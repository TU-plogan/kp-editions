                    states, a most important principle of foreign policy, intimately connected with
                    the general peace and independence of nations, but which some have treated as
                    altogether chimerical, and others represented as having led only to pernicious
                    results. It is more generally admitted, however, to have a real foundation in
                    the rides of intercourse and union among states, and to have exercised a great
                    and beneficial influence on the affairs of modern Europe. We say of modern
                    Europe, because, though the policy in question was not wholly unknown to other
                    ages and countries, it was nowhere <hi rend="italic">systematically</hi> pursued
                    but among the European nations of modern times. Previous to the sixteenth
                    century there was little political connection among those nations, their
                    circumstances not being such as to admit of any regulated attention to foreign
                    affairs; but about the commencement of that century they began to form one grand
                    community or federal league, of which the actuating principle was the
                    preservation of the balance of power. The attention to this principle
                    thenceforth influenced all the great wars and negociations, and made every
                    foreign movement, however remote, an object of interest throughout every part of
                    the European system.</p>
                <p>We shall endeavour to sketch a general outline of this important subject; and, in
                    doing so, we shall notice, though in a brief way, all the principal topics which
                    it seems to present for discussion.</p>
                <p>1. The ultimate intention of the system founded on the balance of power, is to
                    secure every state in the full possession and enjoyment of all its rights, by
                    making its safety and independence objects of interest and guardianship to its
                    neighbours. It endeavours to accomplish this great end by teaching that it is
                    the interest of all states to check the first encroachments of ambition, to
                    watch every movement of foreign powers, and to unite their respective forces in
                    support of the weak against the strong. It is called the balancing system,
                    because its aim is to prevent any state from aggrandizing itself at the expense
                    of its neighbours, and to counterpoise any state that may have become too
                    powerful, by a union of the forces of others.</p>
                <p>The metaphorical terms applied to this system seem to have given rise to some
                    very absurd misconceptions of its true theory and purposes. It has sometimes
                    been supposed that its object was to <hi rend="italic">equalize</hi> the powers
                    of states composing a common system; and as it is plainly impossible either to
                    effect or to maintain such an equality, it has thence been concluded, that the
                    whole system is founded upon a chimera. But, with a view to the objects of this
                    system, the question is, not what amount of power above another any state
                    possesses, provided the power so possessed be fairly acquired, but whether any
                    state possesses its power in such circumstances as to enable it to trespass at
                    pleasure on a weaker neighbour. If there be no other state, or confederacy of
                    states, capable of counteracting any injurious designs which a greater power
                    might undertake, then it is said there is no balance; but if there be such a
                    counterpoise, this is all that the balancing system requires to produce what, in
                    its language, is called an equilibrium. In order to make this point as clear as
                    possible, we beg to refer to the following definitions of the balance of power,
                    as given by Vattel and by Gentz: “By this balance,” says the former, “is to be
                    understood such a disposition of things, as that no one potentate or state shall
                    be able absolutely to predominate and prescribe laws to the others.” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Lau) of Nations,</hi> b. iii. c. iii. § 47.)—“What is usually
                    termed a balance of power,” says M. Gentz, “is that constitution subsisting
                    among neighbouring states, more or less connected with one another, by virtue of
                    which no one among them can injure the independence or essential rights of
                    another, without meeting with effectual resistance on some side, and,
                    consequently, exposing itself to danger.” <hi rend="italic">(Fragments on the
                    Political Balance,</hi> c. i.)</p>
                <p>Thus, then, it is distinctly understood that the balancing system is not grounded
                    upon an <hi rend="italic">equality</hi> among states in respect of power, but
                    upon a union of powers to repress the enterprises of the strong and ambitious,
                    and to counteract the effects of necessary individual inequalities by aggregate
                    strength.</p>
                <p>It is quite indispensable to the existence of such a system, that one state
                    should not be permitted to obtain such a superiority of power as to enable it to
                    overawe all opposition, and make the safety of those around it dependent on its
                    will; and as it is the disposition of all unchecked power to extend itself, the
                    balancing system inculcates it as the interest, as well as the right, of every
                    state to join in opposing the first encroachments of any ambitious potentate or
                    community. It teaches that the danger extends much further than to the party
                    immediately attacked or menaced; that one encroachment will pave the way to
                    another; and that it is therefore wise to meet the danger whilst yet distant,
                    and capable of being combated with less peril or loss. The right of interference
                    to put down a danger of this kind is, in fact, only a modification of the right
                    to resist an immediate attack. All human experience shows, that the state which
                    is suffered to aggrandize itself at the expense of one neighbour, will with <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193193332" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3332-0309"/> its increased
                    means acquire stronger dispositions to encroach still further; and therefore
                    self-defence authorizes ' us to treat as already an invader, any potentate whose
                    conduct entitles us to conclude that he only waits a convenient opportunity to
                    become so in effect. “As long,” says Bacon, “as men are men, and as long as
                    reason is reason, a just fear will be a just cause of a preventive war; but
                    especially if it be part of the case that there be a nation that is manifestly
                    detected to aspire to new acquests, then other states assuredly cannot be justly
                    accused for not paying for the first blow, or for not adopting Polyphemus’s
                    courtesy, to be the last that shall be eaten up.” <hi rend="italic">(Speech
                    concerning a War with Spain.')</hi> It is peculiarly and emphatically the
                    language of the balancing system, <hi rend="italic">Principiis obsta,—</hi> in
                    other words, look well to the safety and independence of your neighbours, even
                    the most remote, if you wish to preserve your own.</p>
                <p>Upon this point it is by no means necessary to enter into any lengthened
                    deductions. The principle of interference to prevent the progress of a dangerous
                    power rests, both as to right and policy, upon the most obvious dictates of
                    experience and prudence. No state ever yet acquired a preponderating power
                    without abusing it; and therefore it is the right and interest of all states to
                    prevent any one from rising to such an ascendency as may endanger the common
                    safety.</p>
                <p>The right in question, however, is that of guarding against injury justly to be
                    apprehended from the conduct of a state which uses improper means of
                    aggrandizement. As far, therefore, as measures of hostility are concerned, there
                    must be actual encroachment in order to warrant them. The balancing system does
                    not say there shall be no alterations in the relative strength of states; for a
                    state may fairly and honourably increase her power by wise legislation, or by
                    the cultivation of her own internal resources. To attempt to impede a state
                    which takes this road to greatness, would be to make war upon those very arts by
                    the successful cultivation of which peace and happiness are spread throughout
                    the world. The aggrandizements to which the balancing system stands opposed, are
                    those attended with immediate violence to some, and which infer further violence
                    to others. All that nations can do when a neighbour becomes formidable in a fair
                    way, is to watch her, and to draw closer those ties of alliance which may enable
                    them to counteract any bad use of her power. When Lord Bacon, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay on Empire,</hi> counsels princes “to keep due sentinel, that
                    none of their neighbours do so overgrow by increase of territory, by <hi
                    rend="italic">embracing of trade,</hi> by approaches or the like, as to become
                    more able to annoy them than they were,” he does not mean that the growth of a
                    state by commerce is to be prevented in the same way as in the case of its
                    extension by a seizure of territory, but, that all great power, however
                    acquired, is in its nature dangerous, and ought to be counterpoised by timely
                    confederation.</p>
                <p>There is another way in which a state may become formidable, and that of a
                    sudden, where the balancing system does not authorize immediate hostile
                    interference. We allude here to the case of a sovereign who acquires a great
                    accession of power by marriage or by inheritance. “It is a sacred principle of
                    the law of nations,” says Vattel, “that such an increase of power cannot, <hi
                    rend="italic">alone and of itself,</hi> give any one a right to take up arms in
                    order to oppose it.” (B. iii. c. 3, sect. 43.) Grotius and Puffendorf maintain
                    the same opinion in terms equally decided. But suppose a sovereign, who has
                    already displayed an encroaching disposition, is about to acquire in this way an
                    accession of power, which would render him more and more formidable to his
                    neighbours; in this case, as Vattel shows, the maxims of the balancing system
                    authorize an immediate interference to procure securities; or, according as the
                    danger is imminent, altogether to prevent the impending aggrandizement. It is
                    perhaps wholly unprecedented, as this writer observes, that a state should
                    receive any remarkable accession of power, without giving other states just
                    grounds to interfere; but if it should be otherwise, the only course to be
                    pursued is that which the balancing system recommends, namely, to keep a
                    watchful eye on all the proceedings of the formidable state, and the formation
                    of a counterpoise by means of alliances.</p>
                <p>These, then, are the grand expedients of the balancing system: vigilant
                    inspection to discover, and prompt union to counteract, in their birth, all such
                    projects of encroachment as powerful states will ever, when opportunity offers,
                    be ready to form. By employing resident agents to procure speedy information,
                    and by the weight of joint warnings and reclamations in every case of
                    apprehended or of real injury, the balancing system furnishes the only peaceful
                    means which human wisdom can devise to control the conduct of independent
                    states; the only means which can be employed to guard against injustice, or
                    obtain redress, without an actual appeal to the sword. It was the <hi
                    rend="italic">habitual</hi> employment of these expedients, with a view to guard
                    against distant dangers, that distinguished the balancing system, as exemplified
                    in modern Europe, from those momentary efforts and loose confederacies in which
                    all nations, and even the rudest tribes, have occasionally united, in order to
                    repel or pull down a powerful and common enemy.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“The grand and distinguishing feature of the
                    balancing system is the perpetual attention to foreign affairs which it
                    inculcates; the constant watchfulness over every nation which it prescribes; the
                    subjection in which it places all national passions and antipathies to the fine
                    and delicate view of remote expediency; the unceasing care which it dictates, of
                    nations most remotely situated, and apparently unconnected with ourselves; the
                    general union Avhich it has effected of all the European powers obeying certain
                    laws, and actuated in general by a common principle; in fine, the right of
                    mutual inspection, universally recognized among civilized states in the rights
                    of public envoys and residents.” (Brougham’s <hi rend="italic">Colonial
                    Policy,</hi> b. iii. sect. 1.)</p></note> Without this habitual attention to
                    foreign affairs, and constant application of the principles of counterpoise,
                    there cannot, indeed, be said to exist any thing like a system of reciprocal
                    guarantee of the independence of nations, such as is involved in the idea of a
                    balance of power.</p>
                <p>What particular alliances each state ought to form, with a view to maintain this
                    balance, is a matter of circumstances, and must accordingly vary with them. The
                    object of the system is always the same,—to preserve such a distribution of
                    power amidst the varying relations of states, as shall most effectually check
                    the spirit of encroachment, and confine every potentate to his own
                    dominions.</p>
                <p>In the preceding observations we have had it in view to give a general idea of
                    the nature, intention, and means of maintaining a balance of power among a
                    number of connected nations of different degrees of power and magnitude. But
                    before proceeding to any remarks on the history and results of this branch of
                    policy, we shall recapitulate, in the words of Μ. Gentz, those fundamental
                    maxims which constitute the necessary conditions of the beneficial existence of
                    such a system as we have described. These are,—</p>
                <p>“That no one state in the common system must ever become so powerful as to be
                    able to coerce all the rest put together ;—</p>
                <p>“That, if the system is not merely to exist, but to be maintained, without
                    constant perils and violent concussions, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193345"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-3345-0310"/>every member which infringes it must be in a
                    condition to be coerced, not only by the collective strength of the other
                    members, but by any majority of them, if not by one individual ;—and,</p>
                <p>“That if ever a state attempts, by unlawful enterprise, to attain, or does in
                    fact attain, to a degree of power, which enables it to defy the danger of a
                    union of several of its neighbours, or even of the whole, such a state should be
                    treated as a common enemy; and if it has acquired that degree of force by an
                    accidental concurrence of circumstances, without any acts of violence, whenever
                    it appears upon the public theatre, no means which political wisdom can devise
                    for the purpose of diminishing its power should be neglected or left untried.”

                <p>2. The knowledge of the ancients in regard to these great principles of national
                    safety, and the period when they came to obtain a decided influence among the
                    moderns, are points of considerable historical interest. Mr Hume has proved, in
                    a very satisfactory manner, that the principle of preserving a balance of power
                    is distinctly to be recognised in many of the great political transactions of
                    the ancient world. The same thing had previously been shown by Kahle, a famous

                    Berlin in 1744. The anxiety of the Greeks with regard to the principle of
                    equilibrium among states was particularly manifested in that famous league
                    against the rising power of Athens which produced the Peloponnesian war. Athens
                    herself showed that she both knew and practised this policy, by constantly
                    throwing her power into the lighter scale, when Thebes and Sparta came to
                    contend for the mastery of Greece. Mr Hume also traces the influence of this
                    salutary principle in the contests which arose among the successors of
                    Alexander; their attention to it having “preserved distinct, for several ages,
                    the partitions made after the death of that conqueror.” <hi rend="italic"

                    clear and extensive views in this branch of policy. In that for the
                    Megalopolitans, in particular, “we may see,” according to Mr Hume, “the utmost
                    refinements in the balance of power that ever entered into the head of a
                    Venetian or English speculatist ;” and by a later writer this speech is also
                    pointed out as “containing discussions of some of the most delicate parts of the
                    theory.” (Brougham’s <hi rend="italic">Colonial Policy,</hi> b. iii. sect. 1.)
                    All who peruse this remarkable oration with due attention must indeed perceive
                    that it fully bears out this character. Its reasonings may be analyzed into
                    these leading doctrines of the balancing system: that it is the interest of
                    every state to prevent the formation of a predominating power; that to this end
                    the first encroachments ought to be promptly checked; and that it is necessary
                    to join even a rival against a former friend, when that friend would otherwise
                    infringe upon the balance.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>There is a passage of Polybius, vyhich has been frequently quoted as
                    pointing out the leading aim of the balancing system in terms the most explicit.
                    ſhe historian, after mentioning that Hiero, king of Syracuse, acted wisely in
                    assisting the Carthaginian in the war of the auxiliaries, adds, “Nunquam enim
                    ejusmodi principia contemnere oportet, neque tanta cuiquam astruenda es
                    potentia, ut cum eo postea de tuo quamvis manifesto jure disceptare ex aequo non
                    queas.” (Lib. i. cap. 83.)</p></note></p>
                <p>It seems, in short, to be no longer a question, that it was only with the <hi
                    rend="italic">phrase,</hi> and not the <hi rend="italic">idea,</hi> of a balance
                    of power, that the ancients were unacquainted. But we cannot agree with Mr Hume
                    when he goes so far as to say that this principle, though it has been more
                    generally known and acknowledged in modern times, has not had an authority much
                    more extensive in practice, than it had among the nations of antiquity. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Essays,</hi> vol. i.) This opinion stands clearly refuted by all
                    the great facts, and by the whole tenor of modern history, from the com√
                    mencement of the sixteenth century. It was the more constant operation of the
                    principle in question which gradually formed the nations of Europe into one
                    great republic or federal league, whose common bond of union was the guarantee
                    which it afforded of their respective independence. But neither, on the other
                    hand, can we agree with Mr Brougham, when he affirms that the. ancient states
                    displayed nothing beyond a mere speculative knowledge in this department. <hi
                    rend="italic">( Colonial Policy,</hi> b. iii. § 1.) It may be very true that
                    those more enlarged ideas of foreign policy which Demosthenes disclosed in some
                    of his orations were not generally understood or acted upon by his
                    contemporaries; but it is nevertheless perfectly clear, from Mr Hume’s
                    statements, the accuracy of which has never been called in question, that among
                    the Grecian states the maxim of preserving a balance of power, though it had not
                    produced any course of policy so regular and authoritative as the modern
                    international system, was yet, on many occasions, the sole moving spring of
                    their wars and alliances.</p>
                <p>This maxim, indeed, lies so much within the sphere of common sense, that it can
                    scarcely fail to be attended to, wherever there is a collection of states
                    capable of observing and attacking each other. But circumstances may be more or
                    less favourable to the growth of a consistent policy in this respect. In modern
                    Europe, a number of considerable states were formed under such circumstances as
                    tended peculiarly to promote a regular intercourse among them, and consequently
                    to develope and systematize this great principle of national security. But it
                    did not begin to manifest itself until, in the gradual and similar progress of
                    European society, the power of the sovereigns of these states was so far
                    consolidated as to enable them to give part of their attention to foreign
                    affairs, and to maintain armies beyond their own frontiers. It was in Italy,
                    where civilization was more advanced, and where there existed a number of small
                    states and commonwealths whose safety required that their rulers should
                    reciprocally keep watch on each other, that the modern system of interference
                    took its beginnings. From an early period of the fifteenth century, we see the
                    balance of power as constant an object of concern among these states as, in the
                    next, it came to be throughout Europe. “Their jealousy of each other,” says
                    Guicciardini, “made them watchful of every motion or measure which they
                    conceived might any way increase the power of their neighbours;” and he presents
                    a splendid picture of the beneficial effects, the long peace, and general
                    independence, attendant upon this habitual attention to the balancing principle.
                    <hi rend="italic">(History of Italy,</hi> b. i.)</p>
                <p>It was about the end of the same century that these ideas began to extend to
                    other quarters, and to actuate the movements of greater potentates. There were
                    now several princes possessed of large kingdoms, with powers and prerogatives
                    which enabled them to take part in distant wars and negociations. The first
                    great movement of an ambitious neighbour would naturally, therefore, excite
                    their jealousy, and bring them into concert. Thus, when Charles VIII. of France,
                    in 1494, invaded Italy and laid claim to Naples, the sovereigns of Germany and
                    Spain saw the expediency of listening to the Italian princes, who suggested a
                    confederacy to prevent France from gaining an accession of power which could not
                    but render her a dangerous neighbour. Dr Robertson regards <pb break="no"

                    the first great exertion of those new powers with which the progress of society
                    had invested the princes of Europe; and views the confederacy formed against
                    him, as the first considerable extension of those ideas of a balance of power
                    whose influence had hitherto been limited to the narrow sphere of Italian
                    politics. “From this era,” he says, “we can trace the progress of that
                    intercourse between nations which has finked the powers of Europe so closely
                    together, and can discern the operations of that provident policy which, during
                    peace, guards against remote and contingent dangers, and in war has prevented
                    rapid and destructive conquests.” (<hi rend="italic">View of the Progress of
                    Society in Europe,</hi> § 2.) If we look only a little later, we shall
                    everywhere see a constant jealousy of the increase of power, and a vigilant
                    attention to all foreign operations, combined with the application of those
                    means of safety which peculiarly distinguish the balancing system. “During that
                    triumvirate of kings,” says Lord Bacon, in his usual expressive language, “Henry
                    VIII. of England, Francis I. of France, and Charles V., Emperor, there was such
                    a watch kept, that none of the three could win a palm of ground, but the other
                    two would straightways balance it, either by confederation, or, if need were, by
                    a war; and would not, in any wise, take up peace at interest.” <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Essays on Empire.}</hi></p>
                <p>It has been objected to Dr Robertson that he has represented “the principle of
                    the balance of power as a <hi rend="italic">discovery</hi> made by the Italian
                    politicians in <hi rend="italic">consequence</hi> of this invasion of Charles;
                    whereas it was not to any such single event that the balancing system owed
                    either its origin or refinement, but to the progress of society, which placed
                    the whole states of Europe in the same relative situation in which the states of
                    Italy were at that period, and taught them not to wait for an actual invasion,
                    but to see a Charles at all times in every prince or commonwealth that should
                    manifest the least desire of change.” (Brougham’s <hi rend="italic">Colonial
                    Policy,</hi> b. iii. § 1.) What is here said as to the origin of the balancing
                    system is no doubt true. We have already stated that the principle on which it
                    rests is a principle of our common nature, which cannot fail to manifest itself
                    in certain situations; but that nations must have arrived at an advanced stage
                    of civilization and intercourse before it can be acted upon with consistency and
                    concert. It would therefore be absurd to represent that system as taking its
                    rise in any single event, or its principle as a discovery of some long-sighted
                    statesman. But Dr Robertson knew human nature too well to seek the origin of
                    this principle in an accidental occurrence; and he knew history too well to fix
                    its origin “as a consequence” of Charles’s invasion. On the contrary, throughout
                    the whole of his masterly chapter on the progress of the nations of Europe, with
                    respect to the command of the national force requisite in foreign operations, he
                    speaks of this system as holding progress with the growing improvement and
                    intercourse of these nations; and, so far from representing the principle of the
                    balance of power as a discovery consequent upon the event alluded to, he
                    expressly speaks of the league against the French monarch as only exemplifying
                    an extension of those ideas which had long been familiar to the Italian
                    statesmen “in regulating the operations of the petty states in their own
                    country.” <hi rend="italic">( View of the Progress of Society,</hi> § 2.)</p>
                <p>Before concluding these very general remarks on the rise of the balancing system
                    in modern times, we shall briefly advert to a conjecture of M. Villers upon this
                    subject, which occurs in his able work on the Reformation. Long before the
                    states of Europe became united in a general system, Italy and Germany, he
                    observes, had formed partial sys* <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> ms, with a view
                    to restrain the members within them, each by the other, and thus maintain a
                    balance of power. It is possible, he adds, that the idea of the <hi
                    rend="italic">general</hi> balance of Europe may have been copied from these
                    partial confederacies. <hi rend="italic">{Essai sur ι Esprit et l’Iu. fluence de
                    la Reformation,</hi> 2de partie.) This conjecture, if we rightly understand the
                    learned author, appears to us exceedingly unphilosophical. The states of Europe
                    embraced the idea of a balance of power in proportion as their circumstances
                    enabled them to act upon it, and not in consequence of any estimate of its
                    effects, as displayed on those earlier and narrower stages of its agency.</p>
                <p>3. It appears, then, to have been about the beginning of the sixteenth century
                    that the principle of maintaining a balance of power came to be generally
                    recognised and acted upon by the states of Europe; “at first,” as Μ. Gentz says,
                    “more in a practical way, and, as it were, from political instinct, but
                    afterwards with clear, reflecting, and methodical constancy.” <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Fragments.}</hi> What the advantages were which Europe reaped from this course
                    of policy we shall endeavour to show, after we have adverted to certain
                    arguments generally employed by those who wish to give an unfavourable view of
                    the balancing system.</p>
                <p>By some this system is represented as productive only of wars; as but a
                    convenient pretext to cover projects of ambition, or to screen the restless
                    movements of national jealousy. Others talk of it as being merely a brilliant
                    conception, and appeal to the many violences and usurpations which modern
                    history records, as proofs, if not of its nonentity, at least of its inefficacy.
                    But there is surely no great respect due to that sort of estimate of the system
                    which is founded solely on the abuses to which it is liable, or upon
                    imperfections from which no human institution is free. They who decry or who
                    ridicule the balancing system should be prepared to show, not that it has
                    sometimes afforded plausible pretexts for unnecessary-wars, or has sometimes
                    failed to protect the weak against the outrages of the strong, but that it is
                    wholly useless to interest ourselves in the safety of neighbouring nations; to
                    take any trouble to avert dangers which are yet distant; or to seek to
                    strengthen ourselves against a powerful enemy with any strength not our own.
                    This view of things, were it to prevail, would, as Μ. Gentz observes, open the
                    most desirable prospects to every sovereign whose power and ambition might
                    prompt him to aspire to universal domination.</p>
                <p>It must, we think, appear obvious to every one who reflects upon the subject,
                    that the balancing system is, upon the whole, favourable to peace. The wars
                    which peculiarly belong to it are in the nature of a sacrifice of a smaller
                    present, to secure a greater future good; and the tendency of the system is to
                    render these wars -less and less frequent. The evil passions which give rise to
                    ambitious attacks, like all other evil passions, will be more apt to be indulged
                    the less exposed they are to opposition or restraint. And it cannot be
                    questioned that, in proportion as the maxims of this system are vigilantly and
                    steadily pursued, there will be less inducement, because less prospect of
                    success, for ambitious undertakings.</p>
                <p>Its object is to alarm, and to arm all against the prince whose power prompts him
                    to transgress upon others; and the prince who knows that all his motions are
                    keenly watched, and that his first successes would only expose him to a more
                    extended contest, must see how hopeless would be any attempt to possess himself
                    of the territories even of the weakest of his neighbours. Such is the general
                    tendency of the system; and however it may have occasionally failed to prevent
                    outrages, it cannot be doubted that it has proved a formidable barrier against
                    conquest, and a rampart of defence to the weaker states.</p>

                    that could have been pronounced upon the salutary influence of the modern
                    system. The advocates of that system can, indeed, appeal to history for the most
                    satisfactory of all proofs of its efficacy, in the remarkable fact, that, for a
                    period of nearly three centuries, no European state, however small, has lost its
                    independence from external violence. When we recollect the number of small
                    states which, during so long a period, enjoyed an independent existence in the
                    immediate neighbourhood of powerful nations, and reflect for a moment on those
                    evil passions which have, in all ages, prompted the strong to prey on the weak;
                    we must admit that, but for that salutary jealousy of power, and united
                    resistance to its encroachments, which it was the object and office of this
                    system to nourish and enforce, these otherwise helpless states would have been
                    speedily absorbed, or their independence annihilated, by the mighty masses with
                    which they were in contact. It was not the preservation of such countries as
                    Portugal or Holland, of Sweden or Denmark, which, though small compared with
                    many others in the system, were yet possessed of considerable means of
                    self-defence; —it was not the preservation of such states as these merely, but
                    of a multitude of feeble communities in Germany, in Switzerland, and Italy,
                    which affords the proudest proof of the salutary influence of the balancing
                    system on the fortunes of modern Europe. “Consider, for instance,” to use the

                    the brilliant success with which she applied to industry and literature, while
                    Lewis XIV. was pouring his myriads into Italy before her gates; call to mind
                    that happy period when we scarcely dreamt more of the subjugation of the
                    feeblest republic of Europe, than of the conquest of her mightiest empire; and
                    say whether any spectacle can be imagined more beautiful to the moral eye, or
                    which affords a more striking proof of progress in the noblest principles of
                    true civilization.” . (Mackintosh’s <hi rend="italic">Speech on the Trial of

                    type="authorial"><p>We shall here add a striking passage in reference to our
                    subject from this celebrated oration. “These small states were, in many
                    respects, one of the most interesting parts of the ancient system of Europe.
                    Unfortunately for the repose of mankind, great states are compelled, by regard
                    to their own safety, to consider the military spirit and martial habits of their
                    people as one of the main objects of their policy, řrequent hostilities seem
                    almost the necessary condition of their greatness; and, without being great,
                    they cannot long remain safe. Smaller states, exempted from this cruel
                    necessity—a hard condition of greatness, a bitter satire on human nature—devoted
                    themselves to the arts of peace, to the cultivation of literature, and the
                    improvement of reason. They became places of refuge for free and fearless
                    discussion; they were the impartial spectators and judges of the various
                    contests of ambition which from time to time disturbed the quiet of the world.
                    They thus became peculiarly qualified to be the organs of that public opinion
                    which converted Europe into a great republic, with laws which mitigated, though
                    they could not extinguish, ambition; and with moral tribunals to which even the
                    most despotic sovereigns were amenable. If wars of aggrandizement were
                    undertaken, their authors were arraigned in the face of Europe. Iŕ acts of
                    internal tyranny were perpetrated, they resounded from a thousand presses
                    throughout all civilized countries. Princes on whose will there were no legal
                    checks thus found a moral restraint which the most powerful of them could not
                    brave with absolute impunity. They acted before a vast audience, to whose
                    applause they could not be utterly indifferent. The very constitution of human
                    nature, the unalterable laws of the mind of man, against which all rebellion is
                    ruιtless, subjected the proudest tyrants to this control. No elevation of
                    power,—no depravity, however consummate, no innocence, however spotless,—can
                    render man wholly independent of the praise or blame of his
                    fellow-men.”</p></note></p>
                <p>Such were the results of the system founded on the balance of power. It was a
                    bridle upon the strong and a bulwark to the weak. When it failed to prevent the
                    in roads of violence and injustice, it yet acted as a restorative principle, and
                    replaced injured nations in their former state of independence. It was at the
                    memorable and fatal era of the partition of Poland in 1772 that it first lost
                    this character; that the first example was set of a deliberate, successful,
                    unchecked conspiracy against the independent existence of an unoffending
                    country. It is here proper to mention, that some authors have spoken of this
                    infamous transaction in terms which seem to imply that it was quite in
                    consonance with the principles of the balancing system.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See, for example, the terms in which Count
                    Hertzberg speaks of the partition, in his essay, <hi rend="italic">Sur la
                    Balance du Commerce et celle du l’ouvmr. (Oeuvres,</hi> tome ι.) The language of
                    Μ. Gentz upon this subject, in his able work, <hi rend="italic">Ή Etat de
                    l’Europe avant et après la Révolution Françoise,</hi> is extremely
                    exceptionable; but in his later work, referred to in this article, he condemns
                    the partition as wholly inconsistent with, and as having in fact led to the
                    subversion of, the balancing system.</p></note> It is indeed true, that the
                    maxims of that system were still so far operative as to effect a relative
                    equality in the division of the spoil. But as the whole intention of this system
                    is to maintain the integrity and independence of nations against unlawful
                    attacks, the partition was just as diametrically opposite to its principle, as
                    if the whole spoil had been appropriated by one robber, instead of being shared
                    by three. The equality of the division did not take away from the danger of the
                    example; the example of states combining, not to uphold, but to destroy,—not to
                    enforce respect to the great principles of national safety, but to set them at
                    defiance; an example too soon followed by similar violences, and which, in fact,
                    paved the way for that total overthrow of the ancient system of Europe which ere
                    long took place.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">origin</hi> of a project so pernicious in its consequences
                    is a matter of some interest in the history of the balancing system. We learn
                    from Rulhière’s <hi rend="italic">Histoire de l’Anarchie de Pologne,</hi>
                    published in 1807, that the distractions of this country had suggested the
                    project of a partition as early as 1658; that a Swedish minister, named
                    Stippen-bach, proposed it to his own court, to Austria, and the grand duke of
                    Prussia, whose armies were then in possession of the country; and that it would,
                    in all probability, have been acted upon but for the discovery of the scheme by
                    France, and the consequent interference of that power.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“J’ai retrouvé,” says Μ. Rulhière, “dans les
                    archives des affaires étrangères de France, cette anecdote importante, et

                    carried into execution in 1772, each party concerned was desirous to shift the
                    blame of the first proposal on the others; but it was generally believed to have
                    originated with Frederick, though some were of opinion that he was indebted for
                    the idea to his brother, Prince Henry. Frederick, however, in one of his
                    posthumous pieces <hi rend="italic">(^Mémoires de</hi> 1763 <hi rend="italic"
                    >jusqiia</hi> 1775), states that the scheme was devised by the empress
                    Catharine; and this is corroborated by M. Rulhière, who asserts that she
                    communicated it to Prince Henry during his visit to St Petersburg in 1770; a
                    piece of information, he adds, which was detailed to him in the most
                    circumstantial manner, by three different secretaries, who <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193193384" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3384-0313"/>accompanied the prince to the
                    Russian court. (Tome iv. n. 151-210.) It seems to be generally acknowledged,
                    that the proposal, when first made to the cabinet of Vienna, was opposed by that
                    power; and that her accession would not have been obtained but for the
                    astonishing apathy displayed by France, and, indeed, by all the other states of
                    Europe. The silence of England during the aerpetration of this shameless plot
                    against the independence of nations, if it can be accounted for, can never, at
                    any rate, be excused; inasmuch as the fact appears pretty well established,
                    that, had she, as the guardian of the political balance, raised her voice
                    against the partition, Europe might have been saved from the fatal effects of
                    that new system of robbery and oppression which the spoilers of Poland w ere
                    suffered, without any sort of interruption, to exemplify. “To my certain
                    knowledge,” says Mr Burke, “if Great Britain had at that time been willing to
                    concur in preventing the execution of a project so dangerous in the example,
                    even exhausted as France then was by the preceding war, and under a lazy and
                    unenterprizing prince, she would have at every risk taken an active part in this
                    business.” <hi rend="italic">(Thoughts on French Affairs in</hi> 1791.) ’ 4. We
                    have still to allude to the question, whether Britain, protected as she is on
                    all sides by nature, ought to consider it as a necessary part of her policy to
                    attend to the European balance of power? This has been considered as
                    constituting a separate question, by some who make no doubt that the other
                    states of Europe could not long preserve their independence secure by any other
                    course. Taking the question generally, we do not think there is any great
                    difficulty in regard to it. With the multitude, to be sure, it always will be
                    popular to argue, that Britain stands in need of no other defence than what the
                    seas and her invincible navy afford her, and that all continental connections
                    are useless or pernicious. But the argument from the advantages of our insular
                    situation would not in fact bear out this conclusion, even were the seas and the
                    navy a stronger defence than it is possible they can always be. Our commerce and
                    our colonies, the supports of that navy, render it indispensably necessary that
                    we should more particularly observe some nations, and ally ourselves with
                    others. Those great concerns make it, indeed, nothing less than absurd to talk
                    of our being <hi rend="italic">insulated</hi> as an empire or state, because
                    Britain is an island. And, with regard to invasion, it is clear that we could
                    not always be as secure and as free from uneasy apprehensions, in a state of
                    total insulation from foreign connections, as with friends and confederates to
                    employ or oppose a formidable enemy on his own confines.</p>
                <p>But supposing the balance of power to constitute a great national object, the
                    line of conduct which that object imposes upon us may, no doubt, be affected by
                    our insular situation. We may on some occasions allow other nations who are more
                    exposed to danger, and who ought, on that account, to be more on the alert to
                    prevent encroachments, to take the first measures, and bear the first expense of
                    resistance. We may watch and warn, and use the influence of our remonstrances
                    and our counsels, without having recourse, except in urgent cases, to the
                    extremity of arms.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>"Other nations must watch over every motion of their neighbours; penetrate,
                    if they can, every design; foresee every minute event; and take part, by some
                    engagement or other, in almost every conjecture that arises. But as we cannot be
                    easily nor suddenly attacked, it may be our interest to watch the secret
                    workings of the several councils abroad; to advise and warn; to abet and oppose;
                    but it never can be our true interest easily and officiously to enter into
                    action, much less into engagements that imply action and expense.”

                    there seems any fair room for difference of opinion among British statesmen. In
                    point of fact, all our later statesmen, however differing in other respects,
                    have distinctly assented to the <hi rend="italic">general</hi> doctrine, that
                    the balance of power was an interest of the highest importance to England. The
                    last time, we believe, that this question can be said to have been fairly
                    brought into debate, and fully discussed in Parliament, was on occasion of the
                    famous armament against Russia for refusing to restore Oczakov to the Porte; and
                    on that occasion, though Mr Fox and his followers reprobated the armament in the
                    strongest terms, they did so, not because they denied the great principle to
                    which the minister appealed, as the sole justification of the measuré, that the
                    balance of power was a British concern, and gave Britain an undoubted interest
                    to mingle in the affairs of the continent,—not because they thought that Britain
                    ought never to guard against any distant danger,—but because there was no such
                    degree of danger from the retention of that city and its district, as called
                    upon this country to interfere at the risk of a war.<note anchored="true"

                    and forcibly declared his adherence to the general doctrine; affirming, that
                    though the epithets <hi rend="italic">wild</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    power; and that this country ought to interfere whenever that balance appeared
                    to be really in danger. Of all those who joined in this opposition, Mr Burke was
                    the only statesman who did so upon a ground, as it appears to us, equally
