                <p><label type="entry">BASEDOW, <hi rend="smallcaps">John Bernard</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated German writer, born at Hamburg, the 11th September 1723, was the son
                    of a hair-dresser. Ill treatment made him abandon his father’s house. A
                    physician in a neighbouring village took him into his service, and shortly after
                    persuaded him to return home to his father. Being placed in one of the lower
                    classes of the college of St John, the severity of his masters rendered him
                    harsh and violent himself. Forced to submit to a slow and rigorous method of
                    study, he contracted a dislike to patience and regularity, which exercised a
                    marked influence over the whole course of his life. Boor but intelligent, he
                    often performed their tasks for his school-fellows who could afford to pay for
                    it; and they, in return, invited him to their parties of pleasure, which
                    contributed to those habits of irregularity by which ms health and reputation
                    often suffered. In 1744 Basedow went to Leipsic to study theology. He gave
                    himself <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> P entirely to the instructions of the
                    professor, Crusius, and the study of philosophy. This at first made him
                    sceptical in theology; a more profound examination of the sacred writings, and
                    of all that relates to them, brought ım back to the Christian faith; but, in his
                    retirement, he ιoir∏ed his belief after his own ideas, and it was far from
                    orthodox. Having returned to Hamburg, he 1 ved there without any employment till
                    1749, when M. de Quaalen, privy-counsellor of Holstein, appointed him preceptor
                    to ħis son. Basedow now began to apply himself to the subject of education. At
                    first he would not teach his pupil Latin otherwise than by talking with him in
                    Latin; and he wrote a dissertation on this subject, published at Kiel in 1751,
                    <hi rend="italic">Inusitata et optima honestioris Juventutis erudienda
                    Methodo.</hi> In 1753 he was chosen professor of moral philosophy and belles
                    lettres in the academy of Soroë in Denmark. Here he published in 1758 his <hi
                    rend="italic">Practical Philosophy for all Conditions,</hi> in two volumes
                    (Copenhagen and Leipsic, second edition, in 1777), which contained many good
                    observations on education in general, and on that of girls in particular; but he
                    advanced in it opinions by no means consistent with Lutheran orthodoxy, so that
                    the Count Danneskiold, superintendent of the academy, took his place from him,
                    and removed him to the school of exercises at Altona. Basedow still continued to
                    devote himself to theological studies. In 1764 he published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Philalethes, or New Considerations on the Truth of Religion and
                    Reason, within the Limits of Revelation,</hi> two volumes in 8vo. The
                    magistrates of Altona forbade the reading of this work. He was not allowed any
                    longer permission to print his writings at Hamburg or Lubeck; the communion was
                    prohibited to him and all his family, and the common people were on the point of
                    stoning him. Basedow, however, was convinced of the truth of his opinions, and
                    displayed prodigious activity in defending them. He wrote his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Methodical Instruction in Religion, and the Morality of Reason,</hi> Altona,
                    1764; his <hi rend="italic">Theoretical System, of Sound Reason,</hi> 1765; his
                    <hi rend="italic">Essay on Free Dogmatism,</hi> Berlin, 1766; his <hi
                    rend="italic">Extracts from the Old and New Testament,</hi> and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay in Favour of the Truth of Christianity,</hi> in the same
                    year. The last of these works he particularly valued himself upon, because he
                    there founds the evidence of Christianity chiefly on its moral purity. In these
                    and other works, however, he maintained several heterodox opinions, as the
                    non-eternity of future punishments; the inequality of the three persons of the
                    Trinity; the insufficiency of the atonement for our sins by the death of Jesus
                    Christ, &amp;c. Constantly persecuted in his theological career, he would have
                    fallen the victim of his incautious zeal, if the count de Bernstoff, minister of
                    state, and J. A. Cramer, another officer of the court of Copenhagen, had not
                    taken him under their protection. He left off giving lessons without losing his
                    salary; and, towards the end of 1767, he abandoned theology to devote himself
                    with the same ardour to education, of which he conceived the project of a
                    general reform in Germany. He began by publishing <hi rend="italic">An Address
                    to the Friends of Humanity, and to Persons in Power, on Schools, on Education,
                    and its Influence on Public Happiness, with the Plan of an Elementary Treatise
                    on Human Knowledge.</hi> Hamburg, 1768. He proposed the reform of schools, of
                    the common methods of instruction, the establishment of an institute for
                    qualifying teachers, and solicited subscriptions for the printing of his
                    elementary work, where his principles were to be explained at length, and
                    accompanied with plates. For this object he required 5050 crowns. The
                    subscriptions presently amounted to 15,000 crowns: the empress of Russia,
                    Catherine IL, sent a thousand crowns, the king of Denmark nine hundred. In 1770
                    appeared at Altona the first volume of his <hi rend="italic">Method for Fathers
                    and Mothers of Families, and for the Chiefs of the People;</hi> and, six months
                    after, the first three parts of his <hi rend="italic">Elementary Treatise,</hi>
                    in 8vo, with 54 plates. This work, which was praised in all the journals, was
                    translated into French by Huber, and into Latin by Mangelsdorf; but Schlozer, in
                    the German translation of the <hi rend="italic">Essay on National Education</hi>
                    by Μ. de la Chalotais, accused Basedow <pb break="no" facs="nls:193194827"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-4827-0424"/>of having omitted in his plan various Dranches of
                    science, and of having had in view only a pecuniary speculation. Basedow, in
                    despair, offered to return the price of his book to those who were not satisfied
                    with it. Only one man, a Swiss, demanded his subscription. Encouraged by the
                    success of the <hi rend="italic">Treatise,</hi> our author continued to write
                    other works on the same subject and on the same principles; among others, his
                    <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Arithmetic,</hi> 1773, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elements of pure Mathematics,</hi> 1772. His <hi rend="italic">Agathocrator, or
                    the Education of Teachers to come,</hi> 1771, procured him a medal from the
                    emperor Joseph II.; and the visits which he made to Brunswick, to Leipsic,
                    Dessau, Berlin, and Halle, to inquire into the state of public instruction,
                    having enabled him to enlarge and correct his ideas, and convinced him that his
                    elementary work contained many erroneous and hasty assertions, he published a
                    new and improved edition of this work in 1774. The same year he published his
                    <hi rend="italic">Legacy for Consciences, or Manual of Natural and Revealed
                    Religion;</hi> a work which he composed in order to make known the real state of
                    his religious opinions, and to clear himself from the imputation of wishing to
                    found a new sect. In his travels he had been well received by the prince of
                    Anhalt-Dessau, who promised him his protection. From that time he had resolved
                    to establish an institute for education at Dessau, and to apply his principles
                    himself in forming disciples, who might spread them over all Germany. Little
                    calculated by nature or habit to succeed in an employment which requires the
                    greatest regularity, patience, and attention, he, however, engaged in this new
                    project with all his accustomed ardour. The name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philanthropinon</hi> appeared to him the most expressive of his views; and he
                    published at Leipsic in 1774 a pamphlet, entitled <hi rend="italic">The
                    Philanthropinon founded at Dessau,</hi> containing the details of his plan. He
                    immediately set about carrying it into execution; but he had few scholars, and
                    the success by no means answered his hopes. The institution, badly managed,
                    became a theatre of quarrels between Basedow and the masters who taught in it
                    under his direction. The assistance of the celebrated Campe, a journal which
                    they both composed together, under the title of <hi rend="italic">School
                    Dialogues,</hi> from 1777 to 1779, and a public examination which went off with
                    eclat, gave a transient splendour to the <hi rend="italic">Philanthropinon;</hi>
                    but in a short time Basedow quarrelled with Campe, made complaints against his
                    prince, quitted and returned to the care of the institution, and exemplifying in
                    his conduct the effects of coarse manners and bad temper, was at length drawn
                    into the most scandalous scenes in his disputes with Professor Wolke, his former
                    coadjutor. This institution was finally shut up in 1793. Basedow for some time
                    had given up all thoughts of education; he returned to his old theological
                    inquiries, and residing sometimes at Magdeburg, sometimes at Halle, sometimes at
                    Leipsic, he took part in the famous controversy excited in Germany by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fragments of Wolfenbutel,</hi> an anonymous posthumous work of
                    Reimarus, published by Lessing. Doctor Semler having written a pretended
                    refutation of the <hi rend="italic">Fragments,</hi> Basedow, without difficulty,
                    exposed the ill intentions of the author, who secretly attacked the cause he
                    affected to defend; and, with his usual vehemence and franκness, called upon
                    Semler to declare himself openly, offering to indemnify him with his fortune if
                    this public declaration should prove prejudicial to him. Semler made no reply,
                    and Basedow wrote on. He published his work entitled <hi rend="italic">Jesus
                    Christ, the Christian World, and the small Number of the Elect,</hi> in 1784;
                    and the year following, returning to the study which had divided his time and
                    his powers with theology, he gave the public his <hi rend="italic">Neιν Method
                    of Learning to Read,</hi> which he employed with success in two schools of
                    little girls at Magdeburg; and in this occupation he passed four hours every day
                    for some time previous to his death, which took place in that city, on the 25th
                    July 1790. He died with Christian firmness and resignation, and desired that his
                    body might be opened wishing, to use his own words, to be still useful to his
                    fellow-citizens after his death. In 1797 a monument of marble was erected on the
                    spot where he was buried.</p>
                <p>To manners unpolished and abrupt he joined gross habits; he was fond of wine, of
                    which he drank to excess ∙ in short, with a character in itself unamiable, he
                    seemed by his conduct sometimes to take pains to render his services of no use,
                    and his virtues of no account. Nothing can give a better idea of him than what
                    he says of himself: “The sagacious reader will discover by my writina∙s that I
                    have been especially called to serve the cause of truth and humanity, in
                    following a path hitherto unknown. Myopinions have succeeded one another, as has
                    been seen. I have been at different times Lutheran, sceptic, infidel, a friend
                    to natural religion, a convert to Christianity, a Christian with paradoxical
                    sentiments, and more and more heterodox. In me has been seen a thinker tormented
                    within by his own reflections, and a writer tormented from without because he
                    has been at one time hated, at another misunderstood. Bold and enterprising in
                    my actions, I have always seen, with a faultering heart, the dangers which
                    threatened me, and from which Providence has saved me in part. I have made
                    little account of domestic happiness, of friendship, or society. I have suffered
                    the penalty. Occupied in curing others, I have neglected the health of my own
                    mind. Esteem is due to the sincerity of my opinions, rather than to my conduct.
                    I desired ardently to make it perfect, but this would have required more
                    perseverance and more attention than the meditation of abstract truths;
                    accordingly, I have oftener been dissatisfied with myself than with others, with
                    whom, however, for the same reason, I have been rarely satisfied. My heart has
                    had little,enjoyment of the consolations of religion,because every occasion led
                    me into difficult researches, and thus weakened the force of sentiment. I regard
                    myself as a man and a Christian, such as there are but few in the world, and
                    such as it is not desirable that there should be many.” This frankness, without
                    affectation and without pride, mduces us to honour the character of aman who has
                    rendered some services to his country and his age. His work <hi rend="italic">On
                    the Education of Princes destined to</hi> ŵ <hi rend="italic">Throne</hi> has
                    been translated into French by Bourjoing. A list of his writings may be seen in
                    Meusel’s <hi rend="italic">Lexico of German Writers from</hi> 1750 <hi
                    rend="italic">to</hi> 1800, and a further account of his life in
                    Schlichtegròll’s <hi rend="italic">Necrology for</hi> 1790. Goethe tells an
                    anecdote of going a journey in company with him and Lavater, who fell into a
                    violent dispute about the Trinity. Basedow consoled himself with the hope of
                    getting some beer and a pipe of tobacco at an inn which he saw before them on
                    the road. When they came to it Goethe made the coachman drive on, to the great
                    chagrin of Basedow, to whom he excused himself by saying, that the sign of the
                    inn was <hi rend="italic">two triangles,</hi> and as he had such an aversion to
                    one triangle (the scholastic emblem of the Trinity), he was afraid the sight of
                    two might overcome him. This conceit, according to Goethe, pacified our
                    antitrinitarian divine.</p>
                <p>Basedow, in his general writings, endeavoured to appb philosophy to practical
                    purposes, and to give a more popular air to his reasonings than had been usual
                    with Ins countrymen before his time. He held truth to be of littae value without
                    practice, and, indeed, he held its essence to depend chiefly on its utility. He
                    considered external or speculative truth to be a very vague and doubtful thing,
                    and that it is principally the consequences of things to the mind itself, that
                    is, a <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> necessity, which determines <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193194840" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4840-0425"/>it to believe Strongly and
                    consistently on any point, so <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> that that is true
                    to each individual which makes the most lasting impression on his mind, and
                    which he feels to be pecessary to his happiness. Thus he regarded practical good
                    as the test of speculative truth. He gave great weight to the principle of
                    analogy, and founded the doctrine of a Providence on this principle. He
                    considered common sense as one ingredient in philosophical reasoning, and
                    rejected all systems which appeared to him to exclude it; such as idealism, the
                    doctrine of monads, and a preestablished harmony. His favourite adage in his
                    system of education was <hi rend="italic">to follow nature.</hi> He wished the
                    mind to be led to knowledge, virtue, and religion, by gentle means, instead of
                    those of constraint and terror. Indeed, his principles on this subject are very
                    nearly the same as those of Locke and Rousseau; and he seems to have done little
                    else than to give currency in Germany to the same reasonings which those
                    philosophers had taught before him in England and France. He insisted on the
                    disuse of the preposterous and unhealthy dresses used by children and their
                    parents, such as stays, swaddling-clothes, tight bandages round the neck, the
                    knees, &amp;c. He recommended exercise and hardy sports as necessary to the
                    health and activity of the body. He proposed to exercise the judgment by
                    teaching a knowledge of things, and not merely to load the memory with words. He
                    preferred the practical sciences to the speculative, the living to the dead
                    languages, modern to ancient history, things which are more near to those which
                    are more remote. In fine, most of his principles were in themselves sound and
                    good, and have in fact exerted their influence on the actual progress of
                    civilization; they were only erroneous from the excess to which he sometimes
                    appears to have carried them, partly from the natural vehemence of his mind,
                    partly from a natural tendency to paradox on the side of new opinions. Paradox,
                    by exciting attention and enlisting the passions, is perhaps necessary to
                    contend against prejudice; common sense and reason are lost sight of by both
                    parties during the combat; but in the end they prevail, if they have fair play
                    allowed them. Thus, in the present instance, it is now generally admitted that
                    something besides the classics is necessary to a liberal education; nor is it
                    thought requisite to arrive at this conclusion through the antithesis to the
                    vulgar opinion of his day set up by Basedow, viz. that the classics are of no
                    use at all in a rational system of education. <hi rend="smallcaps">(d.
