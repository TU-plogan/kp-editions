                    chain of islands of great extent, stretching from off the northern coast of St
                    Domingo, to that of East Florida, and situated between the 21st and 28th degrees
                    of north latitude, and the 7lst and 81st of west longitude. They have never been
                    regularly surveyed, nor their numbers ascertained with any degree of certainty;
                    but they are estimated at above 500. Of these the principal are, Acklin’s
                    Island, Andros Island, Atwood’s Key, Great Bahama, Berry Island, Biminis, Caico,
                    Castle Island, Crooked Island, Eleuthera, Exumas, French Keys, Hog Island, Hog
                    Key, Harbour Island, Heneagus, Little Island, Long Island, Long Key, Maya-guana,
                    New Providence, Ragged Island, Rose Island, Royal Island, Rum Key, Russell
                    Island, St Salvador, Turk’s Islands, Watling’s Island.</p>
                <p>St Salvador, one of the islands composing this chain, was the first land
                    discovered by Columbus on his memorable voyage. At that period the Bahamas were
                    inhabited by a mild and peaceable race of Indians, who, seduced by the arts of
                    the Spaniards, were afterwards consigned to perpetual bondage in the mines of St
                    Domingo, or sent to act as divers in the pearl fisheries of Cumana. From this
                    period the islands continued devoid of inhabitants until 1629, when New
                    Providence was settled by the English, and held till 1641, at which time the
                    Spaniards expelled them, but made no attempts to settle there themselves. It was
                    again colonized by England in 1666, and again ravaged by the French and
                    Spaniards in 1703; after which it became a rendezvous for pirates till 1718,
                    when these were extirpated, a regular colonial administration established, and
                    the seat of government fixed in this island. In 1781 the Bahamas were
                    surrendered to the Spaniards; but at the conclusion of the war they were once
                    more annexed to the British empire, to which they have ever since belonged. At
                    the close of the American war many of the British royalists sought refuge in
                    these islands, and colonized the principal of them, from which period we may
                    date their gradual though slow cultivation and improvement.</p>
                <p>Many of the Bahamas are situated on the Great Bahama Bank, others upon the Little
                    Bahama Bank, and some <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192994"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-2994-0283"/>out of soundings in the Atlantic Ocean. The
                    greater part of them consist merely of bleak and barren rocks, others are
                    entirely covered with wood; and in general they are very flat, presenting the
                    appearance of sand-banks. In the islands which have been cultivated, the soil is
                    thin, and generally light or sandy, but interspersed with partial spots of rich
                    mould. Though destitute of running streams, they have a number of springs; and
                    by digging wells in the ∙ rocks down to the level of the sea, fresh water is
                    obtained. The productions of the soil comprehend all the varieties of a tropical
                    climate. Provisions, such as Guinea and Indian corn, yams, sweet potatoes,
                    plantains, cassava, &amp;c., and fruits, such as oranges, lemons, limes, pine
                    apples, cocoa nuts, &amp;c. are produced in abundance; and so also are different
                    species of timber and dye-woods, such as mahogany, fustic, lignum vitae, pines,
                    cedars, and the like. There are no sugar plantations, but a little cotton and
                    coffee is raised. Oxen, sheep, horses, poultry, and a great variety of live
                    stock, are reared. The shores and creeks of all the Bahamas abound in turtle and
                    excellent fish of different sorts. There are many varieties of birds; and wild
                    hogs, guanas, &amp;c. are found in the w bods. The climate is in general dry and
                    salubrious, and the hurricanes are not violent.</p>
                <p>New Providence is about twenty-five miles long by nine miles broad, and is
                    situated between long. 77. 10. and 77. 38. W. and lat. 25. 3. and 25. 20. N. It
                    differs littlc in soil and productions from the rest of the Bahamas, except that
                    it is considerably in advance in point of cultivation. Nassau, the capital town,
                    the centre of trade, and the seat of government, is situated on the north coast
                    of the island. The houses are built of a stone found in the island, and are
                    remarkably good; the public buildings in particular, such as the
                    government-house, custom-house, courts of justice, &amp;c. are very handsome.
                    New barracks have been lately erected in a situation not very beautiful it is
                    true, but much more healthful than the former. There are several churches,
                    public schools, and charitable institutions in this town, which are well
                    supported. The three other regular ports of entry are the Turk’s Islands, Great
                    Exuma, and the Caico; but their trade is very trifling, and they arc still far
                    behind New Providence in cultivation and improvement.</p>
                <p>The Bahamas are of more importance to Britain by commanding the Gulf of Florida
                    than from their trade and commerce. The exports consist chiefly of cotton,
                    dyewoods, mahogany, turtle, fruits, and coffee. The salt trade, which was at one
                    time considerable, is now in a great measure abandoned; and the imports consist
                    principally of articles of clothing, provisions, and prepared wood. A great
                    proportion of the inhabitants gain a livelihood by picking up the fragments of
                    wrecks, so frequent in this labyrinth of shoals and rocks, sometimes to the
                    number of 200 vessels annually, and also in giving assistance to those who are
                    in danger, in which precarious trade a vast number of vessels are employed. The
                    population of the Bahamas, according to the returns made to parliament in 1829,
                    consists of—whites, exclusive of white troops, 4152; free blacks and coloured,
                    exclusive of black troops, 2791; slaves, 9297.</p>
