                <p><label type="entry">BARRY, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label>, an eminent
                    painter, was born at Cork, in Ireland, on the 11th October 1741. His father had
                    been a builder, and at one time of his life a coasting trader between the two
                    countries of England and Ireland. To this business of trader was James destined,
                    and he actually made, when a boy, several voyages; but these voyages being
                    forced upon him, he on one occasion ran away from the ship, and on others
                    discovered such an aversion to the life and habits of a sailor, as to induce his
                    father to relinquish all hopes of him in this line, and to suffer him to pursue
                    his inclinations, which led him to drawing and study. V hen on board his
                    father’s vessel, instead of handling sails and ropes, and climbing the mast, he
                    was generally occupied with a piece of black chalk, sketching the coast or
                    drawing figures, as his fancy directed him. When his father found that the idea
                    of making a sailor of him must be given up, he permitted him to acquire as much
                    instruction as the schools of Cork afforded, but long retained his aversion<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193194658" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4658-0411"/> to the chalk
                    drawings, with which the floors and walls of the house were covered; the boy
                    being always engaged in some attempt at large figures, and early catching at the
                    means of representing action, attitude, and passion. It was at a very early
                    period of his life that some bookseller in Ireland, undertaking to reprint a set
                    of fables or emblems, young Barry offered to furnish the drawings, and, as it is
                    believed, helped to etch the engravings, such as they were. At the schools in
                    Cork, to which he was sent, he was distinguished by his parts and industry above
                    his school-fellows; his habits differed from those of ordinary boys, as he
                    seldom mixed in their games or amusements, but at those times stole off to his
                    own room, where he worked at his pencil, or was studying some book that he had
                    borrowed or bought. He would spend whole nights in this manner at his studies,
                    to the alarm of his mother, who dreaded his injuring his health or setting fire
                    to the house, and who often kept up his sister or the servant to watch him. His
                    allowance of money he spent in buying books or candles to read by; he sometimes
                    locked himself up in his room for days, and seldom slept upon his bed, or else
                    made it so hard as to take away the temptation or luxury of ly ing long in it.
                    Perhaps the unsocial and ascetic turn of his temper, which thus early ’
                    manifested itself, might be remarked as the source both of the misfortunes of
                    his life and of the defects of his genius. Common humanity, a sense of pleasure,
                    and a sympathy with the feelings of those around us, are not more necessary to
                    success in life than they probably are to success in the fine arts. Few things
                    can be more fatal to the artist than this sort of indifference to the common
                    pleasures and pursuits of life. If affected, it is bad; if real and
                    constitutional, it is even worse. It stuck to poor Barry to the last. It is not
                    to be understood that, at this period of his life, he led the life of an
                    absolute recluse, for he could and did occasionally join in any feats going on
                    in the neighbourhood, and was not behind other boys in such pastimes and
                    mischief as boys are usually fond of. An adventure which happened to him about
                    this time, and which left a strong impression on his mind, is worth mentioning
                    here. In one of his rambles in the neighbourhood, he entered, one winter’s
                    evening, an old, and, as he thought, an uninhabited house, situate in a narrow
                    by-lane in the city of Cork. The house was without doors or windows; but
                    curiosity impelled him to enter, and, after mounting a rotten staircase, which
                    conducted to empty rooms on different floors, he arrived at the garret, where he
                    could just discern, by the glimmering light of a few embers, two old and
                    emaciated figures, broken by age, disease, and want, sitting beside each other,
                    in the act, as far as their palsied efforts would permit, of tearing each
                    other’s faces; not a word being uttered by either, but with the most horrible
                    grimaces that malice could invent. They took no notice of his entrance, but went
                    on with their deeds of mutual hate, • hich made such an impression on the boy
                    that he ran down stairs, making his own reflections, which he afterwards found
                    verified through life, that man and all animals are malicious and cruel in
                    proportion as they are impotent; and that age and poverty, two of the worst
                    evils m human life, almost always add to the calamities inherent m them by arts
                    of their own creating. In general, his great desire to improve his mind led him
                    to seek the society of educated men, who were not averse to receive mm, seeing
                    his active and inquisitive disposition, and his seriousness of manner, couched
                    under a garb the plainest and coarsest; for he adopted this kind of attire from
                    his childhood, not from affectation, but from an indifference o all dress.
                    Having a retentive memory, he profited by is own reading, and by the
                    conversation of others, who ιrected him also in the choice of books. As his
                    finances were too low to make many purchases, he borrowed books from his
                    friends; and was in the practice of making large extracts from such as he
                    particularly liked, ana. sometimes even of copying out the whole book, of which
                    several specimens were found among his papers, written in a stiff school-boy’s
                    hand. As his industry was excessive, his advances in the acquisition of
                    knowledge were rapid, and he was regarded as a prodigy by his schoolfellows. His
                    mother being a zealous I atholic, the son could not avoid mixing at times in the
                    company of priests resident at Cork, who pointed out to him books of polemical
                    divinity, of which he became a great reader, and for which he retained a strong
                    bias during his lifetime He was said at one time to have been destined for the
                    priesthood, but for this report there is no authority. He, however, always
                    continued a Catholic, and in the decline of life manifested rather a bigoted
                    attachment to the religion of his early choice. For a short interval he had a
                    little wavering in his belief of revealed religion in general; but a
                    conversation with Mr Edmund Burke put an end to this levity. A book which Mr
                    Burke lent him, and which settled his mind on this subject, was Bishop Butler’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Analogy;</hi> and, as a suitable reward, he has placed this
                    prelate in the group of divines in his picture of Elysium.</p>
                <p>About the age of seventeen he first attempted oil paintings, and between that and
                    the age of twenty-two, when he first went to Dublin, he produced several large
                    ones, which decorated his father’s house, and represented subjects not often
                    handled by young men, such as Aeneas escaping with his family from the flames of
                    Troy, Susanna and the Elders, Daniel in the Lion’s Den, &amp;c. At this period
                    he also produced the picture which first drew him into public notice, launched
                    him on an ampler theatre than his native town of Cork afforded, and, above all,
                    gained him the acquaintance and patronage of Mr Burke. This picture was founded
                    on an old tradition of the landing of St Patrick on the sea-coast of Cashel, and
                    of the conversion and baptism of the king of that district by the patron saint
                    of Ireland. The priest, in the act of baptizing his new convert, inadvertently
                    strikes the spear of the crosier in the foot of the monarch. The holy father,
                    absorbed in the duties of his office, does not perceive what he has done; and
                    the king, without interrupting the ceremony, bears the pain with immovable
                    fortitude. Th’s incident, together with the gestures and expressions of the
                    attendants, certainly formed a good subject for an historical picture; and Mr
                    Barry’s manner of treating it was such as to insure him the applause and
                    admiration of the connoisseurs of the metropolis of the sister kingdom, where it
                    was exhibited in 1762 or 1763. Mr Barry took this picture with him to Dublin;
                    and afterwards going to the exhibition room, being delighted with the encomiums
                    it received from the spectators, he could not refrain from making himself known
                    as the painter. His pretensions were treated with great contempt by the company,
                    and Barry burst into tears of anger and vexation. But the incredulity of his
                    hearers was a compliment paid to the real or supposed excellence of his
                    painting. It appears that a Dr Sleigh, a physician of Cork, and a sensible and
                    amiable man, was first instrumental in introducing young Barry to the notice of
                    Mr Burke. During their early acquaintance, having fallen into a dispute on the
                    subject of taste, Barry quoted a passage in support of his opinion from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay on the Sublime and Beautiful,</hi> which had been just then
                    published anonymously, and which Barry, in his youthful admiration of it, had,
                    it seems, transcribed entire. Burke affected to treat this work as a theoretical
                    romance of no authority whatever; which threw Barry into such a rage in its
                    defence, that Mr Burke thought it necessary to appease him by owning himself to
                    be the author<pb break="no" facs="nls:193194671" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4671-0412"/>.
                    The scene ended in Barry’s running to embrace him, and showing him the copy of
                    the work which he had been at the pains to transcribe. He passed his time in
                    Dublin in reading, drawing, and society. While he resided here, an anecdote is
                    preserved of him, which marks the character of the man. He had been enticed by
                    his companions several times to carousings at a tavern, and one night, as he
                    wandered home by himself, a thought struck him of the frivolity and vìciousness
                    of thus misspending his time: the fault, he imagined, lay in his money, and,
                    therefore, without more ado, in order to avoid the morrow’s temptation, he threw
                    the whole of his wealth, which perhaps amounted to no great sum, into the
                    Liffey, and locked himself up at his favourite pursuits. After a residence of
                    seven or eight months in Dublin, an opportunity offered of accompanying some
                    part of Mr Burke’s family to London, which he eagerly embraced. This took place
                    some time in the year 1764, when he was twenty-three years of age, and with one
                    of those advantages which do not always fall to the lot of young artists on
                    their arrival in the British capital, that of being recommended to the
                    acquaintance of the most eminent men in the profession by the persuasive
                    eloquence of a man who, to genius in himself, added the rare and noble quality
                    of encouraging it in others: this was Mr Burke, who lost no time, not merely in
                    making Barry known, but in procuring for him the first of all objects to an
                    inexperienced and destitute young artist, employment. This employment was
                    chiefly that of copying in oil drawings by Mr Stuart, better known by the name
                    of Athenian Stuart; and whether it suited the ambition of Barry or not to be at
                    this kind of labour, yet there can be no doubt that he profited by his
                    connection with such a man as Stuart, and had full leisure to cast his eye
                    about, and to improve by the general aspect of art and artists that occupied the
                    period.</p>
                <p>Mr Burke and his other friends thinking it important that he should be introduced
                    to a w ider and nobler school of art than this country afforded, now came
                    forward with the means necessary to accomplish this object; and in the latter
                    end of 1765 Mr Barry proceeded to the Continent, where he remained till the
                    beginning of 1771, studying his art with an enthusiasm which seemed to augur the
                    highest success, and making observations on the different <hi rend="italic"
                    >chefs d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">oeuvre</hi> of Italy with equal independence
                    of judgment and nicety of discrimination. He was supported during this period by
                    the friendly liberality of the Burke family (Edmund, William, and Richard), who
                    allowed him forty pounds a year for his necessary expenditure, besides
                    occasional remittances for particular purposes. He proceeded first to Paris,
                    then to Rome, where he remained upwards of three years, from thence to Florence
                    and Bologna, and home through Venice. His letters to the Burkes, giving an
                    account of Michael Angelo, Raphael, Titian, and Leonardo da Vinci, show a
                    complete insight into the characteristic merits of their works, and would make
                    us wonder (if the case were at all singular) how he could enter with such force,
                    delicacy, and feeling, into excellencies of which he never transplanted an atom
                    into his own works. He saw, felt, and <hi rend="italic">wrote;</hi> his
                    impressions were profound and refined, but the expression of them must be
                    instantaneous, such as gave the results of them with a stroke of the pen, as
                    they were received by a glance of the eye, and he could not wait for the slow
                    process of the pencil for embodying his conceptions in the necessary details of
                    his own art. It was his desire to make the ideas and language of painting
                    coinsiantaneous, —to express abstract results by abstract mechanical means (a
                    thing impossible),—to stamp the idea in his mind at once upon the canvass,
                    without knowledge of its parts, without labour, without patience, without a
                    moment’s time or thought intervening between what he wished to do and its being
                    done, that was perhaps the principal obstacle to his ever attaining a degree of
                    excellence in his profession at all proportioned either to his ambition or his
                    genius It is probable that, as his hand had not the patience to give the details
                    of objects, his eye, from the same habit of mind, had not the power to analyze
                    them. It is possible, however, to see the results without the same laborious
                    process that is necessary to convey them; for the eye sees faster than the hand
                    can move.</p>
                <p>We suspect Mr Barry did not succeed very well in copying the pictures he so well
                    describes; because heappears to have copied but few, only one of Raphael, as far
                    as we can find, and three from Titian, whom he justly considered as the model of
                    colouring, and as more perfect in that department of the art than either Raphael
                    or Michael Angelo were in theirs, expression and form, the highest excellence in
                    which he conceives to have been possessed only by the ancients. In copying from
                    the antique, however, he manifested the same aversion to labour or to that kind
                    of labour which, by showing us our defects, compels us to make exertions to
                    remedy them. He made all his drawings from the antique, by means of a <hi
                    rend="italic">delineator,</hi> that .s, a mechanical instrument, to save the
                    trouble of acquiring a knowledge both of form and proportion. In this manner,
                    equally gratifying to his indolence and his self-love, he is stated to have made
                    numberless sketches of the antique statues, of all sizes, and in all directions,
                    carefully noting down on his sketch-paper their several measurements and
                    proportions.</p>
                <p>The consequences are before us in his pictures; namely, that all those of his
                    figures which he took from these memorandums are deficient in every thing but
                    form, and that all the others are equally deficient in form and every thing
                    else. If he did not employ his pencil properly, or enough, in copying from the
                    models he saw, he employed his thoughts and his pen about them with
                    indefatigable zeal and spirit. He talked well about them; he wrote well about
                    them; he made researches into all the collateral branches of art and knowledge,
                    sculpture, architecture, cameos, seals, and intaglios. There is a long letter of
                    his addressed to Mr Burke, on the origin of the Gothic style of architecture,
                    written, as it should seem, to convince his friend and patron of his industry in
                    neglecting his proper business. Soon after his arrival at Rome, he became
                    embroiled with the whole tribe of connoisseurs, painters, and patrons there,
                    whether native or foreign, on subjects of <hi rend="italic">virtu;</hi> and he
                    continued in this state of hostility with those around him while he staid there,
                    and, indeed, to the end of his life. One might be tempted to suppose that Barry
                    chiefly studied his art as a subject to employ his dialectics upon. On this
                    unfortunate disposition of his to wrangling and controversy, as it was likely to
                    affect his progress in his art and his progress in life, he received some most
                    judicious advice from Sir Joshua Reynolds and Mr Burke, his answers to which
                    show an admirable selfignorance. On his irritable denunciations of the practices
                    and tricks of the Italian picture-dealers, Mr Burke makes a reflection well
                    deserving of attention. “In particular, you may be assured that the traffic in
                    antiquity, and all the enthusiasm, folly, and fraud, which may be in it, <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> f</hi><hi rend="italic">⅛f
                    did, nor never can, hurt the merit of living artists·</hi> Quite the contrary^,
                    in my opinion: for I have ever observe I, that, whatever it be that turns the
                    minds of men to anything relative to the arts, even the most remotely so&gt;
                    brings artists more and more into credit and repute; aı though, now and then,
                    the mere broker and dealer in sue things runs away with a great deal of profit,
                    yet, in <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> J <hi rend="superscript"> ιe</hi> end,
                    ingenious men will find themselves gainers by the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193194684" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4684-0413"/>dispositions which are
                    nourished and diffused in the world by such pursuits.” Mr Barry painted two
                    pictures while abroad, his Adam and Eve and his Philoctetes. The first of these
                    he sent home as a specimen of his progress in the art. It does not appear to
                    have given much satisfaction. His Philoctetes he brought home with him. It is a
                    most wretched, coarse, unclassical performance, the direct opposite of all that
                    he thought it to be. During his stay at Rome, he made an excursion to Naples,
                    and was highly delighted with the collections of art there. All the time he was
                    abroad, Mr Burke and his brothers not only were punctual in their remittances to
                    him, but kept up a most friendly and cordial correspondence. On one occasion,
                    owing to the delay of a letter, a bill which Barry had presented to a banker was
                    dishonoured. This detained Barry for some time at the place where he was in very
                    awkward circumstances, and he had thoughts of getting rid of his chagrin and of
                    his prospects in life at once, by running away and turning friar. For some time
                    previous to his return to England, Mr Hamilton (afterwards Sir William) appears
                    to have been almost the only person with whom he kept up any intimacy. It was on
                    his return home through Milan that he witnessed, and has recorded with due
                    reprobation, the destruction of Leonardo’s Last Supper, which two bungling
                    artists were employed to paint over by order of one Count de Firmian, the
                    secretary of state.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1771 Mr Barry arrived in England, after an absence of five
                    years. He soon after produced his picture of Venus, which has been compared to
                    the Galatea of Raphael, the Venus of Titian, and the Venus de’ Medici, without
                    reason. Mr Barry flattered himself that he had surpassed the famous statue of
                    that name, by avoiding the appearance of <hi rend="italic">maternity</hi> in it.
                    There is an engraving of it by Mr Valentine Green. In 1773 he exhibited his
                    Jupiter and Juno on Mount Ida, which was much praised by some critics of that
                    flay. His Death of General Wolfe was considered as a falling off from his great
                    style of art, which consisted in painting Greek subjects, and accordingly it is
                    said to “have obtained no praise.” His fondness for Greek costume was assigned
                    by his admirers as the cause of his reluctance to paint portraits; as if the
                    coat was of more importance than the face. His fastidiousness in this respect,
                    and his frequent excuses, or blunt refusals, to go on with a portrait of Mr
                    Burke, which he had begun, caused a misunderstanding with that gentleman, which
                    does not appear to have been ever entirely made up. The difference between them
                    is said to have been widened by Burke’s growing intimacy with Sir Joshua, and by
                    Barry’s feeling some little jealousy of the fame and fortune of his rival <hi
                    rend="italic">in an humbler walh of the art.</hi> He, about the same time,
                    painted a pair of classical subjects, Mercury inventing the Lyre, and Narcissus
                    looking at himself in the Water, the last suggested to him by Mr Burke. He also
                    painted an historical picture of Chiron and Achilles, and another of the story
                    of Stratonice, for which last the duke of Richmond gave him a hundred guineas.
                    In 1773 there was a plan in contemplation for our artists to decorate the inside
                    of St Paul’s with historical and sacred subjects; but this plan fell to the
                    ground, from its not meeting with the concurrence of the bishop of London and
                    the archbishop of Canterbury, to the no small morti-cation of Barry, who had
                    fixed upon the subject he was to paint,—the rejection of Christ by the Jews when
                    Piate proposes his release. In 1773 he published <hi rend="italic">Au In- ^uιry

                <p>'tensions; and, lastly, to the general turn of the public mind to mechanics,
                    manufactures, and commerce. In the year 1774, shortly after the failure of the
                    scheme of decorating St Paul’s, a proposal was made, through Mr Valentine Green,
                    to the same artists, Reynolds, West, Cipriani, Barry, &amp;c. for ornamenting
                    the great room of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and
                    Commerce, in the Adelphi, with historical and allegorical paintings. This
                    proposal was at the time rejected by the artists themselves; but, in 1777, Mr
                    Barry made an offer to paint the whole himself, on condition of being allowed
                    the choice of his subjects, and being paid the expense of canvass, paints, and
                    models, by the society. This offer was accepted, and he finished the series of
                    pictures at the end of seven years, instead of two, which he had proposed to
                    himself, but with entire satisfaction to the members of the society, far whom it
                    was intended, and who conducted themselves to him with liberality throughout.
                    They granted him two exhibitions, and at different periods voted him 50 guineas,
                    their gold medal, and again 200 guineas, and a seat among them. Dr Johnson
                    remarked, when he saw the pictures, that, “whatever the band had done, the head
                    had done its part.” There was an excellent anonymous criticism, supposed to be
                    by Mr Burke, published on them, in answer to some remarks put forth by Barry in
                    his descriptive catalogue on the <hi rend="italic">ideal</hi> style of art, and
                    the necessity of size to grandeur. His notions on both these subjects are very
                    ably controverted, and, indeed, they are the rock on which Barry’s genius split.
                    It would be curious if Mr Burke were the author of these strictures; for it is
                    not improbable that Barry was led into the last error, here deprecated, by that
                    author’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Sublime and Beautiful.</hi> The series
                    consists of six pictures, showing the progress of human culture. The first
                    represents Orpheus taming the savages by his lyre. The figure of Orpheus himself
                    is more like that of a drunken bacchanal than an inspired poet or lawgiver. The
                    only part of this picture which is valuable is the background, in one part of
                    which a lion is seen ready to dart upon a family group milking near a cave, and,
                    in another, a tiger is pursuing a horse. There is certainly a scope of thought
                    and picturesque invention, in thus showing indirectly the protection which
                    civilization extends, as it were, over both man and animals. The second picture
                    is a Grecian harvest, which has nothing Grecian in it. But we cannot apply this
                    censure to the third picture of the Olympic Games, some of the figures in which,
                    and the principal group, are exceedingly graceful, classical, and finely
                    conceived. This picture is the only proof Mr Barry has left upon canvass that he
                    was not utterly insensible to the beauties of the art. The figure of the young
                    man on horseback really reminds the spectator of some of the Elgin marbles; and
                    the outlines of the two youthful victors at the games, supporting their father
                    on their shoulders, are excellent. The colouring is, however, as bald and
                    wretched in this picture as the rest, and there is a great want of expression.
                    The fourth picture is the triumph of commerce, with Dr Burney swimming in the
                    Thames, with his hair powdered, among naked sea-nymphs. The fifth, the Society
                    of Arts distributing their annual prizes. And the sixth represents Elysium. This
                    last picture is a collection of caricatured portraits of celebrated individuals
                    of all ages and nations, strangely jumbled together, with a huge allegorical
                    figure of Retribution driving Heresy, Vice, and Atheism, into the infernal
                    regions. The moral design of all these pictures is much better explained in the
                    catalogue than on the canvass; and the artist has added none of the graces of
                    the pencil to it in any of them, with the exception above made. Mr Barry
                    appears, however, to have rested his pretensions to fame as an artist on this
                    work, for he did little afterwards but paltry engravings from <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193194697" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4697-0414"/>himself, and the enormous and
                    totally worthless picture of Pandora in the assembly of the gods. His
                    self-denial, frugality, and fortitude, in the prosecution of his work at the
                    Adelphi, cannot be too much applauded. He has been heard to say, that at the
                    time of his undertaking it, he had only 16s. in his pocket; and that he had
                    often been obliged, after painting all day, to sit up at night to sketch or
                    engrave some design for the printsellers, which was to supply him with his next
                    day’s subsistence. In this manner he did his prints of Job, dedicated to Mr
                    Burke, of the Birth of Venus, Polemon, Head of Chatham, King Lear from the
                    picture painted for the Shakspeare gallery, &amp;c. His prints are caricatures
                    even of his pictures; they seem engraved on rotten wood.</p>
                <p>Soon after Mr Barry’s return from the Continent, he was chosen a member of the
                    Royal Academy; and in 1782 he was appointed professor of painting, in the room
                    of Mr Penny, with a salary of L.30 a year. The lectures which he delivered from
                    the chair were full of strong sense and strong advice, both to the students and
                    academicians. Among other things, he insisted much on the necessity of
                    purchasing a collection of pictures by the best masters as models for the
                    students, and proposed several of those in the Orleans collection. This
                    recommendation was not relished by the academicians, who, perhaps, thought their
                    own pictures the best models for their several pupils. Bickerings, jealousies,
                    and quarrels arose, and at length reached such a height, that, in 1799, Mr Barry
                    was expelled from the Academy, soon after the appearance of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Letter to the Dilettanti Society;</hi> a very amusing but
                    eccentric publication, full of the highest enthusiasm for his art, and the
                    lowest contempt for the living professors of it. In 1800 he undertook a design
                    or drawing to celebrate the union of the two kingdoms of Great Britain and
                    Ireland. The profits of the two exhibitions of the Adelphi pictures are said to
                    have amounted to above L.500. Lord Romney presented him with 100 guineas for his
                    portrait, which had been copied into one of the pictures, and he had twenty
                    guineas for a head of Mr Hooper. He probably received other sums for portraits
                    introduced into the work. By extreme frugality, he contrived, not only to live,
                    but to save money. His house was twice robbed of sums which he kept by him; one
                    of the times (in 1794) of upwards of L.100, a loss which was made up by the
                    munificence of Lord Radnor, and by that of his friends the Hollises. After the
                    loss of his salary, a subscription was set on foot by the earl of Buchan to
                    relieve him from his difficulties, and to settle him in a larger house to finish
                    his picture of Pandora. The subscription amounted to L.1000, with which an
                    annuity was bought, but of this he was prevented from enjoying the benefit, for,
                    on the 6th of February 1806, he was seized with a pleuritic fever, and, as he
                    neglected medical assistance at first, it was afterwards of no use. After
                    lingering on for a fortnight in considerable pain, but without losing his
                    fortitude of mind, he died on the 22d of the same month. On the 13th of March
                    the body was taken to the great room of the Society of Arts, and was thence
                    attended the following day by a numerous and respectable train of his friends to
                    the cathedral of St Paul’s, where it was deposited.</p>
                <p>Mr Barry, as an artist, a writer, and a man, was distinguished by great
                    inequality of powers and extreme contradictions in character. He was gross and
                    refined at the same time; violent and urbane; sociable and sullen; inflammable
                    and inert; ardent and phlegmatic; relapsing from enthusiasm into indolence;
                    irritable, headstrong, impatient of restraint; captious in his intercourse with
                    his friends; wavering and desultory in his profession. In his personal habits he
                    was careless of appearances or de cency; penurious, slovenly, and squalid. He
                    regarded nothing but his immediate impulses, confirmed into incorrigible habits.
                    His pencil was under no control. His eye and his hand seemed to receive a first
                    rude impulse, to which it gave itself up, and paid no regard to any thin«· else.
                    The strength of the original impetus only drove him farther from his object.
                    F1is genius constantly flew off in tangents, and came in contact with nature
                    only at salient points. There are two drawings of his from statues of a lion and
                    a lioness at Rome; the nose of the lioness is two straight lines; the ears of
                    the lion two curves, which might be mistaken for horns; as if, after it had
                    taken its first direction, he lost the use of his hand, and his tools worked
                    mechanically and monotonously without his will. His enthusiasm and vigour were
                    exhausted in the conception; the execution was crude and abortive. His writings
                    are a greater acquisition to the art than his paintings. The powers of
                    conversation were what he most excelled in; and the influence which he exercised
                    in this way over all companies where he came, in spite of the coarseness of his
                    dress, and the frequent rudeness of his manner, was great. Take him for all in
                    all, he was a man of whose memory it is impossible to think without admiration
                    as well as regret. <hi rend="smallcaps">(d. d.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
