                    are twenty-four black and white spaces, called <hi rend="italic">points.</hi>
                    Each adversary has fifteen men, black and white, to distinguish them, and they
                    are disposed of in the following manner: Supposing the game to be played in the
                    right-hand table, two are placed upon the ace point in the adversary’s table,
                    five upon the six <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192864"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-2864-0273"/>. point in the opposite table, three upon the
                    cinque point in the hithermost table, and five on the six point in the righthand
                    table. The grand object in this game is for each player to bring the men round
                    into his right-hand table, by throwing with a pair of dice those throws that
                    contribute towards it, and at the same time to prevent the adversary doing the
                    like. The first best throw upon the dice is esteemed aces, because it stops the
                    six point in the outer table, and secures the cinque in the thrower’s table; so
                    that the adversary’s two men upon the thrower’s aqe point cannot get out with
                    either quatre, cinque, or six. This throw is an advantage often given to the
                    antagonist by the superior player. When he carries his men home in order to lose
                    no point, he is to carry the most distant man to his adversary’s bar point, that
                    being the first stage he is to place it on; the next is six points farther, viz.
                    in the place where the adversary’s five men are first placed out of his tables;
                    and he must go on in this method till all his men are brought home except two,
                    when by losing a point he may often save the gammon, by throwing two fours or
                    two fives. When a hit is only played for, he should endeavour to gain either his
                    own or adversary’s cinque point; and if that fails by his being hit by the
                    adversary, and he finds him farther advanced than himself, in that case he must
                    throw more men into the adversary’s tables, which is done in this manner: He
                    must put a man upon his cinque or bar point; and if die adversary neglects to
                    hit it, he may then gain a forward game instead of a back game. But if the
                    adversary hits him, he should play for a back game; and then the greater number
                    of men which are taken up makes his game the better, because by these means he
                    will preserve his game at home. He should then endeavour to gain both his
                    adversary’s ace and trois points, or his ace and deuce points, and take care to
                    keep three men upon the adversary’s ace point, that in case the latter hits him
                    from thence, that point may remain still secure to himself. A back game should
                    not be played for at the beginning of a set, because it would be a great
                    disadvantage, the player running the risk of a gammon to win a single hit. The
                    subsequent calculations will show the odds of entering a single man upon any
                    certain number of points. Upon two dice there are thirty-six chances, and upon
                    these chances the following points, viz.</p>

                </table>
                <p>If a player has taken up two of the adversary’s men, and happens to have two,
                    three, or more points made in his own tables, he should spread his men, that he
                    may either take a new point in his tables, or be ready to hit the man which the
                    adversary may happen to enter. If he finds, upon the adversary’s entering, that
                    the game is upon a par, or that the advantage is on his own side, he should take
                    the adversary’s man up whenever he can, it being 25 to 11 that he is not hit;
                    except when he is playing for a single hit only, because then, if playing the
                    throw otherwise gives him a better chance for it, he ought to do it.</p>
                <p>It being five to one against his being hit with double dice, he should never be
                    deterred from taking up any one man of the adversary’s.</p>
                <p>If he has taken up one of the adversary’s men, and happens to have five points in
                    his own tables, yet is forced to leave a blot out of his tables, he should
                    endeavour to leave it upon doublets in preference to any other chance, because
                    in that case the odds are 35 to 1 that he is not hit; whereas it is only 17 to 1
                    that he is hit upon any other chance.</p>
                <p>When the adversary is very forward, a player should never move a man from his own
                    quatre, trois, or deuce points, thinking to bear that man from the point where
                    he put it, as nothing but high doublets can give him any chance for the hit.
                    Instead of playing an ace or a deuce from any of those points, he should play
                    them from his own six or highest points, so that, throwing two fives or two
                    fours, his six and cinque points being eased, would be a considerable advantage
                    to him; whereas if they had been loaded he would have been obliged to play
                    otherwise.</p>
                <p>It is the interest of the adversary to take up the player as soon as he enters.
                    The blot should be left upon the adversary’s lowest point; that is to say, upon
                    his deuce point rather than upon his trois point, or upon his trois point rather
                    than his quatre point, or upon his quatre point preferably to his cinque point,
                    for a reason before mentioned. All the men the adversary plays upon his trois or
                    his deuce point are deemed lost, being greatly out of play; so that those men
                    not having it in their power to make his cinque point, and his game being
                    crowded in one place and open in another, the adversary must be greatly annoyed
                    by the player.</p>
                <p>If the player has two of the adversary’s men in his tables, he has a better
                    chance for a hit than if he had more, provided his game is more forward than
                    that of his antagonist; for if he had three or more of the adversary’s men in
                    his tables, he would stand a worse chance to be hit.</p>
                <p>When a player is running to save the gammon, if he should have two men upon his
                    ace point and several men abroad, although he should lose a point or two in
                    putting his men into his tables, it is his interest to leave a man upon the
                    adversary’s ace point, because it will prevent his adversary from bearing his
                    men to the greatest advantage, and at the same time the player will have a
                    chance of the adversary’s making a blot, which he may chance to hit. However, if
                    a player finds upon a throw that he has a probability of saving his gammon, he
                    should never wait for a blot, as the odds are greatly against his hitting it,
                    but at once embrace that opportunity to escape.</p>
                <p>Suppose the adversary has so many men abroad as to require three throws to put
                    them into his tables, and at the same time that the player’s tables are made up,
                    and that he has taken up one of the adversary’s men; in this case it is about an
                    equal wager that the adversary is gammoned; for in all probability the player
                    has borne two men before he opens his tables, and when he bears the third man he
                    will be obliged to open his six or cinque point. It is then probable that the
                    adversary is obliged to throw twice before he enters his men in the player’s
                    tables, twice more before he puts that man into his own tables, and three throws
                    more to put the men which are abroad into his own tables; in all seven throws.
                    Now the player having twelve men to bear, he may be forced to make an ace or a
                    deuce twice before he can bear all his men, and consequently will require seven
                    throws in bearing them; so that, upon the whole, it is about equal whether the
                    adversary is gammoned or not.</p>
                <p>Suppose a player has three men upon his adversary’s ace point and five points in
                    his own tables, and that the adversary has all his men in his tables, three upon
                    each of his five highest points; has the pjayer a probability of gammoning his
                    adversary or not?</p>

                <p>This method may be taken to find out the odds of hitting three, four, or five

                    time. After knowin 5 how many chances there are to hit any of these blots, they
                    must be added all together, and then subtracted from the number 36. which are
                    the chances of the two dice; and the question is solved.</p>
                <p>The laws of backgammon are as follow: 1. If a man is taken from any point, it
                    must be played; if two men are taken from it, they also must be played. 2. A man
                    is not supposed to be played till it is placed upon a point and quitted. 3. If a
                    player has only fourteen men in play, there is no penalty inflicted, because by
                    his playing with a lesser number than he is entitled to, he plays to a
                    disadvantage for want of the deficient man to make up his tables. 4. If he bears
                    any number of men before he has entered a man taken up, and which of course he
                    was obliged to enter, such men so borne must be entered again in the adversary’s
                    tables as well as the man taken up, 5. If he has mistaken his throw and played
                    it, and his adversary has thrown, it is not in the choice of either of the
                    players to alter it, unless they both agree so to do.</p>
