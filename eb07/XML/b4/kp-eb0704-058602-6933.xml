            <div facs="nls:193196933" type="entry">
                <p><label type="entry">BERKSHIRE</label>, an English inland county, bounded on the
                    north by Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, from which it is separated by the
                    Thames; on the east by Surrey; on the south by Hampshire; and on the west by
                    Wiltshire. At the north-eastern corner this county comes slightly in contact
                    with Gloucestershire. It is of a very irregular figure, its whole northern side
                    being bounded by the sinuosities of the river Thames, which, taking a southern
                    course from Oxford, almost cuts this county asunder at Reading. From east to
                    west it extends about forty-two miles; from north to south, in its widest part,
                    it is about twenty-eight miles; but in its narrowest it is not more than seven.
                    Its extent is about 756 square miles, or 483,840 statute acres.</p>
                <p>The face of the country is generally level, but undulating, though on some parts,
                    and those near the Thames, the hills rise rather abruptly, and give diversity
                    and beauty to the scenery. This is especially the case near Farring-don, and on
                    the opposite corner of the county near Windsor. A ridge of chalk hills runs from
                    Oxfordshire westward, and bounds the vale of White-horse. It is needless to
                    advert to the beauties of Windsor forest, since they have been immortalized in
                    song by Pope, at a time when they were far inferior to their present appearance.
                    The south and east sides of the county are well wooded, but the trees are not
                    generally of great size nor of the most valuable or picturesque kind.</p>
                <p>The agriculture of the county varies much from its locality. On the gravelly
                    soils, though good barley is raised after turnips, it is liable to suffer in dry
                    seasons. Wheat and beans are well cultivated, and the facilities of
                    watercarriage contribute to bring much manure from London and other distant
                    parts; whilst a species of peat found on the banks of the Kennet yields ashes
                    that are of great value to the soils near that river. More than one half of the
                    land is calculated to be under tillage, about one quarter is pasturage, and the
                    remainder consists of woodlands or uncultivated heaths, affording only scanty
                    food for sheep.</p>
                <p>Few parts of England are better supplied with the facilities of water
                    communication than the county of Berks. It is connected by means of the Thames,
                    which runs round or through it, on one hand with London and the sea, and on the
                    other with the Severn at two separate points on that river; one through the
                    Thames and Severn canal, with Gloucester; the other through the river Kennet and
                    the Kennet and Avon Canal, with Bath and Bristol. Besides the navigable rivers,
                    it enjoys the benefit of the Wilts and Berks Canal, which connects the Thames at
                    Abingdon with the Avon at Trowbridge, in Wiltshire, and communicates with the
                    Kennet and Avon Canal. The other rivers, which all finally fall into the Thames,
                    are the Ock, the Loddon, the Auburn, and the Lambourn.</p>
                <p>1he woollen manufacture was introduced into this county under the Tudors; and the
                    story of the celebrated clothier, Jack of Newbury, has been handed down to the
                    period when the establishments founded by him have passed to the northern parts
                    of the kingdom. At Abingdon some linen manufactures still linger. The copper
                    smelted in Wales is conveyed to some large mills near Marlow, where it is rolled
                    into sheets for coppering ves sels. 1 here are some tew paper-mills near
                    Newbury. The chief commerce of the county consists in the sale of its
                    agricultural produce, and some transit trade, from beingin the way of inland
                    navigation between the two greatest English rivers, the Thames and the
                    Severn.</p>
                <p>The civil division of the county is into twenty hundreds containing ten
                    market-towns and 148 parishes. In ⅛e clerical division it is in the diocese of
                    Salisbury and the archdeaconry of Berks. It is on the Oxford judicial circuit,
                    and the assizes are held alternately at Reading and Abingdon. Under the actual
                    system of representation, two members are returned to the house of commons for
                    the county, two for each of the boroughs of Reading, Wallingford, and Windsor,
                    and one for Abingdon.</p>

                    of inhabited houses appeared as follows :—</p>

                <p>The families chiefly employed in agriculture in 1821 were 14,769; those employed

                    preceding classes were 4158.</p>
                <p>From the vicinity to the metropolis, the salubrity of the climate, and the
                    general beauty of the country, few counties have more numerous, magnificent, and
                    convenient seats of the nobility and gentry than are to be found in Berkshire.
                    Among these stands pre-eminent the royal castle of Windsor, the favourite
                    residence of our monarchs during many centuries; for although it was chiefly
                    rebuilt in the reign of Edward III., it was originally constructed by William
                    the Conqueror, soon after he had attained the sovereign power in England. It is
                    built on the summit of a hill whose base is washed by the Thames, and is a
                    prominent object of admiration from an extensive surrounding district. But as a
                    description of this castle, of St George’s chapel, the burying-place of our
                    kings, and of the great and small parks, will be much more appropriate under the
                    head of <hi rend="smallcaps">Windsor,</hi> the reader is accordingly referred to
                    that article. The other more distinguished residences are Caversham, near
                    Reading, belonging to Mr Marsac, formerly to Lord Cadogan. It is an elegant
                    structure, on an eminence overlooking the Thames. Benham House, the seat of Lord
                    Craven, is a simple and beautiful building, ornamented with woods, forming a
                    pleasing contrast with the subjacent valley. Park Place, near Henley, built by
                    the late General Conway, possesses high attractions from the beauty and variety
                    of the grounds, and the prospects commanded by them. Basildon House, on the
                    banks of the Thames, between Reading and Wallingford, is a most superb mansion,
                    erected by the late Sir Francis Sykes. The other seats deserving of mention are,
                    Hare Hatch, Sir Μ. Ximenes; Sunning, R. Palmer, Esq.; Coley Park, Mr Monck;
                    Englefield FIouse, Mr Benyon; Dornington Castle, Colonel Stead; Ramsbury House,
                    Sir Francis Burdett; Barton Court, Mr Dundas, Chilton Lodge, Mr Pearce; Pusey
                    House, Mr Pusey; Buscot Park, Mr Loveden Loveden; and Buckland, Sir G.
                    Throckmorton·</p>
                <p>Antiquities, both Roman and Saxon, are numerous in various parts of this county.
                    The Watling Street road of the former people enters Berkshire from Bedfordshire
                    at the village of Streatley, and leaves it at Newbury. Another Roman road passes
                    from Reading to Newbury, where it divides into two branches, one passing to
                    Marlborough in Wiltshire, and the other to Cirencester in Gloucestershire. A
                    branch of the Icknield Street road passes from Wallingford to Wantage. Near
                    Wantage is a Roman camp, of a quadrangular form; and there are other remains<pb

                    East Hampstead, near Wokingham, nθ∏ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> White-horse
                    Hill, near Pusey, and at Sinodun Hill, near Wallingford. At Lawrence Waltham
                    there is a Roman fort, and near Denchworth a fortress said to have been built by
                    Canute the Dane, called Cherbury Castle. Dragon Hill is supposed to have been
                    the burying-place of a British prince called Uter Pendragon, and near to it is
                    Uffi∏gton Castle, supposed to be of Danish construction. On White-horse Hill, in
                    the same vicinity, is the rude figure of what is called a horse, although it
                    bears a greater resemblance to a greyhound. It has been formed by cutting away
                    the turf and leaving the chalk bare. It is said to occupy near an acre of land,
                    and to have been executed by Alfred to celebrate a victory over the Danes in the
                    reign of his brother Ethelred, in the year 872.</p>
                <p>Berkshire comprehended the principality inhabited by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Atrebates,</hi> a tribe of people who originally migrated from Gaul before the
                    island was divided into Roman provinces. Under that nation it formed part of <hi
                    rend="italic">Britannia Prima,</hi> and during the Saxon heptarchy was included
                    in the kingdom of West Saxony. When Alfred divided the county into shires,
                    hundreds, and parishes, it obtained the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Berocscire,</hi> which subsequently changed to that which it now bears. It was
                    frequently the scene of military operations from the time of Offa down to the
                    troubles in the reign of Charles I. During the civil war two battles were fought
                    at Newbury. In 1643, after a siege, Reading was taken by the parliament forces,
                    and the royalist party expelled from the whole of the county except
                    Wallingford.</p>
                <p>Mineral springs are found at Cumner and Sunninghill, and at the latter are
                    establishments for the reception of visitants. There is a strong chalybeate
                    called Gorrick Well, near Luckley House, and some springs near Windsor of the
                    nature of the Epsom waters.</p>
                <p>The following are the principal towns in this county, with their population in
                    1821:—Reading, 12,867; Newbury, 5347; Thatcham, 3677; Wokingham, 2490;
                    Wallingford, 2093; Windsor, 5698; Abingdon, 5137; Wantage, 2560; Farringdon,
