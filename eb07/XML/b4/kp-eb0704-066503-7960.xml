                <p><label type="entry">BLACKSTONE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir William</hi></label>, an
                    eminent English lawyer, was born at London in July 1723. His father, Mr Charles
                    Blackstone, a silk-man, citizen, andbowyer of London, died some months before
                    the birth of our author, who was the youngest of four children; and his mother
                    also died before he was twelve years old. Even from his birth, the care both of
                    his education and fortune was kindly undertaken by his maternal uncle Mr Thomas
                    Bigg, an eminent surgeon in London, and afterwards, on the death of his elder
                    brothers, owner of the Chilton estate, which is still enjoyed by his family. In
                    1730, being then about seven years old, he was put to school at the
                    Charter-house; and in 1735 he was admitted upon the foundation there by the
                    nomination of Sir Robert Walpole, on the recommendation of Charles Wither, of
                    Hall in Hampshire, Esq. his cousin by the mother’s side. In this excellent
                    seminary he applied himself to every branch of youthful education, with the same
                    assiduity which distinguished him throughout life. His talents and industry
                    rendered him the favourite of his masters, who encouraged and assisted him to
                    the utmost of their power; so that at the age of fifteen he was at the head of
                    the school, and, although very young, was thought well qualified to be removed
                    to the university. He was accordingly entered a commoner at Pembroke College,
                    Oxford, on the 30th of November 1738, and matriculated the next day. At this
                    time he was elected to one of the Charter-house exhibitions by the governors of
                    that foundation, to commence from the Michaelmas preceding, but was permitted to
                    continue a scholar there till after the 12th of December, being the anniversary
                    commemoration of the founder, to give him an opportunity of speaking the
                    customary oration, which he had prepared, and which did him much credit. About
                    this time also he obtained Mr Benson’s gold prize-medal of Milton, for verses on
                    that poet. In the February following, the society of Pembroke College
                    unanimously elected him to one of Lady Holford’s exhibitions for Charter-house
                    scholars in that house. Here he prosecuted his studies with unremitting ardour;
                    and although the classics, and particularly the Greek and Roman poets, w
                    &lt;,i∙e his favourites, they did not entirely engross his attention; for logic,
                    mathematics, and the other sciences, were not neglected. At the early age of
                    twenty, he compiled a treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">Elements of
                    Architecture,</hi> intended for his own use only, and not for publication, but
                    esteemed by those who have perused it as in no respect unworthy of his maturer
                    judgment and more practised pen.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197973" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7973-0666"/>
                <p>Having determined on his future plan of life, and made choice of the law for his
                    profession, he was entered in the Middle Temple on the 20th of November 1741. He
                    now found it necessary to quit the more amusing pursuits of his youth for the
                    severer studies to which he had dedicated himself, and betook himself seriously
                    to reading law. He expressed his disagreeable sensations on this occasion in a
                    copy of verses, since published by Dodsley in the fourth volume of his
                    miscellanies, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Lawyers Farewell to his Muse;</hi>
                    in which the struggle of his mind is expressed so strongly, so naturally, and
                    with such elegance of language and harmony of versification, as must convince
                    every reader that his passion for the muses was too deeply rooted to be laid
                    aside without much reluctance, and that, if he had pursued that flowery path, he
                    might perhaps have proved inferior to but few of our English poets. Besides
                    this, several fugitive pieces were at times communicated by him to his friends;
                    and he left, but not with a view of publication, a small collection of juvenile
                    pieces, consisting of both originals and translations. Some notes on Shakspeare,
                    which just before his death he communicated to Mr Steevens, and which were
                    inserted by him in his last edition of that author, show how well he understood
                    the meaning as well as relished the beauties of his favourite among the English
                    poets.</p>
                <p>In November 1743 he was elected into the society of All-Souls College; while in
                    the November following he spoke the anniversary speech in commemoration of
                    Archbishop Chichelay, the founder, and the other benefactors to that house of
                    learning, and was at the same time admitted actual fellow. From this period he
                    divided his time between the university and the Temple, where he took chambers
                    in order to attend the courts. In the former he pursued his academical studies,
                    and on the 12th of June 1745 commenced bachelor of civil law; in the latter he
                    applied himself closely to his profession, both in the hall and in his private
                    studies, and on the 28th of November 1746 he was called to the bar. Though but
                    little known or distinguished in Westminster Hall, he was actively employed,
                    during his occasional residences at the university, in attending to its
                    interests, and in mingling with and improving its interior concerns. In May
                    1749, as a small reward for his services, and to give him further opportunities
                    of advancing the interests of the college, Mr Blackstone was appointed steward
                    of its manors. And in the same year, on the resignation of his uncle Seymour
                    Richmond, Esq., he was elected recorder of the borough of Wallingford in
                    Berkshire, and received the king’s approbation on the 30th of May. On the 26th
                    of April 1750 he commenced doctor of civil law, and thereby became a member of
                    the convocation, which enabled him to extend his views beyond the narrow circle
                    of his own society, to the benefit of the university at large. In the summer of
                    1753 he took the resolution of wholly retiring to his fellowship and an
                    academical life, still continuing the practice of his profession as a provincial
                    counsel.</p>
                <p>His lectures on the laws of England appear to have been an early and favourite
                    idea; for in the Michaelmas term, immediately after he quitted Westminster Hall,
                    he entered on the province of reading them at Oxford; and we are told by the
                    author of his life, that even at their commencement, such were the expectations
                    formed from the acknowledged abilities of the lecturer, that they were attended
                    by a very crowded class of young men of the first families, characters, and
                    hopes. But it was not till the year 1758 that the lectures, in the form they now
                    bear, were read in the university. Mr Viner having by his will left not only the
                    copyright of his abridgment, but other property to a considerable amount, to the
                    university of Oxford, in order to found a professorship, fellowships, and
                    scholarships of common law, he was on the 20th of October 1758 unanimously
                    elected Vinerian professor; and on the 25th of the same month he read his first
                    introductory lecture which he published at the request of the vice-chancellor
                    and heads of houses, and afterwards prefixed to the first volume of his
                    Commentaries. His lectures had now gained such universal applause, that he was
                    requested by a noble personage who superintended the education of George HL,
                    then prince of Wales, to read them to his royal highness; but as he was at that
                    time engaged with a numerous class of pupils in the university, he thought he
                    could not, consistently with that engagement, comply with this request, and
                    therefore declined it. But he transmitted copies of many of them for the perusal
                    of his royal highness; who, far from being offended at an excuse grounded on so
                    honourable a motive, was pleased to order a handsome gratuity to be presented to
                    him. It is doubtful whether the Commentaries were originally intended for the
                    press; but many imperfect and incorrect copies having got abroad, and a pirated
                    edition of them being either published or preparing for publication in Ireland,
                    the learned lecturer thought proper to print a correct edition himself, and in
                    November 1765 published the first volume, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentaries on the Laws of England</hi> The remaining parts of this admirable
                    work were given to the world in the course of the four succeeding years, lt
                    ought to be remarked, that before this period the reputation which his lectures
                    had deservedly acquired for him had induced him to resume his practice in
                    Westminster Hall; and, contrary to the general order of the profession, he who
                    had quitted the bar for an academic life, was sent back from the college to the
                    bar with a considerable increase of business. He was likewise elected into
                    parliament, first for Hindon, and afterwards for Westbury in Wilts; but in
                    neither of these departments did he equal the expectations which his writings
                    had raised. The part he took in the Middlesex election drew upon him the attacks
                    of some persons of ability in the senate, and likewise a severe animadversion by
                    one of the keenest polemical writers of that day, we mean Junius. This
                    circumstance probably strengthened the aversion he professed to parliamentary
                    attendance; “where,” he said, “amidst the rage of contending parties, a man of
                    moderation must expect to meet with no quarter from any side.” When, on the
                    resignation of Mr Dunning in 1770, he was offered the place of
                    solicitor-general, he refused that office; but shortly afterwards, on the
                    promotion of Sir Joseph Yates to a seat in the court of Common Pleas, he
                    accepted a seat on the bench, and by the death of Sir Joseph succeeded him there
                    also. This eminent and valuable man died on the 14th of February 1780, in the
                    fifty-seventh year of his <hi rend="italic">age.</hi></p>
