                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BOERHAAVE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Herman</hi></label>, the most
                    celebrated physician of the eighteenth century, and one who without impropriety
                    maybe opposed to the Galen of antiquity, if not in extent of genius, at least
                    for the number and variety of his acquirements, the exclusive empire which his
                    medical system obtained, and the immense celebrity which he enjoyed during his
                    life. He was born in 1668, at Worhout, a village near Leyden. At the age of
                    sixteen he found himself without parents, protection, advice, or fortune. He had
                    already studied theology and the other ecclesiastical sciences, with the view of
                    devoting himself to a clerical life; but the science of nature, which had
                    equally occupied his mind, soon engrossed his whole attention. This illustrious
                    person, whose name afterwards spread throughout the world, and who left at his
                    death above L.200,000, could at that time barely live by his labours, and was
                    compelled to teach mathematics in order to obtain the means of subsistence. But
                    in 1693 he was received as doctor of physic, and began practice; and his merit
                    having been discovered, many powerful friends patronized him, and procured him
                    three valuable appointments; first, that of professor of medicine in the
                    university of Leyden; secondly, that of professor of chemistry; and thirdly,
                    that of professor of botany. The Academy of Sciences of Paris, and the Royal
                    Society of London, each invited him to become one of their members; and he
                    communicated to both his discoveries in chemistry. In Boerhaave’s time the city
                    of Leyden became the school of Europe for this science, as well as for medicine
                    and botany. All the princes of Europe sent him disciples, who found in this
                    skilful professor not only an indefatigable teacher, but an affectionate
                    guardian, who encouraged them to pursue their labours, consoled them in their
                    afflictions, and solaced them in their wants. When Peter the Great went to
                    Holland in 1715, to instruct himself in maritime affairs, he also attended
                    Boerhaave in order to receive lessons. The reputation of the latter extended as
                    far as China: a mandarin wrote to him a letter superscribed with this direction,
                    “To the illustrious Boerhaave, physician in Europe and it reached him in due
                    course. The city of Leyden has raised a monument in the church of St Peter, to
                    the salutary genius of Boerhaave, <hi rend="italic">Salutifero Boerhaavii genio
                    sacrum.</hi></p>
                <p>From the time of Hippocrates, no physician had more justly merited the esteem of
                    his contemporaries, and the thanks of posterity, than Boerhaave. To an uncommon
                    genius and extraordinary talents he united those qualities of the heart which
                    give them so great a value to society. His appearance was decent, simple,
                    venerable, and, latterly, almost patriarchal. He was an eloquent orator, and
                    discoursed with dignity and grace. He taught very methodically, and with great
                    precision; he never tired his auditors, who always regretted when his discourses
                    were finished. He would sometimes also give them a lively turn; but his raillery
                    was refined and ingenious, and it enlivened the subject he treated of, without
                    carrying with it any thing severe or satirical. A declared foe to all excess, he
                    considered decent mirth as the salt of life. It was the daily practice of this
                    eminent person, throughout his life, as soon as he rose in the morning, which
                    was generally very early, to retire for an hour to private prayer, and
                    meditation on some part of the Scriptures. He often told his friends, when they
                    asked him how it was possible for him to go through so much fatigue, that it was
                    this practice which gave him spirit and vigour in the business of the day. He
                    therefore recommended it as the best rule he could give; for nothing, said he,
                    can tend more to the health of the body than the tranquillity of the mind.</p>
                <p>Of his sagacity, and the wonderful penetration with which he often discovered and
                    described, at first sight, such distempers as betray themselves by no symptoms
                    to common eyes, very surprising accounts have been transmitted to us. Yet this
                    great master of medical knowledge was so far from having presumptuous confidence
                    in his own abilities, or from being puffed up by riches, that he was
                    condescending to all, and remarkably diligent in his profession; and he used
                    often to observe that the life of a patient, if trifled with or neglected, would
                    one day be required at the hand of the physician. The activity of his mind
                    sparkled visibly in his eyes. He was always cheerful, and desirous of promoting
                    every valuable end of conversation, of which the excellency of the Christian
                    religion was frequently the subject; for he asserted, on all proper occasions,
                    the divine authority and sacred efficacy of the Scriptures. He never regarded
                    calumny nor detraction,—for even Boerhaave himself had enemies,—nor in any
                    instance thought it necessary to confute them. “They are sparks,” said he,
                    “which, if you do not blow them, will go out of themselves. The surest remedy
                    against scandal, is to live it down by a perseverance in well-doing; and by
                    praying to God that he would cure the distempered minds of those who traduce and
                    injure us.” Being once asked by a friend, who had often admired his patience
                    under great provocations, whether he knew what it was to be angry, and by what
                    means he had so entirely suppressed that impetuous and ungovernable passion, he
                    answered, with the utmost frankness and sincerity, that he was naturally quick
                    of resentment; but that, by daily prayer and meditation, he had at length
                    attained to this mastery over himself.</p>
                <p>About the middle of the year 1737 he felt the first approaches of that fatal
                    illness which brought him to the grave; namely, a disorder in the chest, which
                    was at times very painful, often threatening him with immediate suffocation, and
                    which terminated in an universal dropsy. But during this afflictive and
                    lingering illness, his constancy and firmness did not forsake him; he neither
                    intermitted the necessary cares of life, nor forgot the proper preparations for
                    death. About three weeks before his dissolution, when the Rev. Mr Schultens, one
                    of the most learned and exemplary divines of the age, attended him at his
                    countryhouse, the doctor desired his prayers, and afterwards entered into a most
                    remarkably judicious discourse with him on the spiritual and immaterial nature
                    of the soul; and this he illustrated to Mr Schultens with wonderful perspicuity,
                    by a description of the effects which the infirmities of his body had upon his
                    faculties; which, however, they did not so oppress or vanquish as to deprive his
                    mind of the mastery over itself. As death approached nearer, he was so far from
                    terror or confusion, that he seemed less sensible of pain, and more cheerful
                    under his sufferings, which continued till the 23d day of September 1738, when
                    he died, between four and five in the morning, in the seventieth year of his
                    age; often recommending to the byestanders a careful observation of St John’s
                    precepts concerning the love of God and the love of man, as frequently
                    inculcated in his first epistle, particularly in the fifth chapter. His funeral
                    oration was spoken in Latin before the university of Leyden, to a very numerous
                    audience, by Mr Schultens, and afterwards published at their particular
                    desire.</p>
                <p>When Boerhaave first directed his attention to medicine, the new philosophy of
                    Bacon, and the creation of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193198792"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-8792-0729"/>the experimental art, had caused the physical
                    sciences to make great advancement; and these, accordingly, occupied all minds,
                    whilst the healing art had but little profited in consequence. It was overlooked
                    or forgotten, that, from its very origin, Hippocrates had applied to it the very
                    philosophy with which the learned were now everywhere so enthusiastically
                    occupied. His theory, however, still continued to fluctuate between several
                    dogmas equally remote from the truth. The chemists who, at the revival of
                    learning in Europe, had overturned the authority of Galen, had to defend
                    themselves against the sects of the mechanicians, and of Bellini, which divided
                    the dominion of medicine between them. In a small portion of Germany alone Stahl
                    brought back men’s minds to the judicious doctrine of Hippocrates, attributing
                    all the movements in the animal economy to a force inherent in itself, and
                    different from the general forces of matter; but in adopting a word, the meaning
                    of which was by no means precise, he rendered less general and less salutary the
                    influence which he would otherwise have produced. The first perusal of
                    Hippocrates appeared to have carried away Boerhaave; but this physician, endowed
                    by nature with a mind fitted for analysis, comparison, and combination, rather
                    than with a creative and inventive genius, was unable to resist the influence of
                    his age, and, above all, the effect of his early studies. Having been a
                    mathematician and natural philosopher before he became physician, he was
                    constantly carried away by the first objects of his labour and research; and
                    being more capable than any one else of detecting the accessory affinities
                    between these sciences and that of man, he ran greater risk of being seduced by
                    them. But as every system, however vicious, has always, along with the facts
                    which it arranges and offers to explain, a point of accordance more or less
                    remote, he thought that the best medical system would be that which should unite
                    and combine all opinions. Forgetting that living bodies are free, during their
                    life, from those movements to which other bodies are imperiously constrained, or
                    at least counterbalance them, and that all the acts which they perform are the
                    result of an activity which is peculiar to them; overlooking, also, that those
                    of the movements of the living economy which most easily admit an application of
                    the laws of physics and mechanics, have, nevertheless, as a <hi rend="italic"
                    >primum mobile,</hi> the force of life, and only receive from the forces of dead
                    matter an accessory impulse; Boerhaave wished to combine in one and the same
                    theory the vital philosophy of Hippocrates, the chemical principles of Sylvius,
                    the mechanism of Bellini, and many other incongruities besides; attributing
                    more, however, to the mechanical and chemical forces, which can never be but
                    accessory, than to the more profound and secret powers of life, which are the
                    principal. Thus the calibre of the vessels adjusted to the dimensions of the
                    globules composing the liquids of the body, formed, according to him, the
                    hydraulic relation on which depended the circulation of the humours, their
                    separation from the blood in the different secretory organs, the morbific
                    congestion of the blood in various fluxions, in humours, inflammations, and such
                    like; and hence he concluded that all the efforts of the physician should be
                    directed to establish this relation, or rather mechanical equilibrium. Nor did
                    he stop even here. To the mechanical hypotheses just mentioned he added others
                    founded on chemical principles, when, in attempting to explain the causes and
                    the phenomena of diseases, he admitted the formation of pretended acrimonies in
                    the blood, which the physician ought, according to him, to have constantly in
                    view in order to neutralize them; acrimonies which were long famous in the
                    language of the schools, and which are still found in that of ordinary life. The
                    whole phenomena of diseases, with the spontaneous evacuations by which they are
                    terminated, and which constitute the crises, find a ready explanation on this
                    vicious system, which seems to offer a reason, when it only mystifies with a
                    word, involving a gratuitous hypothesis. In practice, however, theory receives
                    many modifications; and there can be little doubt, that in prescribing for
                    patients, Boerhaave was more guided by experience and good sense than by the
                    strangely eclectic doctrine to which we have here cursorily alluded.</p>
