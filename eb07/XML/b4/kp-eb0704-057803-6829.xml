                <p><label type="entry">BERBICE</label> is a colony belonging to the British,
                    situated on the banks of the river of the same name, in the province of Guiana,
                    in South America. The latitude of the mouth of the river Berbice is 6. 20. N.
                    and its longitude 57. 11. W. from London. The plantations are situated on each
                    side of the river, and extend nearly 300 miles from its entrance. Previously to
                    the year 1799 this colony was bounded on the east by the Devil’s Creek, and on
                    the west by Abarry Creek, which separated it f <hi rend="superscript"> ronl</hi>
                    Demerary, its breadth being then 30 miles; but when Surinam surrendered to the
                    British in that year, a negociation was entered into between the governors of
                    these two colonies, by which Surinam conceded to Berbicet∏θ tract of country
                    between the Devil’s Creek and the r∏er Courantine, thus increasing its breadth
                    to about CO miles. The sea-coast and the west bank of the Courantine were
                    immediately surveyed and laid out into regular allotments· The extent of this
                    colony was further enlarged by t British, who cleared and embanked from the sea
                    the who e line of coast between the Demerary and the Courantmθ&gt; forming upon
                    it a carriage-road sixty feet broad, with∙sι <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196842"

                    travelling·</p>
                <p>Previously to this improvement the face of the country resembled that of the rest
                    of Guiana. On the shores there was a border of low ground, between high and
                    low-water marks, covered with mangroves. When the tide flowed, this border had
                    several feet of water over it; and when it ebbed it presented an inaccessible
                    mud-bank. This is now rendered dry and productive. Behind this border of
                    mangroves, at the distance of 400 or 500 paces, commence low, level, swampy
                    savannahs, formed by the rains, which are prolonged in the direction of the
                    coast, with a depth more or less considerable, according to the distance of the
                    mountains. This part of the colony was almost entirely neglected by the Dutch,
                    who fixed their principal plantations in the more elevated and interior part of
                    the country.</p>
                <p>The year is here divided into two dry and two wet seasons; light showers begin to
                    refresh the land about the middle of April; the rain increases till the middle
                    of June, when it falls in torrents; at the beginning of July these heavy rains
                    begin to decrease; and in August the long dry season begins, and continues till
                    November. December and January constitute the short rainy season, and February
                    and March the short dry season. The land winds prevail during the two wet
                    seasons, and are unhealthy; in the dry season the air is refreshed by regular
                    diurnal sea-breezes. The temperature of this colony is not so great as might be
                    expected from its latitude; the thermometer very seldom rises to 91°; during
                    May, June, and July, it generally varies between 83° and 84°; and the lowest
                    degree is about 75°. The weather always changes very gradually.</p>
                <p>There are two rivers in this colony, the Berbice and the Canje. The former runs
                    from south to north, and discharges itself into the Atlantic Ocean. The coast on
                    each side of it forms a bay at its entrance, which is nearly a mile in width,
                    having a small island in the middle, called Crab Island, from the number of
                    land-crabs on it; and the entrance itself is protected by three forts, but they
                    are of little use, as Berbice must, from its situation, always follow the fate
                    of Demerary. Without the entrance of the river is a bar of sand, over which at
                    high tide there is seldom more than eighteen feet of water; but within, the
                    water is of sufficient depth, and the river is navigable for ships of burden 200
                    miles from its mouth. On account of the bar, however, few vessels rendezvous
                    here, but anchor off the port of Demerary. The river Canje is narrow, but deep,
                    running at first nearly from south to north, but afterwards diverging to the
                    west, till it falls into the Berbice about a mile from the sea. It is navigable
                    for colony schooners thirty miles up. At its head are immense falls, and about
                    forty miles below there is a creek which connects it with the Courantine. In
                    this route, and by means of this creek, dispatches are brought from Surinam to
                    Berbice by the Indians. All the water on the coast of Berbice is brackish. The
                    rain-water, which lodges in the low parts of the forests, called bush-water, is
                    collected by the Indians for the purposes of drinking and cooking. The forests
                    are extensive, and contain many very large trees. ŋ <hi rend="superscript">
                    r</hi> Pinckard describes an enormous tree of the Tonquin bean, the body of
                    which rose perpendicularly to the height of between seventy and eighty feet
                    before it threw out a smgle branch.</p>
                <p>The only towns in this colony are Old Amsterdam, and Fort Nassau or New
                    Amsterdam. The former is said by Bolingbroke to be fifty miles up the river
                    Berbice, but Dr Bancroft places it at 100 miles from the mouth. The
                    inconveniences attendant on this situation of Old Amsterdam were so numerous and
                    obvious, arising chiefly from the uncertain and intricate navigation of the
                    river, that, in the year 1766, when Dr Bancroft visited Guiana, it was resolved
                    to remove the seat of government to a point of land on the eastern shore of the
                    Berbice, about a mile from its entrance, formed between that river and the
                    Canje. So slow, however, were the Dutch in their operations, that New Amsterdam,
                    for so this town was called, was scarcely begun in the year 1796, when Berbice
                    capitulated to the English. Under the greater activity of the conquerors, New
                    Amsterdam soon assumed the size and appearance of the capital of the colony. It
                    is situated on the south side of the Canje; and the houses extend up the banks
                    of the Berbice about a mile and a half, facing the water. The Dutch, in laying
                    out the town, paid particular attention to health and convenience. Round each
                    allotment there are trenches, which fill and empty themselves every tide, so
                    that all the filth is carried off before it stagnates and becomes unwholesome.
                    Each lot contains a quarter of an acre of land; and a free circulation of air,
                    as well as ground for a kitchen-garden, is thus secured to the inhabitants. The
                    houses are very long and narrow, and not more than a storey and a half high,
                    with galleries on each side to protect them from the sun. Those inhabited by the
                    Dutch are thatched with troolie<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The troolies are perhaps the largest leaves that have been
                    hitherto discovered in any part of the world. Each leaf is supported y a single

                    leaf, these stems are hard and strong, and about three inches in circumference
                    near the root. Each leaf is from twenty to thirty feet in length, and from two
                    to three feet <hi rend="superscript"> ιn</hi> breadth. They will effectually

                    shingle their houses, from their dislike of the insects and vermin which the
                    troolie and plantain leaves harbour. The government-house and colonial offices
                    are built of brick, in the European style, and with considerable pretensions to
                    architectural taste and magnificence.</p>
                <p>Before Berbice surrendered to the British, in 1796, almost all the plantations
                    were at a distance from the coast, considerably up the banks of the Berbice and
                    the Canje; but within a very short time after the colony came into our
                    possession, the plantations were greatly extended. The west coast was first
                    cultivated; and, in the year 1799, that to the eastward of the river Berbice, as
                    far as the Devil’s Creek, was cleared and cultivated. This part was surveyed and
                    cut into two parallel lines of estates, with a navigable canal between them for
                    the convenience of watercarriage. Behind the second row of estates runs the
                    river Canje, both the banks of which are cultivated with sugar, coffee, and
                    plantains. The estates are distinguished as follows: those on the line facing
                    the sea are the coast estates; the second line consists of the canal estates;
                    and the remainder are called the Canje estates. Besides these there are valuable
                    and extensive plantations on each side of the Berbice, stretching, as has been
                    already mentioned, nearly 300 miles from its mouth. The principal and most
                    valuable productions of the colony are sugar, coffee, cocoa, tobacco, cotton,
                    and the arnotta or roucou shrub. This last was, for a considerable time after
                    the settlement of the colony, cultivated almost exclusively by the Indians; they
                    macerated its seed in the juice of lemons, in which the gum of the manna-tree
                    had been dissolved, and thus obtained the celebrated Indian pigment, or crimson
                    paint, with which they adorned their bodies.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196855" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6855-0580"/>
                <p>The roucou is now cultivated by the Dutch and English planters as a dye-stuff.
                    Cotton thrives best on the coast estates, and it is on these therefore that it
                    is principally cultivated. The sugar plantations are esteemed the most
                    valuable.</p>
                <p>Agriculture, and all other labour in Berbice, is almost wholly performed by
                    negroes. It is estimated that, on an average, there are about 200 slaves,
                    calculated at the value of from L.50 to L.100 each, employed in producing
                    annually 140,000 cwts. of coffee, and 10,000 cwts∙ of cocoa. The Indians who
                    inhabit this part of the South American coast consist of four tribes; and from
                    these, particularly the tribe of the Arrowaucs, the inhabitants derive some
                    assistance, as a few of them reside on almost every plantation, and are employed
                    in various services, particularly in hunting and fishing. They have no animals
                    domesticated, nor any grain or roots, except the cassada, brought into
                    cultivation. A small species of deer, which somewhat resembles the hare, and the
                    armadillo, are their favourite food. They scald off the fur of the deer, cut the
                    body in pieces, and stew it in cassada juice, seasoning it very highly with
                    capsicum. The weapons they employ are the common bow and arrow, and the poisoned
                    arrow, which they blow from a tube. Their accuracy and skill in using both these
                    is surprising. With the common arrow, which is formed of a reed nearly six feet
                    long, they can hit a chicken with tolerable certainty at nearly 100 yards
                    distance. The poisoned arrow they can shoot from a tube of about seven feet in
                    length, to the distance of eight or ten yards, with great accuracy; and, at
                    twelve or fourteen feet distance, they seldom fail in striking the edge of a
                    penknife stuck on the back of a chair. The plants from which this poison is
                    extracted are not known.</p>
                <p>Mr Bolingbroke states that the negro population of Berbice was doubled within ten
                    years after it came into the possession of the English; and that, in 1805, it
                    amounted to about 40,000, besides 1000 free people of colour and 2500 whites.
                    From the papers relative to the British West Indies, ordered by the house of
                    commons to be printed in 1815, it appears that, in October 1811, the population
                    of Berbice must have decreased very considerably, if Mr Bolingbroke’s estimate
                    be correct, since at that time it consisted of,</p>

                    pounds of sugar made, a weightagetoll of about two per cent, on all imports and

                <p>And, in the year ending 5th January 1813, there were imported of sugar 9084
                    cwts.; and in 1828, 87,971 cwts. In 1809 the exportation of cocoa from the
                    colony amounted to 17,665 cwts., and in 1810 to 22,582 cwts. In the former year
                    the exportation of cotton was 1,874,195 lbs., and in the latter year 2,656,057
                    lbs.</p>
                <p>The colony of Berbice was founded in the year 1626, by a minister of Flushing, to
                    whose family, in 1678, it was granted as an hereditary fief. Three fourths of
                    it, however, were, not long afterwards, given to Van Hoorn and Company, in
                    consequence of their discharging a heavy contribution levied on the colony by
                    some French privateers. The new proprietors, being allowed by the Dutch East
                    India Company to import a certain number of negroes annually from Africa, and
                    obtaining other privileges, greatly extended the cultivation of sugar, cocoa,
                    and indigo; but they were restricted from exporting the produce of their
                    plantations to any port not within the province of Holland. In 1763 an
                    insurrection happened among the slaves of Berbice, which was quelled chiefly by
                    the assistance of the Indians and the English from Barbadoes. In 1796 the colony
                    capitulated to the British, but it was restored to the Dutch by the peace of
                    Amiens. In 1803 it was again reduced, and its possession was confirmed to
                    Britain by the peace of Paris. In consequence of the lords of the treasury
                    learning that the loss of slaves on the crown estates from the year 1803 to 1810
                    had been at the rate of 26 per cent., they appointed, in 1811, commissioners for
                    the management of these estates, who were especially directed and empowered to
                    maintain and protect the negroes, and to reward and encourage industry among
                    them.</p>
                <p>By an act of the British parliament, passed in the 56th of George III. (1816),
                    cap. 91, Berbice is placed on the same footing in relation to the regulations of
                    trade as the British West India Islands. The subjects of the king of the
                    Netherlands, who are proprietors in Berbice, may import into it from the
                    Netherlands the usual articles of supply for their estates, but not for trade;
                    but wine imported for the use of their estates pays a duty of 10s. per tun. The
                    Dutch proprietors may export their produce, but not to Britain; both exports and
                    imports must be made in ships belonging to the Netherlands; the duties are the
                    same as those payable by British proprietors.</p>
