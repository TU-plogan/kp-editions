                <p><label type="entry">BOGOTA, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Santa Fe de
                    Bogota</hi></label>, the capital of the republic of Colombia, in South America,
                    is situated in the department of Cundinamarca, in west longitude 78° 30' and
                    north latitude 4° 6', on an elevated plain or tableland, forming part of the
                    eastern ridge of the cordillera of the Andes, which separates the extensive
                    valley traversed by the river Magdalena from those boundless and fertile plains
                    that are watered by the Meta, the Casanare, and the numerous other large rivers
                    which flow to the eastward to augment the waters of the majestic Orinoco.</p>
                <p>The plain of Bogota has been estimated at about sixty miles in length from north
                    to south, and thirty miles <pb break="no" facs="nls:193198831"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-8831-0732"/>in breadth from east to west. It is surrounded on
                    all sides by lofty mountains, but more especially to the eastward, where the
                    summits of Chingaso and the Paramo de la Suma Paz are conspicuous for their,
                    elevation. No part of this chain, however, has been found to exceed in height
                    14,000 feet above the level of the sea, and consequently in these latitudes it
                    does not reach the limits of perpetual snow. The mountains which bound it in
                    other directions are much less elevated; and over those to the westward may be
                    seen, in the distance, the snowy summits of the more elevated mountains which
                    constitute the central ridge of the cordillera.</p>
                <p>Throughout its whole extent this plain exhibits evident marks, in the perfect
                    level of its surface, the alluvial nature of the soil, and the appearance of the
                    insulated rocks which rise up in some parts of its extent, of having formerly
                    been the site of an extensive lake. It is traversed by the river Fιmzha or
                    Bogota, which, collecting into one channel the numerous mountain-streams that
                    water the valley, bends its course to the south-western extremity of the plain,
                    and enters a narrow channel, from which it is precipitated over a perpendicular
                    precipice of 600 feet in height, into the valley of the Magdalena, forming the
                    magnificent fall of Tequendama. This splendid cataract is an object of wonder
                    and admiration to all beholders. The fall forms one continued sheet of water,
                    interrupted only a little at its upper part by a projecting ledge of rocks. So
                    great is the diffusion of water in the surrounding atmosphere, in the form of
                    rain or haze, that a perpetual humidity prevails; and the vegetation in the
                    immediate vicinity exhibits an uncommon degree of vigour and luxuriance. The
                    contrast of the vegetation at the summit, where oaks, and elms, and other trees
                    of temperate climes are found, and that at the bottom, where the graceful palms
                    abound, is very remarkable, and cannot be altogether accounted for solely by the
                    difference of level. The evaporation at the fall must be very great, as the
                    volume of water which issues from the bottom of the valley towards the Magdalena
                    is much smaller than at the summit, where the river leaves the plain of Bogota.
                    In various parts of the plain, from the great equality of its surface, the banks
                    of the river are to a considerable extent inundated, and so marshy, that,
                    especially in the rainy season, they cannot be passed without difficulty. These
                    situations have bccome favourite habitations to great numbers of ducks and other
                    water-fowl, which afford excellent amusement to the sportsman, and even exercise
                    the ingenuity of the Indians. The latter have a novel mode of catching them:
                    they enter these grounds wearing caps made of rushes, which conceal their heads,
                    the only part of their bodies above the water; they then move slowly and with
                    caution to the places occupied by the ducks, which,being accustomed to witness
                    similar caps floating about, are wholly unconscious of the near approach of
                    their insidious enemies, and allow themselves to be seized by the feet, and
                    secured to a girdle worn by the Indian.</p>
                <p>Could the opening at Tequendama, through which the river Bogota now escapes, be
                    closed up by artificial means, the whole extent of the plain would be converted
                    into one continuous lake, as appears to have been the case in former times; for
                    the change which has been produced, and which has rendered so great an extent of
                    soil useful to man, has without doubt been occasioned by the agency of the
                    river, whose waters, by constant attrition during a series of ages, have
                    eventually been able to overcome the rocky barrier opposed to their progress,
                    and have hollowed out the deep channel through which the river now precipitates
                    itself into the abyss beneath; and, from our knowledge of the laws which
                    regulate the economy of nature, we may anticipate that the same causes will in
                    time to come still more effectually drain the plain of Bogota. The traditions of
                    the aborigines tend to confirm the view which is now taken of the ancient
                    condition of this plain; but, ignorant of the extensive operation of those
                    natural causes which are known to us, they ascribed the whole to supernatural
                    agency, and have handed down a legend, setting forth, that an aged man of great
                    power and wisdom, named Bochica, broke down, by means of his powerful arm, a
                    passage through the rocks which inclose the valley at Tequendama, and formed the
                    outlet by which he drained the adjacent plain; and that having accomplished
                    this, he taught the inhabitants of the country to build cities and villages, and
                    introduced among them those habits of industry, civilization, and religion,
                    which were found to exist at the time when the country was discovered by
                    Europeans.</p>
                <p>This extensive plain is exceedingly fertile, and susceptible of the highest
                    cultivation. It produces abundant crops of wheat, barley, and the leguminous
                    plants cultivated in Europe. Of the former the average produce is five quarters
                    per acre; and of all these, owing to the regular succession of the rainy and dry
                    seasons, two crops may be obtained from the same field in one year; a practice,
                    however, which is not usually followed with the cerealia, as these require the
                    alternation of green crops, to prevent the fertility of the soil becoming too
                    much exhausted. Lucerne is also cultivated to a great extent, and affords ample
                    sustenance to numerous flocks of sheep and herds of cattle and horses, which are
                    reared and maintained on this plain for the supply of the capital. Before the
                    conquest of the Spaniards, the plain of Bogota maintained a numerous population
                    , but the inhabitants who at present reside on it, and are occupied in
                    agricultural pursuits, are few in number compared with those who are requisite
                    to give full development to its fertility and resources. Its immediate vicinity
                    to a populous city, where there is a ready market for all its produce, presents
                    very powerful inducements to the establishment of industrious and intelligent
                    agriculturists; and, doubtless, many such, from Europe and elsewhere, will ere
                    long find their way to so inviting a situation.</p>
                <p>The plain of Bogota, according to the observations of <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> Humboldt, has an elevation of 8694 feet above the level of the sea; and
                    consequently, although so near the equator, it enjoys a mild and equable
                    climate, the inhabitants experiencing a kind of perpetual spring, and the
                    extremes of heat and cold being seldom felt. In consequence of the sun being
                    twice perpendicular at nearly equidistant periods during the year, there are two
                    winter or rainy seasons, and two summer or dry seasons every year, each being of
                    about three months continuance; the rainy season commencing about the equinoxes,
                    and continuing during the months of March, April, and May, and again during
                    September, October, and November; and the dry seasons beginning with the
                    solstices, and continuing during the intermediate months. Even during the winter
                    months the rains are not continuous, but generally the mornings are cool and
                    exceedingly agreeable, the rain usually commencing towards the afternoon. The
                    range of the thermometer averages at this season from fifty-eight to sixty-three
                    degrees, but sometimes descends as low as forty-seven degrees, of Fahrenheit.
                    During the summer months, however, there is almost constantly a serene and
                    unclouded sky, with so little dew during the night that it scarcely incommodes
                    the inhabitants who venture out during that period. At this season the average
                    height of the thermometer is from sixty-eight to seventy degrees in the shade. A
                    climate so delicious is found very conducive to the enjoyment of health, and few
                    places within the tropics present so desirable a place of residence. Here those
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193198844" xml:id="kp-eb0704-8844-0733"/> insects and
                    venomous reptiles which occasion so much annoyance in the neighbouring districts
                    of less elevation are altogether unknown; and the females who inhabit this plain
                    possess a freshness of complexion unknown to those who dwell in less favoured
                    parts of the country. Yet, with all these advantages, the period of human
                    existence does not appear to be in general so long protracted in this country as
                    in more rigorous climates; old age comes on at a less advanced period of life;
                    and females, who reach maturity at an early age, exhibit the symptoms of decay
                    at a period when women in England are in the full enjoyment of all their
                    physical and intellectual faculties.</p>
                <p>Owing to its great elevation, the rarefaction of the atmosphere is so
                    considerable, that strangers, on their first arrival at Bogota, are generally
                    affected with a degree of oppression and difficulty of breathing; but this, in
                    most instances, gradually disappears on their becoming longer residents. Here,
                    epidemic diseases are altogether unknown. Travellers, however, who proceed to
                    Bogota by the Magdalena are not unfrequently attacked, on their arrival, with
                    intermittent fevers; but there is every reason to believe that the causes which
                    give rise to this complaint have been in operation during the period of their
                    navigating that river.</p>
                <p>The mountains encircling the table-land of Bogota are replete with many valuable
                    mineral productions, which must tend greatly to augment the wealth and
                    prosperity of its inhabitants whenever circumstances shall favour the more
                    complete development of these and the other natural resources of the country.
                    Coal in considerable quantities has been discovered near Guatavita, the fall of
                    Tequendama, and other places in these mountains; but hitherto this valuable
                    mineral has been extracted in small quantities for the use of the blacksmith
                    alone; yet the coal, and the iron, which is also found in these mountains, seem,
                    by their abundance, calculated to produce a powerful influence over the habits
                    and destinies of this favoured region; though they cannot prove of much value
                    until the formation of good roads, and the introduction of improved methods of
                    working them, shall lay open these hidden treasures to the use of man.</p>
                <p>Abundance of excellent salt is obtained from the mines of Zipaquira, Tauza, and
                    Enemocon, and the saline springs at Yousa, which have hitherto supplied the
                    inhabitants of all the mountainous parts of Colombia with this important and
                    necessary article. The quantities, however, which have hitherto been produced
                    have proved quite inadequate to the demand, and, in consequence of the operose
                    and expensive mode by which it is obtained, the profits of the undertaking have
                    been inconsiderable; the same methods having been followed, until within these
                    few years, as were originally practised by the Indians. A proposal was made some
                    years ago, by an English gentleman named Thomson, to place these establishments
                    on an improved and more productive footing, and his scheme received the sanction
                    of the government of Colombia; but, owing to some mismanagement on the part of
                    those concerned, it would appear that the undertaking has been abandoned. The
                    salt of these mines has been found to be precisely similar to the rock-salt of
                    Cheshire and other parts of Europe, and it is purified by the same method.
                    Amongst the mineral productions of the mountains surrounding Bogota might be
                    mentioned the celebrated emerald mines of Mozo, and various others of gold,
                    silver, and copper; but these will more properly come under consideration when
                    treating of the productions of’Colombia.</p>
                <p>The city of Santa Fe de Bogota was founded in 1538, by Gonzalez Ximenes de
                    Quesada, at the base of two mountains, which are known by the names of La
                    Guadalupe and Monteserrato. At first it consisted of only twelve houses, in
                    honour of the twelve apostles, and contained only sixty inhabitants; but, from
                    its favourable situation, it increased rapidly, and became a place of
                    considerable extent; and in two years afterwards it was raised to the rank of a
                    city, and eventually became the seat of government for the kingdom of New
                    Grenada. Its population in 1800 consisted of 21,464, exclusive of strangers and
                    temporary residenters; and in that year the number of births exceeded that of
                    deaths by 247. Its population was estimated at 30,000 in 1821, when, on the
                    union of New Grenada and Venezuela, to form the republic of Colombia, it became
                    the capital and the seat of government. By this event it has acquired much
                    additional importance, and so great has been the influx of natives and
                    foreigners, that the latest accounts estimate the numbers at upwards of 40,000
                    souls. The rapid increase of the population has already greatly enhanced the
                    value of houses and other property in the city and its vicinity. Nature indeed
                    seems to have pointed out the plain of Bogota as the most eligible situation
                    which can well be imagined for the formation of a great and opulent city, the
                    seat of government of a powerful nation. It enjoys a genial and salubrious
                    climate, in the midst of a fertile and abundant district; and it forms the
                    centre from which diverge to the north and to the east the two most extensive
                    lines of internal navigation to be found in Colombia.</p>
                <p>Bogota is only distant about twenty-two leagues from Honda, on the Magdalena; and
                    a good road was lately in progress between the capital and the Penon de Conejo,
                    on the banks of that river. Steam-vessels are also constantly passing to and
                    from Carthagena and Santa Martha, near the mouth of the Magdalena, by which
                    means the expense of carriage and of travelling has been greatly diminished, and
                    passengers suffer much less than heretofore from exposure to the noxious
                    influence of the climate; the time occupied in ascending that river being
                    shortened from about forty days to less than a fourth part of that time. The
                    distance from the sea to the point of disembarkation is about 540 miles. To the
                    eastward, by the Paso de la Cabulla, situated between the lofty mountains of
                    Chingaso and the Paramo de la Suma Paz, Bogota is distant only about fifteen
                    leagues from the Rio Negro, which is navigable to its junction with the Meta, a
                    river affording uninterrupted communication with the Orinoco; while the latter
                    opens up numerous channels of internal navigation, besides a free transit for
                    vessels of considerable size, to Angostura and to the Atlantic, being a line of
                    navigation from the point of embarkation near Bogota to the sea, of not less
                    than 1500 miles. Fully aware of the immense importance of opening up to commerce
                    so extensive a line of internal communication, the government of Colombia, some
                    years ago, took measures to place it on a permanent footing, and accordingly
                    granted to Colonel James Hamilton of the Colombian service the exclusive
                    privilege for ten years, under certain conditions, of navigating these rivers by
                    means of steam-vessels. This arrangement, however, was not finally acted upon,
                    as the steam-boats did not reach the country within the specified time, by which
                    means the privilege was forfeited, and the project suspended for a time. But on
                    reviewing the numerous important channels of internal navigation which
                    communicate with the Orinoco, little doubt can be entertained that this will ere
                    long become of even more importance than that line of communication which is now
                    established on the Magdalena. As the road from Bogota to the Rio Negro has
                    hitherto been of less immediate importance than that to the Magdalena, we
                    understand that little attention has as yet been paid by the authorities of the
                    country towards rendering it available for commercial <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193198857" xml:id="kp-eb0704-8857-0734"/>purposes. Notwithstanding all
                    the disadvantages of the bad roads which prevail throughout the whole country,
                    Bogota continues to be the best and most expeditious line of communication
                    between Europe and Quito, as well as the other southern provinces of the
                    republic. ∙ ∙ ‘</p>
                <p>On approaching Bogota from the Magdalena, the city is seen at a considerable
                    distance, the cathedral and the convents of Guadalupe and Monteserrato being the
                    most conspicuous objects in view. The latter are built on the summits of two
                    mountains having an elevation of about 2500, or, according to Hamilton, 2420,
                    feet above the city, which is built at their base. These mountains are ascended
                    by a very steep and difficult road; but the labour of the ascent is amply repaid
                    by the magnificent view which is presented to the eye of the spectator, of the
                    city, its convents and gardens, and the whole extent of the plain, with its
                    villages, its hamlets, and cultivated fields. The city itself is somewhat in the
                    form of an amphitheatre, and occupies a larger space than might seem requisite
                    for the number of its inhabitants. The convents, however, which are numerous,
                    together with their extensive gardens, comprise a considerable portion of it;
                    and the houses, on account of the earthquakes, are generally of but one story.
                    The cathedral, which was built in 1814, after the design of a Colombian
                    architect, possesses in its exterior very little architectural beauty: but its
                    interior is nevertheless fitted up with considerable taste and elegance; its
                    ornaments are rich and valuable; and the statue of the virgin, who is the patron
                    saint, is covered with a profusion of diamonds and other precious stones. The
                    convents, which were formerly numerous (about 33), and many of them richly
                    endowed, have of late years fallen into decay, and been devoted to the service
                    of government, and to other purposes very different from those for which they
                    were originally intended. According to the latest accounts, however, there are
                    still about nine convents and three nunneries occupied by religious persons, of
                    which the most wealthy and prosperous are those of Santo Domingo and San Juan de
                    Dios, to which latter there is attached an hospital for the reception of the
                    sick and wounded. This institution seems to have fallen somewhat into decay
                    about the period when Bogota became the seat of the republican government, for
                    it was then described as being conducted in a very inefficient and slovenly
                    manner; but later accounts inform us that it is now a very well regulated and
                    useful establishment, affording accommodation to several hundred inmates, who
                    are carefully attended by the friars, and plentifully supplied with every thing
                    requisite; besides which, food is here daily distributed to the poor. The
                    convent of San Francisco, although by the rule of that order possessed of
                    comparatively little wealth, is yet of great extent, and under good management;
                    and it contains many valuable paintings, the productions of Basquez, a native
                    artist of considerable merit, one of which, in particular, a Madonna with an
                    infant Jesus, has been mentioned in terms of high commendation.</p>
                <p>The university of Bogota was founded in 1610, since which time two colleges have
                    been endowed with large revenues for the purposes of education. The colleges are
                    now three in number, and in them are educated nearly all the youth of these
                    countries. The students wear caps and gowns, which, for the purposes of
                    distinction, are white in one college and red in the other. Before the
                    revolution, one of these colleges was appropriated solely for the education of
                    the young nobility, and the other for the sons of the middling classes; but
                    since that period all such distinctions have been abolished. Formerly the course
                    of study was confined to Latin, mathematics, natural and moral philosophy, and
                    theology; and even then the uni versity produced some men of great eminence for
                    their attainments in the natural sciences, among whom Mutis, Caldas, and Zea,
                    hold a distinguished place. Of late years great improvements have taken place in
                    the course of study, which has been regulated more in unison with the advanced
                    state of science and philosophy. Professors of eminence have been brought from
                    Europe; and a school of mineralogy has been established under the able auspices
                    of Dr Ribero, who, although a native of Peru, has enjoyed the advantage of being
                    educated at the best schools in Europe. Under his direction has also been formed
                    a national museum, which, in consequence of the zeal and activity of those
                    connected with it, has already made great progress. There has likewise been
                    formed in one of the colleges a public library, which was under the able
                    direction of Dr Jose Maria Esteves, and contained 12,000 volumes. Lancasterian
                    schools have been established in Bogota, in consequence of the judicious
                    regulations of the government of Colombia, which has provided for the formation
                    of such schools, not only in all the cities, but in every village and district
                    throughout the republic. Neither has the education of the female children been
                    neglected, as in former times; efficient means having been adopted for rescuing
                    this interesting portion of the community from that state of moral and
                    intellectual debasement in which they have so long been held. But still this
                    department is too much under the guidance of the nuns and the clergy, whose
                    limited acquirements and secluded habits render them by no means the most
                    eligible instructors for preparing youth for the active duties of life. The
                    revenues of the greater part of the monastic establishments, which were falling
                    into decay in consequence of the diminished number of their inmates, or the
                    increased intelligence of the people, have been devoted to the purposes of
                    education; and if administered with judgment and integrity, will form a
                    permanent fund, which may be productive of incalculable advantages in promoting
                    the future welfare of the country and its inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The mint is a large and handsome building, with ample accommodation for the
                    various officers employed in the establishment. The coining machinery is of
                    great strength and solidity, and all the departments are regulated with much
                    precision and minuteness. This is the only mint in the kingdom of New Grenada,
                    with the exception of that of Popayan; and we are informed by Humboldt, that
                    from 1789 to 1795, 8,161,862 dollars were coined at Santa Fe de Bogota, and from
                    1788 to 1794, 6,502,542 dollars∙in Popayan. At the commencement of the present
                    century, the following was the amount of coinage in New Grenada during four
                    years.</p>

                <p>After this period the coinage seems to have increased in amount, since in Santa
                    Fe de Bogota alone no less than 3,499,489 dollars were issued in 1806 and 1807.
                    We are not in possession of any details of the amount of coinage since the
                    country came under the management of the republican government.</p>
                <p>The palace where the viceroy of New Grenada formerly resided is a plain building
                    with a flat roof, having attached to it on each side other buildings, in which
                    are contained the public offices and the prison. The central building, which is
                    the residence of the vice-president of the republic, is devoid of ornament, and
                    possesses few of those conveniences that are considered essential in such <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193198870" xml:id="kp-eb0704-8870-0735"/> an establishment.
                    The apartments, however, are spacious, and the hall of audience is about
                    thirty-six feet in length by sixteen in breadth, and provided with sofas and a
                    throne, covered with crimson damask; but the lamps are suspended from the beams,
                    as it is destitute of ceiling, which gives the whole an unfinished appearance.
                    The places in which the senate and the house of representatives assemble have
                    little to recommend them besides their utility, being merely temporary places of
                    accommodation; a portion of the convent of Santo Domingo having been fitted up
                    for the former, and part of a private house for the latter. The private houses
                    are generally good, and for the most part of only one story, the rooms
                    communicating with each other, and likewise with an inner court or <hi
                    rend="italic">patio,</hi> in which are sometimes contained fountains and orange
                    trees. But of late years an improved and more convenient style of building has
                    been introduced, in consequence of the great influx of foreigners since the
                    establishment of their independence.</p>
                <p>The streets, as in almost all cities built by the Spaniards in South America, are
                    formed at right angles to each other; and all those extending from east to west
                    have a small stream of water flowing along them, a convenience which might tend
                    greatly to increase the comfort and cleanliness of the inhabitants, under an
                    improved system of police. Only a few of the principal streets are provided with
                    side pavements, such as the Calle Real and the Calle de San Juan de Dios, which
                    are the most frequented. The former, which extends from the great square or <hi
                    rend="italic">plaza</hi> to the bridge of San Francisco, contains handsome shops
                    and arcades, which are much frequented in rainy weather. There are four public
                    squares or <hi rend="italic">plazas</hi> provided with fountains, and five
                    handsome bridges over two small rivulets which traverse the city, enter the
                    Funzha, and are named San Francisco and San Augustin, from passing near the two
                    convents so named.</p>
                <p>A public market is held every Friday in the great square, where abundant supplies
                    of all kinds of provisions are exposed for sale, and where may be seen an
                    assemblage of all the varied classes which inhabit this country, the Creole, the
                    Mulatto, the Mestizo, the Indian, and the Negro. A considerable proportion of
                    the last are slaves; but the number in this degraded condition is gradually
                    diminishing, from the operation of those wise and beneficent laws which have
                    been enacted by the republican government for the gradual extinction of slavery.
                    The supplies of beef, mutton, and pork, are abundant and at moderate prices, but
                    of an inferior quality to that usually met with in England; which is attributed
                    to the defective method they follow in fattening their cattle for the market,
                    and in killing and cutting them up. Poultry and game are in great abundance, and
                    are moderate in price. Vegetables and fruit are also abundant, and in the utmost
                    variety; the vegetable productions of the tropical, the temperate, and even cold
                    regions, being all easily attainable, in consequence of the diversified
                    elevation of the surrounding country. Thus we find in one place quantities of
                    wheat, barley, and corn; in another maize, cocoa, and sugar; in a third,
                    quantities of cabbages, carrots, potatoes, and arracachas, intermingled with
                    tornatas, yuccas, and bananas; while apples, strawberries, peaches,
                    pomegranates, melons, ananas, agua-cates, pine-apples, chirimoyas, zapotas,
                    mangoes, and many other kinds of fruit, are found in equal profusion, and are
                    moderate in price. One part of the market-place is appropriated to the sale of
                    articles of native manufacture, which consist principally of coarse cotton and
                    woollen fabrics.</p>
                <p>The police of Bogota, and the lighting of the streets, are in a very neglected
                    state, and many disagreeable and disgusting sights may in consequence be
                    witnessed in the market-place, and most of the streets; while the office of
                    scavenger seems to be principally intrusted to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gal-linazos,</hi> a species of small black vulture <hi rend="italic">(vultur
                    aura),</hi> which may often be seen in great numbers, and are very tame. In the
                    vicinity of the river Funzha or Bogota, which is here an inconsiderable stream,
                    and runs close to the city, is situated the alameda or public promenade, which
                    is inclosed on each side by gardens, and shaded by rows of stately poplars. This
                    forms the favourite resort of the inhabitants during the delightful evenings of
                    summer; and the surrounding gardens afford a place of resort to such parties as
                    desire to solace themselves with the sweet notes of their favourite guitar.</p>
                <p>The society of Bogota is very agreeable, the inhabitants being mild, polite, and
                    cheerful. They are naturally fond of gaiety and amusements, as is evinced by the
                    frequency of their <hi rend="italic">tertulias,</hi> or evening parties, their
                    balls and concerts. The ladies are remarkably lively and pleasing in their
                    manners, and are for the most part short in stature, but delicately formed,
                    their feet and ancles being particularly small and handsome, which they set off
                    to great advantage by the neatness of their shoes and silk stockings. The
                    morning dress, in which they usually attend their devotions, consists of the <hi
                    rend="italic">saya</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mantilla,</hi> surmounted by a <hi
                    rend="italic">sombrero</hi> or broad-brimmed black beaver hat. The <hi
                    rend="italic">saga</hi> or skirt of black kerseymere or silk, variously
                    ornamented, fits closely to the body, and is well calculated to show off a fine
                    figure; the <hi rend="italic">mantilla</hi> covers the neck and shoulders, and
                    sometimes the head, and is kept close to the body by the folded arms. The dress
                    of the <hi rend="italic">beatas</hi> or female devotees is somewhat remarkable,
                    and merits notice. Those devoted to Nuestra Señora del Carmen “are generally,”
                    says a late writer, “young ladies, who on some occasion of sickness or peril,
                    either of their own or of some near relation, have vowed, in case of their
                    deliverance, to assume the habit of the Carmelite nuns for a year or a longer
                    period, as the case may be. The Carmelite habit, as worn at Bogota, consists of
                    a <hi rend="italic">saya</hi> of fine cloth or stuff of a reddish brown or fawn
                    colour, used by the nuns of that order, with a white hat, <hi rend="italic"
                    >mantilla,</hi> and shoes. Round the waist is bound a cord of twisted silk, in
                    imitation of the scourges carried by the nuns, but having tassels instead of
                    knots hanging from it. This dress is very becoming, for the fair ladies who
                    assume it do not think themselves obliged by their vow to imitate the nuns so
                    closely as to cut off their hair. This may perhaps account for the number of
                    youthful and generally pretty females who are to be seen wearing it, while the
                    dark-coloured habits of the other orders of San Francisco and La Señora de
                    Dolores are usually worn only by elderly devotees, and those whose admirers
                    would not be quite inconsolable were they to take the veil in earnest.” The
                    evening promenade dresses of the ladies are much more showy and diversified,
                    both in form and texture, than those which are worn in the early part of the
                    day, partaking a good deal of the fashions of Europe, which daily become more
                    prevalent; and at their balls and <hi rend="italic">tertulias</hi> they
                    frequently display the additional ornaments of a profusion of rich and valuable
                    jewels. They dance with much grace and elegance; and the favourite dances of the
                    country, among which may be noticed the Spanish <hi rend="italic"
                    >contra-danza,</hi> by its slow and graceful movements, is peculiarly well
                    calculated to exhibit to advantage the fine figures which they possess, in
                    common with most other women of Spanish origin. The females of the inferior
                    classes usually go without shoes or stockings, a practice which often forms a
                    striking contrast with the rest of their attire, which in many such cases is
                    both showy and expensive.</p>
                <p>The moral condition of the inhabitants of Bogota has: been variously estimated,
                    and perhaps in most instances ∣ incorrectly. The political state of the country
                    before <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193198883"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-8883-0736"/>the revolution was such as to afford little scope
                    for the exercise of the higher faculties; and consequently they were neither
                    remarkable for instances of atrocious crime on the one hand, nor of
                    extraordinary virtue on the other. But the eventful and exciting scenes of the
                    revolution have given rise to a development of character which shows that they
                    possess in a high degree those qualities which are calculated to raise them in
                    the scale of civilization. They are by no means deficient in natural abilities,
                    and they only require the advantage of an improved system of education, and
                    favourable circumstances, to acquire a high degree of cultivation.</p>
                <p>Previous to the revolution, the men, besides their ordinary occupations or
                    religious duties, had scarcely any other means of employing their leisure time
                    than by devoting themselves to gambling, cock-fighting, and bull-baiting. The
                    women, brought up in the most profound ignorance, and deeply imbued with all the
                    unmeaning superstitions which accompany a religion that only appeals to the
                    senses, devoted much of their time to their religious duties, and in attendance
                    on the numerous festivals and processions which the clergy kept so constantly
                    before them, well aware of the influence of pomp and circumstance over the
                    ignorant and the uneducated. Some have affirmed that the females are rather lax
                    in their morals, especially after marriage; and perhaps, if judged by the
                    standard of female morality in the more highly educated nations of the world,
                    they rhight lose by the comparison; yet this difference may with great justice
                    be attributed to the peculiar circumstances in which they have been placed. The
                    want of a good and efficient education, the demoralizing influence of some of
                    the religious practices there prevalent, and the comparatively little estimation
                    in which virtuous conduct in females has hitherto been held, have tended
                    materially to lower the tone of morals in the country. But a new epoch has at
                    length dawned upon them; efficient means have been adopted to promote education
                    and intelligence among all classes; and a purer system of ethics seems to be
                    gradually introducing itself into the country, as has been shown, among other
                    things, by the establishment of a Bible Society in Bogota, under the able
                    auspices of some of the most influential men of the country, and even aided by
                    the Catholic clergy themselves. (Humboldt, <hi rend="italic">Essai
