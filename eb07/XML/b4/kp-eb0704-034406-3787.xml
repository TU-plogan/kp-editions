                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BANFF</label>, the capital of Banffshire, is pleasantly
                    situated on the western bank of the river Deveron, at the point where it
                    discharges itself into the sea. The town is of great antiquity, and its erection
                    is traditionally ascribed to Malcolm Canmore. A charter was afterwards granted
                    in 1165 by William the Lion (Carte of Moray). Its former charters were confirmed
                    by Robert IL, on the 7th October 1372; and also by different succeeding
                    monarchs, down to the time of James VI., who granted charters in 1581 and 1592,
                    which are the latest held by the town. Banff was originally endowed with an
                    ample patrimony, but this was lost to the burgh by the rapacity of its
                    magistracy and the neighbouring proprietors, about the time of James VI., who
                    granted charters to enable them to feu and sell in perpetuity.</p>
                <p>The form of the town is irregular. The houses, with the exception of a few modern
                    structures, are old and incommodious; some of the streets are narrow and ill
                    paved; and no extension can be now expected, as it is hemmed in on all sides by
                    lands held in strict entail. The great north road passes through Banff, and
                    enters the town by a beautiful bridge across the Deveron. The accommodation for
                    religious instruction is ample; and there is an excellent academy, besides
                    several private and charity schools. The charitable foundations are also
                    extensive. The shipping interest has long been on the decline, particularly
                    since the peace with France; and all attempts to revive it, with the exception
                    of the Banff and London Shipping Company, at present very flourishing, have
                    failed. In 1815 a speculation in whale fishing was entered into, and a new
                    harbour projected, principally for the accommodation of the whale vessels; but
                    the harbour has been found useless as a place of safety. The old harbour is
                    quite safe, although of difficult access, and only fitted for the reception of
                    small craft. The exports are corn, cattle, pork, butter, herrings, salmon, and
                    other fish. The imports are merchant goods, coals, iron, staves, and other
                    articles necessary for the herring fishery. There are no manufactories of any
                    description within the town, although the place and near neighbourhood afford
                    many facilities for that purpose. A cast-iron foundery was, however, established
                    in 1825, which has hitherto proved very successful. The town was lighted with
                    gas in November 1b∙31.</p>
                <p>The lower part of the town was inundated by the great flood in 1829, and
                    considerable damage was done. Banff has a weekly market for provisions, a
                    monthly corn market, and four fairs annually. By the census of 1831, the po∙
                    pulation of the town and parish amounted to 3711. Banff is 46 miles N. W. from
                    Aberdeen, and 75 N. N. E. from Edinburgh. Long. 2. 32. W. Lat. 57. 40. 58.
