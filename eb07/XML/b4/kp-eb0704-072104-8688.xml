                <p><label type="entry">BOAT</label>, a small open vessel, propelled on the water by
                    oars or sails. The construction, machinery, and even <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193198701" xml:id="kp-eb0704-8701-0722"/>the names of boats, are very
                    different, according to the various purposes for which they are calculated, and
                    the services on which they are to be employed. Thus they are occasionally slight
                    or strong, sharp or flat-bottomed, open or decked, plain or ornamented; as they
                    may be designed for swiftness or burden, for deep or shallow water, for sailing
                    in a harbour or at sea, and for convenience or pleasure. The largest boat that
                    usually accompanies a ship is the <hi rend="italic">long-boat,</hi> which is
                    generally furnished with a mast and sails. Long-boats fitted for men of war are
                    occasionally decked, armed, and equipped, for cruising short distances against
                    merchant ships of the enemy, or smugglers, for impressing seamen, and other
                    services. The <hi rend="italic">barges,</hi> which are next in order, are
                    longer, slighter, and narrower. They are employed to carry the principal
                    sea-officers, as admirals and captains of ships of war, and are unfit for the
                    open sea. <hi rend="italic">Pinnaces</hi> exactly resemble barges, only that
                    they are somewhat smaller, and have never more than eight oars; whereas a barge
                    properly never rows less than ten. The <hi rend="italic">cutters</hi> of a ship
                    are broader, deeper, and shorter, than the barges and pinnaces; they are fitter
                    for sailing, and are commonly employed in carrying stores, provisions,
                    passengers, and the like, to and from the ship. In the structure of this sort of
                    boats the lower edge of every plank in the side overlays the upper edge of the
                    plank below, which is called by ship-wrights clink-work. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Yawls</hi> are something less than cutters, nearly of the same form, and used
                    for similar services. They are generally rowed with six oars. The above boats
                    more particularly belong to men of war, as merchant-ships have seldom more than
                    two, a long-boat and yawl; when they have a third, it is generally calculated
                    for the countries to which they trade, and varies in its construction
                    accordingly. Merchant-ships employed in the Mediterranean find it more
                    convenient to use a <hi rend="italic">launch,</hi> which is longer, flatter in
                    the bottom, and better adapted every way to the harbours of that sea, than a
                    long-boat. A <hi rend="italic">wherry</hi> is a light, sharp boat, used in a
                    river or harbour for carrying passengers from place to place. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Punts</hi> are a sort of oblong flat-bottomed boats, nearly resembling floating
                    stages. They are used by ship∙wrights and caulkers, for breaming, caulking, or
                    repairing a ship’s bottom. A <hi rend="italic">moses</hi> is a very fiat, broad
                    boat, used by merchant-ships among the Caribbee Islands, to bring hogsheads of
                    sugar off from the sea beach to the shipping which are anchored in the roads. A
                    <hi rend="italic">felucca</hi> is a strong passage-boat used in the
                    Mediterranean, and propelled with oars like sweeps. The natives of Barbary often
                    employ boats of this sort as cruisers.</p>
