                <p><label type="entry">BASILICA</label>, rα BaΛλ∕κa, in the history of
                    jurisprudence, a name given to a digest of laws, commenced by the emperor
                    Basilius, and completed by his son Leo the philosopher. This collection,
                    according to some, received the title of Basilica in honour of the emperor
                    Basilius; while others think that it was so denominated from the circumstance of
                    its containing <hi rend="italic">βa&lt;iιλ∣xaς διατάζεις</hi> or imperial
                    constitutions. It was begun by Basilius in the year 867, and completed by Leo in
                    the year 880; the former having carried the work as far as forty books, and the
                    latter having added twenty more, in which state it was published. In 911 Leo was
                    succeeded by his son Constantinus Porphyrogennetus, from whom the Basilica
                    received their final revision, <hi rend="italic">τr</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">ν τsλευτα∣αv αναχαόαξ&amp;ιν</hi>; and the
                    amended edition is supposed by Heimbach to have appeared about the year 945.
                    Opinions, however, are divided as to whether the work has descended to us in the
                    state in which it was first published by Leo, or according to the revised and
                    improved edition of Constantine. Brunquell thinks that we possess the Basilica
                    in the amended form; but Hoffmann considers this opinion doubtful, andhis
                    suspicionshave been confirmed by the subsequent investigations of Heimbach. In
                    the West, the Basilica never obtained the force of law; and the chief value of
                    the collection therefore consists in the illustration it furnishes of the
                    Justinianean body of law from which it was mostly compiled; but in this respect
                    its utility has long been understood and acknowledged. Four complete books of
                    the Basilica, namely, the forty-fifth, forty-sixth, forty-seventh, and
                    forty-eighth, and fragments of two others, the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth,
                    were published at Paris in 1557, accompanied with a Latin version, by Gentianus
                    Hervetus. In 1566, Cuja* cius published, at Lyons, a Latin version of the
                    sixtieth <pb break="no" facs="nls:193194866" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4866-0427"/>book,
                    which is of great length. And the different portions' which had thus been edited
                    were collected by Dionysius Gothofredus, and printed at Hanau in 1598 and 1606.
                    But the more extensive and complete edition of Fabrot, which appeared at Paris
                    in 1647, superseded these imperfect publications, and proved of great service to
                    the study of ancient jurisprudence. It is contained in seven volumes folio, and
                    accompanied with a Latin version of the text as well as of the Greek scholia
                    subjoined. Of the sixty books which composed this great work Fabrot supposes
                    that he has exhibited forty-one in an entire form; but Meerrnan, Reitz, and
                    others, think that this estimate admits of some abatement. About a century after
                    the date of Fabrot’s edition, Reitz published four entire books of the Basilica,
                    namely, the forty-ninth, fiftieth, fifty-first, and fifty-second, which were
                    inserted in the fifth volume of Meerman’s <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus Juris
                    Civilis et Canonici,</hi> and, thirteen years afterwards, given to the world in
                    a separate form, accompanied with the commentaries (as edited by Ruhnken) of
                    Thalelaeus, Theodorus, Stephanus, Cyrillus, Gobidas, and other Greek lawyers on
                    the titles of the Pandects and Code <hi rend="italic">De Postulando sive de
                    Advocatis, nee non de Procuratoribus et Defensoribus.</hi> With regard to the
                    ancient <hi rend="italic">Glossae,</hi> which are not without their value, they
                    were first published by Labbé, and afterwards illustrated by Schulting and
                    Rover.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See a very
