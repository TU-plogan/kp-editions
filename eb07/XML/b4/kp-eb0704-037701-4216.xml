                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    distinguished anatomist, was born in Perthshire in 1760, and died at Edinburgh
                    in 1826. After the usual routine of parochial education, Dr <hi rend="subscript"
                    > ι</hi> Barclay was entered as a student at the United College of St Andrews,
                    where he distinguished himself as a classical scholar. He subsequently studied
                    divinity in the same university, and was licensed as a preacher by the
                    presbytery of Dunkeld. Having repaired to Edinburgh in 1789, as tutor to the
                    family of Sir James Campbell of Aberuchill, Dr Barclay began to give his
                    attention to the study of medicine, and particularly to anatomy, both human and
                    comparative. He became assistant to the late Mr John Bell, and took the degree
                    of doctor of physic in the university of Edinburgh in 1796, after having
                    defended an inaugural dissertation, <hi rend="italic">De Anima, seu Principio
                    Vitali.</hi> This subject seems very early to have engaged his attention; and
                    his last work, on <hi rend="italic">Life and Organization,</hi> in which his
                    views are more fully developed, affords a proof of the continued <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193194229" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4229-0378"/>assiduity with which Dr
                    Barclay prosecuted his inquiries in this interesting field of research.</p>
                <p>Immediately after his graduation, having determined, it is believed somewhat
                    suddenly, to come forward as a teacher of anatomy, he repaired to London, and
                    studied for some time under the late Dr Marshall of Thavies Inn, at that time a
                    very distinguished teacher of anatomy in the metropolis.</p>
                <p>Soon after his return from London, Dr Barclay commenced his lectures on anatomy
                    in Edinburgh in November 1797; and by his punctual attention to his engagements,
                    and assiduous devotion to the instruction of his pupils, he speedily attracted a
                    respectable audience, which continued gradually to increase in numbers until the
                    period of his retirement, a short time before his death.</p>
                <p>Of Dr Barclay’s professional writings, the earliest, we believe, was the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Physiology,</hi> which he furnished for the third edition
                    of this work.</p>
                <p>In 1803, six years after he commenced his career as a teacher, Dr Barclay
                    attempted a reform in the language of anatomy, with a view to render it more
                    accurate and precise; a task for which his acquirements as a classical scholar
                    rendered him peculiarly fit. Although the <hi rend="italic">Nomenclature</hi>
                    which he published upon that occasion has not yet been generally adopted, we
                    believe that the profession, with one voice, acknowledges the importance of the
                    object which he had in view, and the talent and learning with which it was
                    executed. Some of his illustrations of the defects in the existing language of
                    anatomy, particularly in the terms expressive of position and aspect, were
                    peculiarly striking, and highly characteristic of his overflowing humour. “The
                    terms <hi rend="italic">above, below, behind,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >before”</hi> he used to observe, “would be sufficiently definite if the body
                    were uniformly to preserve the same position; and so,” said he, “would be the
                    expression in Hudibras, where the author makes Crowdero apply a squeaking-engine
                    to the <hi rend="italic">north-east</hi> side of his neck; this would be
                    sufficiently definite if one could ascertain, by compass, in what particular
                    position the fiddler stood.”</p>
                <p>His next work, published in 1808, was a <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the
                    Muscular Motions of the Human Body,</hi> calculated to encourage a more
                    attentive study of the simple and combined actions of the muscles, with a view
                    to a more scientific and successful treatment of fractures and luxations; a
                    department of surgery which, even now, although illustrated by his distinguished
                    friend Sir Astlcy Cooper, can scarcely be said to be rescued from those popular
                    prejudices under which it has so long laboured.</p>
                <p>In 1812 Dr Barclay published the first edition of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Description of the Arteries of the Human Body;</hi> a work displaying much
                    acute observation and laborious research, and which may perhaps be considered
                    the most practically useful of all his writings. The labour which this work must
                    have cost him may be judged of by the fact, that he wrote no description of any
                    artery until he had studied its delineation, as given by Haller, and every other
                    standard authority, and until he had actually examined its course and
                    distribution in every preparation to which he had access; in some instances
                    repairing to Glasgow to examine the excellent collection of vascular
                    preparations then in the possession of his friend Mr Allan Burns.</p>
                <p>His last publication, completed only a few years before his death, was <hi
                    rend="italic">An Inquiry into the Opinions, Ancient and Modern, concerning Life
                    and Organization;</hi> a work replete with learning and original criticism, and
                    well calculated to check the progress of those idle and dangerous speculations
                    by which some of our modern philosophers have been distinguished. This, like all
                    his former publications, is dedicated to Dr Ihomas Thomson, professor of
                    chemistry in the university of Glasgow, one of the earliest and most
                    distinguished of his numerous friends.</p>
                <p>These several works, which afford such remarkable proofs of the inexhaustible
                    energies of Dr Barclay’s mind were undertaken and completed amidst the incessant
                    and laborious toils which his courses of anatomical lectures necessarily imposed
                    upon him. Of these he gave two very full ones every winter, commencing each of
                    them early in November, and terminating at the end of April. For several years
                    previous to his death he had also given a course of comparative anatomy during
                    the summer months. To this branch of study Dr Barclay had always shown a marked
                    partiality, not only as an object of scientific research, but of great practical
                    utility. He pressed upon the Highland Society of Scotland, of which he was a
                    distinguished member, the propriety of giving encouragement to the study of
                    veterinary medicine; and to him, in conjunction with his friend Mr Robert
                    Johnston, the public is chiefly indebted for the establishment of the-veterinary
                    school, so successfully conducted by his pupil Mr Dick, under the auspices of
                    the liberal and patriotic body above mentioned.</p>
                <p>At the period of his death Dr Barclay was engaged in revising and preparing for
                    the press his introductory lectures, which have since been published, and
                    contain a valuable abridgement of the history of anatomy.</p>
                <p>His successful progress as a teacher of anatomy Dr Barclay always gratefully
                    attributed, in a great measure, to the patronage which, at an early period, he
                    received from the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh; and to that learned
                    and public-spirited body he bequeathed his anatomical collection, now known as
                    the Barclayan Museum, which contains many valuable specimens in comparative
                    anatomy, and some of the finest vascular preparations which are anywhere to be
                    found. <hi rend="smallcaps">(q. q.)</hi></p>
