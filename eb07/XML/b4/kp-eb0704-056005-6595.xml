                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BENARES</label>, a large and valuable district of Hindostan,
                    in the province of Allahabad, situated on both sides of the river Ganges,
                    between the 23d and 27th degrees of N. latitude. It contains 1200 square miles
                    of fertile soil, which produces grain, chiefly barley, wheat, several species of
                    the pea, and some rice; besides sugar, indigo, and opium. The air is so cold
                    during the winter as to render fires necessary; but for three months after March
                    it becomes so heated, by the setting in of the hot winds, as to destroy all
                    verdure. It is exceedingly populous and well cultivated, its inhabitants being
                    Hindoos, and well versed in the arts. The country from Patna to Buxar, Gazypoor,
                    Benares, and Mirzapoor, is rich and highly cultivated; while the numerous clumps
                    of mango trees give the district the appearance of a forest, and afford shelter
                    to the cattle. The country is well watered. The principal rivers are the Ganges,
                    the Goomty, the Caramnassa, and the Soane, the two latter being the boundary
                    rivers. Tissues, brocades, and ornamented gauzes, are manufactured throughout
                    the province, and in the northern parts plain and flowered muslins, adapted to
                    common uses; baftas are also fabricated in the western, and sanaes in the
                    eastern part of the province. The district furnishes a proportion of the
                    company’s opium. The chief towns are Benares, Mirzapoor, Jionpoor, Chunar, and
                    Gazypoor. In answer to some queries circulated by the Marquis Wellesley in 1801,
                    the population was returned at 3,000,000, and the proportion of Hindoos to
                    Mahommedans was as five to one. The Bengal code of regulations has been
                    extended, with little alteration, to the district of Benares. The Brahmins,
                    however, in consideration of their high character, have received some special
                    indulgence in the mode of proceeding against them on criminal charges; and, when
                    they are convicted of a capital offence, the punishment of death is commutable
                    into transportation at the discretion of the government. Many of their criminal
                    practices, however, such as holding out a threat of avenging themselves on their
                    adversaries by suicide, or by the murder of one of their own children, have been
                    subjected to the usual course of punishment by law. Another tribe of Hindoos,
                    among whom.it was customary to destroy their female infants, are also subjected
                    to trial and punishment for murder. Cheit Sing, who ruled over this zemindary in
                    1770, was expelled in 1781 by the British, who since this period have had
                    possession of the country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Benares,</hi> an extensive and opulent city of Hindostan, in
                    the province of Allahabad, is the capital of the Benares district. It has long
                    been celebrated among the Hindoos as a seat of piety and learning, as well as a
                    noted emporium of trade. The Ganges here forms a fine sweep of about four miles
                    in length, and the city is situated on the northern bank of the river, and on
                    the outward side of the curve, which is the most elevated. It is about four
                    miles in length by two in breadth, and it rises from the river in an
                    amphitheatrical form, thickly studded with domes and minarets. The bank of the
                    river is entirely lined with stone, in which are many very fine ghats or landing
                    places, built by pious devotees, of large stones, to the height of thirty feet
                    before they reach the level of the street, and highly ornamented. These are
                    generally crowded with bathers and worshippers. ' <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    Shrines and temples, even within the limits of the river’s rise, almost line its
                    banks. The streets of this great city are so winding and narrow that there is
                    not room for a wheel carriage to pass; and it is difficult to penetrate them
                    even on horseback. The streets are considerably lower than the ground-floors of
                    the houses, which have mostly arched rows in front, with little shops behind
                    them; and above these they are richly embellished with verandas, galleries,
                    projecting oriel windows, and very broad overhanging eaves supported by carved
                    brackets. The houses are built of a very good stone from Chunar, and are mostly
                    lofty, none being less than two storeys in height, most of them three, and
                    several of five or six storeys, close to each other, with terraces on the
                    summit, and extremely small windows, for the sake of coolness and to prevent
                    inspection. The Hindoos are fond of painting the outside of their houses of a
                    deep red colour, and of covering the most conspicuous parts with paintings in
                    gaudy colours of flower-pots, men, women, bulls, elephants, gods and goddesses,
                    in all the forms of Hindoo mythology. The number of temples is very great,
                    mostly small, and stuck like shrines in the angles of the streets, and under the
                    shadow of the lofty houses. Their forms are not ungraceful, and they are many of
                    them covered over with beautiful and elaborate carvings of flowers, animals, and
                    palmbranches, rivalling in richness and minuteness the finest specimens of
                    Gothic or of Grecian architecture.</p>
                <p>The mosque, which was built by Aurungzebe on the site of a Hindoo temple, and in
                    order to mortify the Hindoos, is a handsome building, placed on the highest and
                    most conspicuous point of land, and close to the river, lts minarets are very
                    lofty, and command an extensive view of the town and adjacent country, and of
                    the numerous Hindoo temples scattered over the city and the surrounding plains.
                    The Hindoo college at Benares is a large building, divided into two courts, with
                    galleries above and below. There are 200 scholars in this college, who learn
                    reading, writing, arithmetic, Persian, Hindoo law, and sacred literature;
                    Sanscrit; astronomy according to the Ptolemaic system, by which the sun is
                    supposed to revolve round the earth; and astrology.</p>
                <p>Benares having from time immemorial been a holy city, contains about 8000 houses
                    of Brahmins, who subsist by charitable contributions, although they have
                    property of their own. These houses are adorned with idols, and send out an
                    unceasing sound from all sorts of discordant instruments; while religious
                    mendicants from the numerous Hindoo sects, with every conceivable deformity
                    “which chalk, cow-dung, disease, matted locks, distorted limbs, and disgusting
                    and hideous attitudes of penance, can show, literally line the principal streets
                    on both sides.” Sonic are seen with their legs or arms distorted by long
                    continuance in one position; others with their hands clenched until the nails
                    have grown through at the back. A stranger, as he passes through the streets, is
                    saluted with the most pitiful exclamations from those swarms of beggars· But
                    besides this immense resort to Benares of poor [ grims from every part of India,
                    as well as from Thibet an the Burman empire, numerous rich individuals in the
                    decline of life, and almost all the great men who are disgraced<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193196608" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6608-0561"/> or banished from home by the
                    political revolutions which have been of late years so frequent among the Hindoo
                    states, repair to this holy city to wash away their sins in the sacred waters of
                    the Ganges, or to fill up their time with the gaudy ceremonies of their
                    religion. All these devotees give away large sums in indiscriminate charity,
                    some of them to the annual amount of L.8000 or L.9000; and it is the hope of
                    sharing in those pious distributions that brings together from all quarters such
                    a concourse of religious mendicants. Bulls are reckoned sacred by the Hindoo,
                    and being tame and familiar, they walk lazily up and down the streets, or are
                    seen lying across them, interrupting the passage, and are hardly to be roused,
                    as, in compliance with the prejudices of the fanatic population, they must be
                    treated in the gentlest manner. Monkeys, also held sacred, are seen clinging to
                    all the roofs and projections of the temple.</p>
                <p>But, amid all this wretchedness and fanaticism, Benares is a splendid, wealthy,
                    and commercial city; the bazars are filled with the richest goods, and there is
                    a constant bustle of business in all the principal streets. It is a great
                    commercial emporium for the shawls of the north, the diamonds of the south, and
                    the muslins of Dacca and the eastern provinces; and it has very considerable
                    manufactures of silk, cotton, and fine wool, as well as of gold and silver lace;
                    while English hardware, swords, shields, and spears from Lucknow and Monghyr,
                    and the finer manufactures of Europe, are exported to Bundelcund, Gorruckpoor,
                    Nepaul, and other tracts removed from the main channel of communication by the
                    Ganges. The inhabitants, according to a census made in 1803, amounted to above
                    582,000; and during religious festivals, the concourse of people from all parts
                    is immense. Yet the city, notwithstanding its crowded population and narrow
                    streets (the new market-place, constructed by the present government, being the
                    only square or open part in it), is not unhealthy; which is probably owing to
                    its dry situation on a high rocky bank, sloping towards the river, and to the
                    frequent ablutions and temperate habits of the people. There are but few
                    Europeans in Benares; a judge, collector, and register, with a few other civil
                    servants, constitute the whole of the company’s establishment; to which may be
                    added a few private merchants and planters. The residence of the English judge
                    and civil establishment is at Secrole, a pleasant village about two miles from
                    the city, where there is a military cantonment for a battalion of sepoys. The
                    Benares division of the court of circuit includes Mirzapoor, Allahabad,
                    Bundelcund, Jionpoor, Gorruckpoor, and the city of Benares. From Benares to
                    Calcutta by Birbhoom the travelling distance is 460 miles, by Moorshedabad 565,
                    from Allahabad 83, Buzar 70, Bareilly 345, Calpy 239, Kanoge 259 miles. Long.
