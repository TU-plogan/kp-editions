                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Beating</hi><hi rend="italic">the Wind,</hi> was a
                    practice in use in the ancient method of trial by combat. If either of the
                    combatants did not appear in the field at the time appointed, the other was to
                    beat the wind, or make so many flourishes with his weapon, by which he was
                    entitled to all the advantages of a conqueror.</p>

                    rend="italic">Music, a</hi> method of measuring and marking the time for
                    performers in concert, by a motion of the hand and foot up or down successively
                    and in equal times. Knowing the true time of a crotchet, and supposing die
                    measure actually subdivided into four crotchets, and the half-measure into two,
                    the hand or foot being up, if we put it down with the very beginning of the
                    first note or crotchet, and then raise it with the third, and then down with the
                    beginning of the next measure, this is called <hi rend="italic">beating the
                    time;</hi> and by practice a habit is acquired of making this motion very equal.
                    Each down and up is sometimes called a <hi rend="italic">time</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">measure.</hi> Beating time is denoted, in the Italian music, by
                    the term <hi rend="italic">a battuta,</hi> which is usually put after what they
                    call <hi rend="italic">recitativo,</hi> where little or no time is observed, to
                    denote that here they are to begin again to mark or beat the time exactly. The
                    Romans aimed at somewhat of harmony in the strokes of their oars, and had an
                    officer called <hi rend="italic">portisculus</hi> in each galley, whose business
                    it was to beat time to the rowers, sometimes by a pole or mallet, and sometimes
                    by his voice alone. The ancients marked the rhythm in their musical
                    compositions; but to make it more observable in practice, they beat the measure
                    or time, and this in different manners. The most usual method consisted in a
                    motion of the foot, which was raised from and struck alternately against the
                    ground, according to the modern method. This was commonly the province of the
                    master of the music, called <hi rend="italic">μίΰο- γο1ος</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">κοoυφα∣ος,</hi> because placed in the middle of the choir of
                    musicians, and in an elevated situation, in order to be more easily seen and
                    heard by the whole company. These beaters of measure were also called by the
                    Greeks m⅛ψopc⅛, because of the noise of their feet; the Latins denominated them
                    <hi rend="italic">pedarii, podarii,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pedicularii.</hi>
                    To make the beats or strokes more audible, their feet were generally shod with a
                    sort of sandals made of wood or iron, called by the Greeks κgoιmζ∕α, %govffaλα,
                    % <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> 'oυ^ra, and by the Latins <hi rend="italic"
                    >pedicula, scabella,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">scabilla,</hi> because resembling
                    little stools or footstools. The ancients also beat time or measure with shells,
                    as oyster shells and bones of animals, which they struck against one another,
                    much as the moderns now use castanets and similar instruments. Other noisy
                    instruments, as drums, cymbals, and citterns, were also used on the same
                    occasion. ∙</p>
