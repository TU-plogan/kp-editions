                <p><label type="entry">BERNOULLI</label>, a name illustrious in the annals of the
                    exact sciences, and belonging to a family of respectability, originally of
                    Antwerp. During the oppressive and bigoted government of Spain, when the
                    Flemings, like the expatriated Greeks with their stores of ancient learning,
                    carried their arts, industry, and genius, to the less enlightened portions of
                    Europe, this exiled family, driven from their liberties and soil for their
                    attachment to the reformed religion, sought first an asylum at Frankfort in
                    1583, and afterwards at Basel, where they ultimately obtained the highest
                    professional and civic distinctions. In the course of a single century not less
                    than eight of its members successfully cultivated different branches of the
                    mathematics, and by their personal labours contributed much to the extension of
                    science and to the diffusion of correct knowledge over a great portion of
                    Europe. The most celebrated of these distinguished men were James, John, and
                    Daniel; but, for the sake of perspicuity, it maybe proper to consider them
                    nearly in the order of family succession.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bernoulli,</hi><hi rend="italic">James,</hi> was born at
                    Basel on the 27 th December 1654. He was educated at the public school of Basel,
                    and, preparatory to his philosophical course in the university of the same city,
                    he received private instruction from the learned lexicorapher Hoffman, then
                    professor of Greek. At the conclusion of his philosophical studies, some
                    geometrical figures, which fell in his way, excited in him so ardent a passion
                    for mathematical pursuits, that it was not to be checked even by the opposition
                    and entreaties of his father, who wished him to be a clergyman. Like Pascal,
                    whom he also resembled in intensity of religious feeling, he applied himself in
                    secret to his favourite science, and by his unaided exertions became one of the
                    most distinguished mathematicians of his time. In these forbidden labours he
                    chiefly cultivated astronomy; while, with classic propriety, he chose for his
                    device Phaethon driving the chariot of the sun, with the motto, <hi
                    rend="italic">Invito patre sidera verso.</hi></p>
                <p>In the spring of 1676 he visited Geneva on his way to the south of France, and
                    subsequently extended his travels to England and Holland, without however
                    relinquishing the studies of his choice. While at Geneva he taught a blind young
                    lady several branches of science, and also how to communicate her ideas in
                    writing; and he afterwards gave to the public, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">A Method of teaching Mathematics to the Blind,</hi> an account of
                    the plan he had followed, which consisted in having recourse to the sense of
                    touch, instead of that of sight.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Dialling were constructed; and at London he had the happiness and advantage of
                    being introduced into the philosophical meetings of Boyle, Hooke, fillingfleet,
                    and other learned and scientific men worthy of the age of Newton.</p>

                    himself to physical and mathematical investigations; and, in order to make the
                    knowledge which he had acquired in travelling available, he opened a public
                    seminary for experimental physics or mechanical philosophy,<note anchored="true"

                    which, from the interest of the experiments and the eloquence of the lecturer,
                    became a source of attraction to his fellow-citizens. In the same year he
                    published his essay on comets, <hi rend="italic">Conamen novi systematis
                    Cometarum,</hi> occasioned by the appearance of the comet of 1680, which had
                    excited the attention of all the astronomers of Europe. This essay, and his next
                    publication, entitled <hi rend="italic">De Gravitate Aetheris,</hi> though both
                    deeply tinged with the philosophy of Descartes, contain some truths not unworthy
                    of the more correct philosophy of the <hi rend="italic">Principia.</hi> But
                    these, and several interesting papers in the <hi rend="italic">Journal des
                    Savans</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Acta Eruditorum</hi> of that period, were only
                    the preludes to greater labours and higher achievements.</p>
                <p>The pleasure which Pythagoras and Archimedes derived from their respective
                    discoveries, was perhaps as vividly felt by the discoverers of the differential
                    calculus. Newton and Leibnitz being independent discoverers, may be allowed to
                    have had an equal share in that refined pleasure, as well as an equal claim to
                    the merit of an invention which forms an epoch in mathematical science. But
                    James Bernoulli, having had both the aid of his younger brother John, and the
                    perusal of Leibnitz’s new method of tangents and of maxima and minima,
                    previously published in the Leipsic Transactions,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis, itemque
                    Tangentibus, quae nec fractas nec irrationales quantitates moratur, et singu-

                    rend="italic">Act. Εrud.</hi> 1G84.</p></note> cannot be strictly called an
                    independent discoverer; but, from his extensive and successful application of
                    the calculus, he is well deserving of a place by the side of Newton and
                    Leibnitz. As an additional claim of merit, he was the first to solve Leibnitz’s
                    problem of the isochronous curve, and to determine a curve mistaken by Galileo
                    for a parabola—the catenarian <hi rend="italic">(fa chainette)</hi> or the curve
                    formed by a chain suspended by its two extremities, and which he also showed to
                    be the same as the curvature of a sail filled with wind. This curve, though
                    proposed at first as a trial of Leibnitz’s skill, is of much practical utility
                    in regard to the nature of arches, and particularly of those of suspension.</p>
                <p>These inquiries, like step following step, led to another interesting and useful
                    curve, which, from being formed by an elastic plate or rod fixed at one end and
                    bent by a weight applied to the other, he called the elastic curve, and which he
                    also showed to be the same as the curvature of an impervious sail filled with a
                    fluid such as water. In his investigations respecting cycloidal lines and
                    different spiral curves, his attention was particularly directed to the
                    loxodromic and logarithmic spirals; and his discoveries regarding the last,
                    which possesses the remarkable property of reproducing itself under a great
                    variety of conditions, induced him afterwards to make it the monument of his
                    labours and the emblem of his hopes.</p>
                <p>Whether in the frailty of envying the scientific honours of his younger brother,
                    or in the better spirit of noble emulation, which then urged the torch of truth
                    into brighter animation, he proposed to geometers in general, and to his brother
                    in particular, the famous problem of isoperimetrical figures, with a promised
                    reward for its solution. This problem engaged the attention of the British as
                    well as continental mathematicians; and however little we may be prepared to
                    expect such a result in the calm researches of abstract truth, it gave rise to a
                    most unfortunate family quarrel. His brother John’s solution being too hasty,
                    and not quite satisfactory, a discussion arose, which, after much altercation,
                    became a lasting feud, to be ended only by death.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197011" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7011-0592"/>
                <p>As the reward of merit, the mathematical chair of the university of Basel, vacant
                    by the death of the learned Megerlin, had been conferred upon James not long
                    after his return from his travels; and, in the discharge of the duties of his
                    office he was so successful as to attract students from foreign parts, and to
                    have pupils who became afterwards professors in some of the most celebrated
                    universities of Germany. He was once made rector of the distinguished university
                    of which he was a member, and he had other honourable distinctions bestowed on
                    him. He and his brother John were the first two foreign associates of the
                    academy of sciences at Paris; and, at the earnest request of the discriminating
                    Leibnitz, they were both made members of the academy of Berlin. His fame, too,
                    was increased by his posthumous work <hi rend="italic">De Arte Conjectandi,</hi>
                    which embraces the application of the doctrine of probabilities to moral,
                    political, and economical subjects.</p>
                <p>Three years previous to his official appointment at Basel, he had been offered a
                    professorship at Heidelberg; but his union with an accomplished lady of his
                    native city led him to decline the invitation. In this marriage he was happy;
                    but his family, consisting of a son and daughter, though highly respectable in
                    life, possessed little of the characteristic genius of their father. Intense
                    application brought on infirmities, and a slow fever, of which he died on the
                    16th of August 1705, with all the resignation of a Christian, and all the
                    firmness of a philosopher. Like another Archimedes he requested, previous to his
                    death, that the logarithmic spiral should be engraven on his tombstone, with
                    these words, <hi rend="italic">Eadem mutata resurgo;</hi> elegantly alluding, by
                    the properties of the curve, to the Christian’s hope of the resurrection of the
                    body.</p>
                <p>In James Bernoulli were united many of the highest powers of the understanding
                    with some of the best qualities of the heart. From a regard to truth he chose
                    rather to be silent than eloquently wrong; and in religion he was equally
                    removed from superstition and from free-thinking. With a bilious temperament,
                    inducing that “philosophic melancholy” which is so often the attendant of true
                    genius, his mind was peculiarly marked by elegance and simplicity, and by
                    retentiveness rather than quickness. Like Plato, he combined the elegant
                    exercises of the imagination with the more severe labours of the understanding;
                    poetry with mathematics, and eloquence with philosophy.<note anchored="true"

                    fame now rests. These are, 1. Jacobi Bernoulli Basiliensis Opera, Genevae, 1744,

                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bernoulli,</hi><hi rend="italic">John,</hi> was born at
                    Basel on the 7th August 1667. His education was begun at six years of age; and
                    his progress was such as to give a fair promise of future greatness. Having
                    finished his literary studies, he was sent to Neufchâtel to learn commerce and
                    acquire the French language. But at the end of a year, renouncing the enriching
                    pursuits of the merchant for the less lucrative investigations of the
                    philosopher, he returned to the university of Basel, where he was admitted to
                    the degree of bachelor in philosophy. In a year after, at the age of eighteen,
                    he obtained that of master of arts. His thesis on the one occasion was <hi
                    rend="italic">De Igne lambente,</hi> written in Latin verse; and, on the other,
                    <hi rend="italic">Que le Prince est pour les Sujets,</hi> written in Greek
                    verse.</p>
                <p>In his mathematical education, it was his good fortune to have the able
                    instruction of his elder brother James, whom he ultimately equalled in this
                    congenial department of science. Chemistry, however, as well as mathematics,
                    seems to have been the object of his early attention. In the year 1690 he
                    published a chemical dissertation on effervescence and fermentation,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>-Dwserŕűŵ <hi rend="italic"
                    >de Effervescentia et Fermentatione nova hypothesi fundata.</hi> Basil. 1690;
                    <hi rend="italic">iterum,</hi> Venetiis, 1721; <hi rend="italic">tertium,</hi>
                    Neapoli, 1734.</p></note> in which he endeavours to explain the phenomena of
                    chemical action by the different figures of what he calls <hi rend="italic"
                    >active</hi> and <hi rend="italic">passive</hi> particles. But to have made a
                    juvenile failure where so many have erred, and where some uncertainty yet
                    remains, can scarcely infer any disgrace.</p>
                <p>In the same year he went to Geneva, where he gave some instructions in the
                    differential calculus to Fatio de Duiller, and afterwards proceeded to Paris,
                    where he enjoyed the society of Malebranche, Cassini, De la Hire, and Varignon.
                    With the Marquis de l’Hôpital he spent four months at his country residence in
                    the study of the higher geometry, and the resources of the new calculus, of
                    which he was an ardent promoter, and which he had the honour of imparting to his
                    distinguished host. But his independent discoveries in mathematics are numerous
                    and important. Of these it may be proper to mention the exponential calculus,
                    and the curve called by him the <hi rend="italic">lined brachystochrona,</hi> or
                    line of swiftest descent, which he was not only the first to determine, but at
                    the same time to point out the beautiful relation which this curve bears to the
                    path described by a ray or particle of light passing through strata of variable
                    density, such as our atmosphere.</p>
                <p>On h is return to his native city he studied medicine, a pursuit in some degree
                    allied to his now favourite study of mathematics; and in 1694 he took the degree
                    of Μ. D. On this occasion he maintained an ingenious thesis on muscular
                    motion,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    he adopts respecting the contraction of the muscles, he displays a happy
                    application of mathematical principles to the investigation of their motive
                    power.</p>
                <p>At this period he formed a connection by marriage with one of the oldest and most
                    respectable families in Basel; and although he had already declined a
                    professorship in Germany, he now accepted an invitation to be professor of

                    a residence of ten years in Groningen, his controversies were almost as numerous
                    as his discoveries. An incidental expression regarding the resurrection, founded
                    on the anatomical doctrine of a constant change in the particles of the body
                    during life, brought on him a charge of heresy, which was preferred by a
                    theologian of more zeal than wisdom. Both his voice and pen, however, were
                    exerted against his opponents in vindication of “his reputation, his religion,
                    and his honour ;” and in a medical dissertation <hi rend="italic">1⅛

                    him the notice of royalty, and engaged him in controversy. Through Leibnitz he
                    received from the king of Prussia a gold medal for his supposed discoveries;
                    while Hartsocker and some of the French academicians disputed the fact. If we
                    could suppose the calm breast of his brother James to have been in any respect
                    ruffled by this mark of royal favour, it might perhaps be considered as the
                    remote cause of the family quarrel about the problem of isoperimetrical figures
                    above mentioned. But be this as it may, the problem was prepared on this
                    occasion; and we have no desire to use any softening when truth forbids it.
                    Indeed his most ardent admirers must allow that, in his dispute with his
                    brother, in his controversies with the English and Scottish mathematicians, and
                    in his harsh and jealous bearing to his son Daniel, he showed a temper no less
                    unfortunate for its possessor than calculated to impair the lustre of his
                    character, and detract from the respect otherwise due to it. Having declined,
                    during his residence at Groningen, an invitation to Utrecht, he however
                    accepted, in 1705, the mathematical chair in the university of his native city,
                    vacant by the death of his brother James; and here he remained till death,
                    though flatteringly invited to higher emoluments in other distinguished

                    But his works in pure mathematics are the permanent monuments of his fame, and
                    must be studied to be fully appreciated. D’Alembert indeed acknowledges in
                    gratitude, that “.whatever he knew of mathematics he owed to the works of John
                    Bernoulli.” If his <hi rend="italic">Hydraulica,</hi> one of the latest of his

                <p>He was a member of almost every learned society in Europe, and one of the first

                    surpassing excellence of Newton; sincere in his religion, though attacked by a
                    theologian, and eulogised by a freethinker. The graphic if not faultless pencil
                    of Voltaire has thus drawn his character:</p>

                    with all the fond attention usually bestowed on a firstborn. At the age of eight
                    lie could speak German, Dutch, French, and Latin. When his father returned to
                    Basel he went to the university of that city, where, at the age of sixteen, he
                    took the degree of doctor in philosophy, and four years after the highest degree
                    in law.</p>
                <p>During these pursuits the study of mathematics had not been neglected, as appears
                    not only from his giving instructions in geometry to his younger brother Daniel,
                    but from his writings on the differential, integral, and exponential calculus,
                    and from his father considering him, at the age of tw enty-one, worthy of
                    receiving the torch of science from his own hands.<note anchored="true"

                <p>• Gladly embracing his father’s permission to travel, he visited Italy and
                    France. In the one he formed a friendship with Varignon, and in the other with
                    Riccati, one of the first mathematicians of Italy, and the father of a family in
                    some degree talented like the Bernoullis themselves; but ill health precluding
                    him from reaping the advantages of more extended travelling, he returned to his
                    native city.</p>
                <p>The invitation of a Venetian nobleman, however, induced him again to visit Italy,
                    where he resided two years, till his return to be a candidate for the chair of
                    jurisprudence in the university of Basel. Disappointed in this object by the
                    rather singular mode of election by lot, he was soon afterwards honourably
                    appointed to a similar office in the university of Berne. Here he resided three
                    years, respected and beloved, and with no other regret than what he felt on
                    account of his separation from his brother Daniel; an attachment of kindred

                    nobile fratrum.” Both seemed fortunate in being appointed at the same time
                    professors of mathematics in the academy of Petersburg; but this important
                    office Nicholas enjoyed for little more than eight months. In the end of July
                    1726 he was cut off by a lingering fever, in the prime of life, and in the
                    opening career of useful labour. <hi rend="subscript"> φ</hi></p>

                    of John Bernoulli, was born 9th February 1700, during his father’s residence in
                    Groningen. Like his father, Daniel was intended for a mercantile life; but,
                    preferring a learned profession, he studied medicine, became a physician, and,
                    following with hereditary ability and ardour his paternal steps, he rose to an
                    eminence and fame worthy of his first and favourite appellation, “Son of John
                    Bernoulli.”</p>
                <p>Taught by his father to regard mathematical learning as the sure foundation of
                    all science and all practical art, his attention was early directed to
                    geometrical studies, though the severity of his father’s manner was ill
                    calculated to encourage the first efforts of one of so sensitive a disposition;
                    but fortunately, at the age of eleven, he became the pupil of his affectionate
                    brother Nicholas.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">ļrila Nie. Bern.</hi></p></note> Mathematics and medicine were
                    equally the studies of his youth, and these he had the means of cultivating with
                    particular advantage in Italy under Michelotti and Morgagni; the former being an
                    able geometer, and the latter well skilled in several branches of physical
                    science, as well as in anatomy. In such society he breathed a kindred element;
                    and when he left Italy, he returned to his native country with well-won literary
                    and scientific honours.</p>
                <p>About this time, though only twenty-four years of age, he was invited to become
                    president of an academy then projected at Genoa; but, declining this honour, he
                    was, in the following year, appointed professor of mathematics at Petersburg. In
                    this situation, although he enjoyed a competent salary, he still looked back
                    with fond regard to the humble but equal lot of his native country. And on his
                    resolving to leave Russia, the court of Petersburg not only augmented his
                    salary, but granted him the half as a retiring pension, with the liberty of
                    returning if he chose. This truly generous conduct made him for a time forego
                    the gratification of a desire so peculiarly strong in a native of Switzerland.
                    His health, however, allowing him only to remain three years longer, he returned
                    to Basel, where in a short time he was appointed professor of anatomy and
                    botany, and afterwards of experimental and speculative philosophy. In the useful
                    and honourable labours of this office he spent the remaining years of his life,
                    which are scarcely marked by any other events than the calm conquests of
                    intellect, and the communication of valuable knowledge and good deeds to
                    mankind.</p>
                <p>He had previously published some medical and botanical dissertations, besides his
                    <hi rend="italic">Exercitationes quoedam Mathematica!,</hi> containing a
                    solution of the differential equation proposed by Riccati, and which now bears
                    the name of that celebrated geometer. In 1738 his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Piydrodynamica</hi> appeared; and whatever may be its defects, it must be
                    allowed to be at once an original and useful work. The equilibrium, the
                    pressure, the re-action and varied velo-: cities of fluids, are considered, not
                    merely theoretically, ’ but practically, with reference to the conveyance of
                    water in pipes and canals, to machines for raising water, and also as a moving
                    power in different mechanical operations. Some of his experiments on this
                    subject were performed in the presence of Maupertuis and Clairaut, whom the fame
                    of the Bernoullis had attracted to Basel; which, famous not only for
                    mathematical, classical, and oriental learning, but hallowed by the residence of
                    Erasmus, the pencil of Holbein, and the labours of the Buxtorfs, had then, as
                    D’Alembert remarks, become to the philosophers of France what Egypt had been to
                    the philosophers of ancient Greece.</p>
                <p>With a success equalled only by Euler, his fellow-citizen, his friend, and
                    successor at Petersburg, Daniel Bernoulli gained or shared no less than ten
                    prizes of the Academy of Sciences of Paris. The first, on the construction of a
                    clepsydra for measuring time exactly at sea, he gained at the age of
                    twenty-four; the second, on the physical cause of the inclination of the
                    planetary orbits, he divided with his father; and the third, on the tides, he
                    shared with Euler, Maclaurin, and another competitor, whose only merit consisted
                    in making a last effort to support the system of Descartes.</p>
                <p>The problem of vibrating cords, which had been some time before resolved by
                    Taylor and D’Alembert, became the subject of a long dispute between Daniel
                    Bernoulli and his illustrious friend Euler. This discussion, however, was
                    conducted with that generous spirit which soars above personalities, and with
                    almost equal claims to praise; the one, in support of D’Alembert, displaying all
                    the force of analysis; and the other, in defence of Taylor, using all the
                    address of a mind fertile in resources.</p>
                <p>In one of his early investigations on mechanics, he has given an ingenious though
                    indirect demonstration of the problem of the parallelogram of forces; and in
                    other papers, contained also in the Petersburg Memoirs, he has published
                    researches of a higher character and of equal utility. His labours in the
                    decline of life were chiefly directed to the doctrine of probabilities in
                    reference to practical purposes, and in particular to economical subjects; to
                    inoculation as an object of national interest, and to the duration of married
                    life in the different sexes, and the relative proportion of male and female
                    births. But in such speculations the premises often do not embrace all the
                    existing circumstances; so that we need not be much surprised to find the
                    results sometimes at variance with nature. His great object however was, in the
                    spirit of true philosophy, to employ theory only as a means to investigate the
                    secrets of nature, and to apply mathematics to explain with accuracy and
                    certainty the phenomena of the universe. <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi></p>
                <p>By a regular and calm tenor of life, though of a delicate constitution, he
                    retained his usual vigour of understanding till near the age of eighty, when his
                    nephew James relieved him of his public duties. Being afflicted with a
                    troublesome asthma, his retirement was confined to the society of a few chosen
                    friends. In the spring of 1782 all his complaints were increased, and, after
                    some days illness, this excellent man and true philosopher died like his father,
                    in the repose of sleep.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>He was never married, owing, it is said, to a misplaced affection in youth. His
                    manners were unaffected, and his society agreeable. His house, his table, and
                    his dress, had nothing inconsistent with simplicity. Frugal without par* simony,
                    and benevolent without ostentation, the wea∣t which might have been expended in
                    selfish pleasure or <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197050"

                    endowment for poor students at Basel. Excluded by his professional character
                    from the councils of the republic, he however received all the deference and
                    honour of a first magistrate. He indeed enjoyed an esteem and respect seldom
                    accorded to living worth. One of the first lessons which a parent taught his
                    child was to bow to Daniel Bernoulli. Gratified as he must have been by this
                    flattering regard of his fellow-citizens, he was yet wont to mention two
                    incidents in his life as having afforded him the greatest pleasure; the
                    accidental meeting and indirect approbation of Newton, and the solving of
                    Koenig’s difficult problem, while he did the honours of the table for him.</p>
                <p>Like his father, he was a member of almost every learned society of Europe, and
                    he succeeded him as foreign associate of the academy of Paris. Several of his
                    interesting investigations are contained in the earlier volumes of the
                    Petersburg Memoirs; and his separately published works are, 1. <hi rend="italic"

                    of the three distinguished sons of John Bernoulli, was born at Basel on the 18th
                    May 1710. He studied law and mathematics, and, after travelling in France, was
                    appointed professor of eloquence in tħeuniversity of his native city. In this
                    office he continued five years, till the death of his father, whom he succeeded
                    as professor of mathematics. He was thrice a successful competitor for the
                    prizes of the academy of sciences of Paris. His prize subjects were, on the
                    capstan, on the propagation of light, and on the magnet. The friendship of
                    Maupertuis, who died under his roof while on his way to Berlin, was esteemed by
                    him not the least of his honours. He himself died in 1790, at the age of eighty.
                    His two sons, John and James, are the last noted mathematicians of the Bernoulli
                    family.</p>

                    of the three preceding, and son of Nicholas Bernoulli, one of the senators of
                    Basel, was born in that city on the 10th October 1687. He is frequently
                    mentioned with approbation both by his uncle and Leibnitz in their epistolary
                    correspondence. He visited England, where he was kindly received by Newton and
                    Halley,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    at Padua to the mathematical chair which Galileo had once filled. But neither
                    the classical recollections, nor the superior wealth of Padua, were sufficient
                    to prevent his return to the freedom and happy mediocrity of his native city. At
                    Basel he was successively professor of logic and of law, where he died on the
                    29th of November 1759. He was editor of the <hi rend="italic">Ars
                    Conjectandi</hi> of his uncle James. His own works are not published separately,
                    but are contained in the <hi rend="italic">Acta Eruditorum,</hi> the <hi

                <p>VII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bernoulli,</hi><hi rend="italic">John,</hi> grandson of
                    the celebrated John Bernoulli, and son of the second of that name, was born at
                    Basel on the 4th December 1744. He studied at Basel and at Neufchâtel, ∙and when
                    thirteen years of age he took the degree of doctor in philosophy. His Thesis,
                    <hi rend="italic">De Vαriclarum Insitione,</hi> is still preserved in Haller’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Letters.</hi> It gives a short history of inoculation, as well
                    as the method of operation and manner of treatment which had recently and
                    successfully been practised on himself.</p>
                <p>The kindred studies of mathematics and astronomy were his early pursuits. When
                    only nineteen years of age he was appointed astronomer royal of Berlin. Some
                    years after, obtaining leave to travel, he visited Germany, France, and England;
                    and subsequently Italy, Russia, and Poland. On his return to Berlin he was
                    appointed director of the mathematical department of the academy of that city.
                    Here he died on the 10th July 1807, being, at the time of his death, a member of
                    several of the learned academies of Europe.</p>
                <p>He is a very voluminous and varied writer. His writings consist of several
                    volumes of travels, besides astronomical, geographical, and mathematical works.
                    In 1774 he published a French translation of Euler’s Elements of Algebra at
                    Lyons, in 2 vols. 8vo., He was a conductor of some of the periodical works of
                    Berlin, and in the academical memoirs of that city are several of his papers on
                    astronomical subjects. Those for the years 1803 and 1804 contain his
                    observations and experiments on the cultivation of <hi rend="italic">tea
                    mays</hi> or Indian corn in Switzerland and Germany, and on its advantageous
                    application to various economical purposes.</p>
                <p>VIII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bernoulli,</hi><hi rend="italic">James,</hi> younger
                    brother of the preceding, and the second of this name, was born at Basel on the
                    17th October 1759. He displayed early talents, which were cultivated with the
                    greatest care. Having finished his literary studies, he was, according to
                    custom, sent to Neufchâtel to acquire the French language. On his return to his
                    native city he studied law and took a degree.</p>
                <p>The study of law, however, had neither alienated nor checked his hereditary taste
                    for geometrical pursuits. The early mathematical lessons which he had received
                    from his father were continued by his uncle Daniel, so as to give new vigour to
                    his native predilection for the exact sciences. Such, indeed, was his progress
                    in these studies, that at the age of twenty-one the directors of the university
                    of Basel committed to him the duties of the chair of experimental physics, which
                    his uncle’s advanced years rendered him unable to discharge. But although he
                    filled this important office with satisfaction, both to the directors and to his
                    auditors, he did not succeed on his relative’s death. The lot was capricious,
                    and the voice of public opinion (by which almost all the important appointments
                    at Basel were then decided) unfavourable. He had been formerly, too, an
                    unsuccessful candidate for the chair of eloquence; so that, with perhaps a
                    conscious feeling of unmerited neglect, he published on the present occasion a
                    thesis <hi rend="italic">De Sublimi.</hi></p>
                <p>This repeated disappointment, combined with the desire of travelling, so natural
                    and so powerful in youth, induced him to accept the situation of secretary to
                    Count de Brenner, which afforded him an opportunity of seeing a great part of
                    Germany and Italy. In Italy he formed a friendship with Lorgna, professor of
                    mathematics at Verona, and one of the founders of the Italian society for the
                    encouragement of the sciences. He was also made corresponding member of the
                    Royal Society of Turin; and, while residing at Venice, he was, through the
                    friendly representation of Fuss, admitted into the academy of Petersburg, with
                    the promise of promotion in the course of a year. In 1788 he was accordingly
                    made one of the mathematical professors of that flourishing seminary, and in the
                    following year he married a daughter of Albert Euler, son of the illustrious
                    Euler. This marriage, which united names equally dear to science, and, from
                    congeniality of sentiment, promised much happiness, was almost tragically
                    dissolved in the space of two short months. Residence in the country, and the
                    opportunity of bathing in the Neva, had given him a taste for that healthful but
                    sometimes fatal exercise. Beingan excellent swimmer,he was fearlessly enjoying
                    this recreation, when at once he sunk without any appearance of danger or
                    expression of pain. He was instantly <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197063"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-7063-0596"/>taken out by his brother-in-law, and every means
                    of resuscitation applied, but without success. The opinion of the physicians was
                    that his death had been occasioned by a shock of apoplexy. His constitution
                    indeed was naturally delicate, and two years before he had suffered much from a
                    nervous fever. His premature death at the age of twenty-nine was a source of
                    deep regret, not only to his relatives, but to many whom he had attached to him
                    by a character open, obliging, gentle, and modest.</p>
