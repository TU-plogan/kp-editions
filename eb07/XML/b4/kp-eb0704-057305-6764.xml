                <p><label type="entry">BENTINCK, <hi rend="smallcaps">William Henry
                    Cavendish</hi></label>, third duke of Portland, was born on the 14th of April
                    1738. Having finished his education at Christ Church, Oxford, he went on his
                    travels. Soon after his return he was elected for the borough of Weobly, in the
                    first parliament of the king’s reign. For this borough, however, he did not sit
                    long; for, on the death of his father, on the 1st of May 1762, he was called up
                    to the house of peers. He immediately joined the opposition; and, in 1763, his
                    name is found among the minority against the cider bill, and along with that of
                    the duke of Grafton in a pro’test against it. The next session he also signed a
                    protest on the motion to vote away the privilege claimed by members of
                    parliament in matters of libel. In 1765, when his friend the marquis' of
                    Rockingham came into power, he was appointed lord chamberlain, and he retired
                    when the marquis went out of office. In 1768 there was a violent contest for the
                    county of Cumberland; and as the duke warmly supported the two opposition
                    candidates, the ministry, in order to weaken his influence, and at the same time
                    to increase that of Sir James Lowther, who was one of the ministerial
                    candidates, granted to the latter Inglewood forest, an extensive and valuable
                    estate, which had been granted by King William III. to the first duke of
                    Portland, and had remained in possession of that family ever since. The new
                    grant was made in consequence of a report from the surveyor-gene··</p>

                <p>ral of crown lands, that the premises were not comprised in the original grant
                    from King William to the duke of Portland, but were still vested in the crown. A
                    letter was written from the treasury, directing the duke to prepare his title,
                    and assuring him that nothing should be decided concerning the grant till such
                    title had been stated and maturely considered: but while his grace’s agents were
                    busily employed in their researches and inquiries, he received a second letter,
                    informing him that the grants were passed and the leases signed. A caveat had
                    been entered at the exchequer to stop the progress of the grant; but when Lord
                    North was prayed to withhold affixing the exchequer seal, he replied that, as
                    chancellor of the exchequer, he was bound to obey the orders of the treasury. On
                    the 19th of November 1771 this great cause was tried before the barons of the
                    exchequer in Westminster Hall. The court recited all the records and
                    prerogatives of the crown, from Edward I. to the lease made to Sir James
                    Lowther; when, after a full and impartial examination of the said lease, it was
                    found invalid, agreeably to the statute of the 1st of Anne, which expressly
                    requires that, upon every grant from the crown, there shall be a reserved rent,
                    not under the third part of the clear yearly value of the manors, lands, &amp;c.
                    as shall be contained in the grant. Sir James Lowther’s grant from the crown,
                    being only a quit-rent of 13s. 4d. for the whole of Inglewood forest, was
                    immediately determined by the court an inadequate third proportion, and he was
                    nonsuited accordingly. The. <hi rend="italic">nullum tempus</hi> bill, or the
                    act for quieting the possessions of the subject against all pretences of
                    concealment whatsoever, which was brought into parliament in 1768, and passed in
                    the following year, owed its rise to this grant of the Portland property to Sir
                    James Lowther.</p>
                <p>In 1766 the duke of Portland had been bound more closely than ever to the
                    Roekingham party, in consequence of his marriage with Lady Dorothy Cavendish,
                    sister to the duke of Devonshire. On the resignation of Lord North he was
                    appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland; and during his government the parliament
                    of that country was declared independent of the British parliament. After an
                    administration of somewhat more than three months he was recalled, when Lord
                    Shelburne came into power. On the death of the marquis of Roekingham he was
                    recommended by the privy council to the king as his successor at the Treasury;
                    but Lord Shelburne was preferred. When the coalition came into power, however,
                    he obtained the situation of prime minister, and went out of office with them.
                    During Mr Pitt’s difficulties, when he first came into administration, in
                    consequence of the house of commons being against him, an attempt was made to
                    form a coalition between him and the duke of Portland; but his grace objected to
                    the conditions on which Mr Pitt came into power, and refused his support unless
                    he would resign his place and come in again on equal terms with himself and his
                    friends.</p>
                <p>In 1792 he was elected chancellor of the university of Oxford; and soon
                    afterwards he, as well as several other friends of Mr Fox, who differed from
                    that statesman respecting the French revolution, left the opposition and joined
                    the ministry. Upon this he was appointed lord-lieutenant of the county of
                    Nottingham, and, in 1794, secretary of state for the home department. The
                    scareity and high price of provisions, and the state-trials, which occurred soon
                    after he became seeretary of state, rendered his office arduous and unpleasant.
                    He discharged his duty, however, under these circumstanees, with moderation, and
                    with acknowledged good intentions, though not always perhaps with vigour and
                    judgment. He continued seeretary of state till Mr Addington became prime
                    minister in 1801, when he exchanged this situation for the more easy duty of
                    president of the council. On the death of Mr Pitt, and the appointment of Lord
                    Grenville and Mr Fox to the ministry, in the spring of 1806, he was removed from
                    the presidentship of the council; but he was again called into public life, and
                    placed at the head of the treasury, in March 1807, when Lord Grenville’s
                    administration closed. His Grace, however, though nominally the prime minister,
                    was too infirm to take an active part in the high and arduous duties of this
                    situation, which were discharged almost entirely by Mr Pereeval, the chancellor
                    of the exchequer. He continued nominally the first lord of the treasury till a
                    very short time before his death, which happened on the 30th of October
                    1809.</p>
                <p>The abilities of his grace were certainly but moderate, and very far inferior to
                    those which he must have possessed had he been, as latterly there has been an
                    attempt to prove, the author of <hi rend="italic">Junius’s Letters;</hi> but his
                    understanding was good, and he was by no means unwilling or unable to give
                    regular attention to official business. His political integrity was never
                    questioned, even by the party he abandoned.</p>
