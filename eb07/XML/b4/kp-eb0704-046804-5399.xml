                <p><label type="entry">BAZEEGURS</label>, a tribe of Indians, inhabiting different
                    parts of the peninsula of Hindostan. The appearance and manners of mankind are
                    so much diversified in the various countries where they dwell, that animated
                    controversies have been excited, whether all have had a common origin; or
                    whether they have sprung from protoplasts whose conformation, at the beginning
                    of the world, was dissimilar. Some maintain, that, in consequence of the changes
                    produced by situation, climate, and circumstances, the present generations may
                    possibly exhibit figures and proportions altogether different from those that
                    distinguished their ancestors thousands of years ago; while others hold that no
                    such differences could appear, unless they had actually formed part of the
                    original conformation of a race. The partisans of either theory have appealed to
                    that uniformity of features and customs known to be continued among tribes, who
                    preserve their own descent pure and unmixed with others, of which the Jews
                    constitute a striking example; and a case something similar, though not equally
                    prominent, is that of the Bazeegurs. This class of people is recognised by
                    several appellations, as Bazeegurs, Panchperee, Kunjura, or Nuts; they follow a
                    mode of life distinguishing them from the Hindoos, among whom they dwell; they
                    also abstain from intermixing their families with the Hindoos, and from any
                    intercourse by which they can be united. The name Bazeegur is said to signify a
                    juggler; and some etymologists find a probable derivation of conjuror from
                    Kunjura, which might certainly find a corroboration from the similarity of
                    professions. In India they are dispersed throughout the whole country, partly in
                    wandering tribes, partly adhering to fixed residences, but the greater
                    proportion lead a nomadic life. '</p>
                <p>The Bazecgurs are divided into seven castes, Charee, Athbhyeea, Bynsa, Purbuttee,
                    Kalkoor, Dorkince, and Gurgwar; but all these are the same people, intermarrying
                    as such, and avoiding alliances with other tribes. According to their own
                    traditions, they are descended from four brothers, who, finding it difficult to
                    provide for their numerous followers, resolved to separate, and to direct their
                    course respectively to each quarter of the world. In cotise-1 quence of this one
                    of them, named Sa, arrived in Bengal from Gazeepour or Allahabad. He took up his
                    abode at Hoogly, and having governed his tribe peaceably during many years, died
                    at Uncourpoor, whither his posterity still repair to offer up their prayers to
                    his manes. Sa left three sons who succeeded each other; and the succession
                    having afterwards regularly passed through several generations, at length
                    devolved to Munbhungee, many years ago. At the same time some of the castes
                    considered a woman called Toota as the chief of the whole; but the power
                    ascribed to the chief seems merely nominal, scarcely amounting to restraint, and
                    not at all to coercion. Munbhungee only resisted the entrance of any of the
                    people acknowledging the superiority of Toota, to seek a livelihood in the
                    territory occupied by his own sect; and the latter were under the same
                    prohibition with respect to the places frequented by her and her dependents.
                    Besides those who are united into sets or castes, there are individuals who
                    wander about endeavouring to pick up a precarious livelihood.</p>
                <p>It is not evident, although the Bazeegurs are certainly distinguished by their
                    manners and customs from the natives of Hindostan, that their features
                    discriminate them as a separate race. Some of their women are reputed very
                    beautiful, and arc thence sought after in those temporary alliances common in
                    the East. The manners of the Panchperec are somewhat different from those of the
                    Bazeegurs, and some of the sects are more civilized than others. It has already
                    been observed that they are not in the exclusive occupation of any district in
                    particular, but their villages or respective quarters are found in the same
                    places as those of the Hindoos or British settlers. The Panchperec form neat
                    little encampments in the upper provinces; their huts are small and regular, and
                    each is surrounded by a small inclosure or court-yard, generally disposed in
                    such a manner that the whole hamlet, formed of portable matting, obtains a kind
                    of circumvallation by means of them.</p>
                <p>The Bazeegurs, more especially distinguished by that name, are the most civilized
                    of the whole; they are Mahommedans in food, apparel, and religion. The
                    Panch-peree profess no system of faith in preference, adopting that of any
                    village indifferently, whither their wanderings may guide them. Some traverse
                    the country as Mahommedan Fakeers, and live on the ill-directed bounty of
                    devotees; and a particular association among them, of bad repute or abject
                    superstition, has been accused of sacrificing human victims. Notwithstanding
                    their ignorance of the established religions, they seem to venerate a female
                    deity, Kali, probably the sanguinary goddess of the Hindoos, and many perhaps in
                    this way seek to purchase her protection. The Bazcegurs arc circumcised, and
                    have priests to officiate at their marriages and funerals; but their knowledge
                    of the prophet Mahomet is very imperfect, for they can give little account of
                    him, except that he was a saint. They seem to acknowledge an omnipotent Being,
                    and conceive that all nature is animated by one universal spirit, which the
                    soul, as being part of it, will rejoin after death. At the birth of their
                    children, some Brahmin, supposed an adept in astrology, is called in to aid them
                    in choosing a propitious name.</p>
                <p>Among the Panchperee, the marriage ceremony is commenced by the bridegroom
                    repairing to the hut of his elect, and calling aloud for her to be delivered to
                    him. A near relation, guarding the door, resists his entrance, and rudely pushes
                    him away, while he is the object of taunts and jocularity; but when his patience
                    is supposed to have been sufficiently put to the test, the bride is brought out.
                    Both receive an exhortation from the priest to p <hi rend="superscript">
                    ril</hi> ^ <hi rend="superscript"> ιs</hi>, <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi>
                    mutual kindness; and the bridegroom, marking the bride s <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193195412" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5412-0469"/>face with ochre, declares her
                    his wedded wife; and she, on her part, does the same in return. The little
                    fingers of their hands are now joined, and a scene of merriment, from which the
                    bride alone is exempted, commences. But this consists chiefly in the progress to
                    intoxication, for all these people are addicted to the most immoderate use of
                    spirits; and after copious libations, a cavalcade, formed of the two parties,
                    whose little fingers are again joined, and their parents and friends, departs
                    for the hut of the bridegroom. Before the door there are some enigmatical
                    ceremonies performed; the mother of the bridegroom advances with a sieve
                    containing rice, paint, and grass, with which the foreheads of the couple are
                    touched, after being waved around them; and the bride is led into the house,
                    before which there stands a small fresh branch of the mango tree in an earthen
                    pot of water. The meaning of these ceremonies is not well understood; and it is
                    to be observed, that the origin of most of the customs of the modern races of
                    mankind is lost in the darkness of antiquity. Some of the peasantry in Britain
                    have various ceremonies both at marriages and funerals, such as breaking a cake
                    above the head of the bride, or strewing flowers on the bier of one deceased,
                    which have descended from remote ages, and arose from sources at this day
                    unknown. When these ceremonies are completed among the Bazeegurs, a new scene of
                    mirth is resumed; and towards evening, for the whole day from the breaking of
                    dawn is thus occupied, the bride is conducted to her own hut, when those who are
                    able retire; but the majority, and in general the bridegroom among them, pass
                    the night in a state of insensibility on the neighbouring plain.</p>
                <p>From the earliest period they are accustomed to intoxicating draughts; even
                    infants of five or six months old are supplied with spirits, though their
                    mothers suckle them during five or six years; and it is not uncommon to observe
                    several children of different ages hanging on their mother, and struggling to
                    extract their scanty portion of nourishment, which is gradually diminished by
                    her own insatiable propensities to the same beverage. Many of the sects are very
                    indiscriminate in food; scarcely any thing is rejected; dead horses, jackals,
                    and bullocks, are alike acceptable; and it has been suspected that they can even
                    enjoy a repast of human flesh. However, this fact is not authenticated, and if
                    analogical reasoning may be admitted here, we should be inclined to deny it,
                    because there is no proof that any tribe, however savage, is addicted to
                    anthropophagy, if dwelling among a more civilized people.</p>
                <p>The chief occupation of the Bazeegurs seems to consist in feats of address and
                    agility to amuse the public, in which both males and females are equally
                    skilful. The former are extremely athletic, and the women are taught dancing,
                    which, instead of the graceful motions seen in the north, consists there
                    principally in a display of lascivious gestures. Most, if not all, the men are
                    jugglers, tumblers, and actors, in which they are very adroit. The people of
                    each sect, or dramatis personae, are hired out by <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi>
                    sirdar or manager of a company, for a definite period, generally one year, after
                    which they are at liberty to join <hi rend="superscript"> an</hi> y other party.
                    But no person can establish a set of actors without permission from the Nardar
                    Boutah, a chief θι the Bazeegurs, who receives a proportion of the profits, and
                    a tribute or tax from each female, somewhat analogous to what was called
                    milk-money, a revenue levied by Ce Holy See from licenses to prostitutes. On the
                    return θ a party from an excursion, this money is paid to the ardar Boutah, who
                    convenes his people, and they connue feasting until the whole is expended.
                    Should any <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> γ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> e</hi> managers be suspected of giving an unfair account <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0</hi> his profits, a court is assembled, where the accused
                    must undergo the ordeal of applying his tongue to a piece of red-hot iron. It
                    thus appears that these tribes have a kind of civil government among themselves;
                    that each of five sets, at Calcutta at least, has a sirdar or ruler, and that
                    the whole are subject to the Nardar Boutah. These sirdars and the chief
                    apparently constitute a court for the trial of any infringement of their
                    regulations, which may be followed by punishment. Thus if, on application of the
                    red-hot iron, the suspected manager be burnt, he is declared guilty of a fraud,
                    which is expiated by a fine, and, if it be an aggravated offence, by the
                    additional punishment of having-his nose rubbed on the ground. The same penalty
                    is attached to disclosures to strangers of matters which it is the interest of
                    the tribe to conceal. The fine is generally converted into liquor; but should
                    the offender be either unable or unwilling to discharge it immediately, he is
                    banished from all society, or he is universally execrated, and even his wife and
                    children avoid him. He soon finds compliance indispensable, and although the
                    Bazeegurs pique themselves on their honesty, it is conjectured that on such
                    occasions they do not entertain many scruples in acquiring what is so essential
                    to avert the indignation of their fellows. The mulct being paid, is converted to
                    the general behoof, and affords a new opportunity for gratifying the strong
                    propensities implanted in these people for ardent liquors. All differences among
                    this set are the subject of reference either to a <hi rend="italic">punchy
                    at</hi> or a general assembly; but, before commencing the business, both
                    plantiff' and defendant must provide a quantity of spirits proportioned to the
                    importance of the case. The party non-suited ultimately bears the whole expense,
                    and the assembly is regaled with the beverage produced by the litigants.</p>
                <p>Some of the Bazeegurs are owners of land, which they entertain a great desire to
                    obtain; but they are never cultivators. They are collected, as already observed,
                    into various associations in different parts of India. The dancing girls,
                    however, have no regular and settled habitations; they dwell merely in temporary
                    huts, erected near the place of their exhibitions. The duration of their lives
                    is supposed to be much abridged by the course of life which they lead,
                    particularly from the violent exercises practised from early youth, and habitual
                    indulgence in intoxicating draughts. Both males and females undergo such a
                    regular progress of debauchery, that few live beyond forty, and many do not
                    attain their thirtieth year. But from the pursuits of the females being
                    productive to their parents, their marriages are deferred to a later period than
                    is usual in India. There prostitution is free from that odium and contempt which
                    it incurs in Europe, and those females who are considered so unfortunate and
                    depraved by us are under the special protection of the laws. The female
                    Bazeegurs who are taught singing and dancing only are under no greater personal
                    restraint than the common dancing girls of Hindostan; but the chastity of those
                    whose particular department is tumbling is strictly enjoined until their place
                    be supplied by others more youthful. When this substitution comes they join the
                    companies of dancers alone; and the men, though quite aware of their
                    incontinence, do not scruple to select wives from among them. But after marriage
                    a total change of conduct is expected, and it is said that such expectations are
                    commonly realized. Nevertheless, among the Panchperee, the fidelity of those
                    employed in different vocations in the towns becomes suspected if they have not
                    returned to their homes when the cry of the jackal is heard, and their husbands
                    are by no means disposed to overlook the offence. It does not appear, however,
                    that they have either the power or the inclination of the Hindoos, who
                    sometimes, in such cases, decoy their own daughters to a lonely place for the
                    purpose of perpe-ι<pb break="no" facs="nls:193195425"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5425-0470"/> trating a barbarous murder on them, as the
                    punishment of their indiscretion. The Bazeegur parents and husbands are content
                    with slighter expiations; but if the paramour be not of their own particular
                    caste, the incontinence of the female is judged a much more grievous fault.</p>
                <p>The females now alluded to are those who do not attend the juggling exhibitions
                    of the men, or their feats of activity; they practise physic and cupping, and
                    perform a kind of tattooing on the skin of the Hindoos of their own sex, called
                    Godna. As the men, besides their usual occupations, collect medicinal herbs, and
                    a certain bud, the latter is dried, and the former prepared by their wives as
                    curatives, especially of the complaints of their own sex. Thus they find
                    employment in the towns, in such vocations, or by the sale of trinkets, though
                    both afford but a precarious subsistence. Some tribes also exhibit wild beasts
                    to the vulgar, or offer mats fabricated by themselves for sale. Before the
                    establishment of the British government in Bengal, the Bazeegurs were subject to
                    the arbitrary exactions of a tax-gatherer, whom they greatly dreaded; and the
                    apprehension of the renewal of that officer’s powers has proved a considerable
                    impediment to investigating their manners and customs.</p>
                <p>A general coincidence in the mode of life, the vocations, manners, and language
                    of all the different sects of these people, determines them as belonging to the
                    same race. The distinctions seen among them are too trivial to admit of their
                    being considered of separate and independent origin. They are different from all
                    the other tribes dispersed throughout Hindostan, and have two dialects also
                    peculiar to themselves, the one most probably a jargon, which is spoken only
                    among the public performers; the other in common use among the whole. The Bazee-
                    ’ gurs are supposed to present many features analogous to the gipsies scattered
                    over Europe and Asia, where they subsist as a distinct race from all the other
                    inhabitants of the countries frequented by them. The Bazeegurs, as well as
                    gipsies, have a chief or king; each has a peculiar language, bearing some
                    reciprocal analogy, and different from that of the people among whom they
                    reside; and this analogy is so decided, that it is difficult to deny that in
                    both cases it has had a common origin. In India and in Europe they are equally
                    an itinerant race; their pursuits, excepting in as far as these are modified by
                    the manners of countries distant from each other, are alike; for the
                    discrepancies they exhibit may reasonably enough be ascribed to an insensible
                    acquisition of the habits of those near whom their various tribes happen to
                    dwell. They are totally indifferent as to the quality of the food serving for
                    their subsistence, and entirely ignorant of systematic religious principles. All
                    preserve the strictest adherence to their own sect, and sedulously abstain from
                    intermixtures or intermarriages with that of any other nation; and where
                    infringements of these rules are seen, they are to be ascribed more to necessity
                    than inclination. Another resemblance, which has probably been lost in the lapse
                    of time, is supposed to consist in the three-stringed viol, introduced into
                    Europe by the jugglers of the thirteenth century, which is exactly similar to
                    the instrument now used in Hindostan. Separate and disjoined, these analogies
                    may not carry conviction of the identity of the European gipsies with the Indian
                    Bazeegurs; but, on uniting and combining the whole, it does not seem unlikely,
                    that if Asia be their original country, or if they have found their way from
                    Egypt <hi rend="superscript"> t0</hi> India, they may also have emigrated
                    farther at a period of remote antiquity, and reached the boundaries of Europe.
