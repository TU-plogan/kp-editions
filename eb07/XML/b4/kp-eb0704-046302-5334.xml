                <p><label type="entry">BAXTER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Richard</hi></label>, an eminent
                    nonconformist divine, was born at Rowton in Shropshire, the 12th November 1615,
                    and distinguished himself by his exemplary life, his pacific and moderate
                    principles, and his numerous writings. He was remarkable for his piety even when
                    he was very young. Upon the opening of the Long Parliament he was chosen vicar
                    of Kidderminster. In the heat of the civil wars lie withdrew from, that town to
                    Coventry, and preached to the garrison and inhabitants. When Oliver Cromwell was
                    made protector, he declined complying with his measures, though he once preached
                    before him. He came to London just before the deposition of Richard Cromwell,
                    and preached before the parliament the day previous to that on which they voted
                    the return of Charles II. The king, on his restoration, appointed Baxter one of
                    his chaplains in ordinary. The latter assisted at the conference in the Savoy,
                    as one of the commissioners for stating the fundamentals in religion, and
                    afterwards drew up a reformed liturgy. He was offered the bishopric of Hereford,
                    which he refused, affecting no higher preferment than the liberty of continuing
                    minister of Kidderminster; but this was denied him, for he was not permitted to
                    preach there above twice or thrice after the Restoration; whereupon he returned
                    to London and preached occasionally in or about the city till the act of
                    uniformity passed. In 1662 Mr Baxter married Margaret Charleton, daughter to
                    Francis Charleton, Esq. of the county of Salop. This lady was a woman of great
                    piety, and entered thoroughly into her husband’s views concerning religion.
                    During the plague in 1665 he retired into Buckinghamshire; but afterwards
                    returned to Acton, where he staid till the act against conventicles expired, and
                    then his audience became so large that he wanted room. Upon this he was
                    committed to prison; but having procured a <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus,</hi>
                    he was discharged. After the indulgence in 1672, he returned to London; but in
                    1682 he was seized for coming Within five miles of a corporation. In 1684 he was
                    again seized; and in the reign of King James II. he was com-nutted prisoner to
                    the King’s Bench, and tried before the ļord chief justice Jefferies for his
                    Paraphrase on the New testament, which was called a “scandalous” and “sedi- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> tl0us</hi> book against the government. He continued in
                    prison two years; but was at last discharged, and had his fine remitted by the
                    king. He died on the 8th of December 1691, and was buried in Christ Church.</p>
                <p>Mr Sylvester says that Mr Baxter’s “person was tall and slender, and stooped
                    much; his countenance composed and grave, somewhat inclining to a smile. He had
                    a piercing eye, a very articulate speech, and deportment rather plain than
                    complimental.” The same writer adds, “He had a great command over his thoughts.
                    He had that happy faculty, so as to answer the character that was given of him
                    by a learned man dissenting from him after discourse with him, which was that
                    <hi rend="italic">he could say what he would, and he could prove what he
                    said.</hi> He was most intent upon the necessary things. Rational learning he
                    most valued, and was a very extraordinary master of. And as to his expressive
                    faculty, he spake properly, plainly, pertinently, and pathetically. He could
                    speak suitably, both to men’s capacities and to the things insisted on. He was a
                    person wonderful at extemporary preaching.” But his common practice appears to
                    have been to preach from notes, though he said that “he thought it very needful
                    for a minister to have a body of divinity in his head.” He was honoured with the
                    friendship of some of the greatest and the best men in the kingdom, as the earl
                    of Lauderdale, the earl of Balcarras, Lord Chief Justice Hales, Dr Tillotson,
                    &amp;c.; and he carried on a correspondence with some of the most eminent
                    foreign divines. He wrote above a hundred and twenty books, and more than sixty
                    were written against him. The former, however, it should seem, were greatly
                    preferable to the latter, since Dr Barrow, an excellent judge, says that “his
                    practical writings were never mended, his controversial seldom confuted.”</p>
                <p>Mr Granger’s character of him is too striking to be omitted. “Richard Baxter was
                    a man famous for weakness of body and strength of mind; for having the strongest
                    sense of religion himself, and exciting a sense of it in the thoughtless and
                    profligate; for preaching more sermons, engaging in more controversies, and
                    writing more books, than any other nonconformist of his age. He spoke, disputed,
                    and wrote with ease; and discovered the same intrepidity when he reproved
                    Cromwell and expostulated with Charles II. as when he preached to a congregation
                    of mechanics. His zeal for religion was extraordinary, but it seems never to
                    have prompted him to faction, or carried him to enthusiasm. This champion of the
                    Presbyterians was the common butt of men of every other religion, and of those
                    who were of no religion at all. But this had very little effect upon him; his
                    presence and his firmness of mind on no occasion forsook him. He was just the
                    same man before he went into a prison, while he was in it, and when he came out
                    of it; and he maintained an <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195347"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5347-0464"/>uniformity of character to the last gasp of his
                    life. His enemies have placed him in hell; but every man who has not ten times
                    the bigotry that Mr Baxter himself had, must conclude that he is in a better
                    place. This is a very faint and imperfect sketch of Mr Baxter’s character: men
                    of his size are not to be drawn in miniature. His portrait, in full proportion,
                    is in his <hi rend="italic">Narrative of his own Life and Times;</hi> which,
                    though a rhapsody, composed in the manner of a diary, contains a great variety
                    of memorable things, and is itself, as far as it goes, a history of
                    nonconformity.” Among his most celebrated works are, 1. The Saints’ Everlasting
                    Rest; 2. Call to the Unconverted, of which 20,000 were sold in one year, and it
                    was translated not only into all the European languages, but into the Indian
                    tongue; 3. Poor Man’s Family Book; 4. Dying Thoughts; and, 5. A Paraphrase on
                    the New Testament. His practical works have been printed in four volumes
                    folio.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Baxter,</hi><hi rend="italic">William,</hi> nephew and heir
                    to the former, was an eminent schoolmaster and critic. He was born at Lanlu-gan,
                    in Shropshire, in the year 1650; and it is remarkable, that at the age of
                    eighteen, when he first went to school, he knew not one letter, nor understood
                    one word of any language but Welsh; but he improved his time so well that he
                    became a person of great and extensive knowledge. His genius led him chiefly to
                    the study of antiquities and philology, in which he composed several books. The
                    first he published was a grammar, in 1679, entitled <hi rend="italic">De
                    Analogia seu Arte Latinoe Linguae Commentariolus.</hi> He also published a new
                    and correct edition of Anacreon, with notes; an edition of Horace; a Dictionary
                    of British Antiquities, in Latin; and several other works. He was a great master
                    of the ancient British and Irish tongues, and particularly skilled in the Latin,
                    Greek, northern, and oriental languages. He died on the 31st May 1723, after
                    being above twenty years master of Mercer’s school in London.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Baxter,</hi><hi rend="italic">Andrew,</hi> a very ingenious
                    metaphysical writer, was born in 1686 or 1687, in Old Aberdeen, where his father
                    was a merchant, and educated in King’s College there. His principal employment
                    was that of private tutor to young gentlemen; and among his pupils were Lord
                    Gray, Lord Blantyre, and Mr Hay of Drummelzier. About 1724 he married the
                    daughter of a clergyman in Berwickshire. A few years afterwards, but without
                    date, he published, in <hi rend="italic">An Inquiry into the Nature of the Human
                    Soul,</hi> wherein its immateriality is evinced from the principles of reason
                    and philosophy. In 1741 he went abroad with Mr Hay, and resided several years at
                    U trecht, having Lord Blantyre also under his care. From this place he made
                    excursions into Flanders, France, and Germany, his wife and family residing, in
                    the mean time, chiefly at Berwick-upon-Tweed. He returned to Scotland in 1747,
                    and resided till his death at Whittingham, in the county of East Lothian. He
                    drew up, for the use of his pupils and his son, a piece, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Matho, sive Cosmotheoria puerilis, Dialogus, in quo prima elementa
                    de mundi ordine et ornatu proponuntur,</hi> &amp;c. This was afterwards greatly
                    enlarged, and published in English, in two volumes 8vo. In 1750 was published an
                    appendix to his <hi rend="italic">Inquiry into the Nature of the Human
                    Soul,</hi> in which he endeavours to remove some difficulties which had been
                    started against his notions of the <hi rend="italic">vis inertiae</hi> of
                    matter, by Maclaurin, in his <hi rend="italic">Account of Sir Isaac Neινtons
                    Philosophical Discoveries.</hi> To this piece Mr Baxter prefixed a dedication to
                    Mr John Wilkes, with whom he had commenced an acquaintance abroad. He died on
                    the 23d April 1750, after suffering for some months under a complication of
                    severe disorders, of which the gout was the chief. He left a wife, three
                    daughters, and one son, Mr Alexander Baxter, from whom the authors of <hi
                    rend="italic">Biographia Eritannicμ</hi> received sundry particulars of his
                    life.</p>
                <p>Mr Baxter’s learning and abilities are sufficiently display, ed in his writings.
                    He was extremely studious, and sometimes sat up whole nights reading and
                    writing. At the same time his temper was very cheerful, and he was a friend to
                    innocent merriment. It is said of Mr Baxter that he entered with much good
                    humour into the conversation and pleasures of young people, when they were of an
                    innocent nature; and that during the whole of his residence at Utrecht he
                    presided at the ordinary, which was frequent· ed by all the young English
                    gentlemen there, with much gaiety and politeness, and in such a manner as to
                    give universal satisfaction. He also attended the most polite assemblies in that
                    city, and his company and conversation were particularly acceptable to the
                    ladies; so that Mr Baxter appeared to have studied the graces, without
                    neglecting more valuable acquisitions and accomplishments. He was at once the
                    scholar and the gentleman. In conversation he was modest, and not apt to make
                    much show of the extensive knowledge he was possessed of; while in the discharge
                    of the several social and relative duties of life his conduct was exemplary. He
                    had the most reverential sentiments of the deity, of whose presence and
                    immediate support he had always a strong impression upon his mind; and the
                    general tenor of his life appears to have been conformable to the rules of
                    virtue. Mr Baxter paid a strict attention to economy, though he dressed
                    elegantly, and was not parsimonious in his other expenses. It is known also that
                    there were several occasions on which he acted with remarkable
                    disinterestedness; and so far was he from courting preferment, that he
                    repeatedly declined considerable offers of that kind which were made him on
                    condition of his taking orders in the church of England. The French, German, and
                    Dutch languages he spoke with much ease, and the Italian tolerably; and he wrote
                    and read all of them, together with the Spanish. His friends and correspondents
                    were both numerous and respectable; amongst these was Dr Warburton, bishop of
                    Gloucester. He was also a man of great benevolence and candour; insomuch, that
                    although Mr Wilkes had made himself very obnoxious to the Scottish nation in
                    general, Mr Baxter maintained an affectionate correspondence with himlo the
                    last, even after he was unable to write with his own hand. He left many
                    manuscripts behind him, and would gladly have finished his work upon the human
                    soul. “I own.” says he, in a letter to Mr Wilkes, “if it had been the will of
                    Heaven, I would gladly have lived till I had put in order the second part of the
                    Inquiry, showing the immortality of the human soul; but infinite wisdom cannot
                    be mistaken in calling me sooner. Our blindness makes us form wishes.” This,
                    indeed, he considered his capital work. A second edition of it was published in
                    two volumes 8vo in 1737, and a third in 1745.</p>
