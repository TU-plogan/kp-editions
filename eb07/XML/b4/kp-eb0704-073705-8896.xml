                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BOIARDO, <hi rend="smallcaps">Count Matteo
                    Maria</hi></label>, of a noble and illustrious house established at Ferrara, but
                    originally from Reggio, was born at Scandiano, one of the seignorial estates of
                    his family, near Reggio di Modena, about the year 1434 according to Tiraboschi,
                    or 1420 according to Mazzuchelli. At an early age he entered the university of
                    Ferrara, where he applied to his studies as regularly as if he had not been a
                    person of quality, nor belonged to the privileged class. He acquired the Greek
                    and Latin, and even the oriental languages, and was in due time admitted doctor
                    in philosophy and in law. At the court of Ferrara, where he enjoyed the favour
                    of duke Borso d’Este and his successor Hercules, he was invested with several
                    honourable employments, and in particular named governor of Reggio, an
                    appointment which he held in the year 1478. Three years afterwards he was
                    elected captain of Modena, and re-appointed governor of the town and citadel of
                    Reggio, where he died in the year 1494, though in what month is uncertain.
                    Almost all his works, and especially his great poem of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orlando Inamorato,</hi> were composed for the amusement of duke Hercules and
                    his court, though not written within its precincts. His practice, it is said,
                    was to retire to Scandiano or some other of his estates, and there to devote
                    himself to composition; and Castelvctro, Vallisnieri, Mazzuchelli, and
                    Tiraboschi, all unite in stating, that he took care to insert in the
                    descriptions of his poem those of the agreeable environs of his chateau, and
                    that the greater part of the names of his heroes, as Man-dricar, Gradasse,
                    Sacripant, Agramant, and others, were merely the names of some of his peasants,
                    which, from their uncouthness, appeared to him proper to be given to Sar-razen
                    warriors. But be this as it may, the <hi rend="italic">Orlando Inamorato</hi>
                    deserves to be considered as one of the most important poems in Italian
                    literature, since it forms the first example of the romantic epic worthy to
                    serve as a model, and, as such, undoubtedly produced the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orlando Furioso.</hi> Gravina and Mazzuchelli have said, and succeeding writers
                    have repeated on their authority, that Boiardo proposed to himself as his model
                    the Iliad of Homer; that Paris is besieged like the city of Troy, that Angelica
                    holds the place of Helen, and that, in short, the one poem is a sort of reflex
                    image of the other. In point of fact, however, the subject-matter of the poem is
                    derived from the <hi rend="italic">Fabulous C∕ιronicle</hi> of Turpin; and, with
                    the exception of the names of Charlemagne, Roland, Olivier, and some other
                    principal warriors, who necessarily figure as important characters in the scene,
                    there is not the least resemblance or analogy between the fable of the one and
                    that of the other. This poem, which Boiardo did not live to finish, was printed
                    at Scandiano the year after his death, under the superintendence of his son
                    Count Camille. The title of the book is without date; but a Latin letter from
                    Antonio Caraffa di Reggio, prefixed to the poem, is dated the kalends of June
                    1495. A second edition, also without date, but which must have been printed
                    before the year 1500, appeared at Venice; and the poem was there twice reprinted
                    during the first twenty years of the sixteenth century. These editions are the
                    more curious and valuable, that they contain nothing but the text of the author,
                    which is comprised in three books, divided into cantos, the third book being
                    incomplete. But Niccolo degli Agostini, a mediocre poet, had the courage to
                    continue the work commenced by Boiardo, adding to it three books, which were
                    printed at Venice in 1526, 1531, in 4to; and since this time no edition of the
                    Orlando has been printed without the continuation of Agostini, wretched as it
                    unquestionably is. Nor is this all. Successive rifacciamenti were executed by
                    Domenichi and Berni, who took prodigious liberties, especially with <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193198909" xml:id="kp-eb0704-8909-0738"/> the style, which
                    they chose to consider as feeble, and ill suited to the high qualities of the
                    poem in other respects; and the consequence has been, that the original
                    composition has been nearly overlaid by these innovations, and that the romantic
                    epic invented by Boiardo is now almost universally read as remodelled by Berni.
