                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    >Casernes,</hi> places for soldiers to lodge in, especially in garrisons. Till
                    the middle of the year 1792, when there was a prospect of war with revolutionary
                    France, and the British ministry became apprehensive of disturbances in this
                    country, barracks were not numerous, nor were they under the control and
                    management of a separate and peculiar board. Previous to this they were built
                    under the authority and directions of the Board of Ordnance, which also supplied
                    them with bedding and the necessary utensils; and any extra articles that were
                    requisite were furnished by the secretary at war. In 1792 orders were issued by
                    the ministry for building cavalry barracks with the utmost dispatch, and the
                    deputy-adjutant-general was directed to superintend the building and fitting
                    them up. In January 1793 the same officer was appointed superintendent-general
                    of barracks; and on the first of May the king’s warrant was issued for their
                    regulation. Greater powers were given to the superintendentgeneral in the year
                    1794; but as these seemed to interfere with the duties and powers of the Board
                    of Ordnance, a new warrant was issued in the year 1795, defining and limiting
                    the respective duties and powers of the Board of Ordnance, and the
                    superintendent-general, or barrackmaster-general, as he was now called. In the
                    year 1796 the barrack-office establishment consisted of a barrackmaster-general,
                    with two clerks; a deputy-barrack-mastergeneral; an
                    assistant-barrack-master-general, with three clerks; an accountant, with five
                    clerks; an assistant-barrack-master-general for the general inspection of
                    barracks, and six other assistant-barrack-masters-general for the particular
                    inspection of barracks in different districts; five clerks for general business;
                    one assistant-barrackmaster-general for the building branch; one checking clerk,
                    and seven other clerks; two architects and surveyors; one
                    assistant-barrack-master-general in North Britain, with two assistants and
                    clerks; one treasurer; and three other assistant-barrack-masters-general for
                    general duties, and visiting barracks. The salaries and extra pay of these
                    officers amounted in 1796 to L.9524. 17s. 2d. The establishment was afterwards
                    considerably increased, in proportion as the number of barracks throughout the
                    kingdom increased, and by the creation of some new officers, among whom was a
                    law clerk.</p>
                <p>During the year 1800 the Commis.sioners of Military Inquiry began their duties;
                    and their first reports were on the subject of the barrack establishment. In the
                    arrange^ ment of this establishment, and the mode in which its duties were
                    performed, the commissioners pointed out many things that were highly
                    objectionable; and concluded their reports by recommending that the offices of
                    barrack-master-general and deputy-barrack-master-general should be totally
                    abolished, and that the superintendence of the barrack establishment should be
                    vested in commissioners. This suggestion, and some others relative to the mode
                    of transacting the business of the department, and preventing useless and
                    extravagant expenditure, were followed, and the barrack establishment was placed
                    under the direction of four commissioners, one of whom was generally a military
                    man..</p>
                <p>But as it frequently happened that barracks required to be built on an emergency,
                    when there was no time to summon a jury to value the land before the
                    commencement θt the building, and as most persons were averse to have barracks
                    near their dwelling-houses, or even on their property, government was
                    consequently obliged, in all such cases, to pay an extravagant price for the
                    land which Was needed for their erection. In order to remedy this therefore, it
                    was provided by the act usually called <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> defence
                    act, 43 Geo. III. cap. 55, that justices of the peace might <hi rend="italic">de
                    plano</hi> put any general officer into the possession of such ground as he
                    might deem fit for the erection of barracks, provided the immediate necessity
                    for such ground was certified by the lord lieutenant or two deputylieutenants of
                    the county; the value of the ground so appropriated to be afterwards fixed by a
                    jury in the ordinary way.</p>
                <p>Barracks throughout the country are more immediately under the management and
                    care of the resident barrackmasters, especially since the reduction of the
                    barrackoffice establishment, and the further reduction of the
                    assistant-barrack-masters-general attached to districts.</p>
                <p>The barrack districts in Great Britain are as follow :— 1. the northern,
                    containing Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Durham; 2. York,
                    containing Yorkshire; 3. the eastern, containing Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridge,
                    Huntingdonshire, and all Essex, except Tilburyfort; 4. the southern, containing
                    Kent, Tilbury-fort, and Sussex; 5. the south-western, containing Hampshire and
                    Dorsetshire; 6. Isle of Wight; 7. the western, containing Devonshire, Cornŵall,
                    and Somerset; 8. Severn, containing Gloucestershire, Herefordshire,
                    Monmouthshire, and South Wales; 9. the north-western, containing Cheshire,
                    Shropshire, Lancashire, North Wales, and the Isle of Man; 10. London; 11. the
                    home, containing Middlesex, Surrey, Hertfordshire, and part of Kent; 12. the
                    north-inland, containing Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire,
                    Warwickshire, Leicestershire, and Rutlandshire; 13. the southinland, containing
                    Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire, and Buckinghamshire; 14. Jersey,
                    Guernsey, and Alderney.</p>
                <p>The Scottish districts are, 1. the northern, containing Caithness, Sutherland,
                    Ross-shire, Inverness-shire, Nairnshire, Morayshire, and Banffshire; 2. the
                    western, containing Aberdeenshire, Argyleshire, Ayrshire, Bute, Kincardineshire,
                    Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, and Wigtonshire; 3. the central, containing
                    Angusshire, Clackmannanshire, Dumbartonshire, Fifeshire, Kinross-shire,
                    Perthshire, and Stirlingshire; and 4. the southern, containing the Lothians,
                    Berwickshire, Peeblesshire, Selkirkshire, Roxburghshire; and Dumfriesshire.</p>
                <p>On the 14th of July 1805 there were in Great Britain, the Island of Jersey,
                    &amp;c. 84 established barracks of brick and stone, 12 of wood, 75 temporary
                    barracks, and 41 rented; in all 212. But the number was afterwards considerably
                    increased. The annual rents at this time amounted to L.40,231. The whole of
                    these barracks were calculated to accommodate nearly 100,000 infantry and 15,000
                    cavalry. In the cavalry barracks, field-officers have two rooms each; captains
                    one; subalterns, staff, and quarter-masters, one; serjeants of each troop of
                    dragoons, and corporals of each troop of horse, one; eight rank and file one
                    among them; and two rooms are allowed for the officers’ mess. In infantry
                    barracks, fieldofficers are allowed two each; captains one; one is allotted to
                    two subalterns; the staff has one; twelve noncommissioned officers and private
                    men one among them; the serjeant-major and quarter-master-serjeant one; and two
                    are allotted for the officers’ mess. The barracks are supplied by the
                    barrack-office with beds, bedding, sheets, blankets, towels, house and stable
                    utensils, coals, and candles; beer was formerly supplied, but now an allowance
                    is made instead of it. Forage is supplied by the commissariat.</p>
                <p>The expense of erecting barracks must of course greatly depend on the price of
                    materials at the time, and, in some measure, on the part of the kingdom where
                    they are erected. In the year 1805 permanent barracks for a battalion of 800
                    men, in the south of England, cost L.37,000; and barracks for 1200 infantry and
                    400 cavalry L.60,000. The following statement exhibits the several particulars </p>

                <p>During the last war the annual expense of the barrack establishment in Great
                    Britain varied from L.350,000 to L.500,000. But in Ireland, where barracks are
                    more numerous, the expense generally equalled, and often exceeded, that of Great
                    Britain in this particular. Thus, in 1814, the sum required for Great Britain
                    was L.309,826, whilst that necessary for Ireland was L.360,515; and a similar
                    excess appears in the peace estimate for 1816, which was for Great Britain
                    L.173,500, and for Ireland L.213,000. Since this period the annual expense has
                    of course varied, though within limits so narrow that it seems unnecessary to
                    particularize the sums voted for the service of each year. The barrack estimate
                    of 1828 was, for Great Britain and the colonies L. 105,963, and for Ireland
