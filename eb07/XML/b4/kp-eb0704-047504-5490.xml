                <p><label type="entry">BEATTIE, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label>, LL. D., a
                    distinguished moralist and poet, was born on the 25th of October 1735, at
                    Laurencekirk, then an obscure hamlet, in the county of Kincardine in Scotland;
                    near which place his father rented a small farm. He received his early education
                    at the common school of the parish, of which it is recorded that Ruddiman had
                    been teacher in it about forty years before. His acquirements are said to have
                    been interrupted at this time by want of books; a difficulty which has excited
                    commiseration in more instances than that of Beattie, but which is so little
                    able to control natural genius, that it seems almost an incitement to its
                    exertions; as “all impediments in fancy’s course are motives to more fancy.” He
                    first became acquainted with English versification through Ogilby’s translation
                    of Virgil.</p>
                <p>By his father’s death he had been thrown, while yet of tender age, on the care of
                    his elder brother, David Beattie; who, observing his natural endowments,
                    afforded him, notwithstanding his own limited means, every aid in his power
                    towards a liberal education, and, in the year 1749, placed him at Marischal
                    College, Aberdeen, where he soon afterwards obtained a bursary or exhibition.
                    Here he had the advantage of pursuing his studies under Dr Thomas Blackwell,
                    author of the <hi rend="italic">Life of Homer,</hi> Dr Gerard, and other eminent
                    men. In addition to his academical course, he began at this time to instruct
                    himself in the Italian language; and appears to have had a strong predilection
                    for Metastasio.</p>
                <p>In 1753 he was appointed schoolmaster of Fordoun, a small village at the foot of
                    the Grampian Mountains, where he likewise performed the duty of precentor, or
                    parish clerk, usually attached to that office in Scotland. Here he indulged the
                    propensities of the youthful poet, and frequently wandered during a whole night
                    in the fields, “chewing the cud of sweet and bitter fancy ;” and it was from a
                    height in this neighbourhood that his eye first caught a glimpse of the ocean.
                    From the scenery of this secluded spot he appears to have derived, as might be
                    expected, many of those images which he afterwards transferred into his poetical
                    compositions; and, certainly, no exertion <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195503"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5503-0476"/>of the inventive powers can furnish
                    representations equal to these immediate copies from nature. Such is that
                    picture in the small poem which he calls <hi rend="italic">Retirement.</hi></p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> Thy shades, thy silence, now be mine, </l>
                    <l part="N"> Thy charms my only theme; </l>
                    <l part="N"> My haunt the hollow cliff, whose pine </l>

                </lg>
                <l part="N"><hi rend="italic">To more profound repose.</hi></l>
                <p>Such also, among many others in the <hi rend="italic">Minstrel,</hi> are those
                    beautiful pictures contained in the 20th and 21st stanzas of the first
                    canto.</p>
                <p>In this recluse place Beattie was discovered and noticed by Mr Garden, afterwards
                    Lord Gardenstown, then sheriff of the county, and by Lord Monboddo. In 1757 he
                    became a candidate for the situation of usher in the grammar-school of Aberdeen.
                    He was at this time foiled in the competition; but next year, on occasion of a
                    new vacancy, he was requested to accept the office. Lastly, he was removed, in
                    1760, to the professorship of Moral Philosophy and Logic in the Marischal
                    College. Here he passed the remainder of his life, occupied in the zealous
                    discharge of his professional' duties, and in literary pursuits. Here, too, he
                    possessed all the advantages of a congenial society in the company of Dr George
                    Campbell, Dr Reid, Dr Gerard, and other men of genius and learning, who then
                    adorned the university of Aberdeen.</p>
                <p>His first publication was a small collection, entitled <hi rend="italic">Original
                    Poems and Translations,</hi> which was printed in 1760 or 1761. Of many of the
                    pieces contained in this little volume he was afterwards ashamed, and not only
                    omitted them in the subsequent selections which he published, but endeavoured,
                    as far as possible, to obliterate all traces and recollection of them. Of these
                    lesser pieces <hi rend="italic">The Hermit</hi> is best known; and though it
                    cannot be considered as a finished composition, is full of pathos and beauty. In
                    <hi rend="italic">The Battle of the Pigmies and Cranes,</hi> translated from the
                    Latin of Addison, he has displayed a greater command of terse and happy
                    expression than in most of his original pieces.</p>
                <p>Mr Beattie was married, in 1767, to Miss Mary Dun, daughter of Dr James Dun,
                    rector of the grammar-school of Aberdeen. This connection, at first every way
                    auspicious for his happiness, proved, in the sequel, a source of the deepest
                    distress; for, in the course of a few years, Mrs Beattie,-whose mother had
                    laboured under a similar malady, showed unequivocal symptoms of mental disorder,
                    which terminated in a state of confirmed insanity.</p>
                <p>In the year 1770 Mr Beattie published his <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Nature
                    and Immutability of Truth in opposition to Sophistry and Scepticism.</hi> His
                    design was “to prove the universality and immutability of moral sentiment and
                    his motives for the undertaking are sufficiently evident from the title which he
                    has prefixed to the book. He appears to have been particularly encouraged to the
                    prosecution of this task by the opinions of Dr John Gregory and Dr Blacklock. A
                    general outline of the work, which appeared in most of the journals previously
                    to its publication, was prepared by the latter. His original intention, as
                    expressed by himself in one of his letters, was, “first, to have considered the
                    permanency of truth in general and, secondly, to have applied the principles
                    which he should have established “to the illustration of certain truths of
                    morality and religion, to which the reasonings of Helvetius, of Mr Hume in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Essays,</hi> and of some other modern philosophers, seemed
                    unfavourable.” Of this plan the former part only was completed. It is well known
                    that, in the execution of it, the author did not spare the opinions of those
                    whom he considered the enemies of religious and moral truth, and particularly
                    treated the writings of Mr Hume without reserve or qualification. The friends of
                    the latter took up arms in return, repre∙ senting the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essay</hi> as a piece of personal and unprovoked hostility; and, some time
                    after, the opinions which it contained were canvassed in a more public manner,
                    and with much severity, in an <hi rend="italic">Examination</hi> by Dr
                    Priestley. These attacks or retaliations were met by Beattie with the same
                    firmness which he had displayed in the original publication of his sentiments;
                    nor would he ever consent to abate either the plainness or spirit with which he
                    had expressed them.</p>
                <p>In proportion to the censure which this publication called forth from a certain
                    number of persons, was its favourable reception with a different class. It was
                    the means of gaining for its author the unsolicited good offices of George Lord
                    Lyttelton, Dr Johnson, Hurd bishop of Worcester, Percy bishop of Dromore, and
                    many others. From the great success of the work, a second edition of it was
                    called for in 1771. Mr Beattie visited London in the same year, and again in
                    1773. On the last of these occasions he received some flattering marks of public
                    notice and distinction. He had the honour of being admitted to a private and
                    long interview with their majesties; received from the university of Oxford an
                    honorary degree of doctor of laws at the same time with Sir Joshua Reynolds; and
                    was afterwards requested by the latter to sit for his portrait. The reputation
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Essay,</hi> and still more, perhaps, the motives and
                    general character of the author, likewise procured for him about this time a
                    yearly pension of L.200 from the crown.</p>
                <p>In tfie course of the same year, 1773, he published the first part of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Minstrel, ar the Progressof Genius;</hi> to which he added a
                    second part in 1774. His object, as described by himself, was “to trace the
                    progress of a poetical genius, born in a rude age, from the first dawning of
                    fancy and reason, till that period at which he may be supposed capable of
                    appearing in the world as a minstrel; that is, as an itinerant poet and
                    musician; a character which, according to the notion of our forefathers, was not
                    only respectable, but sacred.” It appears from his letters, that he little
                    anticipated the favourable reception which this poem obtained from the public; a
                    doubt which was probably founded on the want of incident and variety of
                    character in the composition. Its merit, however, was quickly acknowledged; and
                    by it the author’s reputation as a poet and a man of genius was raised to its
                    height.</p>
                <p>On occasion of a vacancy which occurred soon after in the chair of Natural and
                    Experimental Philosophy at Edinburgh, it was proposed that Dr Beattie should
                    become a candidate; to which step he was strongly urged by some of his friends,
                    particularly Lord Hailes. And, about the same period, he received various offers
                    of preferment in the English church. These plans of promotion, however, he
                    successively declined, considering the situation which he held as best adapted
                    to his abilities, and affording him the greatest opportunities of usefulness.
                    His reluctance to accept <hi rend="italic">a</hi> chair in the university of
                    Edinburgh arose partly, indeed, from the remaining effect of those heats which
                    controversial metaphysics had produced. “I am so great a lover of peace,” he
                    says in a letter to one of his friends on this occasion, “and so willing to
                    think well of my neighbours, that I do not wish to be connected with one person
                    who dislikes me.”</p>
                <p>Between the years 1780 and 1793 he published his <hi rend="italic">Elements of
                    Moral Science,</hi> and various other works, moral and critical, which are well
                    known, and deservedly popular. He enjoyed the acquaintance and friendship of
                    many distinguished characters, in different classes of society· Among his
                    literary correspondents in England were Bishop <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193195516" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5516-0477"/>Porteus, Mrs Montagu, Scott
                    the poet of Amwell, and Mr Gray. He was intrusted by the latter, in 1768, with
                    superintending an edition of his poems, printed by Foulis.</p>
                <p>During the latter period of his life Dr Beattie experienced a new train of
                    domestic calamities, which, added to the unfortunate situation of Mrs Beattie,
                    gradually undermined his health and impaired his intellectual powers. The first
                    and severest of these trials was the loss of his eldest son, James Hay Beattie,
                    who died in 1790; in whose society he had found one of his greatest enjoyments,
                    and who had already been associated with him in the professorship of Moral
                    Philosophy, at the early age of 19.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>An interesting account of his life and character, by Dr
                    Beattie, with a small collection of his compositions in prose and verse, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> was</hi> published in the year 1800.</p></note> Some years
                    after, his only remaining son, Montagu Beattie, likewise died, after a short
                    illness. This event he intimated to one of his friends, by a letter written on
                    the same day, in the terms of calm and unaffected resignation. But his mind had
                    been violently shaken, even before this blow; and, when he looked on the dead
                    body of his son for the last time, he gave way to the scene, and exclaimed, <hi
                    rend="italic">“Now I</hi> have done with this world.” Its first effect was the
                    loss of memory respecting his deceased son. Yet it was found that, by the
                    mention of what the latter had suffered during his sickness, his recollection
                    could usually be recalled. He continued to discharge his duty as professor; but,
                    notwithstanding some returns of a more vigorous intellect and fancy, he did not
                    from this time resume his studies, and seldom answered the letters which he
                    received. He was attacked with palsy in 1799, and afterwards sustained repeated
                    shocks, the last in 1802. He lingered till the 18th of August 1803, when he
                    expired at the age of 68. A particular account of his life and writings, by Sir
                    William Forbes of Pitsligo, who had long been his friend and confidant, was
                    published in 1806, in which are to be found some interesting selections from his
                    private correspondence.</p>
                <p>The character of Dr Beattie is delineated in his writings, of which the most
                    prominent features are purity of sentiment, and warm attachment to the
                    principles of religion and morality. His dispositions were gentle and modest,
                    and he possessed great tenderness of heart. He was laborious in his literary
                    pursuits, yet fond at all times of conversation and society. Towards the latter
                    period of his life he was subject to an irritability of nerves, by which his
                    temper was sensibly affected; and though, to appearance, his bodily frame was
                    robust, he had impaired his strength by excess in study. He possessed
                    considerable talents both for music and drawing.</p>
                <p>His abilities as a writer may be said to have already undergone that ultimate
                    test which is to be found in public opinion; and it has ranked him high as a
                    moralist, a critic, and a poet. His <hi rend="italic">Essay on Truth</hi> became
                    a very popular book, particularly in England, and has gone through many
                    editions. It must be confessed that this work is not, without considerable
                    faults as a philosophical composition. Its leading doctrine has been thus stated
                    by himself: “As we know nothing of the eternal relations of things, <hi
                    rend="italic">that</hi> to us is and must be <hi rend="italic">truth,</hi> which
                    we feel that we must believe; and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> to us is
                    falsehood, which we feel that we must disbelieve. I have shown that all genuine
                    reasoning does ultimately terminate in certain principles, which it is
                    impossible to disbelieve, and as impossible to prove; that, therefore, the
                    ultimate standard of truth to us is common sense, or that instinctive conviction
                    into which all true reasoning does resolve itself.” It is now generally admitted
                    that, in the illustration of this doctrine, which is conformable in substance to
                    that of Reid, Dr Beattie has fallen into some errors, or at least ambiguities,
                    which the former has been enabled in a greater degree to avoid. What constitutes
                    the chief defect of the <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi> is a want of that
                    strictness and precision which a discussion of the metaphysical parts of the
                    subject necessarily requires. He has used the term <hi rend="italic">common
                    sense</hi> with more latitude, and in a greater variety of significations, than
                    is consistent with exact or conclusive reasoning; and he has stated some
                    propositions too generally, and without the limitations which they seem to
                    require. Notwithstanding this imperfection of the work, when considered strictly
                    as a logical treatise, it is certain that many of the fundamental doctrines
                    delivered in it carry with them an irresistible weight, which subsequent inquiry
                    and discussion have tended, not to diminish, but increase. It may justly be
                    considered as an example, in probable reasoning, of that indirect but conclusive
                    mode of proof which, in mathematical science, is usually termed <hi
                    rend="italic">reductio ad absurdum;</hi> a form which has been frequently and
                    successfully employed by Dr Reid for similar purposes. A reference to the
                    sources of knowledge possessed by mankind in general, and to their common or
                    universal sentiments, is an appeal regarding certain acknowledged facts, as an
                    ingredient and ground-work of science. Nor is it to be supposed that, in these
                    cases, philosophy surrenders her judgment to the popular opinion; but∙only, that
                    the conclusions of the soundest and the most improved reason are conformable to
                    the dictates of our faculties, as they are exercised by the majority of mankind.
                    The materials of knowledge possessed by the philosopher and the vulgar are the
                    same; it is in the extent of the inferences which are drawn from them, in their
                    combination, and in the uses to which they are applied, that the disproportion
                    is to be found. In their reasoning on mixed subjects, and in the power of remote
                    calculation, men differ infinitely; in their immediate judgments they differ
                    very little.</p>
                <p>It is undeniable, also, with respect to the' style of this work, that Dr Beattie
                    has fallen into an error, by using, oń various occasions, a greater keenness of
                    expression than is at all suited to the argumentative parts of his subject. An
                    author may, indeed, be moved by a commendable feeling of indignation to commence
                    the task of writing, whatever be the subject of discussion. But he who attempts
                    to conduct a train of reasoning while under the immediate influence even of a
                    just passion, engages in too difficult a matter, and foregoes many advantages.
                    The truth is, that the metaphysical speculations of Berkeley and Hume had
                    proceeded so far in contradicting the ordinary apprehensions and feelings of
                    mankind, as to prove, in the clearest manner, even to men of science, the
                    impossibility of obtaining certain knowledge, by any exercise of the human
                    intellect, altogether abstracted from the information of matter and the
                    employment of our other faculties; and those consequences with regard to
                    morality, religion, and the social state, which appeared to flow as a necessary
                    result from the speculative principles, particularly of Mr Hume, roused in a
                    large class, both of the learned and unlearned, a sense of repugnance and
                    opposition proportionally strong. Dr Beattie was among the first who endeavoured
                    to resist the current of these opinions. His book was polemical; and that warmth
                    of language, which he has not studied to repress, must be ascribed to these
                    circumstances, if it cannot be defended by them.</p>
                <p>But the objections in question are not applicable to any of his other works. It
                    is impossible here to enter into a further detail of these various publications.
                    His <hi rend="italic">Elements of Moral Science,</hi> and his different critical
                    and philological treatises, are compositions of a very pleasing character<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193195529" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5529-0478"/>; and it was
                    chiefly by them that his reputation was established in other countries. Some of
                    his books were early translated into the Dutch and other languages. A French
                    translation of his <hi rend="italic">Essays on Poetry and Music</hi> was printed
                    at Paris in 1798. But it is chiefly as the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Minstrel</hi> that Beattie is known, and will continue to be admired. This
                    poem, or rather poetical fragment, for the design was not completed, stands
                    fully confirmed in the public favour; and it is sufficient to say, that, in
                    beauty both of sentiment and imagery, it stands in the first class of poetical
                    compositions. It would be difficult perhaps to select, from the body of English
                    verse, any single passage which excels this stanza in the first part :—</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N" rend="indent1"> O, how can’st thou renounce the boundless store </l>

                    <l part="N" rend="indent1"> The pomp of groves, and garniture<note

                        this word should have been objected to by Gray, in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Critique,</hi> communicated to the author previously to the publication of
                        the <hi rend="italic">Minstrel.</hi> His reluctance to admit a term which
                        could only be rendered objectionable by being ranked with none but those of
                        the highest and purest class in poetry, would of itself be a sufficient
                        tribute to the diction of this beautiful passage. But Gray does ample
                        justice to the whole stanza: “This,” lie exclaims, “is true poetry; this is
                        inspiration.”</p></note> of fields; </l>

                </lg>
                <p>It has been objected to the second part of the <hi rend="italic">Minstrel</hi>
                    that it contains too much philosophy. But, though the instruction conveyed in it
                    be frequently addressed to the understanding, it is never abstruse, and the
                    lessons are those of a poet not less than of a moralist. Like the <hi
                    rend="italic">Castle of Indolence,</hi> it is in scope and design a didactic
                    piece. Both commence in the highest strain of descriptive and pathetic poetry;
                    and the subsequent depression of tone in both is a necessary result of this
                    lofty preparation. But the criticism is more just when applied to the work of
                    Thomson than to the <hi rend="italic">Minstrel.</hi></p>
                <p>Dr Beattie’s style is classical, and always perspicuous. He was never weary of
                    retouching what he wrote; the chief secret of good composition, without which,
                    at least, no composition can be rendered complete. He deserves, above all, that
                    which is the greatest praise of an author, that no one can read his works with a
                    candid mind, and rise from the perusal unimproved.</p>
                <p>The following is a list of Dr Beattie’s writings: Poems, first published in 1760;
                    Essay on Truth, 1771; Minstrel, 1771, 1774; Essays, viz. On Poetry and Music—On
                    Laughter and Ludicrous Composition—On Classical Learning, 1776; Dissertations,
                    viz. On Memory and Imagination—On Dreaming—On the Theory of Language—On Fable
                    and Romance—On the Attachments of Kindred— and Illustrations of Sublimity, 1783;
                    Evidences of Christianity, 1786; and Elements of Moral Science, 1790, 1793. He
                    likewise published, in 1790, an edition of Mr Addison’s papers in the <hi

                    Religion,</hi> with his <hi rend="italic">Life of Tichell,</hi> and some
