                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BANTAM</label>, a town of Java, capital of a district of the
                    same name, at the north-western extremity of the island, situated on the Bay of
                    Bantam, near the mouth of a river which falls into the bay. It was once a large,
                    rich, and flourishing city, but now exhibits nothing except ruins, the memorials
                    of its departed greatness. It is about 61 miles west from Batavia, and is
                    situated on a low, swampy beach, surrounded by jungle, and intersected with
                    stagnant streams, so that its climate is even more unhealthy than that of
                    Batavia. The king formerly resided in a kind of palace built in the European
                    style, within an old ruinous fort, containing 80 pieces of cannon; and
                    contiguous to it was the Dutch fort. All these fortifications, both European and
                    native, the Dutch fort as well as the sultan’s fort, are levelled with the
                    ground; and the few European habitations which have not been pulled down are
                    falling fast into decay, and totally deserted. The court of the sultan, who
                    resided here, had dwindled into insignificance, and the high-sounding title was
                    merely retained. After Batavia surrendered to the British arms in 1812, this
                    kingdom was in a state of great distraction; wherefore the British government of
                    Batavia interfered in favour of the rightful heir, and restored him to the
                    throne. Since that period the sultan, from apathy, and labouring under disease,
                    has wholly resigned the government of Bantam, and voluntarily retired on a
                    pension assigned him by the British, who took into their own hands the
                    management of the country. In former times Bantam was a free port, open to the
                    commerce of all nations. In 1683 the trade was monopolized by the Dutch, who
                    erected Fort Spielwyk, to shut out all other merchants. This odious policy
                    excited great discontents among the people, who were always the bitter enemies
                    of the Dutch; but they were unable to shake off the yoke of their oppressors,
                    who, about the year 1742, had succeeded in completely establishing their
                    authority. The Bay of Bantam was formerly a commodious retreat for vessels; but
                    it is now so choked up with daily accessions of new earth washed down from the
                    mountains, as well as by coral shoals extending a considerable way to the
                    eastward, that it is inaccessible to vessels of any considerable burden. Prior
                    to the Dutch conquest, Bantam was a powerful state, the sovereign of which
                    extended his conquests in the neighbouring islands of Borneo and Sumatra. The
                    trade in pepper is the most considerable carried on here. Long, of the town of
                    Bantam, 106. 3. E. Lat. 6. 4. S.</p>
