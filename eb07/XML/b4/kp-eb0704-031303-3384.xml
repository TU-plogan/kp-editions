                <p><label type="entry">BALBEC</label>, a city of Asia, in Syria, anciently called
                    <hi rend="italic">Heliopolis,</hi> and by the Arabians, “The Wonder of Syria.”
                    It is situated at the foot of Anti-Libanus, on the last rising ground where the
                    mountain terminates in the plain.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193397" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3397-0314"/>
                <p>From the south, the city is first discovered at the distance of about a league
                    and a half, behind a hedge of trees, over the verdant tops of which appears a
                    white edging of domes and minarets. After about an hour’s journey the traveller
                    reaches these trees, which are very fine walnuts; and soon after, crossing some
                    ill-cultivated gardens by winding paths, arrives at the entrance of the city.
                    Here he perceives a ruined wall, flanked with square towers, which ascends the
                    declivity to the right, and traces out the precincts of the ancient city. This
                    wall, which is only ten or twelve feet in height, admits a view of those void
                    spaces and heaps of ruins which are invariable characteristics of every Turkish
                    city; but what principally attracts attention is a large edifice on the left,
                    which, by its lofty walls and rich columns, is soon recognised as one of those
                    temples which antiquity has left for our admiration. These ruins, which are
                    among the most beautiful and best preserved of any in Asia, merit a particular
                    description. .</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To</hi> form a just idea of them, the reader must imagine
                    himself descending from the interior of the town. After Grossing the rubbish and
                    huts with which it is filled, the first thing deserving of notice is a vacant
                    space, which appears to have been a square: there, in front, towards the west,
                    is a grand ruin, consisting of two pavilions ornamented with pilasters, joined
                    at their lower angle by a wall 160 feet in length. This front commands the open
                    country from a sort of terrace, on the edge of which are with difficulty
                    distinguished the bases of twelve columns, which formerly extended from the one
                    pavilion to the other, and formed a portico The principal gate is obstructed by
                    heaps of stones; but, that obstacle surmounted, the traveller enters an empty
                    space, which is a hexagonal court of 180 feet in diameter. This court is strewed
                    with broken columns, mutilated capitals, and the remains of pilasters,
                    entablatures, and cornices; and around it is a row of ruined edifices, which
                    display all the ornaments of the richest architecture. At the end of this court,
                    opposite the west, is an outlet, which formerly was a gate, through which is
                    perceived a still more extensive range of ruins, the magnificence of which
                    strongly excites curiosity. To have a full prospect of these, it is necessary to
                    ascend a slope, at the top of which is the entrance of a square court, much more
                    spacious than the former, being 350 feet in width and 336 in length. The eye is
                    first attracted to the end of this court, where are six enormous and majestic
                    columns nearly entire. Another object not less interesting is a second range of
                    columns to the left, which appear to have formed part of the peristyle of a
                    temple. But the edifices which inclose this court on either side claim attention
                    in the first instance. These form a sort of gallery containing various chambers,
                    seven of which may be reckoned in each of the principal wings, namely, two in a
                    semicircle, and five in an oblong square. The base of the apartments still
                    retains pediments of niches and tabernacles, the supporters of which have been
                    destroyed. On the side of the court they are open, while four columns on the one
                    side and six on the other have been totally destroyed. It is not easy to
                    conceive the use of these apartments; but this does not lessen the admiration
                    excited by the beauty of their pilasters and the richness of the frieze of the
                    entablature. Neither is it possible to avoid remarking the singular effect which
                    results from the mixture of the garlands, the large foliage of the capitals, and
                    the sculpture of wild plants, with which they are everywhere ornamented. In the
                    middle of the court is a little square esplanade, where anciently stood a
                    pavilion, of which nothing how remains but the foundation. With regard to the
                    six columns above mentioned, it is impossible to survey them without being
                    struck with the boldness of their elevation and. the richness of their
                    workmanship. Their shafts are twenty-one feet eight inches in circumference, and
                    fifty, eight in height; so that the total height, including the entablature, is
                    from seventy-one to seventy-two feet. The sight of this superb ruin, thus
                    solitary and desolate, is exceedingly imposing; but a more attentive examination
                    discovers a series of foundations, marking an oblong square of 268 feet in
                    length and 146 in width, which probably formed the peristyle of a grand temple,
                    the primary purpose of this whole structure. It presented to the great court,
                    that is, to the east, a front of ten columns, with nineteen on each side; which,
                    with the six already mentioned, make in all fifty-four. The ground on which it
                    stood is an oblong square, on a level with the court, but considerably narrower,
                    so that there was only a terrace of twenty-seven feet wide round the colonnade;
                    while the esplanade thus produced fronts the open country towards the west, by a
                    sloping wall of about thirty feet. In approaching the city this descent becomes
                    less steep, so that the foundation of the pavilion is on a level with the
                    termination of the hill; whence it is evident that the whole ground of the
                    courts has been artificially raised. Such seems to have been the former state of
                    this edifice; but the southern side of the grand temple was afterw ards blocked
                    up in order to build a smaller one, the peristyle and walls of which are still
                    remaining. This temple, situated somewhat lower than the other, presents a side
                    of thirteen columns by eight in front, or thirty-four in all, which are likewise
                    of the Corinthian order, their shafts being fifteen feet eight inches in
                    circumference, and forty-four feet in height. The building they surround is an
                    oblong square, the front of which, turned towards the east, is out of the line
                    of the left wing of the great court. To reach it the traveller must cross trunks
                    of columns, heaps of stone, and a ruinous wall, by which it is now hid. After
                    surmounting these obstacles he arrives at the gate, where he may survey the
                    inclosure which was once the habitation of a god; but, instead of the awful
                    scene of a prostrate people, and sacrifices offered by a multitude of priests,
                    the sky is seen through the open roof, which lets in light enough to show a
                    chaos of ruins covered with dust and weeds. The walls, formerly enriched with
                    all the ornaments of the Corinthian order, now present nothing but pediments of
                    niches and tabernacles, of which almost all the supporters have fallen to the
                    ground. Between these niches is a range of fluted pilasters, the capitals of
                    which support a broken entablature; but what remains displays a rich frieze of
                    foliage resting on the heads of satyrs, horses, bulls, and other animals. Oyer
                    this entablature was the ancient roof, which was 57 feet in width and 110 in
                    length. The walls which supported it are thirty-one feet high, and without a
                    window. It is impossible to form any idea of the ornaments of this roof, except
                    from the fragments lying on the ground; but it could scarcely have been richer
                    in ornament than the gallery of the peristyle. The principal remaining parts
                    contain tablets in the form of lozenges, on which are represented Jupiter seated
                    on his eagle, Leda caressed by the swan, Diana with her bow and crescent, and
                    several busts of emperors and empresses. It is unnecessary to enter more
                    minutely into the description of this astonishing edifice. The lovers of the
                    arts will find it described with the greatest truth and accuracy in a work
                    published at London in 1757, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Ruins of
                    Palbec.</hi> This work, compiled by Mr Robert Wood, the world owes to the
                    attention and liberality of Mr Dawkins, who, in 1751, visited Balbec and
                    Palmyra. Several changes, however, have taken place since their journey, and
                    some of the columns then standing have been overturned or destroyed.</p>
                <p>When we consider the extraordinary magnificence of the temple of Balbec, we
                    cannot but be astonished at <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193410"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-3410-0315"/>the silence of the Greek and Roman authors
                    respecting it. Mr Wood, who carefully examined all the ancient writers, has
                    found no mention of it except in a fragment of John ’of Antioch, who attributes
                    the construction of this edifice to Antoninus Pius. The inscriptions that remain
                    corroborate this opinion; which, moreover, accounts for the constant use of the
                    Corinthian order, since that order was not in general use before the third age
                    of Rome. But we ought by no means to allege as an additional proof the bird
                    sculptured over the gate; for if his crooked beak, large claws, and the caduceus
                    he bears, give him the appearance of an eagle, the tuft of feathers on his head,
                    like that of certain pigeons, proves that he is not the Roman ea <hi
                    rend="superscript"> σ</hi> le. Besides, the same bird is found in the temple of
                    Palmyra, and is therefore probably an oriental eagle, consecrated to the Sun,
                    who was the divinity adored in both these temples. Heliolatry existed at Balbec
                    in the most remote antiquity. The statue of the Sun, which resembled that of
                    Osiris, had been transported thither from the Heliopolis of Egypt; and the
                    ceremonies with which he was worshipped there have been described by Macrobius
                    in his curious collection, entitled <hi rend="italic">Saturnalia.</hi> Mr Wood
                    supposes, with reason, that the name of Balbec, which in Syriac signifies “City
                    of Bal,” or of the Sun, originated in this worship. The Greeks, in naming it <hi
                    rend="italic">Heliopolis,</hi> have, therefore, only given a literal translation
                    of the oriental word; a practice to which they have not always adhered. We are
                    ignorant of the state of this city in remote antiquity; but it is to be presumed
                    that its situation on the road from Tyre to Palmyra secured it some part of the
                    commerce of these opulent capitals. Under the Homans, in the time of Augustus,
                    it is mentioned as a garrisoned town; and there is still remaining on the wall
                    of the southern gate, at the right of the entrance, an inscription which proves
                    the truth of this; the words <hi rend="italic">Kent∣ιria Prima,</hi> in Greek
                    characters, being still legible. One hundred and forty years afterwards,
                    Antoninus built the temple above described instead of the ancient one, which was
                    doubtless falling into ruins; but Christianity having gained the ascendency
                    under Constantine, the modern temple was neglected, and afterwards converted
                    into a church, a wall of which, that screened the sanctuary of the idols, is
                    still remaining. It continued thus until the invasion of the Arabs, when the
                    church, being less frequented, fell into decay; and wars succeeding, it was
                    converted into a place of defence: battlements were built on the wall which
                    surrounded it, on the pavilions, and at the angles which still subsist; and from
                    that time the temple, exposed to the casualties of war and continual
                    dilapidation, fell rapidly to ruin.</p>
