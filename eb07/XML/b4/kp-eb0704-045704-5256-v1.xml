                <p>A <hi rend="smallcaps">country</hi> in the south-west of Germany, in former times
                    a margraviate and duchy, afterwards an electorate, and, since 1806, a kingdom of
                    considerable extent. It is situated between the forty-seventh and fifty-first
                    degrees of north latitude, and is of an oblong form, its greatest extent being
                    from north to south. Its breadth is different in different parts, but we may
                    form a tolerably correct idea of the whole by supposing a rectangular tract of
                    country, having 200 miles in length by 140 in breadth. Such a tract would
                    contain a surface equal to the Bavarian territory, exclusive of the distant
                    province on the Rhine: including that province, however, the extent of the
                    kingdom is above 30,000 square miles, or somewhat more than either'Scotland or
                    Ireland.</p>
                <p>The name in German, Baiern, is derived, like its old Latin name Boiaria, from
                    Boii, the name of a people of Celtic origin, who were the inhabitants of this
                    country in the reign of Augustus. It then formed part of the Rhaetia Vindelicia
                    and Noricum of the Romans. After the fall of the Roman power, the natives were
                    governed by military chieftains of their own till the era of Charlemagne, who
                    succeeded in subjugating this as well as most other parts of Germany. After his
                    death, Bavaria was governed by one of his grandsons, whose successors bore the
                    title of Margrave, or Lord of the Marches; Bavaria forming the frontier of the
                    empire to the south and southwest, as Austria did to the east and south. In the
                    year 920 the ruling margrave was raised to the rank of duke, which continued the
                    title of his successors for no less than seven centuries. During this long
                    period Bavaria was connected with .Germany, nationally by language, and
                    politically as a trontier province, but in civilization was almost as backward
                    as Austria, and greatly behind Saxony, Franconia, and the banks of the Rhine. At
                    last, in 1620, a formidable insurrection taking place in Bohemia against
                    Austria, the reigning duke of Bavaria sided with the latter, and having rendered
                    great service to her cause, received an important accession of territory, and
                    was appointed one <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi>. the nine electors of the
                    empire. His successors continued faithful members of the Germanic body and
                    allies θ Austria until the ambitious projects of Louis XIV. of rance led, in the
                    year 1702, to a close connection between iat monarch and the elector; the object
                    of which was to threaten and even attack Austria, so as to prevent her from
                    co-operating efficiently with England and Holland in their great contest with
                    France. This hostile attitude of Bavaria, joined to the insurrectionary
                    movements in Hungary, bore so hard on tb.e emperor as to induce the duke of
                    Marlborough, in the spring of 1704, to march his army above 300 miles, from the
                    banks of the Maese to those of the Danube and Iser. Bavaria was now invaded, and
                    the elector put under the ban of the empire; but he remained firm to his
                    alliance with Louis, and a French army under Marshal Tallard advanced from the
                    Rhine to his relief. It was over this army, joined to a strong Bavarian force,
                    that Marlborough and Prince Eugene obtained the signal victory of Blenheim, on
                    the 13th August 1704. The result was decisive of the fate of the electorate; the
                    French fled to the Rhine; the elector fled with them, and Bavaria was governed
                    by commissioners appointed by the emperor. This state of things lasted ten
                    years; the elector and his remaining military force serving in the French
                    armies, until the peace of Utrecht, or more properly that of Baden, in 1714,
                    reinstated him in his dominions.</p>
                <p>The son and successor of this elector, untaught by the disasters of his father,
                    was induced to renew his connection with France; and, in 1740, on the death of
                    the emperor of Germany, he ventured to come forward as a candidate for the
                    imperial crown. In this he succeeded so far as to be named to that high dignity
                    by a majority of the electors, and to overrun a considerable part of the
                    Austrian territory; but his triumph was of short duration, for the armies of
                    Maria Theresa, aided by English subsidies, came forward in superior numbers, and
                    not only repulsed the Bavarians, but obtained, in 1744, possession of the
                    electorate. The elector died soon after, and his son recovered his dominions
                    only by renouncing the ambitious pretensions of his father.</p>
                <p>Bavaria now remained tranquil above thirty years, until 1778, when, by the death
                    of the reigning elector, the younger line of the house of Wittelsbach, the line
                    which had long ruled in Bavaria, became extinct. The next heir was the Elector
                    Palatine, the representative of the elder line of the family of W <hi
                    rend="superscript"> τ</hi> ittelsbach; but Austria unexpectedly laid claim to
                    the succession, and took military possession of part of the country. This called
                    into the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195269?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5269-0458"/> field, on the side of Bavaria, Frederic II. of
                    Prussia, then advanced in years. The armies on each side were formidable and
                    well commanded; they made many threatening marches and counter-marches, but
                    happily no bloodshed took place; and at last Austria desisted from her
                    pretensions, on obtaining from Bavaria the cession of the frontier district
                    called the Inn-viertel, or Quarter of the Inn.</p>
                <p>Bavaria again remained at peace for many years, until the great contest between
                    Germany and France began in 1793, when she was obliged to furnish her contingent
                    as a member of the empire. During three years her territory was untouched, the
                    operations being carried on in the Netherlands and on the Rhine; but in the
                    summer of 1796, a powerful French army under Moreau advancing and occupying her
                    capital, the consequence was a separate treaty with France, and the withdrawing
                    of her contingent from the army of the empire. The next war between France and
                    Austria, begun in 1799, was comparatively short; but ending disastrously for the
                    latter, the influence of France in the empire was greatly strengthened, so that
                    in 1805, when the Austrians, subsidized by England, once more took up arms,
                    Bavaria was the firm ally of France, and for the first time found advantage in
                    the connection. In the short space of three months, the victories of Ulm and
                    Austerlitz enabled Buonaparte to prescribe the conditions of peace, and to
                    confer on his electoral ally the title of king, along with very considerable
                    additions of territory.</p>
                <p>These substantial acquisitions rendered Bavaria the willing assistant of France
                    in the invasion of Prussia in the subsequent autumn. The battle of Jena took
                    place, and a further increase of territory to Bavaria followed at the peace of
                    Tilsit. The consequence was, that in 1809, when the absence in Spain of a great
                    part of the French military force encouraged Austria again to try the hazard of
                    war, the Bavarian troops were wholly at the disposal of Buonaparte, and formed a
                    main part of the great army with which he defeated the Austrians at Eckmuhl and
                    Wagram. The peace that ensued gave a further aggrandizement to Bavaria; but a
                    few years more showed how dearly it was purchased, when many thousands of her
                    best troops perished in the disastrous retreat from Russia. This sacrifice of
                    lives, and the horror of Buonaparte’s tyranny, excited in Bavaria, as in the
                    rest of Germany, an ardent wish to throw off his yoke. Nor was opportunity long
                    wanting. In the following year (1813) the allied sovereigns advanced into
                    Saxony, and gave assurance to the king of Bavaria, that, in the event of his
                    co-operating vigorously with them against France, he should be maintained in all
                    his late acquisitions. The king received these assurances with satisfaction, but
                    could not in prudence join the allies for some months; at the end of which the
                    retreat of the French from Dresden, and the probability of their falling back to
                    the Rhine, induced him to make an open declaration of hostility against his
                    former allies, and to march'an army to Hanau, on the Maine, the line of their
                    expected retreat. At Hanau, accordingly, in the latter days of October, several
                    obstinate conflicts took place between the Bavarians and the French; and
                    although the latter forced their way, it was with considerable loss. From that
                    time forward Bavaria took a decided part against Buonaparte, and was confirmed
                    in her extended territory by the definitive treaties of 1814 and 1815. She ceded
                    to Austria her ancient possession of the Tyrol, but received equivalents in
                    Franconia and the vicinity of the Rhine.</p>
                <p>We are thus enabled to trace, in the succession of events, the progressive
                    extension of this state from an early age. The duchy of Bavaria, or the country
                    which was subject to the dukes during the middle ages, and before they were
                    raised to the rank of electors, was the southern half of the present kingdom,
                    and lay almost all to the south of the Danube. This is the Bavaria of our old
                    maps, nearly square in its form, extending about 100 miles from the Danube to
                    the Tyrol, and somewhat more from Suabia on the west to Austria on the east. To
                    this limited territory an important addition was made after 1620, at the expense
                    of the elector palatine, who having taken an active part in the great
                    insurrection in Bohemia against Austria, forfeited both his title and his
                    dominions to the duke of Bavaria. His dominions consisted of what was called the
                    Upper Palatinate, a province of full 3000 square miles, situated to the north of
                    the Danube. This country, joined to the duchy of Bavaria, constituted during a
                    century and a half (from 1623 to 1778) the dominions of the elector; their
                    territorial extent being about 15,000 square miles, and their population, in the
                    beginning of that period, less than 1,000,000, but towards its close about
                    1,500,000. During the seventeenth century this secondary state was in general
                    the ally of Austria, a willing assistant of the head of the empire; but during
                    the eighteenth it ventured, as we have seen, with the aid of France, to enter
                    the lists against its powerful neighbour.</p>
                <p>In 1778 the succession of the Rhenish branch of the reigning family added to the
                    former territory of Bavaria the palatinate of the Rhine, a district of no great
                    extent, but fertile and populous. By this time the nation, hitherto illiterate
                    and backward, became fit for improved institutions, and was fortunate in the
                    character of two successive rulers. She was thus increasing gradually her
                    productive industry and political weight, when, in 1806, her progress received a
                    sudden impulse from political causes. Buonaparte had long laboured to weaken the
                    ascendancy of the greater over the lesser states of the empire; and in 1806 the
                    overthrow, first of Austria, afterwards of Prussia, enabled him to make a very
                    large addition to the territory of his German allies, above all of Bavaria. This
                    was obtained chiefly in Franconia, a country which, being contiguous to Bavaria,
                    and similar to it in soil and climate, is, in general, more advanced both in
                    agriculture and manufactures. The valuable districts, or circles as they are
                    termed by the Bavarian government, of the Lower Maine and the Rezat, with part
                    of those of the Upper Maine and Upper Danube, were all obtained on this
                    occasion; not to mention the Tyrol, as it was afterwards restored to
                    Austria.</p>

                <p>The extent of forest land in Bavaria is double that of the forest land of France,
                    and more than six times that of the land under wood in Great Britain. This is
                    owing to various causes; the great extent of hilly and mountainous country, the
                    insufficient population, and the necessity of keeping a given extent of ground
                    in wood for a supply of fuel. There are, besides, many spots and even districts
                    in the forest lands which are under cultivation for flax, corn, and potatoes.
                    The forests are partly public, partly private property; the former, being the
                    portion under the management of the government, is very considerable, yielding a
                    revenue to the state, and enabling many thousand persons to derive a livelihood
                    from the care of them.</p>
                <p>The frontier of Bavaria on the north-east, towards Bohemia, consists of a long
                    range of mountains; and there are also very extensive chains in the neighbouring
                    part of Franconia. These, however, seldom exceed the height of 3000 or 4000
                    feet; but the ridges in a very different part of the kingdom,—we mean those on
                    the south, which separate it from the Tyrol,—partake of all the grandeur of the
                    Alps, several of them being from 9000 to 10,000 feet in height; an elevation
                    approaching to that of AEtna, and more than double that of the highest mountains
                    in Scotland.</p>
                <p>There is a number of lakes in Bavaria, particularly in the mountainous parts. In
                    the low country there are several extensive tracts of marshy ground, as in all
                    half-cultivated countries. Of the rivers of Bavaria the most remarkable is the
                    Danube, which, on entering the frontier from Suabia, is of sufficient size to be
                    navigable, and afterwards traverses the whole breadth of the kingdom, making
                    with its windings a course of 200 miles. In this long space it becomes increased
                    by the successive junction of tĥe Iller, the Lech, the Iser, and the Inn, all
                    flowing northward from the Alps. On the north or Franconian side, the Danube
                    receives the Nab, the Altmuhl, and several smaller streams. Though a
                    considerable river even m this the early part of its course, it is not large
                    enough to make the erection of bridges a work of so great labour <hi
                    rend="superscript"> as</hi> after the influx of the Inn; wherefore there are no
                    less than sixteen bridges across the Danube in the course of its passage through
                    Bavaria.</p>
                <p>The Inn takes its rise in Switzerland, flows through the 1j <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> °l&gt; and being early swelled by the mountain
                    streams to the right and left of its course, is navigable before it enters the
                    Bavarian territory. It then holds a north and northeast course, and receives the
                    Salsa, a large river flowing rom Upper Austria; after which their united waters,
                    beween 200 and 300 yards in breadth, fall into the Danube at Passau. The Iser or
                    Isar has its source in the Tyrolese ps, flows in a curved direction nearly
                    north-east, passes unιch, becomes navigable, and, after receiving several ι <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> ι utary streams, falls into the Danube half-way
                    between atιsbon and Passau. The Lech has a similar course, but L . <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ess</hi> J <hi rend="superscript"> en</hi> gth. In the
                    northern part of the kingdom the ame is the only river of consequence, either
                    for size or for extent of navigation. It traverses Franconia with a very winding
                    course, and greatly facilitates the trade of that province.</p>
                <p>The climate of Bavaria is in general healthy, although the degree of heat, in
                    this as in the neighbouring country of Austria, is very different according to
                    local differences in the elevation of the soil. Hence the cold of Upper Bavaria
                    in the vicinity of the Tyrol, and the warmth of the plains adjoining the Danube
                    and the Maine. On the whole, the temperature of Bavaria is considerably colder
                    than that of England in the winter months, and considerably hotter during the
                    summer and autumn.</p>
                <p>The extent of forest land in every province of Bavaria is such as to supply a
                    great quantity of wood for sale; but the transport of it is in many parts
                    difficult, from the badness of the roads, and on account of the distance from
                    navigable rivers. The forests are chiefly on the hills and mountains; and the
                    level country, as well Lower Bavaria extending northwards to the Danube, as the
                    western and middle parts of Franconia, is very productive in wheat, barley, rye,
                    oats; also in hemp, flax, hops, madder, and, in warm situations, in vines. The
                    last are raised chiefly in the vicinity of the lake of Constance, and on the
                    banks of the Maine in the lower part of its course. On the whole, the best
                    cultivated districts are those in which the descent of streams from the high
                    grounds gives facilities to irrigation. Such is the case in the valley of the
                    Danube and in part of the plains of Franconia; but in most other parts of the
                    kingdom a third and upwards of the arable land remains uncultivated. The
                    quantity of potatoes raised annually in the kingdom has been much increased in
                    the last and present age, particularly in the northern provinces. The Spessart,
                    an extensive tract of forest land in Franconia, formerly neglected, is now
                    rendered very productive in that respect; and hence a great increase of
                    population during the last half-century. Yet, that much remains to be done
                    before justice is rendered to the soil, is evident, since, with a climate fully
                    as good as ours, and a soil inferior only in the mountainous parts, the average
                    population of Bavaria is only half that of England. The government has caused a
                    few of the marshes to be drained; but these are merely incipient operations, a
                    small part of what ought to have been performed.</p>
                <p>The proportion of land under pasture appears to be nearly the same in one circle
                    or province as another. A late return gives the number in the kingdom, of horses
                    at 330,000; of oxen, cows, calves, hogs, 2,000,000; and of sheep, nearly
                    1,200,000. Little attention has as yet been given to the improvement of the
                    breed of horses or oxen. But in sheep considerable progress has been made in
                    adopting that improved treatment which has added so largely to the value of the
                    wool of Saxony.</p>
                <p>The quantity of salt prepared annually in Bavaria is very considerable, being
                    above 30,000 tons. It is obtained partly from brine springs in the circle of the
                    Iser, partly from saltmines at Halle and other parts; which, like most
                    undertakings of magnitude on the Continent, are and must, from want of capital
                    on the part of individuals, be wrought on account of the government.</p>
                <p>In so mountainous a country the quantity of iron ore is naturally very large. The
                    mines are numerous, being 150' in all; but they are on a small scale compared
                    with those of this country, the quantity of iron annually made hardly exceeding
                    60,000 tons. These mines are found in various parts of the kingdom; in the
                    mountains of Franconia, as well as in those of the south of the kingdom. The
                    coalmines are in like manner numerous, but of small extent compared with ours;
                    the yearly produce of fifty mines in the Bavarian dominions being only from
                    60,000 to 70,000 tons. The number of blast furnaces and forges in the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193195295?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5295-0460"/>
                    whole country is about fifty. ^ Of quicksilver there are several mines, chiefly
                    in the province, of the Rhine.</p>
                <p>Manufactures are as yet very backward,, even in articles such as hardware, for
                    which' the raw material is supplied on the spot. Woollens, linens, and in some
                    towns cottons, are made, but of a quality much coarser than the corresponding
                    manufactures of England, or even of the Netherlands. There are a number of mills
                    in Franconia for making paper, in consequence of two very distinct causes, the
                    frequency of water-falls and the cheapness of linen rags. The extent of the
                    forests, and the command of water power, have led to the erection of many
                    saw-mills; there being no less than 2000 in the whole kingdom. Of glass also the
                    quantity annually made is considerable. As to liquor, the climate of Bavaria
                    being in general too cold for the grape, beer is the general drink, and the
                    breweries are very numerous. They, are not, as in England» confined to the large
                    towns; in a country where the means of carriage by water are so limited, they
                    are necessarily established in almost every district. Leather, tobacco, and
                    earthenware, are the other chief articles of manufacture.</p>
                <p>The exports from Bavaria are such as may be expected in a country chiefly
                    agricultural; they consist of salt, timber, cattle, pigs, corn, and madder. The
                    imports consist of sugar, tobacco, cottons, silks, with some woollens, and linen
                    of the finest qualities. The yearly value of the exports is between three and
                    four millions sterling; that of the imports nearly the same. The government,
                    desirous of removing whatever is pernicious, in established usages, abolished,
                    in 1827, the privileges of guilds and coι&gt; porations; but it must do a great
                    deal more before trade can be raised to a flourishing condition. In the whole
                    kingdom there is only one navigable canal, which extends from the Rhine to the
                    level country of Franconia. The old project of joining the Danube and the Rhine
                    by a canal seems impracticable, from the nature of the ground. The high roads in
                    Bavaria extend in all over 5000 miles; and the conveyance of the mails, though
                    far slower than in England, is not altogether so slow as in most parts of the
                    Continent. The government has also set the example of fitting out boats with
                    sails to navigate the Danube. The same may be done on the Inn, the Iser, and the
                    Maine; and, as fuel is not scarce, steam navigation bids fair to be introduced
                    in all of them. But the greatest national benefit would arise from the opening
                    of roads in remote districts, and improving those at present in use, but which
                    are good only in certain districts, such as the vicinity of Munich, Ratisbon,

                <p>The increase of the population of Bavaria, though not accurately ascertained,
                    appears to have been regularly and even rapidly progessive since the beginning
                    of the present century. The causes are probably the same as in this
                    country,—improved agriculture, an extended cultivation of potatoes, vaccination,
                    the more comfortable condition of the poor, and better medical treatment
                    generally. The average mortality in Bavaria is as yet imperfectly ascertained,
                    but it appears to be, as in France, about one in forty of the population. In
                    England it is only one in forty-eight. The chief towns of Bavaria are,</p>

                <p>Munich, the capital of the kingdom, though not built with regularity, is on the
                    whole one of the most interest ing towns of Germany. The river Iser flows past
                    it, and. though not large, is of sufficient size to give animation to the town
                    and its environs. The town contains several squares and a number of public
                    buildings, as well as valuable collections of books, paintings, and medals. Here
                    are a university and a military school, a considerable demand for literary
                    works, a manufactory of porcelain, and other establishments, all indicative of
                    much more attention to objects of education and taste than used to prevail in
                    this formerly unenlightened part of Germany.</p>
                <p>Augsburg has only half the population of Munich, and, being a very old place, has
                    narrow and crooked streets. It is situated in an extensive plain at no great
                    distance from the Lech, which is here a considerable river. Like Nuremberg,
                    Augsburg has long been one of the chief trading towns in the interior of
                    Germany. It is the seat of several manufactures, and of considerable
                    transactions in bills of exchange. For such business merchants fix on a few
                    places at a considerable distance from each other, but centrally situated in
                    regard to particular districts, ln the south and west of Germany, Vienna,
                    Augsburg, and Frankfort on the Maine, are the chief towns for such busn ness,
                    exactly as Hamburg and Berlin are in the north.</p>
                <p>Nuremberg, situated in Franconia, was a place of note as far back as the eleventh
                    century, and, during the middle ages, was the occasional residence of the
                    emperors. The Pegnitz, a considerable but not navigable stream, divides it into
                    two nearly equal parts. Its chief prosperity has arisen from its manufactures,
                    for which it was remarked more than four centuries ago. Among these are toys of
                    all kinds, whether of hardware or wood, most of which are made, not in the town,
                    but in villages situated in the hilly and woody tract between Franconia and
                    Thuringia. The stationary condition of this place and of Augsburg, compared with
                    the rapid growth of manufacturing towns in England, exhibits, in a striking
                    light, our advantages in coal, fuel, and in communication by canals, railways,
                    and turnpike roads, to which there is no parallel in Germany.</p>
                <p>Ratisbon, equally ancient with these towns, owed its increase to a different
                    cause, namely, to the navigation of the Danube, which it once possessed
                    exclusively from Ulm as far as Vienna. Timber, corn, salt, and marl, form the
                    chief articles of transport along the river; and the building of large boats for
                    such navigation, and for sale in the lower part of the river, continues to be a
                    considerable branch of business in this place. The Danube expands here to a
                    width of more than 300 yards; its current is consequently weakened, and, there
                    being an island in its channel, the inhabitants of Ratisbon erected a bridge
                    across it several centuries ago,—a time when the art of bridge-building was very
                    little understood. This facilitated the access to the town, which was the place
                    of assemblage for the Germanic diet during a century and a half previous to
                    1806; the period when the constitution of the empire underwent a great change,
                    and Austria ceased to be at its head.</p>
                <p>Wurzburg, in Franconia, situated on the Maine, is also remarked for its bridge,
                    but its river has only half the width of the Danube. It is the seat of a
                    university, and has a considerable trade; part of which arises from the sale of
                    the wine raised in its neighbourhood. This town, old as it is, must, along with
                    all the places we have mentioned, yield precedence in antiquity to Spires, the
                    cathedral of which contains the ashes of eight of the earlier emperors of
                    Germany, and of as many empresses. Spires was the see of a bishop as early as
                    the fourth century; a time when civilization was unknown on the eastern side of
                    the Rhine, and had reached on the western side only the few towns occupied by
                    the Romans as military stations.</p>

                    of the kingdom, being nearly 100 miles to the westward, and having the Rhine on
                    the east, Worms on the north, Alsace on the south, and Lorraine on the <hi
                    rend="subscript"> w</hi> est∙ This province is an oblong of nearly fifty-five
                    miles by forty; its extent is somewhat above 2000 square miles, and its
                    population (see the foregoing table, p. 458) more dense than that of any other
                    part of the kingdom. Its surface is very uneven, for the Vosges Mountains extend
                    over a part of its territory. In these there are extensive pastures, and, in
                    particular spots, mines of iron, coal, and quicksilver. In the low grounds the
                    products are wheat, oats, barley, and, in the warmer situations, vines. This
                    province, equal in extent to two of our middle-sized counties, is divided into
                    four districts; of which the chief towns are Landau and Deux Ponts in the south,
                    Frankenthal and Kaiserslautern in the north. After the great successes of the
                    French in 1794 and 1795, this district, formerly the palatinate of the Rhine,
                    became, along with the whole country to the left of the Rhine, subject to
                    France, and remained so nearly twenty years, until the overthrow of Buonaparte
                    in 1814. At that memorable juncture it was assigned by the congress of Vienna to
                    Austria, and made over by the latter to Bavaria in the subsequent exchanges.</p>
                <p>It may be proper to explain here what was meant by the Circle of Bavaria,
                    although, like the other circles of the empire, it has now ceased to have a
                    political existence. It comprised the territories as well of the elector of
                    Bavaria as of a number of petty states contiguous to but independent of him,
                    their respective princes being members of the Germanic body. In addition to
                    Bavaria Proper and the Upper Palatinate, the circle comprised the archbishopric
                    of Salzburg and a number of lesser principalities, which are now mediatized or
                    blended with their greater neighbours; but it contained no part of Franconia,
                    which was a circle by itself. The extent of the circle of Bavaria was about
                    17,000 square miles, and its capital was Ratisbon. That city was also the
                    residence of the dukes of Bavaria until the fourteenth century, when the
                    acquisition of the upper country towards the Tyrol induced them to fix their
                    residence at Munich.</p>
                <p>The public revenue of Bavaria is about L.3,000,000 sterling, arising from almost
                    as great a variety of imposts as in this country.</p>

                <p>The exercise of religious worship in Bavaria is altogether free. The Protestants
                    have the same civil rights as the Catholics, and the sovereign may be either
                    catholic or protestant. Civil immunities have not yet been extended to
                    Anabaptists, Moravians, or Jews. The latter follow in this, as in other
                    countries, neither agricultural nor mechanical employments: they are all
                    traffickers in one way or other, the most respectable being merchants, the
                    inferior class brokers and jobbers. Of the catholic church the heads are two
                    archbishops and six bishops; among the protestants the highest authority is the
                    general consistory of Munich.</p>
                <p>Bavaria was formerly as backward in regard to educa tion as Austria or any part
                    of the south of Germany; but, in the course of the last and present age
                    considerable efforts have been made to lessen the prevailing ignorance. At
                    Munich there are scientific and literary academies, as well as a university, a
                    lyceum, a gymnasium, and other public schools. The university has a very
                    numerous attendance<pb break="no" facs="nls:193195321?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5321-0462"/> of students, namely, about 1800; and there are
                    two provincial universities on a small scale, one catholic at Wurzburg, the
                    other protestant at Erlangen in Franconia. In the kingdom at large there are
                    seven lyceums, eighteen gymnasia, twenty-one pro-gymnasia, and 5000 elementary
                    schools; at which it is computed that nearly half a million of children or young
                    people of both sexes receive instruction in reading and writing. These certainly
                    form a great contrast to the indifference and neglect of former times; and the
                    government continues to evince much solicitude for the diffusion of instruction.
                    But there is still unfortunately a great want of schools above the rank of those
                    merely elementary; they are confined to the larger towns, for in the smaller the
                    inhabitants are hardly able to defray the expense; and the funds appropriated to
                    such a purpose by government are necessarily limited. Much therefore remains to
                    be done before the lower orders in Bavaria can be raised from their general
                    state of ignorance and superstition, or made to approach, in habits of order,
                    diligence, and cleanliness, to the inhabitants of the protestant states of
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>Yet the national character of the Bavarians is in general commendable. Like the
                    majority of the population of Austria, they are accustomed to be faithful to
                    their engagements and loyal to their government; but they are credulous, and
                    even superstitious, in matters of religion. In short, the will of their
                    superiors is received by the lower orders implicitly as a law in political as in
                    ecclesiastical affairs. A great deal was said thirty years ago about the masonic
                    and other secret societies said to have been formed in this country at the time
                    of the French revolution, and to have aimed at combining their efforts with
                    similar societies in Prussia for the overthrow of the established governments.
                    Such assertions, if not absolutely false, must have rested on a very slender
                    foundation, no people being less inclined than the Bavarians to join in
                    revolutionary projects, or less capable of conceiving that any advantage could
                    possibly result from them.</p>
                <p>The government of Bavaria in the early ages of the German empire did not descend
                    from father to son: it involved an important military trust, and was conferred
                    by the emperor on princes of different families until the thirteenth century.
                    Towards the close of that century Louis, of the house of Wittelsbach, duke of
                    Lower Bavaria, and count palatine of the Rhine, left two sons, Rodolph and
                    Louis, between whom, according to the usage of the age, the father’s dominions
                    were shared, the elder receiving the palatinate of the Rhine, the latter the
                    duchy of Bavaria. Small as the Rhenish palatinate was, its comparative
                    civilization made it the more valuable of the two; and its head had the
                    important privileges of an elector of the empire. From the two princes just
                    mentioned descended the rulers of these respective states during five centuries
                    and upwards; until, in 1770, on the failure of the Bavarian line, Charles
                    Theodore, count of the palatinate, obtained the succession, and removed to
                    Munich, since which the two countries have been governed as one state. Charles
                    Theodore ruled Bavaria above twenty years. He evinced much anxiety for the
                    improvement of his new subjects, but, like his contemporary the emperor Joseph
                    II. of Austria, made no sufficient allowance for their general backwardness, or
                    for their unfitness to comprehend the advantage of many of his proposed changes.
                    He died in 1799, and was succeeded by Maximilian I., a prince of equal
                    philanthropy and greater prudence, who governed Bavaria twenty-six years, and
                    was succeeded in 1825 by his son Louis, the present king.</p>
                <p>Bavaria, like other German states, has long had its states or parliament,
                    composed of nobility and prelates. Its present form of government is founded
                    partly on long established usage, partly on a constitutional act of great
                    length, passed in May 1818. The country is there declared an integral part of
                    the Germanic confederation, and the monarchy hereditary, with a legislative body
                    of two houses, the Upper and Lower. The title of the sovereign is simply king of
                    Bavaria; that of his presumptive heir is crown prince of Bavaria. The executive
                    power is vested altogether in the king, whose person is declared inviolable: the
                    responsibility rests with the ministers, whose functions are nearly the same as
                    those of ministers in England or France; and they have respectively offices for
                    foreign affairs, for the home department, for the treasury, the army, and the
                    administration of justice. The upper house of the Bavarian parliament comprises
                    the princes of the bloodroyal, the two archbishops, the barons or heads of
                    families of landed property, and any other members whom the kir may nominate,
                    either as hereditary peers or as counsellors for life; but the latter must not
                    exceed a third of the hereditary members. The lower house consists at present
                    (1831) of 115 deputies, elected on a plan a good deal different from ours, for
                    an eighth part must be of the class of nobility, another eighth of the clergy, a
                    fourth part citizens or burghers, and the remaining half landed proprietors.
                    Each of the three universities also names a representative. A general election
                    takes place once in six years, and the number of members bids fair to increase;
                    for the elective law prescribes that there shall be a deputy or member of the
                    lower house for every 7000 families in the kingdom. The king generally convenes
                    the parliament once a year, and by the constitution it is obligatory on him to
                    do so at least once in three years. The direct taxes must be granted anew under
                    the authority of the parliament once in six years.</p>
                <p>The adoption of this constitution was accompanied by the abolition of all that
                    remained of personal servitude among the peasantry; for many Bavarians of the
                    lower class were until lately serfs, being paid for their labour, not by wages,
                    but by maintenance. They were consequently very indolent, and the government
                    have not yet thought it advisable to exempt them from such punishments as
                    cudgelling and flogging, or from compulsory labour on the public roads. The
                    political improvements still wanting in Bavaria are a more complete equalization
                    of taxes; publicity in the proceedings of courts of justice; a removal of the
                    restrictions on trade with the neighbouring states; and an amendment of the
                    penal code. The liberty of the press is already complete.</p>
                <p>The diplomatic establishment of Bavaria consists of ambassadors, resident in
                    Paris, London, Vienna, Berlin, and St Petersburg; and of envoys in the smaller
                    German capitals, such as Weimar, Carlsruhe, and Darmstadt.</p>
                <p>No part of Europe, if we except the Netherlands, has been more exposed to
                    invasion than Bavaria, and in none has the painful interest arising from
                    military conflicts been given to a greater variety of places. As long as two
                    eenturies ago, both Bavaria and Franconia were laid waste in the Thirty Years’
                    War between the Catholics and Protestants. It was near Augsburg, on the banks of
                    the Lech, that Gustavus Adolphus obtained, in 1632, a memorable victory over the
                    Austrians and other Catholic allies, commanded by Count Tilly. At Nuremberg the
                    success of the Swedish sovereign was for a time arrested by the talents of
                    Wallenstein; but at Nordlingen, two years after, the death of the king and the
                    injuries of the Protestants were avenged in a dreadful conflict. The French next
                    took part in the war, and carried devastation throughout this part of Germany.
                    In the succeeding age Bavaria was invaded by our countrymen and their allies;
                    and it was at Schellenberg, a strong position near the Danube, that the duke of
                    Marlborough first worsted the Bavarians<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193195334?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5334-0463"/>, in July 1704,
                    above a month previous to the battle of Blenheim. In the wars of the French
                    revolution both Franconia and Bavaria were repeatedly overrun. It was at Amberg
                    that the archduke Charles stopped the advance of the French in 1796, and at
                    Wurzburg that he finally defeated them; successes repeated with equal effect
                    three ears after, when, in March 1799, he again met their army on Bavarian
                    ground, near the banks of the Lech. The subsequent operations in this country
                    were equally pernicious to it, though very different in their political results.
                    The name of Hohenlinden recalls the triumph of Moreau in 1800; that of Ulm the
                    surrender of the Austrian army under Mack in October 1805. Lastly, it was at
                    Eckmuhl and Ratisbon, in 1809, that Buonaparte obtained over the Austrians
                    victories which compelled them to retreat with heavy loss, and opened to him the
                    gates of Vienna.</p>
                <p>Such has been the fate of Bavaria in times past; but the prospect is now happily
                    very different, and the inhabitants may, hope to cultivate their territory in
                    peace. The emperor of Austria having espoused a Bavarian princess in 1816, there
                    prevails the greatest cordiality between the two governments; and a deliberate
                    view of their respective interests will probably render it permanent. On the one
                    hand, France has no longer the power of convulsing the interior of Germany; and
                    on the other, it is evident that no country will profit more largely by
                    continued peace than Bavaria. If we consider its physical advantages in soil,
                    climate, and geographical position, and compare its condition with that of
                    improved countries, such as England or the Netherlands, every impartial observer
                    must admit that its cultivation has not yet been carried to half or nearly half
                    the extent of which it is capable, <hi rend="smallcaps">(μ. μ.)</hi></p>
