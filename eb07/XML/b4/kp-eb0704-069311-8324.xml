                <p><label type="entry">BLIND</label>, <hi rend="smallcaps">An</hi> epithet applied
                    to a person deprived of the use of sight; or to one from whom light, colours,
                    and all the variety of the visible creation, are intercepted by some natural
                    deprivation or accidental disease.</p>
                <p> There is no external sense or faculty which affords such an endless variety of
                    perceptions as that of vision; nor is there any loss that can be sustained
                    productive of so many disadvantages and evils as the want of that faculty. By no
                    avenue of perception is knowledge so accessible, by none, in fact, does it flow
                    so abundantly, as through the channel of this sense, which not only reveals
                    external things in all their beauty, in all their changes, and in all their
                    varieties<pb break="no" facs="nls:193198337" xml:id="kp-eb0704-8337-0694"/>, but
                    supplies those materials out of which the imagination creates new forms still
                    more glorious; whilst the understanding traces the varied relations existing
                    among the ideas thus received, and gives birth to a secondary and reflex class
                    still more subtile and refined. To the blind man, however, the visible universe
                    is totally annihilated; he is perfectly conscious of no space excepting that in
                    which he stands, or to which his extremities can reach. Sound, indeed, gives him
                    some ideas of distant objects; but these ideas are often obscure and indistinct;
                    and although by them the notion of distance in general, or even of some
                    particular distances, may be obtained, yet they never fill the mind with those
                    vast and exalting conceptions of extension which are inspired by ocular
                    perception. For although a clap of thunder or an explosion of ordnance may be
                    distinctly heard after they have traversed an immense region of space, yet when
                    the distance is uncommonly great it ceases to be indicated by sound; and hence
                    the ideas of extension acquired by hearing are extremely confused and
                    inadequate. But the living and comprehensive eye darts its instantaneous glance
                    over expanded valleys, lofty mountains, sweeping rivers, and vast tracts of land
                    or of ocean. It measures in an instant of time the mighty space from earth to
                    heaven, or from one star to another. By the assistance of telescopes its horizon
                    is almost indefinitely extended, its objects are greatly multiplied, and the
                    sphere of its observation is prodigiously enlarged. By these means the
                    imagination, habituated to vast impressions of distance, can not only recall
                    them in their utmost extent with as much rapidity as they were at first imbibed,
                    but can multiply them, and add one to another, till all boundaries, distances,
                    and measures, are swallowed up in immensity. By profusely irradiating the face
                    of things, and clothing objects in a robe of diversified splendour, nature at
                    once invites the understanding to expatiate on that extensive and gorgeous
                    theatre which she thus opens up, and gratifies the imagination with every
                    possible exhibition of the sublime and the beautiful. The man of sight enjoys
                    these unspeakable advantages, and beholds from afar the objects of his attention
                    and curiosity. Taught by experience, he measures their relative distances;
                    distinguishes their qualities; determines their situations, positions, and
                    attitudes; traverses in security the space which divides them from him; stops at
                    the point where they are placed; and either obtains them with ease, or
                    immediately perceives the means by which the obstacles that intercept his
                    passage to them may be surmounted. The blind, on the contrary, not only may be,
                    but in reality are, during a considerable period, apprehensive of danger from
                    every motion they make towards any object or place, because their contracted
                    power of perception can give them no certain intelligence of the obstacles or
                    hazards which may intervene.</p>
                <p>Nor is this the worst of their case. All the various modes of delicate
                    proportion, all the beautiful varieties of light and colours, whether exhibited
                    in the works of nature or of art, are to them irretrievably lost. Dependent for
                    every thing on the good offices of others, and from every object obnoxious to
                    injury, which they are neither capacitated to perceive nor qualified to resist,
                    they are, during the present state of being, rather to be considered as
                    prisoners at large than citizens of nature. The sedentary life to which they are
                    doomed relaxes the frame, and subjects them to all the disagreeable sensations
                    which arise from dejection of spirits. Hence the most feeble exertions create
                    lassitude and uneasiness, and the natural tone of the nervous system, destroyed
                    by inactivity exasperates and embitters every disagreeable impression. But even
                    from their loss, however oppressive and irretrievable, they derive some
                    advantages; not indeed adequate to recompense, but sufficient to alleviate,
                    their misery. The attention of the mind, confined to those avenues of perception
                    which it can command, is neither dissipated nor confounded by the multiplicity
                    or rapid succession of surrounding objects. Its contemplations are more
                    uniformly fixed upon itself and its own operations ∙ and hence its perceptions
                    of such external things as are contiguous and obvious to observation become more
                    lively and exquisite, whilst even the instruments of corporeal sensation are
                    more assiduously cultivated and improved; so that from them are derived notices
                    and presages of approaching pleasure or impending danger, which entirely escape
                    the attention of those who depend for security on the information of sight. A
                    blind man, when walking swiftly, or running, is kindly and effectually checked
                    by nature from rudely encountering such hard and extended objects as might hurt
                    or bruise him. When he approaches bodies of this kind, he feels the atmosphere
                    more sensibly resist his progress; and in proportion as his motion is
                    accelerated, or his distance from the object diminished, the resistance is
                    increased. He distinguishes the approach of his friend from afar by the sound of
                    his steps, by his manner of breathing, and almost by every audible token which
                    he can exhibit. Prepared for the dangers which he may encounter from the surface
                    of the ground upon which he walks, his step is habitually firm and cautious.
                    Hence he not only avoids those falls which might be occasioned by its less
                    formidable inequalities, but from its general bias he collects some ideas how
                    far his safety is immediately concerned; and although these conjectures may
                    sometimes prove fallacious, yet they are generally so true as to preserve him
                    from accidents not incurred by his own temerity. The rapid torrent and the deep
                    cascade not only warn him to keep a proper distance, but inform him of the
                    direction in which he is moving, and form a kind of audible beacons to regulate
                    his course. In places to which he has been accustomed, he as it were recognises
                    his latitude and longitude from every breath of varied fragrance wafted by the
                    breeze, from every ascent or declivity in the road, from every natural or
                    artificial sound that strikes his ear. Regulated by these and other analogous
                    signs, the blind have not only been known to perform long and difficult journeys
                    themselves, but even to conduct others through dark, tortuous, and dangerous
                    paths, with the utmost security and exactness.</p>
                <p>It were endless to recapitulate the various mechanical operations of which they
                    are capable, from the nicety and accuracy of their touch. In some the tactile
                    powers are said to have been so highly improved, as to perceive that texture and
                    disposition of coloured surfaces by which some rays of light are reflected and
                    others absorbed, and in this manner to distinguish colours.<note anchored="true"

                    appear too vague and general to deserve implicit credit. We have known a person
                    who had lost the use of his sight at an early period of infancy, and in the
                    vivacity and delicacy of his sensations was not perhaps inferior to any one:
                    this individual having often heard that others in his situation were capable of
                    distinguishing colours by touch with the utmost exactness and promptitude; and
                    being stimulated partly by curiosity to acquire a new train of ideas, if that
                    acquisition were possible, but still more by incredulity respecting the fact
                    alleged; tried <pb break="no" facs="nls:193198350" xml:id="kp-eb0704-8350-0695"
                    /> repeated experiments, by touching the surfaces of different bodies, and
                    examining whether any such diversities could be detected in them as might enable
                    him to distinguish co- ∣ <hi rend="subscript"> ours;</hi> —but nothing of the
                    kind was he ever able to ascertain. Sometimes, indeed, he imagined that objects
                    which had no colour, or, in other words, were black, had something different and
                    peculiar in their surfaces; but this experiment did not universally hold; and
                    his scepticism therefore still continued to prevail. That the acoustic
                    perceptions of the blind are distinct and accurate, we may fairly conclude from
                    the rapidity with which they ascertain the acuteness or gravity of different
                    tones, as relative one to another, and from their exact discernment of the
                    various kinds and modifications of sound and of sonorous objects, if the sounds
                    themselves be in any degree significant of their causes.</p>
                <p>It is owing to this vivacity and accuracy of the other senses, and the assiduous
                    application of a comprehensive and attentive mind, that we are enabled to
                    account for the rapid and astonishing progress which some of them have made, not
                    only in those departments of literature which were most accessible to their
                    understandings, but even in the most abstract, and, if we may be allowed the
                    expression, occult sciences. What, for instance, can apparently be more remote
                    from the conceptions of a blind man than the abstract relations and properties
                    of space and quantity? Yet the attainments of Dr Saunderson in all the branches
                    of mathematics are well known to the literary world since the publication of his
                    works; and we have the testimony of Dr Guillié to the fact that the blind in
                    general have a remarkable aptitude for the study of the exact sciences.<note

                    peut, dans quelques circonstances, devenir un avantage, c’est dans l’étude des

                    à laquelle ils se livrent avec un goût décidé. Très-jeunes, ils apprennent

                <p>When we reflect on the numberless advantages derived from the use of sight, and
                    the immense importance of the information it conveys, both for the well-being of
                    the body and the improvement of the mind, we are almost tempted to doubt the
                    fidelity of the reports which have been published concerning such persons as,
                    without the assistance of sight, have arrived at high degrees of eminence even
                    in those sciences which would appear absolutely unattainable without the aid of
                    this sense. It has, however, been demonstrated by Dr Reid, that blind men, by
                    proper instruction, are capable of forming almost every idea, and attaining
                    almost every truth, which can be impressed on the mind through the medium of
                    light and colour, except the sensations of light and colour themselves. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Inquiry into the Human Mind,</hi> chap. vi. § 1, 2.) Yet there is
                    one phenomenon of this kind which seems to have escaped the attention of that
                    great' philosopher, and of which no author either of this or any former period
                    has been able to offer any satisfactory explanation, although it seems to merit
                    the attention of philosophers. For, admitting that the blind can understand all
                    the phenomena of light and colours, and that on these subjects they may extend
                    their speculations even beyond the sphere of their instructions, and by the mere
                    force of genius and application investigate the mechanical principles of optics
                    from the data which they had previously obtained; yet it will be difficult to
                    assign any reason why these objects should prove more interesting to a blind man
                    than any other abstract truths whatsoever. By means of a retentive memory, it is
                    possible for a blind man to tell that the sky is azure, that the sun, moon, and
                    stars are bright, that the rose is red, the lily white or yellow, and the tulip
                    variegated; by continually hearing these substantives and adjectives joined, he
                    may be mechanically taught to join them in the same manner; but as he never had
                    any sensation of colour, however accurately he may speak of coloured objects,
                    his language must be like that of a parrot, without meaning and without ideas.
                    Homer and Milton had been long acquainted with the visible world before they
                    were afflicted with the calamity of blindness. They might, therefore, still
                    retain the warm and pleasing impressions of what they had seen; their
                    descriptions might be animated with all the enthusiasm which had originally
                    fired their bosoms when the grand or delightful objects which they delineated
                    were immediately beheld; and that enthusiasm might even be heightened by a
                    bitter sense of their loss, and by the regret which a situation so dismal
                    naturally inspired. But how shall we account for the same energy, the same
                    transport of description, exhibited by those on whose minds visible objects were
                    either never impressed, or must have been entirely obliterated?</p>
                <p>Yet certain it is, however extraordinary the fact may appear, that the latter
                    class of the blind experience such emotions, and depict them with astonishing
                    accuracy and truth; that they seem to have a kind of imaginative feeling of
                    external beauty, and to enter into accounts of natural scenery with a keener
                    relish than those who enjoy the blessing of sight. To them light, and shadow,
                    and colour in all its variegated modifications, are merely <hi rend="italic"
                    >voces et praeterea nihil;</hi> yet by the force of imagination, aided by the
                    information supplied by the other senses, and by certain suggestions and
                    relations of language, they are enabled, as it were,· to approximate to ideas
                    which it is impossible they should ever fully attain, and to form for themselves
                    a set of notions adjusted in such a wonderful manner as to serve as links in the
                    chain of association, and to guide them to the use of accurate expressions, in
                    speaking or writing of things which to them are as if they were not. But the
                    speculations into which these considerations would lead us are of too refined
                    and subtile a nature to be prosecuted further in such an article as the present.

                    Edinburgh 1754; or the account of his life and writings by the Rev. Mr Spence,

                    or the <hi rend="italic">Essai sur l’Instruction des Aveugles,</hi> by Dr
                    Guillié, a work which, from the opportunities of observation enjoyed by the
                    author, is naturally of high authority on the subject of which it treats.</p>
                <p>It has already been hinted that the blind are objects of compassion, because
                    their sphere of action and observation is abridged; and this is certainly true.
                    For what is human existence in its present state, when deprived of action, and
                    to a certain extent of contemplation? Thus limited, all that remains is the
                    information derived from form, or from sensitive and locomotive powers. But for
                    these, unless directed to happier ends by superior faculties, few rational
                    beings would, in our opinion, be grateful. The most important view, therefore,
                    which can be entertained in the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193198363"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-8363-0696"/> education of a person deprived of sight, is to
                    redress as effectually as possible the natural disadvantages under which he
                    lies; or, in other words, to enlarge as far as may be the sphere of his
                    knowledge and activity. But this can only be done by the improvement of his
                    intellectual, imaginative, or mechanical powers; and which of these ought to be
                    most assiduously trained and cultivated, the genius of every individual can
                    alone determine. Were men to judge of things by their intrinsic nature, less
                    would be expected from the blind than from others. But, by some pernicious and
                    unaccountable prejudice, people generally hope to find them either possessed of
                    preternatural talents, or more attentive than others to those which they
                    actually do possess: for it was not Rochester’s opinion alone,</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> That if one sense should be suppress’d, </l>
                    <l part="N"> It but retires into the rest. </l>
                </lg>
                <p>Hence it unluckily happens that blind men, when they do not gratify the
                    extravagant expectations of the spectators, too frequently sink in the general
                    estimation, and appear to be much less considerable and meritorious than they
                    really are. This general diffidence of their powers at once deprives them both
                    of the opportunity and the spirit to exert themselves; and they descend at last
                    to that degree of insignificance in which the public estimate has fixed them.
                    From the original dawning of reason and spirit, therefore, the parents and
                    tutors of the blind ought to inculcate this maxim,—that it is their
                    indispensable duty to excel, and that it is absolutely in their power to attain
                    a high degree of eminence. To impress this notion on their minds, the first
                    objects presented to their observation, and the first methods of improvement
                    applied to their understanding, ought to be capable of being comprehended
                    without difficulty by those internal powers and external senses which they
                    possess. Not that improvement should be rendered quite easy to them, if such a
                    plan were possible; for all difficulties which are not really or apparently
                    insuperable heighten the charms and enhance the value of those acquisitions
                    which they seem to retard. But care should be taken that these difficulties be
                    not magnified or exaggerated by imagination; since the blind have naturally a
                    painful sense of their own incapacity, and consequently a strong propensity to
                    despondency continually working in their minds.</p>
                <p>For this reason, parents and relations ought never to be too ready in offering
                    their assistance to the blind in any office which they can perform, or in any
                    acquisition which they can make for themselves, whether they are prompted by
                    amusement or necessity. Let a blind boy be permitted to walk through the
                    neighbourhood without a guide, not only though he should run some hazard, but
                    even though he should suffer some pain. If he have a mechanical turn, let him
                    not be denied the use of edge tools; for it is better that he should lose a
                    little blood, or even break a bone, than be perpetually confined to the same
                    place, and thus debilitated in his frame, and depressed in his mind. Such a
                    being can have no employment but that of feeling his own weakness, and becoming
                    his own tormenter; or perhaps transferring to others a portion of the malignity
                    and peevishness engendered by the natural, adventitious, or imaginary evils
                    which he feels. Scars, fractures, and dislocations in his body, are trivial
                    misfortunes compared with imbecility, timidity, or fretfulness of mind. Besides
                    the pernicious effects of inactivity in relaxing the nerves, and consequently in
                    depressing the spirits, nothing can be more productive of discontent, envy,
                    jealousy, and every mean and malignant passion, than a painful impression of
                    dependence on others, and of our insufficiency for our own happiness. This
                    impression, which even in his most improved state will be but too deeply felt by
                    every blind man, is redoubled by that utter incapacity of action superinduced by
                    the officious humanity of those who would anticipate or supply all his wants,
                    prevent all his motions, and do or procure every thing for him without his own
                    interposition. It is the course of nature that blind people, as well as others,
                    should survive their parents; and it may likewise happen to them to survive
                    those who, by the ties of blood and nature, are more immediately interested in
                    their happiness. But when they come to be dependent on the world, such
                    exigencies as they themselves cannot meet will be but coldly and languidly
                    supplied by strangers. If their expectations be high, their disappointments will
                    be the more sensible; their desires will often be resisted, seldom fully
                    gratified; and, even when their requests are granted, the concession will
                    sometimes be so ungraceful as to deprive it of the character of kindness. For
                    these reasons, we repeat, that, in the training of a blind man, it is infinitely
                    better to direct than to supersede his own exertions. From the time he can move
                    and feel, let him be taught to supply his own wants; to dress and to feed
                    himself; to run from place to place, either for exercise or in pursuit of his
                    own amusements or avocations.</p>
                <p>In these excursions, however, it will be proper for the parent or tutor to
                    superintend his motions at a distance, without seeming to watch over him. A
                    vigilance too apparent may defeat its own object, and create, in a mind
                    naturally jealous, a suspicion of its originating in some interested motive.
                    But, on the other hand, when dangers are obvious and great, those who are
                    intrusted with the care of the blind will find it neither necessary nor
                    expedient to make their vigilance a secret. They ought then to acquaint their
                    pupil that they are present with him, and to interpose for bis preservation
                    whenever his temerity renders it necessary. But objects of a nature less
                    noxious, which may give him some pain without any permanent injury or
                    mutilation, may with design be thrown in this way, provided, however, that the
                    design be industriously concealed; for his own experience of their bad effects
                    will prove a much more eloquent and sensible caution than the abstract and
                    frigid counsels of any monitor whatever.</p>
                <p>When the season of childish amusement has expired, and the impetuosity of animal
                    spirits has abated, the tutor will probably observe, in the whole demeanour of
                    his pupil, a more sensible degree of timidity and precaution, and his activity
                    will then require to be stimulated rather than restrained. In this crisis,
                    exercise will be found requisite to preserve health and facilitate the vital
                    functions, as well as for the mere purpose of recreation; and, of all kinds of
                    exercise, riding on horseback will be found by far the most eligible and
                    advantageous. On such occasions, however, care must be taken that the horses
                    employed be neither capricious nor unmanageable; for on the docility of the
                    animal which he rides, not only the safety, but the confidence, of the blind
                    will entirely depend. In these expeditions, whether long or short, his companion
                    or attendant ought to be constantly with him; and the horse should either be
                    taught to follow its guide, or be conducted by a leading rein. Next to this mode
                    of exercise is walking. If the constitution of the blind boy be tolerably
                    robust, let him be taught to encounter every vicissitude of weather which the
                    human constitution can endure with impunity. And when the cold is so intense, or
                    the elements so tempestuous, as to render air and exercise abroad impracticable,
                    there are methods of exercise within doors, which, though not equally salutary,
                    are still highly eligible. The dumb-bells, the bath-chair or spring board, and
                    the common swing, have been particularly recommended for this purpose; and as
                    each affords an agreeable exercitation, any of them may be had recourse to at
                    pleasure.</p>

                <p>But without dilating further in general observations and recommendations, we
                    shall now proceed to give some account of the practical methods employed in
                    developing the physical and intellectual faculties of the blind, and
                    particularly in communicating to them elementary instruction in the ordinary
                    branches of education; and, with this view, we shall endeavour to describe as
                    briefly as possible the system practised in the Asylum for the Industrious Blind
                    in Edinburgh,—an institution which has long been managed with equal judgment and
                    success, and which, although in some respects inferior to that of Paris, is
                    nevertheless upon the whole well calculated to serve as a model for others of a
                    similar description.</p>
                <p>This asylum was for many years the only one of the kind in Scotland; but latterly
                    an institution of the same description has been formed at Glasgow, and is now
                    conducted upon nearly the same plan. It was originally intended for men; and,
                    during a period of twenty-eight years from its formation, no provision whatever
                    was made for the employment or instruction of the blind of the other sex, who,
                    from their greater helplessness, have still stronger claims to the charitable
                    and humane consideration of the public. But about the year 1820 a female asylum
                    was instituted under the care of the same directors, though in a separate house;
                    and both branches of this interesting establishment are now conducted upon the
                    same general plan, and with nearly equal success.</p>
                <p>The leading feature of this plan is to combine industry with instruction, and
                    alternately to find occupation for the hands and heads of those who are admitted
                    into the asylum. Accordingly, the men and boys are employed in making baskets of
                    all descriptions; in weaving cloth of cotton, linen, and hair; in rope-making in
                    all its branches; in forming matrasses of straw, sea-grass, and hair, and in
                    stuffing beds; in working door-mats, hearth-rugs, and other articles of this
                    description; and, in general, in any occupation for which they have a taste, or
                    in which they are likely to excel. The females, on the other hand, are employed
                    in sewing, knitting, spinning, and other occupations peculiar or suited to their
                    sex, especially in the different kinds of “plain and white seam,” as it is
                    called, which they execute with singular neatness. Stockings, shoes, snow-boots,
                    table-mats, table-covers, shawls of all descriptions and colours, spensers,
                    tippets, dresses for ladies and gentlemen, hair-mits, and such like articles,
                    are also manufactured in the asylum. A great part of the knitted fancy work has,
                    we understand, been invented by the mistress of the house; and such is the
                    perfection to which this elegant branch of industry has been carried, that its
                    products are said to have found their way to all parts of the world.</p>
                <p>France has done much towards the education of the blind, which indeed has
                    engrossed a large share of attention in that country; but although the methods
                    employed are in some respects superior in point of scientific adaptation, it
                    may, nevertheless, be doubted whether any institution in the neighbouring
                    kingdom be upon a more efficient footing than that in Edinburgh, which owes not
                    only its existence, but the success which has attended its endeavours, to the
                    spontaneous and benevolent zeal of enlightened individuals. Various opinions
                    have been expressed respecting the French method of teaching the blind to read
                    by means of letters in relief,—a very ingenious though by no means a recent
                    invention.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The first
                    attempt of this kind appears to have consisted in a modification of the Illyrian
                    or Sclavonian alphabet, which was doubtless preferred on account of the square
                    form of the letters; but on trial it was found to possess no advantage over the
                    common characters, and to have disadvantages peculiar to itself. (Fournier, <hi
                    rend="italic">Manuel Typographique,</hi> tome ii. p. 226, No. 68, 1766.) Movable
                    letters on small tablets of wood were next tried; but after a time this
                    expedient was also abandoned, as not suited for the instruction of the blind,
                    though singularly well adapted for teaching children who see to read. In fact,
                    it was by means of similar letters that Usher, afterwards archbishop of Armagh,
                    was taught to read by his two aunts, who were both blind. {<hi rend="italic"
                    >Biographia Britannica, voce</hi> Usher; London, 1773). In the sixteenth century
                    letters were engraved in wood for the instruction of the blind ;—these, however,
                    were not in relief, but cut out in the ordinary way of engraving ;—the fingers
                    could with difficulty be employed in ascertaining their configuration ;— when
                    used in printing, the letters remained white, whilst the rest of the space was
                    blackened ;—and hence they had none of the advantages which belong to letters in
                    relief, and which are essential in the instruction of the blind. (Francesco
                    Lucas, <hi rend="italic"> Arte de Escrivir,</hi> Madrid, 1580, 4to.) This method
                    was reproduced with some modifications in 1575, by Rampazzetto, an Italian; but
                    with no better success. {<hi rend="italic">Essemplare di più sorti di
                    Lettere</hi>di Μ. Gio Francesco Cresci, Milanese, Scrittore en Venetia; 1575,
                    4to.) In 1640 a writing-master of Paris, called Pierre Moreau, caused movable
                    characters to be cast in lead for the use of the blind; but, discouraged by the
                    difficulties he met with, or not choosing to incur the expense to which the
                    prosecution of the scheme would have subjected him, he abandoned it, and applied
                    himself to the formation of matrices for a new variety of letter, which still
                    bears his name in French typography. A simpler and more ingenious method than
                    any of these consisted in forming letters by means of pins stuck into large
                    pincushions, leaving out only the heads, which of course were easily felt, and
                    rendered the shape of the letters quite distinct as well as palpable, while the
                    arrangement could be altered at pleasure, and with extreme facility. By this
                    natural and easy plan the celebrated Mademoiselle Paradis learned to read.
                    Various other modes were also tried; letters in wood were again had recourse to,
                    and again dropped; and no method secured general approbation till 1783, when
                    letters in relief, that is, letters raised, or as it were embossed on paper,
                    were first invented, and, being gradually improved, were afterwards employed in
                    the instruction of the blind in France. Nor has this invention as yet been
                    superseded by any thing that seems better adapted to the purpose.</p></note> It
                    has been said, for example, that angular letters are preferable to circular
                    ones, as being more easily felt; and Mr Gall of Edinburgh has constructed an
                    alphabet of this kind on the French plan, whilst others have been making trial
                    of a variety of shapes and forms with a view to the same object. But no device
                    of this kind has hitherto been patronised by the directors of the Edinburgh
                    institution; nor, as far as we know, has any one yet been proposed which is in
                    all respects calculated to answer the end proposed. From what has been done,
                    however, for enabling the blind to feel a written language, it seems
                    practicable, by some analogous method, to teach them both to read and write; and
                    we are inclined to hope that such a method, combining distinctness with
                    simplicity and cheapness, will in time be discovered.</p>
                <p>In the Edinburgh institution the men and women are taught to read and write by
                    means of what is called the “string alphabet.” This is formed by so knotting a
                    cord, ribbon, or the like, that the protuberances thus made upon it may, by
                    their shape, size, and situation, denote the elements of language. The letters
                    of this alphabet are distributed into seven classes, which are distinguished by
                    certain knots or marks; and each class comprehends four letters, excepting the
                    last, which includes only two. The first or A class is distinguished by a large
                    round knot; the second or E class, by a knot projecting from the line; the third
                    or I class, by a series of links, vulgarly called the “drummer’s plait the
                    fourth or M class, by a single noose; the fifth or Q class, by a noose with a
                    line drawn through it; the sixth or U class, by a noose with a net-knot cast on
                    it; the seventh or Y class, by a twisted noose. The first letter of each class
                    is denoted by the simple characteristic of its respective class; the second by
                    the characteristic and a common knot close to it; the third by the
                    characteristic and a common knot half an inch from it; <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193198389" xml:id="kp-eb0704-8389-0698"/> and the fourth by the
                    characteristic and a common knot an inch from it. Thus, A is expressed by a
                    large round knot; B by a large round knot, with a common knot close to it; C by
                    a large round knot, and a common knot half an inch from it; and D by a large
                    round knot, and a common knot an inch from it; and so in the case of the other
                    classes. This alphabet was invented by Robert Milne and David Macbeath, both at
                    one time inmates of the asylum, and it is found by experience to answer the
                    purpose for which it was intended, as by means of it the blind can communicate
                    with their friends and with one another.</p>
                <p>Robert Milne, one of the persons above named, also improved the arithmetical
                    board. An instrument of this kind had been invented by Dr Saunderson, and
                    afterwards modified by Dr Moyes; but the board used in the asylum is considered
                    as superior to it in several respects, and has lately undergone a further
                    improvement by the substitution of metal for wood; in consequence of which it
                    has been rendered both cheaper and more correct than before. By means of this
                    instrument both men and women are taught figuring, and may be carried to any
                    extent in arithmetical acquirement. Two small square pins with knobs represent
                    the ten digits.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For an

                    In Paris, as in Edinburgh, Saunderson’s table has been abandoned as operose and
                    inconvenient.</p></note></p>
                <p>The blind are taught geography, both ancient and modern, by means of globes and
                    boards constructed solely for their use; astronomy, by means of an orrery and
                    celestial maps similarly adapted; and mathematics, on a board of analogous
                    construction. In all these branches of science the progress they make is
                    considerable, and, with reference to their peculiar situation, astonishing. As
                    the plan of the globes and boards is exceedingly simple, a few words on each
                    will suffice. From a plan submitted to him, the present master constructed two
                    globes, one thirty and the other thirty-six inches in diameter. Having described
                    the meridians and parallels of latitude, and drawn the boundary lines of
                    countries, and divisions of all kinds, he glued on twine or cord on such lines
                    as are continuous, employing shorter pieces to indicate rivers, and pins to
                    denote towns: the portions representing land are covered with fine sand; the
                    rivers and seas are left smooth; the meridian circle, which is of iron, is so
                    deeply marked as to render the divisions easily felt; and the equator is
                    indicated by small pins. The globes, thus prepared and adapted, have been found
                    by experience completely to answer the purposes of instruction. With regard to
                    the maps, again, they are pasted on square boards, and have cord glued on the
                    boundary lines, in precisely the same manner as the globes.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the Parisian institution improvement has
                    been carried a step further; fine iron wire covered after the fashion of
                    milliners ı used instead of cord for the divisions, as well as the meridians and
                    parallels of latitude; whilst towns and islands are represented J
                    hemispherically-headed nails of different sizes; and over the whole blank paper
                    is pasted, so as in fact to form a skeleton map in relief. (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Guillié,</hi> &gt;p. 117, 149.)</p></note> The orrery has brass hoops or rings
                    to represent the orbits of the planets, which are indicated by balls or spheres
                    of proper relative dimensions, and slide at pleasure along the rings or orbits;
                    the ecliptic, or the outer edge of the circular board, is marked with the
                    degrees of the circle and the days of the month in such a manner as to be felt;
                    and the signs of the zodiac are raised figures, also placed on the edge. The
                    celestial maps consist of square and oblong boards, on which is glued Bristol
                    paper, cut into the figure of the sign or constellation which it is intended to
                    represent, after which steel knobs of different sizes are driven in to indicate
                    the different magnitudes of the stars, while small knobs on the sides of the
                    board denote the degrees. The mathematical board is a square of fourteen inches,
                    full of small holes, with a few pins fitted to them, so as to represent certain
                    letters of the alphabet; while with fine cord or twine extended from the angular
                    points are formed the lines of the figure or diagram, whatever it may be. The
                    globes and boards for geography, as well as the orrery, celestial maps, and
                    mathematical board, were invented in 1824, and are used in no other institution
                    excepting that of Glasgow, and that of Boston in North America, to each of which
                    a set of these instruments was transmitted by order of the directors of the
                    Edinburgh Asylum. In as far as we are able to judge, these latter instruments
                    seem superior to those employed in the Parisian institution; at all events they
                    are simpler, which is a great advantage; and with regard to the mathematical
                    board, the method of representing the diagrams appears to be by far the best
                    that has yet been employed.</p>
                <p>The inmates of this establishment are also taught to play on the violin and
                    piano-forte. They read the music from boards constructed for their use, but by
                    whom invented we have not learned. The game of draughts is a favourite amusement
                    with them. It is played on a board of the common kind, but the alternate squares
                    are covered with sand, and in each there is a small hole fitted to receive a
                    pin, attached to the piece, which is thus retained in the position in which it
                    is placed.</p>
                <p>The greater part of the inmates of this institution consists of persons who
                    originally lost their sight by disease or accident; and there are but few who
                    have been blind from their birth. At the same time, it has been remarked that
                    when one child in a family is born blind, those that follow it are also
                    generally born blind. There are two or three instances of this in the asylum;
                    and we know several others without the walls of the institution. This succession
                    of blindness is probably to be referred to the force of imagination; and, in
                    fact, the mother of two blind children being questioned on the subject, stated
                    her belief that the second instance was occasioned by her continually looking on
                    and thinking of her sightless child.</p>
                <p>The experience acquired in the institution confirms the general observation which
                    we made at the outset, that the loss of one faculty, especially sight, is almost
                    always accompanied by a compensatory and counterbalancing improvement in the
                    other senses and faculties. This undoubtedly arises, not from any original
                    superiority in the senses or faculties which remain, but from a closer attention
                    to their indications, and above all from incessant application. The sense of
                    touch, in particular, is signally improved, and, as it were, quickened in blind
                    persons, who have no other means of discovering the size and figure of the
                    bodies presented to them. With regard to the statement, however, which has
                    sometimes been made, that they can distinguish colours by touch, we may mention
                    that no instance of such extreme delicacy of touch has occurred in the
                    experience of the Edinburgh institution. Memory, like touch, is also improved by
                    constant use and application; and this holds equally true in all cases, though
                    it is more signally exemplified in the case of the blind, who depend so much on
                    this faculty. It has been thought that the memories of the blind are greatly
                    assisted by the exclusion of external objects, which from their multiplicity
                    tend to distract the attention; but as darkness magnifies dangers, which
                    consequently engross the thoughts and excite continual apprehensions, it may
                    reasonably be doubted whether the attention of the blind <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193198402" xml:id="kp-eb0704-8402-0699"/> not at times as Kable to be
                    disturbed as that of those who possess the blessing of sight, and receive
                    impressions from the external world; and hence it is to application chiefly that
                    the improvement of this faculty in the case of the blind ought to be
                    ascribed.</p>
                <p>The same observation holds true in regard to those signs and indications which
                    persons,who see neglect because they are not necessary to be attended to, but
                    which are of great importance to the blind, and are consequently carefully
                    attended to by them. Hence they can discover by the voice whether a person be
                    tall or short, agreeable or disagreeable, and also form some judgment of the
                    passions and affections of the mind. They have even in some cases attempted,
                    from such indications, to describe the external form and beauty of a person.
                    They know the steps of their friends and companions even at a distance.
                    Breathing and smell also afford indications. In hearing a sermon they can tell
                    by the sound of the preacher’s voice whether he uses notes; and currents of air,
                    or different modifications of atmospherical pressure, enable them to discover
                    when they approach any object or building. Their curiosity is so intense that at
                    any risk it must be gratified; and as they are often not aware of the danger to
                    which they expose themselves, they generally attain their object. It is a
                    remarkable fact, that a person born blind never dreams that he <hi rend="italic"
                    >sees</hi> the object of his dreams.</p>
                <p>The blind have been made to communicate with the deaf and dumb by means of the
                    finger alphabet; the former, of course, appealing to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sight</hi> of the latter, and the latter forming the alphabetical characters
                    <hi rend="italic">palpably</hi> on the fingers of the former. An attempt was
                    also made by the deaf and dumb to discover what was said by the blind from the
                    varying configuration of their lips in speaking; but it did not succeed to any
                    extent, and was abandoned, more especially as it could be employed by only one
                    of the parties. In France the means of communication between these two classes
                    of unfortunates have been improved by the invention of a set of pantomimic
                    signs, representing not letters, but words or ideas. These are formed by means
                    of the arms, which being extended somewhat in the manner of a telegraph, are
                    made, by each change of position, to represent a word or idea; and when the
                    blind communicate in this way with the deaf and dumb, their arms are placed in
                    contact, and they go through the strange but ingenious pantomime together in a
                    manner equally grotesque and amusing.</p>
                <p>The experience acquired in the Parisian institution is substantially in
                    accordance with what has been stated as the results of continued observation in
                    the Edinburgh asylum. Dr Guillié is decidedly of opinion that the blind have no
                    natural superiority in any sense or faculty over those who possess all their
                    faculties in an ordinary state of perfection. “L’adresse qu’on remarque dans les
                    aveugles pour le toucher,” says he, “et l’aptitude des sourds-muets à saisir
                    tous les traits de la physionomic, résultent de la nécessité où ils sont, les
                    uns, de se servir presque continuellement du tact pour suppléer à la vue qui
                    leur manque, et les autres, d’employer la vue pour remplacer l’ouie et la
                    parole: l’organe n’en est pas moins en tout semblable à celui des clair-voyans;
                    et si l’aveugle-né opéré par Cheselden ne reconnaissait plus par le toucher,
                    après l’extraction de la cataracte, les objets comme il le faisait auparavant,
                    ce n’est pas qu’il eût perdu, en recevant la vue, la faculté de toucher, mais
                    sculement, parce qu’il ne l’employait plus que comme sens auxiliaire et
                    correctif de la vue.” P. 32, 33. In this opinion the Abbé Sicard, Dr Guillié’s
                    distinguished colleague, completely coincides.</p>
                <p>“The memory of the blind is prodigious” This fact has been exemplified in Paris
                    as well as in Edinburgh and everywhere else; how to account for it is another
                    question. In man there is a memory of sensation and a memory of intelligence:
                    the one recalling his merely physical perceptions; and the other his
                    reflections, judgments, reasonings, speculations, and moral sentiments. Now it
                    is principally with the latter description of memory that the blind are
                    eminently provided; and although they are deprived of the means which persons
                    having the use of sight possess for forming an artificial kind of mnemonics, it
                    is probable that they construct an internal scheme for their own use, and of
                    still superior efficacy. Such at least is the opinion of Dr Guillié; and it
                    appears to be well founded. Helvetius has remarked <hi rend="italic">(De
                    (Esprit,</hi> chap. iii. disc. 3), that a great memory is a phenomenon of order;
                    that it is almost entirely factitious; and that among men well organised, the
                    great inequality of memory is less the effect of unequal perfection in the organ
                    or faculty which produces it, than of unequal attention in cultivating it. But
                    the blind are in general eminently distinguished for the spirit of order,
                    referred to by the French philosopher’as the basis of a great memory; and as the
                    faculty in question depends mainly on association, of which natural arrangement
                    or classification is the very essence, it must of course be greatly strengthened
                    in minds which are animated by the spirit of order, and have a tendency to
                    arrange their ideas in a strictly logical sequence.</p>
                <p>Another peculiarity of the blind is great fecundity of imagination; united in
                    some with a facility in analyzing and recombining their ideas, to which their
                    extraordinary progress in the exact sciences is to be ascribed. Of the former
                    quality, Homer, Milton, Delille, and many others might be cited as examples; of
                    the latter we shall give two instances in the words of Dr Guillié. “Le premier
                    est Paingeon, qui, par l’esprit de l’ordre dont il est doué, a acquis des
                    connaissances transcendantes en mathématiques, et après avoir remporté, en 1806,
                    tous les premiers prix au concours général des quatre Lycées de Paris, fut
                    nommé, par le Grand Maitre de l’Université, professeur de mathématiques au Lycée
                    d’Angers: l’autre est J. Delille, aujourd’hui pensionnaire des Quinze-Vingts,
                    qui a porté très-loin la métaphysique de la langage Française; un aplomb
                    parfait, one précision admirable dans ses definitions, caractérisent surtout ce
                    sujet que nous nous énorgueillissons d’avoir formé.” Both were educated under Dr
                    Guillié, at the Royal Institution for the instruction of the blind.</p>
                <p>On the subject of the moral condition of the blind Dr Guillié has stated many
                    curious and interesting particulars. Theyare generally deficient in modesty or
                    shame. “La pudeur, qui est une des grâces de la jeunesse, est presque pour eux
                    un être imaginaire, quoiqu’ils aient une sorte de timidité qui tient peut-être
                    plus, il est vrai, de crainte que de la honte, mais qui augmente beaucoup leur
                    embarras dans certaines circonstances.” They are, it is said, for the most part
                    without sensibility and without gratitude; irritable, suspicious, vindictive,
                    implacable. Their situation obliges them to be on their guard against all the
                    world; the consciousness of their own deficiency, and the disadvantages under
                    which it places them, render them suspicious as well as selfish; and, by an
                    easy, and we had almost said natural transition, they come to arrange in the
                    same category their benefactors and their enemies. “Commes de toutes les
                    demonstrations extérieures, qui réveillent en nous la commisération et les idées
                    de la douleur, les aveugles ne sont affectés que par la plainte,” says Diderot,
                    “je les soupçonne, en general, d’inhumanité. Quelle différence y a-t-il, pour un
                    aveugle, entre un homme qui urine et un homme qui, sans se plaindre, verse son
                    sang? Nous-mêmes, ne cessons-nous pas de compatir, lorsque la distance, ou la
                    petitesse des objets, produit sur nous le même effet que la privation de la vue
                    chez les aveugles.” <pb break="no" facs="nls:193198415"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-8415-0700"/><hi rend="italic">(Lettres sur les Aveugles?)</hi>
                    This is too strongly stated; but the principle in human nature, on which the
                    striking observation of Diderot is founded, would lead us to anticipate, at
                    least in part, the moral results to which we have alluded. It has been alleged
                    that the blind have a tendency towards atheism; but this is denied by Dr
                    Guillié, who, however, qualifies his contradiction by a very lamentable
                    admission: “Néanmoins, je ne les justifierai pas entièrement du reproche
                    d’impiété qu’on leur a fait avec quelque fondement and he adds, “la conscience
                    enfin n’a pas sur leurs actions l’influence qu’elle a sur nous.” But as these
                    observations are grounded on a partial experience, we hope they have no
                    application to the blind of this country, amongst whom sounder principles and
                    better feelings will always, we trust, prevail; nor will they ever lose a sense
                    of dependence on that Being, whose existence they have only to stretch forth
                    their hands to discover, and who has opened the eye of humanity to
                    compassionate, and the hand of charity to relieve, their wants.</p>
                <p>Hietory has preserved sundry particulars of blind persons, who, of themselves,
                    acquired great knowledge before there existed any regular method of instruction
                    applicable to their case. The number of these is considerable; so much so,
                    indeed, that any accurate enumeration would not only be a task of great
                    difficulty in itself, but would also far exceed the limits prescribed to this
                    article. It may not be uninteresting, however, to signalize a few of those who
                    have made the greatest figure in science and in art.</p>
                <p>The number of blind appears to have been very considerable in Asia and Italy in
                    the time of the Romans. This İ3 proved by the great number of physicians who at
                    the epoch in question wrote on ocular diseases; but what mode of instruction, or
                    whether any at all, was employed in those times, we have not learned. Diogenes
                    Laertius and Thrasylus relate (Diog. Laert. lib. ix., Vossius, <hi rend="italic"
                    >De Philosophia)</hi> that several philosophers voluntarily deprived themselves
                    of sight in order to pursue their contemplations with less interruption; and,
                    amongst those who inflicted on themselves this deprivation, is cited Democritus
                    of Abdera. But it is scarcely probable that this philosopher, the companion of
                    the gymnosophists of India, a man who laughed at every thing, and whom his
                    countrymen wished Hippocrates to cure of madness, because he believed that all
                    things were as they ought to be, depending on chance and the fortuitous
                    aggregations of atoms, should have put out his eyes in order to scoff
                    philosophically, when he might have indulged his humour to so much better
                    purpose with the use of his sight. Besides, putting out the eyes was next to
                    crucifixion, one of the most ignominious punishments inflicted by the laws of
                    ancient times, and as such was reserved only for great criminals. It may
                    therefore be doubted whether the laughing philosopher of Abdera would, on a mere
                    hypothesis, treat himself like a felon: and the words of Cicero, “Democritus
                    impediri etiam animi aciem aspectu oculorum arbitrabatur (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Tuscul. Disp.</hi> v. 39), which have been often quoted, seem rather to express
                    a general opinion than to state a particular fact, or warrant the inference that
                    the philosopher had deprived himself of sight because he thought that the
                    penetration of the mental was impeded by the vision of the natural eye.</p>
                <p>Diodatus, Cicero’s master in philosophy, applied himself to study with more
                    assiduity than ever, after he had lost his sight; and, what is still more
                    remarkable, he taught geometry with so much precision, that his disciples found
                    no difficulty in comprehending how to trace the most complicated figures from
                    his instructions. (Cicero, <hi rend="italic">ubi supra;</hi> Zahn, <hi
                    rend="italic">Specul. PhysicoMath. Hist,</hi> tome iii. c. 6.) Cornelius
                    Aufidius, a Roman citizen, who had lost his sight in his youth, distinguished
                    himself in the study of elegant literature, and wrote a Greek history. (Zahn,
                    <hi rend="italic">Sens. Ext. Mirab.</hi> § 2.) Eusebius the Asiatic became blind
                    at five years of age. He acquired vast knowledge and profound erudition, and
                    taught with the utmost facility as well as success. (Cassiodorus <hi
                    rend="italic">De lust. Div. Litter·</hi> c. 5.) St Jerome has left an account of
                    Dydimus of Alexandria, his master, of whom he speaks with great respect. This
                    blind man, who had lost his sight at the same age with Eusebius, flourished in
                    the fourth century. Ruffinus, Paladus, Isidorus, and several other celebrated
                    men, were his disciples. He acquired great knowledge by having the sacred and
                    profane authors read to him; he was one of the ablest mathematicians of his
                    time; and he applied himself especially to theology, for which he had a decided
                    taste. He composed several works, the principal of which is <hi rend="italic">A
                    Treatise on the Holy Spirit,</hi> translated into Latin by St Jerome. Dydimus
                    was pious as well as learned: nevertheless, his attachment to the opinions of
                    Origen, on whose books he had commented, caused his works to be condemned after
                    his death by the council of Lateran. St Athanasius and St Antony had the
                    greatest esteem for him. Dydimus died A. <hi rend="smallcaps">d.</hi> 398, at
                    the age of eighty-five. (Hieronymus <hi rend="italic">De Viris Iilustr.</hi> c.

                <p>Nicaise of Malignes flourished in the fifteenth century, and enjoyed great
                    reputation for the extent of his learning. Blind from the age of three years, he
                    nevertheless made great advances in science, and taught publicly, in the
                    university of Cologne, both the civil and canon law, citing from memory long
                    passages which he had never seen, <hi rend="italic">quos nunquam viderat.</hi>
                    Having been elected doctor of Louvain, the pope granted a dispensation for his
                    admission to priests’ orders; after which he employed the rest of his life in
                    preaching, and died at Cologne in 1492. (Urithème et Valère, <hi rend="italic"

                    Shorndorf, in the duchy of Wirtemburg, taught philosophy and medicine with great
                    success at Tubingen for about thirteen years. Having early become blind, he was
                    so little sensible of the loss of sight that he refused to allow himself to be
                    couched by an oculist, who offered to restore vision—in order, as he said, not
                    to be obliged to see many things which appeared odious or ridiculous. He died at
                    Tubingen in 1587, leaving several treatises on different points of philosophy,
                    medicine, and controversy. (Zahn, <hi rend="italic">Visus Im. Dep. et Caecit.
                    Ex. Mir.</hi> p∙ 114.) John Fernand, born in Belgium, was the son of a Spaniard,
                    and blind from his birth. His father was very poor; but he surmounted the
                    obstacles both of poverty and blindness, and became a poet, logician,
                    philosopher, and musician. He composed from memory several pieces, which are
                    considered excellent of their kind. (Zahn, <hi rend="italic">ubi supra.)</hi>
                    Ascanius Pedianus the historian lived several years after the loss of his sight,
                    and wrote treatises on grammar, which exhibit no trace either of his age or
                    infirmity. <hi rend="italic">(Fulgosus,</hi> lib. viii. c. 7.)</p>
                <p>Uldaric Schomberg, born in Germany towards the commencement of the seventeenth
                    century, lost his sight by the small-pox at the age of three; but as he grew up
                    he applied himself to the study of the belles-lettres, which he afterwards
                    professed with credit at Altorf, at Leipsic, and at Hamburg. (C. Harknocks, <hi

                    at Grenoble in 1651, became blind when very young, soon after the naval combat
                    at Solbaye, where he had been present. But this accident did not prevent him
                    from publishing the <hi rend="italic">History</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    0</hi><hi rend="italic">J Dauphine,</hi> in two volumes folio. He had made

                    of his time, some account will be found under the proper head. He was born in
                    1682, at a small town in the county of York, and died at Cambridge in 1739, at
                    the age'of fifty-six. He invented a table, which has since been greatly
                    improved, for teaching arithmetic palpably to the blind. A notice of Dr
                    Blacklock will be found under the biography of that individual. Dr Henry Moyes
                    professed the Newtonian philosophy, which he taught with considerable success as
                    an itinerant lecturer. He was also a good chemist, a respectable mathematician,
                    and a tolerable musician.</p>
                <p>Μ. Phefel of Colmar, who lost his sight when very young, in consequence of a
                    violent ophthalmia, composed a great deal of poetry (6 vols. 8vo, Colmar, 1791),
                    consisting chiefly of fables, some of which have been translated into French by
                    M. Degerando. He was privy counsellor to the margrave of Baden; and established
                    at Colmar a military school or academy, where children of the best families were
                    sent to be educated. Among the pupils of this learned blind man may be mentioned
                    Prince Schwartzemberg, Prince Eisemburg, and M. Heilman, lately pensionary of
                    the Quinze-Vingts. He died at Colmar in 1809. Weissemburg of Manheim became
                    blind at the age of seven. He wrote perfectly, and read with characters which he
                    had imagined for his own use. He was an excellent geographer, and composed maps
                    and globes, which he employed both in studying and teaching this science. He was
                    the inventor of an arithmetical table, differing but little from that of
                    Saunderson. <hi rend="italic">(Journal de Paris,</hi> April, 1784.)</p>
                <p>The blind man of Puiseaux must be known to all who have read Diderot’s celebrated
                    <hi rend="italic">Lettres sur les Aveugles.</hi> He was the son of a professor
                    of philosophy in the university of Paris, and he had attended with advantage
                    courses of chemistry and botany at the Jardin du Roi. After having dissipated a
                    part of his fortune he retired to Puiseaux, where he established a distillery,
                    the products of which he came regularly once ayear to Paris to dispose of. There
                    was originality in every thing that he did. His custom was to sleep during the
                    day, and to rise in the evening; he worked all night, “because,” as he himself
                    said, “he was not then disturbed by anybody.” His wife, when she rose in the
                    morning, used to find every thing perfectly arranged. He spoke very sensibly of
                    the qualities and defects of the organ in which he was deficient, and answered
                    questions put to him with much justness and discrimination. Being interrogated
                    as to the idea he formed of a mirror, he replied, “C’est une machine qui met les
                    choses en relief loin d’elles-mêmes, si elles se trouvent placées convenablement
                    par rapport à elle. C’est comme ma main qu’il ne faut pas que je pose à côté
                    d’un objet pour le sentir.” To Diderot, who visited him at Puis eaux, he put
                    some very singular questions on the transparence of glass, colours, and such
                    like matters. He asked if naturalists were the only persons who saw with the
                    microscope, and if astronomers were the only persons who saw with the telescope;
                    if the machine which magnified objects was greater than that which diminished
                    them; if that which brought them near was shorter than that which removed them
                    to a distance. He believed that astronomers had eyes of different conformation
                    from those of other men, and that a man could not devote himself to the study of
                    a particular science without having eyes specially adapted for the purpose. “The
                    eye,” said he, “is an organ upon which the air ought to produce die same effect
                    as my cane does upon my hand.” He possessed the memory of sounds to a surprising
                    degree, and recognised by the voice those whom he had only heard speak once. He
                    could tell if he was in a thoroughfare or <hi rend="superscript"> ιn</hi> a
                    cul-de-sac, in a large or in a small place. He estimated the proximity of fire
                    by the degree of heat; the comparative fulness of vessels by the sound of the
                    liquor in falling; and the neighbourhood of bodies by the action of the air on
                    his face. Being asked on one occasion if he would not be very well pleased to
                    have eyes, he replied, “Si la curiosité ne me dominait pas, j’aimerais bien
                    autant avoir de longs bras: il me semble que mes mains m’instruiraient mieux de
                    ce qui se passe dans la lune que vos yeux ou vos telescopes; et puis les yeux
                    cessent plutôt de voir que les mains de toucher. Il vaudrait done bien autant
                    qu’on perfectionnât en moi l’organe que j’ai, que de m’accorder celui qui me
                    manque.” He employed characters in relief in order to teach his son to read, and
                    the latter never had any other master than his father.</p>
                <p>Μ. Huber of Geneva, an excellent naturalist, and author of the best treatise
                    extant on bees and ants, was blind from his earliest infancy. In reading the
                    descriptions of these insects, we can scarcely persuade ourselves that they are
                    not the production of a singularly clear-sighted man, well versed in this branch
                    of natural history. In executing his great work, however, M. Huber had no other
                    assistance than what he derived from his domestic, who mentioned to him the
                    colour of the insects; and then he ascertained their form and size by touch,
                    with the same facility as he would have recognised them by their humming when
                    flying in the air. This laborious writer has also published a valuable work on
                    education.</p>
                <p>Francis Lcsueur, born of very poor parents, at Lyons, on the 5th of August 1766,
                    lost his sight when only six weeks old. He went to Paris in 1778, and was
                    begging at the gate of a church, when Μ. Haüy, discovering in the young
                    mendicant some inclination to study, received him, and undertook the task of
                    instructing him, at the same time promising him a sum equal to that which he had
                    collected in alms. Lesueur began to study in October 1784. Six months after, he
                    was able to read, to compose with characters in relief, to print; and in less
                    than two years he had. learned the French language, geography, and music, which
                    he understood very well. His intelligence and penetration were indeed
                    surprising, and he was among the blind what Massieu has since been among the
                    deaf and dumb. He was successively repeater to his comrades, head of the
                    printing and economy of the institution for the blind, and pensionary of the
                    Quinze-Vingts. It is painful to add, that he proved unthankful to his benefactor
                    and master, to whom he owed every thing; and that by his conduct he merited the
                    reproach of ingratitude, a vice which, with some reason, has been charged
                    against the blind generally.</p>
                <p>Avisse, born at Paris, was one of the most distinguished élèves of the
                    institution. His father, who kept furnished lodgings in the Rue Guénĉgaud,
                    intended him for the sea; and he embarked when very young on board a vessel
                    fitted out for the slave-trade, in the capacity of secretary or clerk to the
                    captain; but he was struck by a <hi rend="italic">coup de vent</hi> on the coast
                    of Africa, and lost his sight from the violent inflammation which ensued. On his
                    return his parents procured his admission into the institution for the blind,
                    where, in a few years, he became professor of grammar and logic. He produced a
                    comedy in verse, in one act, entitled, <hi rend="italic">La Ruse dAveugle,</hi>
                    which was performed on the 2d Nivose, year 5; a scene, also in verse, entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Ľ Atelier des Aveugles-travailleurs;</hi> and several other
                    pieces, which were all printed in one volume 12mo. in the year 1803. He died
                    before he had completed his thirty-first year, at the very time when the high
                    hopes entertained of him were on the point of being realized.</p>
                <p>Nor have the blind been less distinguished in the practice of the arts than in
                    science and literature. Many instances of their eminence in this respect may be
                    mentioned. Indeed, the want of sight seems little or no impediment to manual
                    dexterity. Stengel mentions a young <pb break="no" facs="nls:193198441"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-8441-0702"/> cabinet-maker of Ingolstadt, who, having lost his
                    sight by an explosion of gun-powder, amused himself by constructing
                    pepper-mills, which he made without the use of any Ģther instrument than a
                    common knife, and executed with so much exactness and elegance that they were
                    thought deserving of a place in the gallery of curiosities at Munich, where they
                    may still be seen. (Laurentius Stengelius <hi rend="italic">De Monstris,</hi> c.
                    16.) Sir Kenelm Digby has stated several extraordinary particulars of a
                    preceptor of his son, who was so completely blind that he could not distinguish
                    the light of noonday from midnight. He surpassed in skill the ablest players at
                    chess; at long distances he shot arrows with such precision as almost never to
                    miss the mark; he constantly went abroad without a guide, and frequented most of
                    the public promenades; he regularly took his place at table, and ate with such
                    dexterity that it was impossible to perceive he was blind; when any one spoke to
                    him for the first time, he was able to tell with certainty his stature and the
                    form of his body; and when his pupils recited in his presence, he knew in what
                    situation and attitude they were. (Digbaeus <hi rend="italic">De Nat.
                    Corpor.</hi> c. 28.) Aldovrandus mentions <hi rend="italic">(Hist.
                    Monstr.')</hi> a butcher of Boulogne, who estimated by touch the weight of the
                    animal he was about to kill. M. de Piles saw in Italy a blind man, a native of
                    Cambassy in Tuscany, who was a very good designer. M. de Piles met him in the
                    Justiniani Palace, where he was modelling in wax a statue of Minerva. By means
                    of touch, he had seized with precision the form and proportions of the original.
                    The duke of Bracciano, who had seen him working, doubted whether he was
                    completely blind; and, in order to put the matter to the test, he caused the
                    artist to take his portrait in a dark cave. It proved a striking likeness. Some,
                    however, objecting that the duke’s beard, which was of patriarchal amplitude,
                    had helped the artist to recognise him, the latter offered to execute a portrait
                    of one of the duke’s daughters, which he accordingly did, and it also proved an
                    excellent likeness. “J’ai vû,” says M. de Piles, “sortis des mains de cet
                    illustre aveugle les portraits du feu roi d’Angleterre, Charles I., celui du
                    pape Urbain VIII., et en France, le portrait de M. Hesselin, tous parfaitement
                    exécutés.” <hi rend="italic">(Cours de Peinture,</hi> p 260, 1766.) “Nous avons
                    vu, dès nos jours,” says Dr Guillié, to whom we are indebted for the particulars
                    of the more distinguished blind, “M. Buret, l’un des plus habiles sculpteurs de
                    l’académie, devenu aveugle, à l’âge de vingt-cinq ans, par suite de la petite
                    vérole, ne pas cesser pour cela de travailler, comme le faisait l’aveugle de
                    Cambassy.” <hi rend="italic">(Essai sur l’instruction des Aveugles,</hi> p. 94,
                    Paris, 1817.)</p>
                <p>Giovanni Gambasio of Volterra lost his sight at the age of twenty, and remained
                    ten years in this state, ignorant of even the elements of sculpture. All of a
                    sudden, however, “the desire of making a statue came upon him and having handled
                    in every way a marble figure representing Cosmo de’ Medici, he formed one of
                    clay, so extremely like that it astonished all who saw it. His talent for sta- '
                    tuary now developed itself to such a degree, that Prince Ferdinand, grand duke
                    of Tuscany, sent him to Rome to model the statue of pope Urban VIII. which he
                    also rendered a striking likeness of the original. He afterwards executed many
                    others with equal success. (Aldovrandus, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Monstr.')</hi>
                    A Dutch organist, blind from his early youth, became very skilful in his
                    profession; he also acquired the habit of distinguishing by touch the different
                    kinds of money, and even, it is said, the primary colours. He was a first-rate
                    card-player; for in dealing he knew the cards which he gave to others as well as
                    those which he kept for himself. (Lecat, <hi rend="italic">Traites des
                    Sens,</hi> p. 11.) Chauvet, born blind, was for several years organist of
                    Notre-Dame-de-Bonne-Nouvelle at Paris. Mademoiselle Paradis of Vienna, who had
                    lost her sight when two years old, formed the delight of the spiritual concerts
                    at Paris in theyear 1784. This lady, who had great talents for musical
                    composition, invented a method of writing whatever she composed, by figuring the
                    concords. She began at first by tracing them on cards pricked with needles; but
                    this first essay proving unsatisfactory, she fell upon another method, which,
                    however, has not been explained,—a circumstance we regret the more, since it has
                    been described as at once certain and of easy execution. Holman, the blind
                    traveller, being still alive, can scarcely with propriety be made the subject of
                    a notice in this place.</p>
                <p>This catalogue might easily be extended; but enough has been said, and a
                    sufficient number of facts accumulated, to show what the blind are really
                    capable of. There seems, in truth, to be a sort of compensating power, alike
                    subtile in its resources, and refined in its operation, by which a multitude of
                    latent faculties and unheeded perceptions are called into activity to supply the
                    want of one great inlet of knowledge, and which, taken in the aggregate, and
                    fully developed, appear almost sufficient to fill up the blank which has been
                    left by nature or produced by disease in the catalogue of human organs. Hence
                    there are few things practicable by persons possessed of sight which have not
                    been done by those who want it; whilst in regard to several the balance of
                    advantage is clearly in favour of the blind. This is at once a wise and
                    beneficent provision of nature; in perfect harmony with the whole economy of
                    providence in the structure of the body as well as of the mind of man; and
                    singularly illustrative of that foresight which has provided, with such
                    benevolent care, for the casualties as well as the wants to which we are exposed
                    in the present state of existence. Had the case been otherwise every loss would
                    have been irreparable, and the smallest deprivation would have driven us to
                    despair. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Blind Coal,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Anthracite,</hi> corresponds to the glance coal of England,
                    and the stone coal of Wales. It is very common in Scotland, and is sufficiently
                    abundant in Ireland. Being less frequent, and of more difficult inflammability,
                    than the common coal, it is both of minor value and of less utility. It is,
                    however, employed in burning lime, in iron founderies, and in smelting works.
