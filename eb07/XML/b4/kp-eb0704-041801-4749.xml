                    of the most celebrated physicians of the university of Montpellier, equally
                    remarkable for the variety and extent of his erudition, and for the vigour of
                    mind displayed in his abstruse speculations. He was born on the 11th of December
                    1734, at Montpellier, and received his early education at Narbonne, where his
                    family resided, and afterwards at Toulouse. He soon gave decisive indications of
                    those talents with which nature had endowed him, and which destined him to
                    occupy a distinguished station among the learned men of the age. Ardent in his
                    pursuit of knowledge, and uniting great quickness of apprehension with a
                    tenacious memory, his progress in every study which he attempted was more than
                    ordinarily rapid; he had a remarkable facility in acquiring languages, and at an
                    early age had made himself master of the ancient and of several modern ones. He
                    seems to have been for some time uncertain what profession he should follow; but
                    having at length, at the instigation of his father, commenced the study of
                    medicine at Montpellier in 1750, he pursued it with eagerness, and his success
                    was proportionate to his exertions; for, in 1753, when he had only attained his
                    19th year, he received his doctor’s degree. He afterwards occasionally visited
                    Paris, where he continued to pursue his studies with indefatigable industry; and
                    attracting the notice, not only of those who were following the same pursuits,
                    but of those who could better appreciate the full extent of his attainments, he
                    was admitted to the society, and acquired the friendship, of the most
                    distinguished literati of that period. In 1756 he obtained the appointment of
                    physician to the military hospital in Normandy, attached to the army of
                    observation commanded by Marshal d’Estrées. The zeal and assiduity with which
                    lie discharged the duties of his new office were most exemplary. He seemed
                    determined to profit to the utmost by the extensive field of observation which
                    was thus opened to him, and in which he could put to the test of experience the
                    knowledge which he had derived from other sources, and train himself in those
                    habits of nice discrimination of symptoms, and of prompt decision in practice,
                    without which learning is of little avail in the actual exercise of the art. He
                    spent his whole time at the hospital, and often passed the night by the bed-side
                    of his patients. Though naturally of a good constitution, his strength was not
                    commensurate with the ardour of his mind; and the tasks in which he engaged were
                    frequently undertaken without duly appreciating the physical powers necessary
                    for accomplishing them. His health suffered much from the intensity of his
                    application, and he was often very near falling a sacrifice to fevers and other
                    disorders, which he caught from the patients in the hospital, whom he was
                    attending too closely; and he thence became liable ever after to attacks of
                    dysentery and bilious fever.</p>
                <p>Many of the observations and inquiries whiclí he made during this period were
                    published in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">

                    crowned by the Academy of Inscriptions. In 1757 his services were required in
                    the medical staff of the army of W <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> estphalia,
                    where he had the rank of consulting physician. On his return to Paris he
                    contributed several articles to the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Savans</hi>
                    and to the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie;</hi> and was, indeed, considered for
                    a time as one of the editors of the former of those works. In 1761 he became a
                    candidate for a medical professorship at Montpellier, which he fortunately
                    succeeded in obtaining, and in which his abilities as a teacher soon shone forth
                    with unrivalled lustre. His success was the more honourable, inasmuch as his
                    colleagues, Lamure, Leroy, and Venel, were men o <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193194762" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4762-0419"/>distinguished reputation, and
                    had raised the school to a high pitch of celebrity. But the singular perspicuity
                    and precision of method, and the peculiar grace and facility of elocution, with
                    which Barthez conveyed to his hearers the ample stores of knowledge of which he
                    was in possession, soon attracted a crowd of auditors, who spread his fame in
                    all directions. He taught in succession all the branches of the medical art; and
                    pronounced, at the opening of the session in 1772, a Latin oration on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vital Principle</hi> in man, which was published in the following
                    year. About the same time appeared his work entitled <hi rend="italic">Nova
                    Doctrina de Functionibus Corporis Humani.</hi> These two works contain a sketch
                    of his peculiar doctrines in physiology; doctrines which he more fully explained
                    in a subsequent book, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Nouveaux Elémens de
                    la Science de l’Homrne∙,</hi> Montpellier, 1778, 8vo, and of which we shall
                    presently give an account.</p>
                <p>In 1774 he was created joint chancellor of the university, with the certainty of
                    succeeding singly to the office on the death of his colleague, which happened in
                    1786. He afterwards took the degree of doctor in civil law, and was appointed
                    counsellor to the supreme court of Aids at Montpellier. In 1780, he was induced
                    to fix his residence in Paris, having been nominated consulting physician to the
                    king, with a brevet of counsellor of state, and a pension of a hundred louis.
                    Honours now crowded upon him; he was admitted free associate to the Academies of
                    Sciences and of Inscriptions, and appointed first physician to the duke of
                    Orleans, in the room of Tronchin. His reputation increased in proportion as his
                    merits could be displayed on a wider theatre. He practised as a physician at
                    Paris for nearly ten years, and received the most flattering testimonials of
                    public approbation.</p>
                <p>This brilliant career was suddenly interrupted by the great political revolution
                    which broke out at this period, and by which the interests of every individual
                    in France, however tranquil his pursuits or obscure his station, were more or
                    less immediately affected.</p>
                <p>It was the occasion of Barthez quitting Paris, and seeking in his native province
                    that tranquillity and repose which the stormy aspect of the times forbade him to
                    hope for in a more conspicuous station, holding, as he did, opinions so much at
                    variance with the new order of things. Though he had lost the greater part of
                    his fortune, acquired by so much labour, and was deprived of the honours to
                    which he possessed so just a claim, he determined, upon his retiring to
                    Carcassone, to practise his profession gratuitously, and devote all his leisure
                    hours to the speculative studies connected with it, which had been the ruling
                    passion of his life. It was in this retreat that he gave to the world his <hi
                    rend="italic">Nouvelle Mécanique des Mouvemens de ĩHomme ct des Animaux,</hi>
                    which appeared in 1798, in quarto; and it was at this period, also, that he
                    composed his work on <hi rend="italic">Gout,</hi> a disease to which his
                    attention had been naturally directed, in consequence of his having frequently
                    suffered under its attacks.</p>
                <p>An occasion soon occurred which demanded his services, and he once more emerged
                    from his retirement, and repaired to the head-quarters of the army of the
                    Eastern Pyrenees, where a contagious fever, originating from the accumulation of
                    sick in the military hospitals of Perpignan, was committing great ravages. The
                    progress of this contagion was effectually arrested by the adoption of the
                    measures which he advised.</p>

                    Medicine at °ntpellier, Barthez was naturally looked up to as the P <hi

                    infirmity operated to dissuade him from resuming the <hi rend="superscript">
                    a</hi>.ollous office of teacher; and he was accordingly nominated honorary
                    professor. It was in this capacity that he pronounced, in 1801, his <hi
                    rend="italic">Discours sur le génie dHippocrate,</hi> on the solemn inauguration
                    of the bust of the father of medicine in that school. In the following year he
                    received several marks of favour from the new government under Buonaparte; he
                    was nominated titular physician to the government, and afterwards consulting
                    physician to the emperor, and member of the legion of honour.</p>
                <p>His <hi rend="italic">Traité des Maladies Goutteuses,</hi> in two volumes octavo,
                    appeared in 1802; and he afterwards occupied himself in preparing for the press
                    a new edition of his <hi rend="italic">Elémens de la Science de l’Homme,</hi> of
                    which he just lived to see the publication. His health had been declining for
                    some years before his death; he was subject to attacks of melancholy, which
                    obliged him to desist from pursuits that required intense application, and at
                    length induced him to change the scene altogether, and seek relief amidst the
                    society and amusements of the capital, where he was generally honoured and
                    esteemed. Soon after his removal to Paris, symptoms of the stone manifested
                    themselves, and increased so much in severity, that he was advised to submit to
                    the operation of lithotomy, as affording the only means of arresting a lingering
                    and painful death. But he constantly refused to undergo the pain and risk to
                    which it would have necessarily exposed him, till, after long protracted
                    suffering, during which he had in vain exhausted all the resources of medicine,
                    he was suddenly relieved by a symptomatic spitting of blood; this hemorrhage,
                    however, was pregnant with new dangers, and, by its continual recurrence, was
                    the immediate occasion of his death, on the 15th of October 1806, in the
                    seventy-second year of his age. As we have already stated, he had published in
                    the same year a second edition of his <hi rend="italic">Nouveaux Elémens de la
                    Science de ľHomme.</hi> He bequeathed his books and manuscripts to Μ. Lordat,
                    who, in consequence, published two volumesof <hi rend="italic">Consultations
                    deMedecine,</hi> Paris, 1810, 8vo, to which he prefixed a preface of his own.
                    Previous to the appearance of this work, however, a collection of consultations
                    of Barthez, and of some other physicians of Paris, was given to the world by
                    Saint-Ursin; but it appears to have been unauthorized by those to whom he had
                    confided his papers, and contains but few of the consultations which were
                    afterwards published by Μ. Lordat. Another posthumous work of Barthez, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Traite du Beazι,</hi> preceded by some account of his life, was
                    edited in 1807 by his brother, Μ. Barthez de Marmorières, who is known as the
                    author of agricultural essays, and projects for improving the maritime coast of
                    Languedoc, together with some translations from the oriental languages; and who
                    has sometimes been mistaken for the subject of the present article.</p>
                <p>Barthez has enjoyed a much higher reputation on the Continent than in this
                    country, where, indeed, his writings are but little known. The work which has
                    chiefly contributed to establish his fame, and which contains the development of
                    his peculiar opinions on physiology, is the <hi rend="italic">Nouveaux Elémens
                    de la Science de ľHomme.</hi> It is not written, however, with the simplicity
                    and clearness which might have been expected from one who had been in the
                    constant habit of instructing others, and whose lectures were generally admired
                    as possessing those qualities in an eminent degree. He appears to have been
                    early impressed with the futility of all the theories that had been hitherto
                    advanced in explanation of the phenomena presented by living beings, and to have
                    been incited to the bold attempt of raising a new system upon more rational and
                    solid foundations. In the preliminary discourse to the work we have alluded to,
                    he lays down, with great correctness, the fundamental principles of the method
                    of philosophizing in the natural sciences. The common object of these sciences
                    he states to be the research into <pb break="no" facs="nls:193194775"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-4775-0420"/>the causes of natural phenomena, in as far as they
                    can be learned by experience; and shows that we have no direct knowledge of
                    these causes, except as manifested by such of their effects as we perceive. In
                    the infancy of philosophy, numerous causes are assigned to these apparently
                    diversified effects; during its advancement, and in proportion as the similarity
                    of effects which had been referred to different causes is established, the
                    number of these assigned causes becomes more and more circumscribed. Although
                    the real nature of the agents producing those general facts, to which we
                    ultimately arrive by following this method of induction, be absolutely unknown,
                    yet, in reasoning concerning them, we find it convenient to express them by a
                    name, as if they were really known to us; in the same way as, in prosecuting an
                    algebraical calculus, we must employ characters to express the unknown as well
                    as the given quantities. But the distinction should ever be kept in view; and we
                    should err greatly were we to imagine that we could derive any ultimate
                    advantage by the substitution of other symbols, which differed from them only in
                    appearance, or which involved the admission of some hypothetical principle.</p>
                <p>Such are the rules by which he professes to be guided in his own investigations;
                    and such the tests by which he examines and passes judgment upon the doctrines
                    of the different sects of Animists, Mechanicians, and Chemists, which had
                    successively prevailed before him in the schools of medicine, and also upon the
                    more recent doctrine of the Solidists, which was then becoming fashionable. In
                    the review which he gives of the opinions of the several leaders of these sects,
                    he displays an accurate acquaintance with the wide circle of medical literature.
                    But, in the prosecution of his plan, he shows, what the example of others has so
                    often proved, that it is more easy to overthrow than to build a system; and he
                    evidently violates the strict principles of induction, and of cautious
                    limitation to the province of philosophical inquiry, which he had prescribed,
                    when he engages in the task himself. He sets out with endeavouring to establish
                    a gradation among the causes which operate in producing motion. The simplest of
                    these is the force of impulsion; that of gravitation appears to him less simple;
                    and still less so those of electricity and magnetism. The principles which
                    regulate chemical affinities are more complicated, as well as those which are
                    concerned in the crystallization of bodies. But the forces which produce the
                    phenomena of living vegetables and animals are of a more refined order, and are
                    all referable, according to Barthez, to a single cause, which he denominates the
                    <hi rend="italic">vital principle,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">principle of
                    life.</hi> Having established this dogma, he proceeds to discuss a variety of
                    abstruse questions that have been agitated on the subject, such as, whether the
                    vital principle has an independent'existence, distinct from the organized body
                    which it animates; and whether it be a modification of the soul, or rational
                    mind. He gives an elaborate historical sketch of the opinions of philosophers
                    from the earliest times respecting the nature of life; tracing the different
                    sentiments entertained by the followers of Aristotle and Descartes, together
                    with the Stahlians and Boer-haavians, on the one hand; and those of Pythagoras,
                    of Plato, and the sect of Stoics, on the other: the former not acknowledging any
                    principle of life distinct from either matter or mind, and the latter admitting
                    such a principle attached to the living body. A third class of philosophers is.
                    noticed, at the head of which he places Bacon, and with which he associates
                    Leibnitz, Cudworth, Van Helmont, and Hoffmann, who have recognised the existence
                    of a vital power different from the ordinary physical properties of matter, and
                    at the same time totally distinct from the soul. After expending much useless
                    argument in refutation of the Stahlian doctrine of the identity of the vital
                    with the thinking principle, and devoting a long chapter to the consideration of
                    doubts as to our means of deciding the question, he shows himself strongly
                    inclined to the belief that the principle of life is something which has a
                    separate existence, distinct from any modification, either of matter or of mind.
                    There is little doubt, indeed, that this was his firm persuasion, as he reasons
                    from it in many parts of his work, though he seems averse to declare it without
                    qualification, while he is discussing these questions. Having thus <hi
                    rend="italic">personified,</hi> as he very aptly expresses it, this new
                    principle of life, he appeals to it for the solution of every difficulty. It is
                    the master-key which unlocks every secret, and renders all the operations of
                    the· living animal body perfectly intelligible. Irritability and sensibility are
                    at once the direct effects of this universal agent. All the modifications of
                    these properties, and, in a word, every phenomenon of life, which is not
                    obviously the result of physical laws, are but so many immediate operations of
                    the vital principle. To this fertile source he refers not only the ordinary
                    muscular contractions, but also the slower and less sensible motions which take
                    place in the iris, in the vascular system, and, in general, in those parts in
                    which no muscular structure can be discerned; effects which he attributes to the
                    tonic power of the vital principle. He contends for the existence of another
                    power in the fibres, still derived from the same source, namely, the power of
                    elongation after they have been contracted; a power which he thinks quite
                    distinct from the other mechanical properties of the fibre, and of which the
                    operation is exemplified in the dilatation of the pupil, the extension of the
                    <hi rend="italic">corpora cavernosa,</hi> and of the nipples, and in the
                    diastole of the heart itself. He plumes himself more particularly upon his
                    supposed discovery of a new species of force distinct from the muscular power;
                    which he terms the <hi rend="italic">force of fixed situation,</hi> and of which
                    lie infers the existence from the circumstance of the <hi rend="italic">tendο
                    Achillis</hi> being ruptured, and of the <hi rend="italic">patella</hi> and head
                    of the <hi rend="italic">os calcis</hi> being fractured, on some occasions, by
                    an apparently slight exertion. He avails himself of this principle, also, to
                    explain the phenomena of <hi rend="italic">tetanus</hi> and other spasmodic
                    affections.</p>
                <p>In a subsequent part of the work he labours to establish the identity of
                    sensibility and irritability, or, at least, the intimate connection which
                    .subsists between them, and the dependence of both upon the immediate and direct
                    operations of the vital principle. He endeavours to prove that both the
                    sensitive and moving powers are exercised in the circulating fluids of the body,
                    and adduces, in support of this opinion, many of the arguments brought forward
                    by Mr Hunter in proof of the vitality of the blood. 0∏ the subject of secretion,
                    implying processes which have hitherto been enveloped in so much darkness, and
                    of which the explanation has in vain been sought for on mechanical and chemical
                    principles, he is very brief, as it is the peculiar advantage of his theory,
                    like the sword of Alexander, to cut through every knot that bids defiance to
                    ordinary powers of unravelling. Secretion, being inexplicable by any of the
                    hitherto known laws of nature, is, of course, simply the effect of the vital
                    principle. The phenomena of animal heat were in danger of being at once
                    consigned to the same Proteus-like power which could operate every possible
                    diversity of effects. But chemistry had, in this instance, interposed some
                    plausible theories, which must first be set aside; and-Bartbez is at great pains
                    to state the reasons of his dissent from the received doctrines on this subject,
                    and of his disbelief in the existence of caloric. He prefers the hypothesis
                    which supposes heat to be a mere quality, excited by motion, an generated,,
                    accordingly, in living animals by the intestino <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193194788" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4788-0421"/>motions of their fluids, and
                    the friction of the solids against each other; and the cause of these motions
                    and frictions being unknown, it followed, as a necessary consequence, that they
                    must arise from the operation of the vital principle. Respiration he considers
                    as a cooling or moderating process, and as useful, also, in exciting throughout
                    the system the tonic actions; but all these actions and agitations of the
                    fibres, and these intestine motions of the fluids, are still regulated by the
                    vital principle which adapts them to variations of climate and other external
                    circumstances of temperature.</p>
                <p>Amidst these vague and unprofitable speculations, his work contains a great store
                    of facts, which are often instructive, though sometimes they expose the
                    credulity of the author. He has collected, for example, a number of curious
                    particulars relative to the operation of different poisons on different animals;
                    but intermingles with these well-attested facts many idle tales respecting the
                    bites of rabid or enraged animals, in which the peculiar manners of the animal
                    were communicated to the human species. Thus he quotes instances of men barking
                    or attempting to bite in hydrophobia; of some mewing like cats after having been
                    bitten by these animals; and of others, again, who flapped their arms, and
                    crowed like cocks, after receiving the bite of one of these birds.</p>
                <p>A large portion of the work is dedicated to the consideration of sympathies,
                    which he distinguishes from wbat he terms synergies, defining the latter to be
                    the connection, whether simultaneous or successive, of the vital forces of
                    different organs, so as to constitute a function or a disease. He divides
                    sympathies into three classes, according as they occur between organs having no
                    visible relation to each other, those which have similar structures and
                    functions, and those which are united by an intermediate texture, or by
                    receiving the same set of vessels or nerves. His chapter on temperaments is ably
                    drawn up; and he discusses well the comparative influence of physical and moral
                    causes in modifying the human temperament, and the changes produced by age and
                    the approach of death. He explains the operation of the more usual causes of
                    death; enters into a comparison of the mutability of different seasons and
                    climates; and concludes, from several facts and arguments, that the actual
                    cessation of life is, in general, not accompanied by any painful sensation.</p>
                <p>The merit of Barthez as a physiologist is more conspicuous on subjects which
                    admitted less of his being led astray by his proneness to indulge in abstract
                    speculation, and his predilection for metaphysical refinement. The most
                    favourable specimen of his talents is afforded by his <hi rend="italic">Nouvelle
                    Mécanique des Mouvemβns de l’Homme et des Animaux;</hi> in which, avoiding all
                    discussion as to the cause of muscular motion, he traces the mode in which this
                    force has been applied by nature, according to the principles of mechanism, in
                    effecting the different movements of the animal machine. He examines the
                    relative disposition of the bones and muscles, the structure of the
                    articulations, and the general play and particular motions °ı the limbs. Borelli
                    <hi rend="italic">(De Motu Animalium')</hi> had given the first model of such a
                    work; but Barthez has investigated the subject with greater care, and has
                    extended his <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> θ'vs to a much wider range of
                    phenomena. He enters minutely into the consideration of a great variety of modes
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> locomotion, both in man and the inferior animals,
                    for ∏ ach he has amassed an immense number of facts; oming, altogether, a work
                    which will ever remain a monument of his industry and superior abilities.</p>
                <p>∏ consulting his writings on the practical branches of is profession, we again
                    find ourselves bewildered in a - ynnth of speculations on the proximate causes
                    of disease, and the <hi rend="italic">modus operandi</hi> of remedies. In his
                    <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Gout,</hi> he adopts the principles of the humoral
                    pathology, in addition to his own physiological doctrines concerning the force
                    of fixed situation, or principle which retains muscular parts in their
                    appropriate places independently of irritability. He states the proximate cause
                    of this disease to be a specific gouty state of the habit, which he infers from
                    the supposed influence he has observed from specific remedies, and especially
                    <hi rend="italic">aconite,</hi> in curing it. He defines the gouty state of the
                    blood to consist in “an improper mixture of its component parts, which· prevents
                    in different degrees the natural formation of its excrementitious humours; so
                    that these humours, being more or less altered, undergo a spontaneous
                    decomposition, which causes the earthy substance to predominate in them.” This
                    earthy substance, or, in other words, gouty matter, is deposited upon the
                    extremities, and thus occasions the paroxysm. His practice, on the whole,
                    notwithstanding his adoption of theories now generally exploded, is tolerably
                    judicious; though he shows but little discrimination in the analysis which he
                    gives of the works of practical authors on this disease; and he seems to be
                    strangely deficient in information as to the practice of English physicians. In
                    other respects his knowledge is accurate and copious; and the history he gives
                    of several of the irregular forms of gout, and also that of sciatica, in which,
                    however, he chiefly follows Co-tannius, are deserving of praise.</p>
                <p>In the preface to his <hi rend="italic">Nova Doctrina de Furictionibus Naturae
                    Humanae,</hi> he has given an excellent arrangement of the general principles of
                    the objects to be kept in view in the medical treatment of diseases. He treats
                    of this subject more at large in his treatise <hi rend="italic">De Methodo
                    Medendi,</hi> published at Montpellier in 1777, and also in the preface to his
                    <hi rend="italic">Traite des Maladies Goutteuses.</hi> He considers all the
                    different methods and indications of cure as capable of being comprehended under
                    three heads, the natural, the analytic, and the empiric. The natural, methods
                    have for their object to promote the spontaneous operations of nature tending to
                    restore health, or, as they have been usually termed, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vires medicatrices naturae.</hi> The analytic methods are those which proceed
                    upon a previous analysis of the disease into the several simpler diseases of
                    which it consists, or into their ultimate component symptoms, which are
                    separately and successively combated by means respectively suited to each. These
                    are the more indicated, in proportion as the disease is more complex, and admits
                    of being resolved into a greater number of elements. The empiric plan of
                    treatment is directed to change the whole nature of the disease, by means of
                    which experience has taught us the efficacy in analogous cases. These means are
                    of three kinds; having either a perturbing, an imitative, or a specific
                    operation: the first being such as, by producing effects of a different kind
                    from those of the disease, tend to diminish or entirely suppress the latter (as
                    when the paroxysm of an ague is prevented by the excitement of a strong
                    sudorific or cathartic operation); the second, such as produce effects analogous
                    to those which nature herself employs for the cure of the disease; and the third
                    those whose salutary operation is known in no other way than as the direct
                    result of experience.</p>
                <p>The writings of Barthez appear to have had considerable influence in overthrowing
                    many of the crude and preposterous theories which had prevailed in the schools
                    of medicine; and, however he may have been seduced from the path of genuine
                    philosophy by an excessive disposition to generalize, and an overweening
                    fondness for abstruse speculation, he still deserves the praise of being an
                    original thinker <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> and of standing pre-eminent among

                    contemporaries for the courage with which he shook off the trammels of
                    authority, in a university where it had ruled with despotic sway, and where the
                    dogmas of antiquity were held in peculiar reverence. <hi rend="smallcaps">'
