                <p><label type="entry">BERNARD, <hi rend="smallcaps">St</hi></label>, the first
                    abbot of Clairvaux, was born in the year 1091, in the village of Fontaine, in
                    Burgundy. He acquired so great a reputation by his zeal and abilities, that all
                    the affairs of the church appeared to rest upon his shoulders, and kings and
                    princes seemed to have chosen him as general arbitrator of their differences. It
                    was owing to him that Innocent II. was acknowledged sovereign pontiff, and that,
                    after the death of Peter Louis anti-pope, Victor, who had been named successor,
                    made a voluntary abdication of his dignity. He convicted Abelard at the council
                    of Sens, in the year 1140; he opposed the monk Raoul; he persecuted the
                    followers of Arnaud dc Bresse; and, in 1148, he caused Gilbert de la Por-vicé,
                    bishop of Poitiers, and Eonde l’Etoile, to be condemned in the council of
                    Rheims. By such zealous behaviour he verified, according to Mr Bayle, the
                    interpretation of his mother’s dream. She had dreamed, when with child of him,
                    that she should bring forth a white dog, whose barking should be very loud.
                    Astonished at this dream, which she was unable to unriddle, she consulted a
                    monk, who said to her, “Bc of good courage; you shall have a son who shall guard
                    the house of God, and bark loudly against the enemies of the faith.” But St
                    Bernard went far beyond the prediction; for he barked sometimes against
                    chimerical enemies, and was more successful in exterminating the heterodox than
                    in putting down infidels, although he attacked the latter, not only with the
                    ordinary arms of his eloquence, but also with the extraordinary weapon of
                    prophecy. He preached up the crusade under Louis the Younger, and added greatly
                    to the troops of the crusaders. But all the fine hopes with which he had
                    flattered the people were disappointed by the event; and when it was alleged
                    that he had hurried a vast number of Christians to slaughter, without sharing
                    the dangers which he had induced so many to brave, the saint defended himself by
                    alleging that the sins of the crusaders had destroyed the efficacy of his
                    prophecies. He is said, however, to have founded 160 monasteries, and to have
                    wrought a prodigious number of miracles. H <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> died

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bernard,</hi><hi rend="italic">Dr Edward,</hi> a learned
                    astronomer, linguist, and critic, was born at Perry St Paul, on the 2d of May
                    1638, and educated at Merchant-Tailor’s school, and St John’s College, Oxford.
                    During his stay at school he had laid in such a fund of classical learning,
                    that, on entering the university, he was master of all the elegancies of the
                    Greek and Latin tongues, and not unacquainted with the Hebrew. On his settling
                    in the university, he applied himself to the study of history, philology, and
                    philosophy, and made himself master of the Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, and Coptic
                    languages; after which he turned his attention to the study of the mathematics
                    under Dr Wallis. Having successively taken the degrees of bachelor and master of
                    arts, and afterwards that of bachelor of divinity, he went to Leyden to consult
                    several oriental manuscripts left to the university there by Joseph Scaliger and
                    Levi-nus Warnerus. At his return to Oxford he collated and examined the most
                    valuable manuscripts in the Bodleian library; and being of a communicative
                    disposition, he in consequence became engaged in a very extensive correspondence
                    with the learned of most countries. In the year 1669 the celebrated Christopher
                    Wren, Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford, having been appointed surveyor
                    general of his majesty’s works, and obliged by this employment to spend much of
                    his time in London, obtained leave to name a deputy at Oxford, and immediately
                    pitched upon Mr Bernard; which engaged the latter in a more particular
                    application to the study of astronomy. In 1676 he was sent by the earl of
                    Arlington to France as tutor to the dukes of Grafton and Northumberland, sons of
                    Charles II. by the duchess of Cleveland, and then living with their mother at
                    Paris; but the simplicity of his manners not suiting the gaiety of the duchess’s
                    family, he returned about a year after to Oxford, and resumed his studies, in
                    which he made great proficiency, as his astronomical and critical works
                    abundantly testify. He composed tables of the longitudes, latitudes, right
                    ascensions, and declinations of the fixed stars; Observations in Latin on the
                    Obliquity of the Ecliptic; and several other pieces inserted in the
                    Philosophical Transactions. He also wrote, 1. A Treatise on the Ancient Weights
                    and Measures; 2. <hi rend="italic">Chronologiae Samaritanoe Synopsis,</hi> in
                    two tables; 3. Testimonies of the Ancients concerning the Greek Version of the
                    Old Testament by the Seventy; and several other learned works. He was a person
                    of great piety, virtue, and humanity, and died on the 12th January 1696, in the
                    fifty-ninth year of his age, leaving behind him a number of manuscripts which
                    were considered valuable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bernard,</hi><hi rend="italic">James,</hi> professor of
                    philosophy and mathematics, and minister of the Walloon church at Leyden, was
                    born on the 1st September 1658, at Nions, in Dauphine. Having studied at Geneva,
                    he returned to France in 1679, and was chosen minister of Venterol, a village m
                    Dauphine, whence he was removed some time afterwards to the church of Vinsobres,
                    in the same province. But the persecution raised against the Protestants in
                    France having obliged him to abandon his native country, he retired to Holland,
                    where he was received with great civility, and appointed one of the pensionary
                    ministers of Gauda. In July 1688 he began a political publication entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire Abrégée de l’Europe,</hi> which he continued monthly till
                    December 1688. In 1692 he began his <hi rend="italic">Lettres Historiques,</hi>
                    containing an account of the most important transactions in Europe, with
                    suitable reflections; and he carried on this work, which was also published
                    monthly, till the end of the year 1698. It was afterwards continued by other
                    hands, and consists of a great number of volumes. Mr le Clerc having left off
                    his <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque Universelle</hi> in 1691, Mr Bernard wrote
                    the greater part of the twentieth volume, and carried on the five following
                    volumes to the year 1693. In 1698 he collected and published <hi rend="italic"
                    >Actes et Négociations de la Paix de Ryszvic,</hi> in four volumes 12mo. In 1699
                    lie began the <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles de la République des Lettres,</hi>
                    which continued till December 1710. Mr Bernard having acquired great reputation
                    by his works, as well as by his sermons at Gauda and the Hague, the congregation
                    of the Walloon church at Leyden became extremely desirous to have him as one of
                    their ministers; and a vacancy happening in 1705, he was unanimously elected to
                    that office. About the same time Mr de Valder, professor of philosophy and
                    mathematics at Leyden, having resigned his situation, Mr Bernard was appointed
                    his successor; and the university presented him with the degrees of doctor in
                    philosophy and master of arts. His public and private lectures occupied the
                    greater part of his time; yet he did not neglect his pastoral function, but
                    composed his sermons with great care, and also wrote two excellent treatises,
                    one on a late repentance, the other on the excellency of religion. In 1716 he
                    published a supplement to Moreri’s Dictionary, in two volumes folio. The same
                    year he resumed his <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles de la République des
                    Lettres,</hi> and continued it till his death, which happened on the 27th of
                    April 1718, in the sixtieth year of his age.</p>
