                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> bee, from its singular instincts, its active
                    industry, and the useful products resulting from its labours, has, from the
                    remotest times, attracted the attention, not only of naturalists, but of mankind
                    in general. No nation upon ' earth has had so many historians as this remarkable
                    tribe of insects. The patience and sagacity of the naturalist have had an ample
                    field for exercise in the study of their structure, physiology, and domestic
                    economy. Their preservation and increase have been objects of assiduous care to
                    the agriculturist; and their reputed perfection of policy and government have
                    long been the theme of admiration, and have afforded copious materials for
                    argument and allusion to the poet and the moralist in every age. It is a subject
                    that has been celebrated and adorned by the muse of Virgil, as well as
                    illustrated by the philosophic genius of Aristotle. Cicero and Pliny report that
                    Aris-tomachus devoted himself during sixty years to the study of these insects;
                    and Philiscus is said to have retired into a desert wood, that he might pursue
                    his observations on them without interruption. A prodigious number of authors
                    have written express treatises on bees; periodical works have been published
                    relating exclusively to their management and economy; and learned societies have
                    been established for the sole purpose of conducting researches on this subject.
                    The most celebrated association of this kind is the <hi rend="italic">Société
                    des Abeilles,</hi> founded about fifty years ago in Little Bautzen, a village in
                    Upper Lausatia, under the auspices of the elector of Saxony. Its labours, as we
                    shall presently find, have enriched the science with a number of valuable
                    discoveries.</p>
                <p>In so complicated a branch of natural history, the application of the difficult
                    art of observing correctly, and of the cautious processes of induction, cannot
                    be effected without laborious and long-continued efforts. But, on the subject of
                    bees, the inquirer after truth had, besides, many obstacles to encounter, from
                    the very general diffusion of errors, which had been transmitted without due
                    examination from one author to another. The history of the opinions of
                    successive writers will sufficiently prove how gradual and how slow has been the
                    advancement of real knowledge in what concerns these insects, and will teach us
                    to estimate the value of that which we at length possess, as being the result of
                    the labour of ages, and as being extorted from nature by indefatigable and
                    persevering exertions. So great an accumulation of curious and interesting
                    facts, indeed, has accrued to us from the researches of Swammerdam, Maraldi,
                    Reaumur, Schirach, and Huber, as to constitute almost a new science. Many of
                    these have been discovered subsequently to the time of the compilation of the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Bee</hi> in the preceding edition of this work. It
                    will therefore be proper, in this place, to give a connected and systematic
                    account of the natural history of this remarkable insect. For the details of the
                    external characters and distinctions of species, we shall refer to the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Entomology.</hi> The principal features of their internal
                    conformation will be described when treating of the particular functions to
                    which they are more immediately subservient; and our descriptions will apply,
                    more especially, to the common and best-known species, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apis mellifica,</hi> which is the one particularly prized on account of the
                    rich products it affords.</p>
                <p>The economy of bees comprehends so wide a field of inquiry, the different parts
                    of which are so connected and dependent upon one another, that it is impossible
                    to treat of them distinctly, without supposing the reader to possess some
                    general acquaintance with the history of these insects. We shall therefore
                    premise a brief account of the different sorts of bees inhabiting the hive, and
                    of the respective offices of each. We shall then proceed to consider their
                    comparative physiology; under which head we shall state the leading particulars
                    relating to their nutrition, secretion, respiration, progressive motion,
                    external senses, and instincts. We shall next follow them in their different
                    labours, from the period when the swarm has settled in a new habitation; we
                    shall detail the complex structure of their hives,—their curious processes of
                    architecture,—the pains they bestow on rearing their progeny, and in sending
                    forth new swarms; and this will lead us to the subject of the fecundation of the
                    queens, and the massacre of the drones. After having thus given an account of
                    their usual condition, we shall, in the last place, describe the result of
                    several experiments and observations which have been made when they were placed
                    in unusual circumstances; experiments which have exhibited many interesting
                    features of their character, and have thrown considerable light on the whole of
                    their history, as well as suggested various practical and economic applications
                    in the management of these insects.</p>
                <p>The leading feature in their history, and one which distinguishes them from
                    almost all insects, is their singular distribution into three different kinds,
                    constituting, to all appearance, so many different modifications of sex. The
                    drone, which is characterized by a thicker body, a round head, a more flattened
                    shape, and more obtusely-terminated abdomen, within which are contained the male
                    organs of generation, has been admitted as the male of the species. It is
                    distinguished also by the absence of a sting, and by the humming noise that
                    accompanies its flight. The queen-bee, which is larger than any of the others,
                    has the abdomen of greater length, and is provided with a sting, and with two
                    ovaria of considerable size, is unequivocally recognised as the female. The
                    working bees compose the third class, and are distinguished by the smallness of
                    their size, their lengthened proboscis, the peculiar structure of their legs and
                    thighs, which are adapted to the collection of certain materials obtained from
                    vegetables, and by the apparent absence of every trace of generative organs,—we
                    say apparent absence, because, as will be hereafter stated, rudiments of ovaria
                    have been very lately discovered to exist, which, however, are not perceptible
                    without a very minute and careful dissection-Till within a few years the working
                    bees were regarded as animals deprived of sex, and were accordingly termed <hi
                    rend="italic">neuters</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mules.</hi> It is these which
                    perform all the laborious offices for the community,—which construct the
                    interior of their habitation,—which explore the country in search of nourishment
                    and other materials,—which collect and bring them to the hive, and apply them to
                    different purposes; it is this kind that assiduously attend upon the queen, and
                    supply all her wants,—that defend the hive from the attacks of depredators, and
                    carry on hostilities against the various enemies of the tribe. The life of the
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196062" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6062-0519"/> females is
                    chiefly engrossed with the duties of laying ' eggs, and conducting the colonies,
                    which, at certain periods, emigrate from the parent state. The drones, producing
                    neither wax nor honey, and depending on the rest for their Subsistence, are idle
                    spectators of these labours. They appear to be formed only for the momentary but
                    important duty of impregnation, since they perish when this purpose is
                    accomplished. There is commonly only one perfect queen existing at a time within
                    each hive; and she appears to be treated by all the other bees with every mark
                    of affection and of deference. The number of labourers is very different in
                    different hives; sometimes there are only a few thousands; at other times from
                    twenty to forty, or even fifty thousand. The drones, even in the spring, seldom
                    compose more than one thirtieth or one fortieth of the whole; and, at other
                    seasons, there are none to be found in the hive. In order to form some estimate
                    of the number of bees which can occupy a certain space, Mr Hunter counted what
                    number of drowned bees could be contained in an alehouse pint, and found it to
                    be 2160; so that if a swarm were to fill two quarts, their numbers would be
                    nearly 9000. Reaumur, with the same view of ascertaining their numbers, employed
                    the more accurate method of weighing them; he found that a collection' of them,
                    weighing one ounce, consisted of 336 bees; and, therefore, that 16 ounces, or
                    one pound, would consist of 5376 bees.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding these differences in conformation, instincts, and offices,
                    between the queen-bee and the workers, it is now established, upon the most
                    incontrovertible evidence, that they both originally proceed from the same kind
                    of larva, and that the queen-bee lays only two kinds of eggs, the one destined
                    to produce the drone, the others capable of being converted, according to
                    circumstances, either into a worker or a queen. It has been proved that the
                    former, although exhibiting no appearance of sexual organs on a superficial
                    examination, are in reality females, and have the rudiments of these organs,
                    which, from their not being developed, are incapable of exercising their proper
                    functions. It may be remarked, that the idea of the working bees being radically
                    females, had been suggested long ago by Dr Warder, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monarchy of Bees,</hi> in which he terms them “True Amazons but no attention
                    had been paid to his opinion. The real merit of this great discovery, which
                    affords the key to a multitude of hitherto inexplicable facts, unquestionably
                    belongs to Mr Schirach, vicar of Little Bautzen, the secretary of the Lausatian
                    Society, to which we formerly adverted. When first announced to the world, it
                    was received with suspicion by the greater number of naturalists, and with
                    complete incredulity by others. It was, indeed, at variance with the whole tenor
                    of the observations of Swammerdam, Maraldi, and Reaumur. Wilhelmi, the
                    brother-in-law of Schirach, though an eye-witness of the experiments from which
                    he had deduced this theory, for a long time refused to admit the doctrine, but
                    became at length one of its most strenuous supporters. It is noticed in a vein
                    of sarcastic ridicule by Mr John Hunter, in his otherwise excellent paper on
                    bees in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions.</hi> Needham wrote a
                    memoir for the Imperial Academy of Brussels in 1777, for the express purpose of
                    refuting it; and he then inveighs in strong language against those naturalists
                    who had deigned to give it the least countenance. Mr Key, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bath Society Papers,</hi> declares that he made experiments on
                    this subject for eight years, without obtaining a single result in conformity to
                    Schirach’s views, nonnet, after exercising a laudable scepticism, and making a
                    diligent inquiry, in which he displays a genuine spirit of philosophy, yielded a
                    reluctant assent. But the truth of the doctrine has since been placed beyond the
                    reach of controversy by multiplied series of observations and experiments in
                    different parts of Europe; and more especially by the recent investigations of
                    Mr Huber of Geneva. We shall not at present enter into the detail of proofs,
                    because their force will be better appreciated when other particulars belonging
                    to the history of the bee have been explained.</p>
                <p>In considering the physiology of the bee, the first function that claims our
                    notice is that of nutrition. The food of bees is principally of two kinds,
                    namely, the fluid secretions of vegetables contained in the nectarea of the
                    flowers, and the dust of the antherae, which has been termed by botanists the
                    pollen, but which, when collected by the bees, has received a variety of
                    appellations, such as farina, bee-bread, raw wax (cz&gt;e <hi rend="italic"
                    >brute),</hi> &amp;c. Occasionally, however, we find bees feeding upon other
                    saccharine substances besides honey, such as honey-dew, treacle, syrup,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The organs by which they collect food are extremely complex, for they comprise
                    instruments adapted to the reception of liquid aliment as well as those fitted
                    for the division of solid materials. Reaumur has given the most elaborate
                    description of these organs, in which he has corrected some errors that
                    Swammerdam had fallen into. For the purpose of taking up fluids, they are
                    provided, in common with all hymenopterous insects, with a long and flexible
                    proboscis or trunk, which may be considered as a lengthened tongue, though,
                    strictly speaking, it is formed by a prolongation of the under lip. It is not
                    tubular, as Swammerdam had supposed, but solid throughout; and the minute
                    depression at its extremity is not the aperture of any canal through which
                    liquids can be absorbed. Cuvier, in his <hi rend="italic">Leçons d’Anatomie
                    Comparée,</hi> has not marked this distinguishing feature in the proboscis of
                    the bee, but speaks of it in common with the tubular trunks of the other
                    hymenoptera, and describes its aperture as being situated in the lower part. But
                    Reaumur has very satisfactorily shown that the trunk of the bee performs
                    strictly the office of a tongue, and not that of a tube for suction; for when it
                    takes up honey or other fluid aliment, the under or the upper surfaces are more
                    immediately applied to it, and rolled from side to side, and the bee thus licks
                    up what adheres to it, while the extremity of the trunk is frequently not
                    applied at all to the substance taken up. The trunk is supported on a pedicle,
                    which admits of being bent back or propelled forwards, and thus can retract or
                    stretch out the trunk to a considerable extent. Protection is given to it by a
                    double sheath; the external, consisting of two scales furnished by the expansion
                    of one of the portions of the labial palpi; and the internal, formed by the
                    prolongation of the two external portions of the jaw. The whole member thus
                    consists of five principal parts, on which account Fabricius termed it <hi
                    rend="italic">lingua quinquefida.</hi></p>
                <p>For the purpose of mechanically dividing solid mate-; rials, the mouth is
                    furnished with two strong mandibles and four palpi; they are but little employed
                    in eating, but are of great use in enabling the insect to seize and break down
                    hard substances for other purposes. In the working bee all these parts are of
                    larger dimensions than in the other kinds. The teeth are two in number, and have
                    the form of concave scales with sharp edges; they are fixed to the ends of the
                    jaws, and play horizontally as in other insects. Reaumur describes and
                    delineates a large aperture above the root of the proboscis, which is so
                    surrounded with fleshy parts as not to be readily seen unless the proboscis be
                    extended and bent downwards. This he considers as the mouth or orifice of the
                    gullet; on the upper side of which, and of course opposite to the root of the
                    proboscis, a small fleshy and pointed organ is seen, which he regards as the
                    tongue, assisting in the deglutition of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196075"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-6075-0520"/>food. Through this orifice, it is presumed, all
                    the aliment, whether liquid or solid, passes; the former being conveyed to it by
                    the trunk, which, by its contractile power, presses forward the fluids it has
                    collected between itself and the inner sheath, and the latter being received
                    directly after its comminution by the teeth, behind which it is situated.
                    Latreille, however, whose authority is great on a point of this nature, thinks
                    that Reaumur has deceived himself with regard to such an aperture, and
                    disbe!ieves its existence. He conceives that the food simply passes on by the
                    sides of the tongue, finding its way from thence into the oesophagus, and so on
                    to the stomach.</p>
                <p>The bee has two stomachs; the first is a large transparent membranous bag,
                    pointed in front, and swelling out into two pouches behind. It performs an
                    office, in some respects analogous to that of the crop in birds; for it receives
                    and retains for a time the fluid of the nectarea, which does not appear to
                    differ in any respect from honey. Mr Hunter observes, that, whatever time the
                    contents of this reservoir may be retained, he never found them altered, so as
                    to give the idea of digestion having taken place. The coats of this reservoir
                    are muscular, by which means it is capable of throwing up the honey into the
                    mouth, so that it is regurgitated into the honey cells, or imparted to other
                    bees. None of it ever passes out from the extremity of the trunk, as Swammerdam
                    had believed. For the purpose of digestion, a second stomach is provided, which
                    takes its origin from the middle of the two posterior lobes of the former, and
                    is of a lengthened cylindrical shape. Its communication with the intestine is
                    not direct, but takes place by a projecting or inverted pylorus, thickest at its
                    most prominent part, with a very small opening in the centre, of a peculiar
                    construction. This inward projecting part is easily seen through the coats of
                    the reservoir, especially if full of honey. A similar kind of structure takes
                    place at the communication of the first with the second stomach, and, having the
                    properties of a valve, must effectually prevent all regurgitation from the
                    latter into the former.</p>
                <p>The pollen of flowers, which is the other principal article of food, was shown by
                    Swammerdam to consist of an infinite number of small particles, generally of a
                    globular shape, each of which is found to be a small capsule, inclosing the
                    still finer dust or fecundating principle destined to be shed on the pistils for
                    the purpose of germination. Geoffroy has given a memoir, published in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Collection Academique des Sciences,</hi> containing a minute
                    description of the shapes of these capsules, taken from different flowers. The
                    working bees, by means of the pencil of hair which grows on the tarsi, first
                    collect a certain quantity of pollen, which they knead together into a ball, and
                    place it in the concave space which is situated at the middle joint of the
                    hinder feet, and has been termed the basket. The surrounding rows of hairs keep
                    the ball from falling off. In order to gather larger quantities at once, the
                    bees are sometimes observed to roll their bodies on the flower, and then,
                    brushing off the pollen which adheres to them with their feet, form it into two
                    masses, which they dispose of as before mentioned; and it is said that, in moist
                    weather, when the particles of pollen cannot be readily made to cohere together,
                    they return to their hive dusted all over with pollen, which they then brush off
                    -with their feet. They are often obliged to tear open the capsules which contain
                    the pollen, in order to procure a supply of this substance, when it has not yet
                    been shed by the flowers.</p>
                <p>Pollen is yielded by flowers during the spring in such abundance that the bees of
                    a single hive will often bring back one pound, or even more, in a day. Some
                    agriculturists have accordingly imagined, that the vegetation of some plants
                    might be endangered from this great consumption of the fecundating principle by
                    insects in general; for other insects besides bees seek it with avidity. But
                    this fear has been proved to be totally without foundation, and the practice of
                    destroying bees in order to prevent this imaginary danger is therefore as
                    useless as it is barbarous. It would appear, indeed, that so far from
                    obstructing the fecundation of plants, the labours of the bee have often tended
                    materially to promote it, by the agitation which they give to the flower, and by
                    transporting the pollen from one flower to another. In this manner may we
                    account for the number of hybrid flowers that are met with near the haunts of
                    bees.</p>
                <p>It has been shown very clearly by Huber, in a paper in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal de Physique,</hi> that pollen is peculiarly the food of the young bees,
                    and is collected by the working bees with this intention. Reaumur, however,
                    asserts that he has seen adult bees devour pollen. Swammerdam, who conceived the
                    trunk to be tubular, rejected the idea that pollen could ever be the food of
                    bees, as the globules of which it consists are incapable of entering an orifice
                    so minute as that which appears at the extremity of the trunk, and which, as he
                    was unacquainted with the real mouth, he thought was the only passage to the
                    stomach. Latreille, who does not admit the existence of the large mouth
                    described by Reaumur, states that the mandibles lay hold of the pollen, and
                    carry it to the base of the trunk, from whence it finds its way into the
                    oesophagus by the sides of that organ.</p>
                <p>Of honey-dew, which forms part of the food of bees, we shall merely remark that
                    it is an excrementitious matter deposited on the leaves of plants by certain
                    species of aphides.</p>
                <p>An abundant supply of water is essential to the healthy condition of bees. They
                    consume a large quantity, and often stop to drink at the edge of stagnant pools,
                    and seem even to prefer putrid and urinous waters to purer streams, as if their
                    saline and pungent qualities were grateful to them.</p>
                <p>It has been long the opinion that wax was but a slight modification of pollen,
                    which required for this conversion ∣ merely the application of a certain
                    pressure, and a kind of kneading by the feet of the bees. Many naturalists, such
                    as Bernard de Jussieu, had pérsuaded themselves that the dust of the stamina of
                    flowers contained wax ready formed as one of its ingredients, and quoted the
                    following experiment in proof of this opinion: If the minute grains of pollen be
                    put into water, they gradually swell, till they at length burst, at which moment
                    a small jet of an oily liquor will be perceived, which floats on the water
                    without mixing with it. But Reaumur had attempted in vain to extract any thing
                    like wax from dust of the antherae; and, indeed, an attention to the chemical
                    properties of these two substances would have sufficiently pointed out their
                    essential differences. From the upper surface of the leaves of many kinds of
                    trees, a substance has indeed been obtained, which possesses all the qualities
                    of bees’ wax; but nothing like it can be extracted from pollen. Reaumur was
                    persuaded that the pollen was elaborated in the second stomach of the bee, and
                    thrown up into the mouth in the form of a white foam, which, by exposure to the
                    air, hardened, and became wax; and that the bee took advantage of its soft state
                    to apply it in the building of the combs. So circumstantial an account, given to
                    us by a scrupulous observer of facts, appeared to be perfectly satisfactory, and
                    was acquiesced in by naturalists in general. But it has since been completely
                    prove¢ by the researches of Duchet, of Hunter, and of Huber, but principally by
                    the latter, that wax is a secretion from the abdomen of the bee; and that it
                    depends not at a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196088"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-6088-0521"/>on the pollen which the insect may consume, but on
                    the quantity of honey or other saccharine substance which it receives into the
                    stomach. The first step in this discovery was made by one of the members of the
                    Lausatian Society, whose name has not been preserved. It was mentioned in a
                    letter of Mr Wilhelmi to Bonnet, in August 1768, in which he says that wax,
                    instead of being rejected by the mouth, exudes from the rings which inclose the
                    posterior part of the body. Of this we may satisfy ourselves by drawing out the
                    bee from the cell in which it is working with wax, by means of the point of a
                    fine needle; and we may perceive, in proportion as the body is elongated,· that
                    the wax will make its appearance under the rings, in the form of small scales.
                    Mr Duchet, in his <hi rend="italic">Culture des Abeilles,</hi> gives a full
                    statement of the principal circumstances attending the production of wax, which
                    he very justly ascribes to tĥe conversion of honey into this substance in the
                    body of the bee. These facts appear to have been entirely overlooked till the
                    subject was again brought forward by Mr John Hunter, in his paper in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions for</hi> 1792. Wildman, however, had
                    cursorily remarked that portions of wax, in the form of scales, and which he
                    conceived must have been moulded on the body of the bee, are sometimes found at
                    the bottom of the hive. Mr Huber was engaged in prosecuting his inquiries on
                    this subject at the same period wΓth Mr Hunter, and discovered, in 1793, the
                    existence of regular receptacles or pouches, from the coats of which the wax is
                    secreted, and within which it accumulates till its edges raise the scales, and
                    become apparent externally. These plates of wax are withdrawn by the bee itself,
                    or some of its fellow-labourers, and are applied in a manner hereafter to be
                    described.</p>
                <p>Huber has shown, by a series of well-conducted experiments, that, in a natural
                    state, the quantity of wax secreted is in proportion to the consumption of
                    honey; but that an equal or even greater quantity will be formed if the bee be
                    fed on a solution of sugar in water. Warmth and rest promote this process of
                    secretion; for the bees, after feeding plentifully on saccharine food, hang
                    together in a cluster without moving, for several hours, at the end of which
                    time large plates of wax are found under the abdominal rings. This happened when
                    bees were confined and restricted from any other sort of nourishment; whilst
                    those that were fed on pollen and fruits alone did not produce any wax. It
                    appears also from his researches that the formation of wax is the office of a
                    particular set of bees, which may be distinguished from the rest, and
                    particularly from those that nurse the young larvae, by the greater size and
                    more cylindrical shape of their abdomen. Dissection also shows that their
                    stomachs are more capacious. In the second volume of Huber’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nouvelles Observations sur les Abeilles,</hi> he describes minutely the anatomy
                    of the pouches or receptacles for the wax, which are parts peculiar to the
                    working bees, being totally absent in the males and queens. It is a structure
                    that had escaped the keen eyes of Swammerdam, and has not been noticed by any
                    subsequent anatomist The cavities are lined with a membrane, which presents a
                    number of folds, forming an hexagonal net-work, not unlike the appearance in the
                    second stomach of ruminant quadrupeds, and evidently destined to perform the
                    office of secretion.</p>
                <p>Among the secretions peculiar to the bee, the poison which is poured into the
                    wounds made by the sting deserves to be noticed. It is said to owe its
                    mischievous efficacy to certain pungent salts. If a bee is provoked to strike
                    its sting against a plate of glass, a drop of poison will be discharged; and if
                    this is placed under a microscope, the salts may be seen to concrete, as the
                    liquor dries into clear, oblong, pointed crystals. The sting consists of bearded
                    darts, which are protruded from the end of a sheath; and the venomous juice is
                    likewise injected through the sheath, from a little bag at the root of the
                    sting.</p>
                <p>As no organs for the circulation of blood have been as yet demonstrated in
                    insects, respiration is supposed to be effected by means totally different from
                    those which are adopted in the higher classes of the animal kingdom. As the
                    blood, or fluid corresponding to the blood, cannot be presented to the air in
                    any separate organ, the air must be conducted to the blood, wherever such a
                    fluid is met with. For this purpose, tracheae or air-tubes, having several
                    external openings or spiracles, are made to ramify like arteries, and are
                    distributed in an infinite number of branches to every part of the body. The
                    analogy of other insects might perhaps be admitted as sufficient evidence that
                    bees respire atmospheric air, the constant renewal of which is essentially
                    necessary to the continuance of the vital functions. It is, however, not always
                    safe to trust to analogical reasoning in subjects of natural history; and direct
                    evidence is, in all cases, to be preferred when it can be obtained. We must
                    therefore consider as valuable the complete series of experiments on the
                    respiration of bees, that have been lately given to the world by Huber, to whom
                    we already owe so large a portion of the information we possess with regard to
                    these insects. We might indeed have anticipated, with the strongest probability,
                    many of the results to which these experiments have led; but there are others
                    which are quite unexpected, and possess as much of interest as of novelty.</p>
                <p>The condition of a hive of bees, in which many thousand individuals, full of
                    animation and activity, are crowded together in the very small space of one or
                    two cubic feet, having no communication with the external air but by means of a
                    small aperture in the lowest part, which entrance is frequently obstructed by a
                    throng of bees that are passing in and out during sultry weather, is of all
                    possible conditions the one least favourable to the renewal of heated air. The
                    most crowded theatres or hospitals are not to be compared with it in point of
                    closeness. Direct experiment, indeed, shows that the combustion of a taper could
                    not be carried on in so limited a space; for Mr Huber found that, in a glass
                    ball of the same dimensions as the hive, and with a similar aperture, the taper
                    went out in a few minutes. So great was the difficulty of explaining the
                    respiration of bees under these circumstances. that Mr Huber was led to examine
                    into the truth of the opinion, that respiration was equally necessary to bees as
                    to other insects. The results were unequivocal. They perish speedily in the
                    vacuum of the air-pump. They are easily drowned by placing them so that the
                    spiracles on the corslet are under water; but revive readily when they are
                    dried. The action of the spiracles is, in this experiment, rendered manifest by
                    the escape of bubbles of air from each of their orifices. When a number of bees
                    are confined in a bottle accurately closed, they exhibit unequivocal symptoms of
                    distress, and fall into complete asphyxia. These changes occur more rapidly when
                    they are placed in any gas which contains no admixture of oxygen, such as
                    carbonic acid, hydrogenous and azotic gases. When they are rendered torpid by
                    cold, and respiration is thereby suspended, these effects do not take place. All
                    these effects are more considerable in adult bees than in the larvae, though
                    they are also distinctly exhibited in the latter. Suffocation is retarded if the
                    proportion of oxygen be greater than in atmospheric air, and it may be averted
                    altogether by a continual renewal of oxygen. It was ascertained by the
                    eudiometer that the same changes were produced on the air as in the respiration
                    of other animals; namely, the subtraction of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196101"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-6101-0522"/>oxygen and the addition of an equal volume of
                    carbonic acid gas.</p>
                <p>Yet, on examining the air of the hive itself, it was found scarcely to differ in
                    purity from atmospheric air. It was at one time conjectured that some of the
                    contents of the hive, such as the pollen, the honey, or the wax, might have some
                    power of evolving oxygen, so as to afford the requisite supply of this gas.
                    Experiments, however, proved that they had no such power. Amidst so great an
                    uncertainty, it was thought worth while to ascertain whether bees might not
                    exert some unknown process by which oxygen was generated in the hive itself. If
                    this were true, they could support life although all communication with the
                    external air were intercepted. A hive was selected having glass sides, so as to
                    allow of the observer’s seeing what was passing in the interior, and the
                    entrance was completely closed. In a quarter of an hour the bees became sensible
                    of their situation, and showed great uneasiness; all business was suspended; an
                    extraordinary agitation, accompanied by a remarkable noise, prevailed in every
                    quarter. All the bees were seen beating their wings with the same rapidity as in
                    flying. They were thus incessantly occupied during ten minutes. Their motions
                    became then more languid, and, after being utterly exhausted, they fell in
                    succession to the bottom of the hive, till every one of them was in a state of
                    complete asphyxia. It is remarkable that, at this period, the temperature of the
                    hive, which had been previously at 95° of Fahrenheit, suddenly cooled down to
                    that of the external air. On opening the door and the top of the hive, and
                    establishing a current of air through it, the bees were soon restored to
                    animation.</p>
                <p>It was proved by this experiment that the air is renewed through the small
                    opening which serves as a door to &gt; the hive. By suspending light substances
                    near the entrance, the existence of different currents of air was rendered
                    manifest. After much reflection, it occurred that the violent agitation of the
                    wings might have some influence in procuring this renewal of air. This
                    conjecture was confirmed by an experiment with a glass bell, to the aperture of
                    which an apparatus was fitted, consisting of a small ventilator, which could be
                    moved rapidly round by machinery. When the ventilator was set in motion, the air
                    within could support the combustion of a candle for an unlimited time.
                    Observation further showed that some bees are actually always employed in the
                    office of ventilating the hive; they vibrate their wings with great vigour and
                    constancy, producing so rapid a movement of them, that they cannot be seen
                    except in the two extremities of the arc of vibration, which is at least one of
                    90°. While thus imitating the actions of flying, they fasten themselves with
                    their feet to the floor of the hive, so that the whole effect of that impulse
                    which, were they at liberty, would carry them forwards with considerable
                    velocity, is exerted on the air, which is therefore driven backwards in a
                    powerful current. Some bees occasionally perform these ventilating motions on
                    the outside of the hive, near the entrance; but a still greater number are
                    employed in this office within doors: sometimes twenty are thus occupied at
                    once, and each bee continues its motions for a certain time, occasionally for
                    nearly half an hour, and is then relieved by another, who takes its place. This
                    is the occasion of that humming sound which is constantly heard from the
                    interior of the hive when the bees are not in a state of torpidity. But it is
                    often heard with even more than usual loudness in the depth of winter. The
                    warmth of the sun s rays, however, always occasions an increased activity among
                    the ventilating bees. The immediate cause of these actions is probably some
                    impression made on their organs by the presence of vitiated air; for a bee may
                    be made to ventilate itself by placing near it substances which have to them an
                    unpleasant odour, such as spirit of wine or oil of turpentine.</p>
                <p>The connection between an active respiration and a <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>
                    high temperature is remarkably exemplified in bees, amon«·' which, in
                    consequence of their collecting together in lar <hi rend="subscript"> g</hi> υ
                    numbers, the heat is not so easily dissipated, and admits also of being easily
                    ascertained by the thermometer. Mr Hunter found it to vary from 73° to 84° of
                    Fahrenheit; and Mr Huber observed it on some occasions to rise suddenly from
                    about 92° to above 104°.</p>
                <p>Bees are well fitted, by their structure, for rapid flight throu gh the air. They
                    possess great muscular strength in proportion to their size, and their
                    indefatigable activity in the different labours of the hive is truly
                    astonishing. Aristotle and Pliny have pretended that, during hi⅛ winds, they
                    endeavour to steady their flight by holding a small stone with their feet, by
                    way of ballast. This assertion has been shown, both by Swammerdam and Reaumur,
                    to be erroneous in as far as it applied to the common bee; but there are other
                    species which build nests with stones and other hard materials, and which, while
                    transporting them for this purpose, were probably mistaken for the
                    honey-bee.</p>
                <p>The physiology of the external senses must necessarily be very imperfectly
                    understood in a class of animals of a nature so remote from our own species. The
                    infinite diversity of characters presented to us by the different tribes of
                    insects, as well as of other animals, naturally suggests the idea that external
                    objects produce on their sentient organs impressions widely different from what
                    they communicate to ourselves. The notions we form of their senses must not only
                    be liable to great inaccuracy, but must often be totally inadequate
                    representations of the truth. A finer organization, and more subtile
                    perceptions, would alone suffice to extend the sphere of their ordinary senses
                    to an inconceivable degree, as the telescope and the microscope have with us
                    extended the powers of vision. But they possess, in all probability, other
                    organs, appropriated to unknown kinds of impressions, and which must open to
                    them avenues to knowledge of various kinds, to which we must ever remain total
                    strangers. Art has with us supplied many elaborate modes of bringing within our
                    cognizance some of the properties of matter which nature has not immediately
                    furnished us with the means of detecting. But who will compare our thermometers,
                    electroscopes, or hygrometers, however elaborately constructed, with those
                    refined instruments with which the lower classes, and particularly insects,
                    appear to be so liberally provided? The antennae, which are so universally met
                    with in this class of animals√ are doubtless organs of the greatest importance
                    in conveying impressions from without. Their continual motion, the constant use
                    which is made of them in examining objects, the total derangement in the
                    instincts of those insects which have been deprived of them, point them out as
                    exquisite organs of more than one sense. To impressions of touch, arising from
                    the immediate contact of bodies, they are highly sensible; but their motions
                    evidently show that they are affected by objects at some distance. They are no
                    doubt alive to all the tremulous motions of the surrounding air, and probably
                    communicate perceptions of some of its other qualities. Composed of a great
                    number of articulations, they are exceedingly flexible in every direction, and
                    can readily embrace the outline of any body that the bee wishes to examine,
                    however small its diameter, and are capable of following all its movements. It
                    is by means of these instruments that the bee is enabled to execute so many
                    works in the interior of the hive, from which the light must be totally exclud
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196114" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6114-0523"/>ed. Aided by
                    these, it builds its combs, pours honey into its magazines, feeds the larvae,
                    and ministers to every want, which it discovers and judges of solely by this
                    species of touch.</p>
                <p>The antennae appear also to be the principal means employed for mutual
                    communication of impressions. The different modes of contact constitute a sort
                    of language, which appears to be susceptible of a great variety of
                    modifications, and to be capable of supplying at once every species of
                    information for which they have occasion. It is in this way alone that they
                    satisfy themselves of the presence of their queen, or communicate to others the
                    alarming intelligence that she has disappeared.</p>
                <p>The sense residing in the antennae appears to be, on many occasions,
                    supplementary to that of vision, which in bees, as in other insects, is less
                    perfect than in the larger animals. During the night, therefore, they are
                    chiefly guided in their movements by the former of these senses. This will
                    sufficiently appear from observing by moon-light the mode in which the bees
                    guard the entrance of the hive against the intrusion of moths which flutter in
                    the neighbourhood. They act as vigilant sentinels, performing continual rounds
                    near this important post, extending their antennae to the utmost, and moving
                    them alternately to the right and to the left. Woe to the unfortunate moth that
                    comes within their reach. Aware of its danger, and of the defective sight of the
                    bees, the moths adroitly avoid the slightest contact, and endeavour to insinuate
                    themselves between the bees, so as to get unperceived into the hive, where they
                    riot upon the honey which they find.</p>
                <p>If bees require full day-light for the exercise of vision, it must at the same
                    time be acknowledged, that, when they are so assisted, they appear to enjoy this
                    sense in great perfection. A bee will recognise its habitation from great
                    distances, and distinguish it at once from many others in a numerous apiary. It
                    passes through the air in a straight line towards its object with extreme
                    rapidity. On quitting the hive, it flies towards the field which is most in
                    flower; and as soon as it has determined on its course, it takes as direct a
                    line as a ball issuing from a musket. When it has collected sufficient
                    provision, it rises in the air to discover its hive, and then darts forward with
                    the velocity of an arrow, and with unerring precision in its aim.</p>
                <p>Their perceptions of heat and cold, which are generally referred to the sense of
                    touch, appear to be extremely delicate. In several experiments of Huber’s, the
                    influence of the rays of the sun excited them to a vigorous action of the wings.
                    It is well known that great cold reduces them to a state of torpor, and inferior
                    degrees of cold are evidently unpleasant to them. They show by their conduct
                    that they are sensible of alterations in the state of the weather for some time
                    before we can perceive them. Sometimes, when working with great assiduity, they
                    will suddenly desist from their labours; none will stir out of the hive, while
                    all the working-bees that are abroad hurry home in crowds, and press forward so
                    as to obstruct the entrance of the hive. Often when they are thus warned of the
                    approach of bad weather, we can distinguish no alteration in the state of the
                    atmosphere. Gathering clouds sometimes produce this effect on them; but perhaps
                    they possess some species of hygrometrical sense, unconnected With any
                    impression of vision. It is alleged that no bee is ever caught in a sudden
                    shower, unless from some cause H has wandered very far from the hive, or been
                    disabled by some accident from returning to it. There is reason for thinking,
                    however, that much exaggeration has prevailed in the statements of authors as to
                    the extent of this kind . foresight. Huber supposes that it is the rapid
                    diminution of light that alarms them; for if the sky be uniformly overcast, they
                    proceed on their excursions, and even the first drops of a soft shower do not
                    make them return with any great precipitation.</p>
                <p>Their taste is perhaps the most imperfect of their senses. ' They exert hardly
                    any discrimination in the collection of honey from different flowers. They are
                    not repelled by the scent or flavour of such as are extremely offensive to our
                    organs, and scruple not to derive supplies from such as are highly poisonous. In
                    some districts in America, it is well known that the honey acquires in this way
                    very deleterious properties. The qualities of honey arc, indeed, observed to
                    vary much, according to the particular situation from which it is obtained. The
                    most stagnant and putrid waters, as we have already noticed, are resorted to by
                    bees with the same avidity as the purest. In their selection of flowers they are
                    guided by the quantity of honey they expect to meet with, and in no respect by
                    its quality. When the scythe has cut down all the flowers which before yielded
                    them a plentiful supply, they discontinue their excursions, although the weather
                    be in all respects propitious. Their smell must, therefore, be sufficiently
                    acute to enable them· to discover the presence of honey at great distances.
                    Direct experiment has, indeed, proved this to be the case. Mr Huber found that
                    they proceeded immediately towards boxes which contained honey concealed from
                    their view; and such in fact is the situation of the fluid of the nectarea in
                    flowers. Some odours, especially the fumes of tobacco, and indeed all kinds of
                    smoke, are highly obnoxious to them; this is the case, also, with the smell of
                    oil of turpentine, alcohol, ammonia, the nitric and muriatic acids, and several
                    other volatile chemical agents, upon receiving the impressions of which, they
                    immediately set about ventilating themselves in the manner above described. But
                    nothing excites their displeasure in a greater degree than the breath of the
                    spectator; as soon as they feel which, they show signs of anger, and prepare to
                    revenge it as an insult. The odour of the poison of their sting produces similar
                    effects, exciting them to immediate rage and hostility.</p>
                <p>Although it is sufficiently clear that many insects possess the power of smell,
                    yet the particular organ of this sense has never been accurately ascertained;
                    and the opinions of naturalists have been much divided on the subject. These
                    opinions have been supported more by arguments drawn from the analogy of what
                    happens in other classes of animals, than by any direct experiments on insects
                    themselves. We know that, in all animals respiring by means of lungs, the organs
                    of smell are placed at the entrance of the passages of the air; and it has often
                    been concluded, that in like manner the stigmata, or the orifices of the
                    air-tubes, were the seat of this sense in insects. By others the antennae have
                    been assigned as the organs through which these impressions were conveyed to the
                    sensorium. The experiments of Huber have proved that neither of these opinions
                    is correct; and have satisfactorily shown that in the bee this sense resides in
                    the mouth itself, or in its immediate vicinity. Here, indeed, would be its
                    proper station, if this faculty be intended, as we may reasonably suppose it to
                    be, to apprize the individual of the qualities of the food prior to its being
                    eaten. When the mouth of the bee was plugged up with paste, which was allowed to
                    dry before the insect was set at liberty, it remained quite insensible to the
                    same odours to which it had before manifested the strongest repugnance.</p>
                <p>It is generally supposed that bees possess the sense of hearing. The common
                    practice of making a loud noise by drums and kettles in order to attract a swarm
                    is founded on this supposition. But the evidence is by no means conclusive; for
                    we find that they are nowise disturbed by a loud clap of thunder, or by the
                    report of a gun, or any <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196127"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-6127-0524"/>other noises that may happen to arise around them.
                    It is, however, certain that they are capable of emitting a variety of sounds,
                    which appear expressive of anger, fear, satisfaction, and other passions; and it
                    would seem that they were even capable of communicating certain emotions to one
                    another in this manner. Huber observed that the queens, during their captivity,
                    sent forth a peculiar sound, which he supposes to be a note of lamentation. A
                    certain cry or humming noise from the queen will strike with sudden
                    consternation all the bees in the hive; and they remain for a considerable time
                    motionless and stupified. Hunter has noticed a number of modulations of sound
                    emitted by bees under different circumstances, and has instituted an inquiry
                    concerning the means employed by them in producing these sounds; for an account
                    of which we shall refer the reader to his paper in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions.</hi></p>
                <p>If the function of sensation in insects be involved in doubt and obscurity, the
                    knowledge of those more interior faculties which are the springs of voluntary
                    action is hid in still deeper mystery. Buffon refuses to allow bees any portion
                    of intelligence, and contends that the actions we behold, however admirably they
                    are directed to certain ends, are in fact merely the results of their peculiar
                    mechanism. Other philosophers, such as Reaumur, have gone into the opposite
                    extreme, and have considered them as endued with extraordinary wisdom and
                    foresight, as animated by a disinterested patriotism, and as uniting a variety
                    of moral and intellectual qualities of a higher order. The truth, no doubt, lies
                    between these overstrained opinions; but it is nevertheless extremely difficult
                    to decide in what degree these respective principles operate in the production
                    of the effects we witness. We have been too long in the habit of sheltering our
                    ignorance of the causes of this class of phenomena, by referring them
                    indiscriminately to what is called <hi rend="italic">instinct,</hi> to submit to
                    a cautious and patient investigation of the hidden springs of action. The term
                    <hi rend="italic">instinct</hi> should properly be regarded, not as denoting a
                    particular and definite principle of action, whose operation we can anticipate
                    in any new or untried combination of circumstances, but as expressive of our
                    inability to refer the phenomena we contemplate to any previously known
                    principle. Thus the actions which an animal performs in obedience to the calls
                    of appetite are not properly said to be instinctive; nor can the term be applied
                    to actions which are the consequence of acquired knowledge, and of which the
                    object is with certainty foreseen by the agent. But when an animal acts
                    apparently under a blind impulse, and produces effects useful to itself or to
                    the species, which effects it could not have previously contemplated as
                    resulting from those actions, it is then customary to say that it is under the
                    guidance of instinct, that is, of some unknown principle of action. It will be
                    proper, therefore, to keep this distinction in view in judging of the voluntary
                    actions of the lower animals.</p>
                <p>In no department of natural history is it more necessary to be aware of the
                    proper import of the term instinct, than in studying the phenomena presented by
                    the bee; for nowhere is it more difficult to discriminate between the regular
                    operation of implanted motives, and the result of acquired knowledge and habits.
                    The most striking feature of their history, and the one which apparently lays
                    the foundation for those extraordinary qualities which raise them above the
                    level of other insects, is the disposition to social union. It may in general,
                    indeed, be remarked, that animals which associate together so as to form large
                    communities, display a higher degree of sagacity than those which lead a
                    solitary life. This is especially observable among insects. The spider and <hi
                    rend="italic">Formica leonis</hi> may exhibit particular talents, or practise
                    particular stratagems in the pursuit and capture or their prey; buttheir history
                    is limited to a single generation, and embraces none of those interesting
                    relations which obtain between individuals composing the gregarious tribes, such
                    as the ant, the wasp, and the bee. Among these we trace a community of wants and
                    desires, and a mutual intelligence and sympathy, which lead to the constant
                    interchange of good offices, and which, by introducing a systematic division of
                    labour, amidst a unity of design, leads to the execution of public works on a
                    scale of astonishing magnitude. The attachment of bees to their hive, which they
                    defend with a courage and self-devotion truly admirable; their jealousy of
                    intruders; their ready co-operation in all the labours required for the welfare
                    of the community; their tender care of their young; the affection and homage
                    which they bestow on their queen, and which they manifest on all occasions in
                    the most unequivocal manner; imply qualities such as we could hardly persuade
                    ourselves could animate a mere insect, on which we are in the habit of proudly
                    looking down as placed in one of the lowest orders of created beings.</p>
                <p>We shall content ourselves at present with these general observations, as the
                    instances which serve to illustrate their moral and intellectual character
                    belong properly to the history of the different processes they follow in the
                    construction of their combs, the hatching and rearing of their progeny, and the
                    mode of conducting their migrations. To these subjects, therefore, we shall now
                    proceed: and in order to present the most connected and complete account of
                    their economy, we shall begin the history from the period when a new swarm has
                    just occupied a hive, and when all the arrangements for their habitation, and
                    the construction of the cells in which their eggs and provisions are to be
                    deposited, are yet to be effected.</p>
                <p>The first care of the labouring bees, on their settlement in their new abode, is
                    to clean it out thoroughly. While one set of bees is thus employed, another is
                    distributed about the country, in order to procure the proper materials for
                    blocking up the small holes and chinks of the hive, and for laying a firm
                    foundation for the edifice which is to be constructed within it. The substance
                    which is principally employed in this preliminary stage is <hi rend="italic"
                    >ρrοροlis,</hi> a species of glutinous resin of an agreeable aromatic odour,;
                    and reddish brown colour, in process of time becoming darker, and acquiring a
                    firmer consistence. According to the analysis of Vauquelin <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Mem. Soc. Agricult. Departern. Seine),</hi> it is composed chiefly of resin,
                    with a small proportion of wax, and of acid and aromatic principles. It is
                    soluble in alcohol, ether, and oils, both fixed and volatile; and tinges the
                    solvent of a beautiful red colour. Cadet has since ascertained in it the
                    presence of benzoic and gallic acids. Reaumur had not been able to discover from
                    what plants the bees collect this substance. Riem asserts that it is chiefly
                    from pines and other trees of the fir kind. The recent observations of Huber
                    have assisted in the solution of this question. On placing branches of the wild
                    poplar tree before the hive, he found that the bees eagerly seized upon the
                    varnish which exudes from the buds; and examining the chemical properties of
                    this varnish, he identified it with the propolis with which the inside of the
                    hive is lined.</p>
                <p>The propolis adheres so strongly to the legs and feetot. the bee which has
                    collected it, that it cannot be detached’ without the assistance of its
                    fellow-labourers, hor this purpose the bee that is loaded presents its legs to
                    the workers in the hive, which carry off with their jaws this adhesive
                    substance, and immediately apply it, while yet ductile, all round the interior
                    of the hive, and particularly over all the projecting parts; hence its name, of
                    Greek <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196140" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6140-0525"
                    />derivation, signifying <hi rend="italic">before the city.</hi> In like manner
                    all the foreign bodies that are introduced into the common habitation, and are
                    too heavy to be removed, are covered over with this resinous substance. If a
                    snail, for instance, should happen to introduce itself into the hive, after
                    dispatching it with their stings, they encrust it over with propolis. Mr Knight
                    has observed that, besides propolis, bees will occasionally carry home, and
                    employ as cement, other substances, having the same glutinous properties. He
                    frequently covered the decorticated parts of trees, on which he was making
                    experiments, with a cement composed of bees’ wax and turpentine; and in the
                    autumn has observed a great number of bees occupied in carrying off this
                    substance. They detached it from the tree with their forceps, and the little
                    portion thus obtained was then transferred by the first to the second leg, by
                    which it was deposited on the thigh of the third, precisely in the same manner
                    as the pollen of flowers is collected and transferred. Whilst the bees were
                    employed in the collection of tin’s substance, Mr Knight had many opportunities
                    of observing their peaceful and patient disposition as individuals, which Mr
                    Hunter had also in some measure noticed. When one bee had collected its load,
                    and was just prepared to take flight, another often came behind it and despoiled
                    it of all it had collected. A second, and even a third load was collected, and
                    lost in the same manner; and still the patient insect pursued its labour,
                    without betraying any symptoms of impatience or resentment. When, however, the
                    hive is approached, the bee appears to be the most irritable of all animals, and
                    is animated with the most vindictive spirit against a public enemy, without
                    displaying any peculiar hostility in the revenge of a private injury.</p>
                <p>The next object of their labours is to prepare the combs, which are to be the
                    receptacles for the eggs with which the queen is pregnant, and which are now
                    about to be laid. The material employed for this purpose is not propolis, but
                    wax, the production of which, by secretion from a particular set of bees who
                    feed largely upon honey, was formerly explained. The bees are for this purpose
                    actively employed in collecting honey, and in imparting it to their companions
                    in the hive, who, when they have filled their crops with it, hang together in a
                    thick cluster from the top of the hive, and thus remain in a state of inactivity
                    for a considerable period. During this time the secretion of wax is proceeding,
                    and may be seen collected in laminae under the abdominal scales, whence it is
                    removed by the hind-legs of the bee, and transferred to the fore-legs, and from
                    thence taken up by the jaws. In this operation they are often assisted by their
                    companions, who even directly seize upon the wax from under the abdomen of those
                    who are before them. When a sufficient quantity of materials has thus been
                    collected together, the process of building is commenced. But, in order to
                    understand the subsequent operations, it is necessary to have a correct idea of
                    the form of the cells which compose the combs. We shall, therefore, proceed to
                    give some account of the structure when they have attained their perfect
                    state.</p>
                <p>The combs of a bee-hive are formed into parallel and vertical strata, each of
                    which is about an inch in thickness, the distances between the surfaces of each
                    being about half an inch, an interval which serves for the passage of the bees
                    over both surfaces. They generally extend the whole breadth of the hive, and
                    often descend the whole length, from the top to the bottom. They consist
                    altogether of thin partitions, which inclose hexagonal cells about half an inch
                    in depth and a quarter of an inch in ιameter, opening on both surfaces of the
                    comb, and closed by a partition common to those on both sides, and which
                    occupies the middle distance between the two surfaces. This partition is not,
                    however, a plane, but is composed of a collection of rhombs. Three, and
                    sometimes four of these rhombs, inclined to one another at a certain angle, form
                    the bottoms of each cell, which thus has the shape of a flattened pyramid, of
                    which the basis is towards the mouth of the cell. The geometric form of each
                    individual cell is, therefore, an hexagonal prism, terminated by a trihedral
                    pyramid, the three sides of which pyramid are rhombs, which meet at the apex by
                    their obtuse angles, and, forming oblique angles with the sides of the prism,
                    truncate a portion of these, and convert them from rectangles, which they would
                    be in a regular prism, into trapeziums. Of the two angles of these trapeziums
                    adjoining to the base of the pyramid, one must be acute and the other obtuse,
                    the acute angle of one trapezium being next to the acute angle of the adjoining
                    trapezium, and the obtuse angle being in like manner next to another obtuse
                    angle of the preceding trapezium, so that, in going round the base, we meet with
                    pairs of acute and of obtuse angles alternately succeeding each other. The two
                    adjoining acute angles of the trapezia are adjoining to two of the terminal
                    rhombs, which here present their acute angles; so that at these points a solid
                    angle of four planes is formed, all the angles being acute. Each pair of obtuse
                    angles of the trapezia, on the other hand, are adjacent to the obtuse angle of
                    one of the rhombs only, thus composing a solid angle of three planes, of which
                    the angles are all obtuse; and these two kinds of solid angles succeed one
                    another alternately all round the base of the pyramid, there being three of each
                    kind, and six in all. The axis of each cell coincides, not with the axis of the
                    cell on the opposite surface, but with one of its angles, so that each of the
                    three obtuse angles at the base of the terminal pyramid corresponds to the
                    central parts of three of the cells on the opposite side; and each of the sides
                    of the pyramid, which closes a cell on one side, contributes in part to the
                    closing of three of the cells on the opposite side. We may easily satisfy
                    ourselves that this is the case, by piercing the centres of each of the three
                    planes which close the bottom of a cell, with a pin, when, on turning the comb,
                    the three pins will be found to have passed into three different cells on the
                    opposite side.</p>
                <p>A structure of this kind is obviously the one of all· others calculated to afford
                    the greatest space for each cell, with the same expense of materials. It is easy
                    to perceive, in the first place, that, in a plane surface, When a number of
                    small spaces are to be divided by partitions, the hexagonal form is the one
                    which comprehends the largest space compatible with the extent of the lines
                    which inclose them. For the equilateral triangle, the square, and the regular
                    hexagon, are the only regular forms that admit of being joined together in the
                    same plane, without leaving interstices; and the proportion of the area to the
                    periphery in every polygon increases as the figure consists of a greater number
                    of sides, and is therefore greater in the hexagon than in any of the other two.
                    The truth of this proposition was perceived by Pappus, and even its application
                    to the subject of the honeycomb was made by that ancient geometrician. But the
                    determination of the form and inclination that should be given to the partitions
                    which close the bottoms of the cells, and which may of course belong equally to
                    those on both sides of the comb, is a problem much more complicated and
                    difficult of solution. It has exercised the skill of several modern
                    mathematicians of great eminence, and has generally been resolved by the
                    assistance of the infinitesimal calculus, or the methods of maxima and minima. A
                    mistake has sometimes been committed irr supposing that the capacity of the
                    cells would be affected by varying <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196153"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-6153-0526"/>the inclination of the partitions, whereas, if
                    abstraction be made of the thickness of these partitions, all the space which is
                    gained on the one side must be obtained at the expense of the space on the
                    other, and the sum total will therefore remain the same. This error has been
                    pointed out by Le Sage of Geneva, and also by others. The whole question,
                    therefore, resolves itself into that of the form producing the greatest saving
                    of materials. Koenig, the pupil of the celebrated Bernoulli, calculated that the
                    angles of the rhombs, which should answer this condition, must be 109° 26' and
                    70° 34'. Cramer, professor of mathematics in the university of Geneva, has given
                    a very elegant demonstration of this problem, from which it results that the
                    obtuse angle of the rhomb must be such, that its half has for its tangent the
                    square root of 2. This is the case with the angle 54° 44' 8"; the two angles of
                    the rhomb are therefore 109° 28' 16" and 70° 31' 44". It follows also that the
                    two diagonals of this rhomb are to one another in the same proportion as the
                    side and diagonal of a square, that is, as 1 to 1∙41421356237, &amp;c. It is
                    also another consequence from the same data, that the angles of the trapezia
                    forming the sides of the hexagonal prism adjacent to the rhombs are precisely
                    equal to those of the rhombs themselves, and that the solid angle formed at the
                    apex of the pyramid, and which is composed of those equal obtuse angles, is
                    precisely equal to each of the three angles at the base, which are also formed
                    of three obtuse angles. It is also true that these are the only angles which
                    will give this perfect equality. Maraldi had already made the same remark; and,
                    assuming the principle of the equality of the angles as the basis of his
                    reasoning, had calculated them on this hypothesis, making them 109° 28' and 70°
                    32', which is nearly accurate. To the same author we are indebted for the
                    comparison of the results of theory with fact, by the admeasurement of the
                    actual angles of the honeycomb; these he states to be about 110° and 70°, which
                    is as near an agreement with theory as could well be expected.</p>
                <p>Boscovich, who has also given a solution of the same problem, conceives that the
                    equality of inclination of the planes gives greater facility to the construction
                    of the comb, and might, therefore, be a motive of preference, independently of
                    the greater economy of wax. Maclaurin has exercised his abilities in resolving
                    this problem, and has demonstrated by simple geometry, that the most
                    advantageous form is that which results from the supposed equality of the three
                    plane angles forming the solid angles at the base. He estimates the saving of
                    wax by partitions so constructed, above what would be required for a flat
                    partition, at one fourth of the wax which would be wanted to complete the
                    truncated sides of the cells, so as to form them into rectangles. L'Huillier, in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Berlin Academy</hi>, has given a
                    demonstration which is remarkable for its simplicity, and for its involving none
                    but elementary propositions; he values the economy of wax at ⅟₃₁st of the whole
                    wax employed. Le Sage, as appears from the life of that philosopher by Professor
                    Prevost, has shown that this celebrated problem reduces itself to the finding of
                    the angle at which two planes with a given inclination (such as 120°) can be cut
                    by a third plane, so as to make all the angles resulting from the section equal
                    to one another.</p>
                <p>But a more essential advantage than even the economy of wax results from this
                    structure, namely, that the whole fabric has much greater strength than if it
                    were composed of planes at right angles to one another; and when we consider the
                    weight they have to support when stored with honey, pollen, and the young brood,
                    besides that of the bees themselves, it is evident that strength is a material
                    requisite in the work.</p>
                <p>It has often been a subject of wonder how such diminutive insects could have
                    adopted and adhered to so regular a plan of architecture, and what principles
                    can actuate so great a multitude to co-operate by the most effectual and
                    systematic mode in its completion. Buffon has endeavoured to explain the
                    hexagonal form by the uniformi pressure of a great number of bees all working at
                    the same time, exerted equally in all directions in a limited space;' and
                    illustrates his theory by supposing a number of similar' cylinders compressed
                    together, and taking the form of hexagonal prisms by the uniform expansion of
                    each. The analogy of the forms produced by the law of crystallization,—of the
                    figures assumed by various parts in the animal and vegetable world, such as the
                    skin of the bat, and the inner coat of the second stomach of. ruminant
                    quadrupeds,—is also adduced by this captivating but superficial writer in
                    support of his argument. But however plausible this theory may at first sight
                    appear, it will not stand the test of a more serious examination. The
                    explanation he has attempted applies no further than to the inclination of the
                    sides of the cells; but he did not take into account, perhaps from not having
                    studied the subject mathematically, the inclinations and forms of the planes
                    which close each cell, and so curiously conspire on both sides to serve a
                    similar office, while they at the same time accurately fulfil a refined
                    geometrical condition. But it is sufficient confutation of the whole theory to
                    show, that it is directly at variance with the actual process employed by the
                    insects in the construction of their combs.</p>
                <p>It might be supposed that bees had been provided by nature with instruments for
                    building of a form somewhat analogous to the angles of the cells; but in no
                    part, either of the teeth, antennae, or feet, can any such correspondence be
                    traced. Their shape in no respect answers to that of the rhombs, which are
                    constructed by their means, any more than the chisel of the sculptor resembles
                    the statue which it has carved. The shape of the head is indeed triangular, but
                    its three angles are acute, and different from that of the planes of the cells.
                    The form of the plates of wax, as they are moulded in the pouches into which
                    this substance is secreted, is an irregular pentagon, in no respect affording a
                    model for any of the parts which compose the honeycomb. Hunter, observing that
                    the thickness of the partition was nearly equal to that of the scale of wax,
                    thought that the bees apply these scales immediately to the formation of the
                    partition, by merely cementing them together. Reaumur, notwithstanding the use
                    of glass hives, had not been able to discover the mystery of their process of
                    architecture; but inferred, from what he saw, that the wax was rejected from the
                    stomach in the form of a white frothy liquor. No naturalist, indeed, prior to
                    Huber, had been able to follow these insects in their labours, on account of the
                    crowding together in a thick mass while they are building; but the expedients
                    resorted to by that ingenious philosopher have unfolded the whole process, which
                    he has given with great detail in the second volume of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observations sur les Abeilles.</hi> Huber witnessed the whole of their actions,
                    and saw that each bee drew out, with its hind feet, one of the plates of wax
                    from under the scales where it was lodged, and, carrying it to the mouth in a
                    vertical position, turned it round, so that every part of its edge was made to
                    pass in succession under the cutting edge of the jaws; it was thus soon divided
                    into very small fragments, while at the same time a frothy liquor was poured
                    upon it from the tongue, so as to form it into a perfectly plastic mass. This
                    liquor gave the wax a whiteness and opacity which it did not possess originally,
                    and rendered it at the same time tenacious and ductile. A quantity of wax thus
                    prepared for use is accumulated, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196166"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-6166-0527"/>and applied to further the work in the manner we
                    are presently to describe.</p>
                <p>But, in considering the process by which the comb is formed, a circumstance
                    should be pointed out, which seems not to have been particularly noticed by any
                    author except Huber; and yet it is one of essential importance in studying their
                    process of architecture ;—namely, that the first row of cells on either side are
                    of a form very different from that of the subsequent rows. As they take their
                    origin from a plane surface, two of the sides necessary to complete the hexagon
                    are cut off by this plane, so that the general form of the orifice is
                    pentagonal; and the bottom of the cells on one side is composed of two equal
                    rhombs only, and on the other side of two trapezoidal planes, with one rhomb.
                    Such a modification of shape was necessary, in order to prepare the way for the
                    regularly-formed cells which were to follow.</p>
                <p>The foundations of the combs are laid by the bees raising a solid block or plate
                    of wax of a semicircular form. In this they scoop out a small vertical channel,
                    of the size of an ordinary cell. The sides of this channel are then strengthened
                    by additions of wax. On the opposite side two other channels are formed, one on
                    each side of the plane opposite to the former channel. The extremities of these
                    channels, which at first present a curved outline, are then fashioned into
                    straight walls, forming an angle at each vertex. The bottom of each cell being
                    thus sketched out, the design is completed by raising walls round the sides.
                    Different bees generally work on the opposite sides at the same time, and appear
                    to have some perception of the thickness of the partitions, and .of the
                    situation of the opposite walls, in which they are perhaps guided by slight
                    prominences, occasioned by the depressions which correspond to them on the other
                    side; and they scrape off the wax in those places where its thickness is
                    greatest; that is, where the bees on the other side had accumulated materials.
                    In this way, then, in constructing the successive rows, the axis of each cell
                    will be found to occupy the most retiring parts of the partition, and will be
                    opposite to the junction of three of the opposite cells.</p>
                <p>Soon after the bees have completed the foundations, and constructed a few of the
                    cells of the central comb, they begin two others, one on each side, at the
                    proper distance, and in this manner continue to form others in succession, in
                    proportion as the former are advanced. Their object at first seems to be to
                    extend the surface of the work, so as to admit of the greatest possible number
                    of workers being employed at one and the same time. In this way, then, the work
                    proceeds from all points at once, new cells being begun before the former are
                    completed, so that the whole comb, while it is in progress of construction, has
                    a semi-lenticular shape, broader at the top, and tapering below and towards the
                    sides. It extends downwards, however, more rapidly than in any other direction,
                    and its surfaces do not become parallel to each other till the last stage of the
                    building process. When this is completed, the whole is further strengthened by
                    an additional coating of propolis round the margin of all the cells; and the
                    junctions of every plane, both of the sides and bottoms of the cells, are also
                    soldered together by a lining of the same substance. The edges of the combs are
                    also secured in their situations by being glued to the side of the hive, and
                    supported by fresh abutments of propolis. Sometimes a mixture of wax and
                    propolis, manu-actured by the bees themselves, is employed as the cementing
                    material. The first coating of this compound substance is denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">Commosis</hi> by Pliny, and described as having a bitter taste;
                    the second, or the <hi rend="italic">Pissoceros</hi> of the same author, is
                    stated to be of a thinner consistence, and more adhesive than the former; while
                    the third substance or propolis is completely solid.</p>
                <p>The cells recently constructed are perfectly white, but in a short time they are
                    found of a yellow tint, which becomes gradually deeper, and, when very ancient,
                    gives them a dark brown cast. It is therefore easy to distinguish in a hive the
                    successive periods of formation of different portions of the combs. From the
                    researches of Huber, it appears that these variations of colour are not owing to
                    any changes in the wax itself, but to additional coatings of a peculiar varnish,
                    consisting of propolis and a colouring matter. The latter differs materially
                    from propolis, being wholly insoluble in alcohol. It loses its colour by the
                    action of nitric acid or the light of the sun. Its origin has not yet been
                    discovered; nor has the mode in which it is applied been clearly made out;
                    although Huber presumes, from his observations, that they spread it by means of
                    their mandibles, which he has seen them rub against the sides of the cells,
                    while they acquired a yellow colour from the operation.</p>
                <p>Such is the general outline of the architectural labours of the bee. A number of
                    modifications are however met with, adapting them to various purposes and to new
                    circumstances. The cells are required to be of different sizes for the reception
                    of different sorts of eggs and larvae. The smallest, which are also the most
                    numerous, are appropriated to the eggs of the working bees; a larger sort
                    receive those of the males; and a small number of very large cells are destined
                    for the education of the young queens, and are therefore called royal cells. The
                    first set are generally five and one third lines in depth, and two and a half in
                    diameter; the second are from seven to seven and a half lines in depth, and
                    three and three fourths in diameter; while the royal cells arc above one inch
                    deep, one third of an inch wide, and their walls are about one eighth of an inch
                    in thickness. Other cells, again, are set apart as magazines of honey or of
                    pollen; they are made twice as deep as the common cells, and their axes are
                    inclined to the horizon, so that their mouths are in the highest part, and their
                    liquid contents may be more easily retained. When these are filled, they arc
                    closed up by the bees with a wall of wax, and opened only when necessity
                    requires.</p>
                <p>The regularity of the cells is often disturbed in conse-1 quence of the admixture
                    of rows of larger cells with those I of smaller dimensions; but the pyramidal
                    partitions are adapted by successive gradations to these changes; so that in
                    many rows of what may be called cells of transition, the bottom presents four
                    planes instead of three, two being trapeziums, and the other two irregular
                    hexagons. These irregularities arc met with chiefly in the combs most distant
                    from the central one. When an abundant supply of honey induces them to lay up a
                    large quantity in store, they build up for this purpose the walls of common
                    cells, so as to give them a greater depth. The royal cells are often raised from
                    the ruins of a number of other cells, which are destroyed to make room for them;
                    they are usually built on the edge of some of the shorter combs, and often in
                    the very centre of the hive. Sometimes there are but three or four of them; at
                    other times eleven, or even fourteen, have been counted in the same hive. They
                    are formed of a mixture of propolis and wax; their form is oblong, resembling
                    that of a pear; their position is always vertical, so that when they arise from
                    amidst other cells, they are placed against the mouths of those cells, and
                    project beyond the common surface of the comb. They are perfectly smooth on the
                    inner surface; while their outer side is covered with a kind of hexagonal
                    fret-work, as if they were intended for the foundation of regular cells.</p>
                <p>As soon as a sufficient number of cells have been con<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193196179" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6179-0528"/>structed, the queen begins to
                    deposit her eggs. In those that have been impregnated the preceding year, the
                    oviducts begin to swell early in the spring, so that by the month of March they
                    are ready to come forth. The queen-bee is, therefore, the earliest breeder of
                    any insect we are acquainted with. But the young queens are capable of laying
                    eggs thirty-six hours after impregnation. It appears to be now well ascertained
                    by the experiments of Huber, that she is aware of the nature of the eggs she is
                    laying, and deposits each in the kind of cell adapted to receive it. She maybe
                    seen examining attentively the capacity of the cell before laying her egg. She
                    passes thus from one cell to another, allowing herself hardly any interval of
                    repose. She commonly lays two hundred eggs in a day; but if the weather be warm,
                    and vegetation luxuriant, she will lay a much greater number. The cold of autumn
                    suspends this process. The eggs first produced are those of labourers, and their
                    deposition continues for ten or twelve days, during which interval the working
                    bees are busily employed in constructing the larger cells. The queen next
                    acquires a considerable increase of size, so as to walk with difficulty. She
                    then lays male eggs in the large cells, during a period of from sixteen to
                    twenty-four days. They are less numerous than the former eggs, in the proportion
                    of one to thirty.</p>
                <p>These industrious insects now set about constructing royal cells; and the
                    queen-bee, having finished her deposition of male eggs, begins again to lay
                    those of the common bees; and finding royal cells open for their reception,
                    deposits a single egg in each, but only at intervals of one or two days; the
                    common cells receiving those laid in the mean time. When the hive is not
                    sufficiently numerous, or the season has been unproductive, no royal cells are
                    formed; and the education of a queen is not attempted.</p>
                <p>As soon as the eggs are deposited, the bees eagerly seek for that species of
                    nourishment on which the larva is to be fed. This consists of pollen, with a
                    proportion of honey and of water, which is partly digested in the stomachs of
                    the nursing bees, and which is made to vary in its qualities according to the
                    age of the young. Pollen is afforded by flowers in the spring in such abundance
                    that the bees of a single hive will often carry home above a pound of this
                    substance in one day. The eggs of bees are of a lengthened oval shape, with a
                    slight curvature, and of a bluish white colour. They are hatched without
                    requiring any particular attention on the part of the bees, except that of
                    keeping up a proper temperature; in which case three days are sufficient for the
                    exclusion of the larva. The larva has the appearance of a small white worm
                    without feet, which remains generally coiled up at the bottom of the cell. The
                    nursing bees feed it with great assiduity, with the kind of jelly above
                    described, and in every respect exhibit the greatest attachment for them. Mr
                    Hunter says that a young bee-maggot might easily be brought up by any person who
                    would be attentive to feed it. It may be seen opening its two lateral pincers to
                    receive the food, and then swallowing it. As it grows up it casts its cuticle,
                    like the larvae of other insects. In the course of five or six days it has
                    attained its full size, and nearly fills the cell in which it is lodged: it now
                    ceases to eat, and the bees close up its cell with a covering of wax, or rather
                    a mixture of wax and propolis, which they possess the art of amalgamating
                    together. During the next thirty-six hours the larva is engaged in spinning its
                    cocoon, and in three days more it is converted into the state of pupa or
                    chrysalis. In this state it is perfectly white, and every part of the future bee
                    may be distinguished through its transparent covering. In the course of a week
                    it tears asunder its investing membrane, makes its way through the outer wall of
                    its prison, and emerges in its perfect form. Reckoning from the time that the
                    egg is laid, it is only on the twentieth day of its existence that this last
                    metamorphosis is completed. No sooner has it thus emancipated itself, than its
                    guardians assemble round it, caress it with their tongues, and supply it
                    plentifully with food. They clean out the cell which it had been occupying,
                    leaving untouched, however, the greater part of the web, which thus serves to
                    bind together still more firmly the sides of the comb. The colour of the bee
                    when it quits the cell is a light gray; it requires two days before it can
                    attain sufficient strength for flying. The metamorphoses of the male bee follow
                    the same progress, but require a few days longer for their completion, occupying
                    about twenty-four days from the time of the egg being laid to the attainment of
                    the perfect state.</p>
                <p>The eggs deposited in the royal cells are precisely similar to those of the
                    working bees, and might be substituted the one for the other. The larva arises
                    from it precisely in the same manner, and does not differ from the larva of the
                    workers. But the attention of the nursing bees is more incessantly bestowed on
                    them; they are supplied with a peculiar kind of food, which appears to be more
                    stimulating than that of ordinary bees. It has not the same mawkish taste, and
                    is evidently acescent. It is furnished to the royal larva in greater quantities
                    than it can consume, so that a portion always remains behind in the cell after
                    its transformation. The growth of the larva, and the development of all its
                    organs, are very much accelerated by this treatment; so that in five days it is
                    prepared to spin its web; and the bees inclose it by building up a wall at the
                    mouth of its cell. The web is completed in twenty-four hours; two days and a
                    half are consumed in a state of inaction, and then the larva transforms itself
                    into a pupa. It remains between four and five days in this state; and thus, on
                    the sixteenth day after the egg has been laid, it has produced the perfect
                    insect. When this change is about to take place, the bees gnaw away part of the
                    wax covering of the cell, till at last it becomes pellucid from its extreme
                    thinness. This must not only facilitate the exit of the fly, but may possibly be
                    useful in permitting the evaporation of the superabundant fluids.</p>
                <p>But the queen-bee, although perfectly formed, is not always at liberty to come
                    out of her prison; for if the queen-mother be still in the hive, waiting a
                    favourable state of the weather to conduct another swarm, the bees do not suffer
                    the young queens to stir out; they even strengthen the covering of the cell by
                    an additional coating of wax, perforating it with a small hole, through which
                    the prisoner can thrust out its trunk in order to be fed by those who guard it.
                    The royal prisoners continually utter a kind of plaintive song, the modulations
                    of which are said to vary. One consequence of their detention is, that they are
                    capable of flying as soon as they are set at liberty. But the motive of this
                    proceeding on the part of the bees who guard them, is to be found in the
                    implacable hatred which the old queen bears against all those of her own sex,
                    and which impels her to destroy without mercy all the young queens that come
                    within her reach. The working bees are, on this account, very solicitous to
                    prevent her even approaching the royal cells while there is any prospect of a
                    swarm being about to take place. They establish themselves as a guard around
                    these cells, an , forgetting their allegiance on this occasion, actually bea her
                    off as often as she endeavours to come near them. , on the other hand, the
                    swarming season is over, or circumstances prevent any further swarms from being
                    sen off, the bees do not interpose any obstacle to the fury the old queen, who
                    immediately begins the work of destructicn, transfixing with her sting, one
                    after the of θ &gt; the whole of the royal brood while they are yet confined <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193196192" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6192-0529"/> in their cells.
                    It is observed by Huber, that the royal larvae construct only imperfect cocoons,
                    open behind, and enveloping only the head, thorax, and first ring of the
                    abdomen; and he conceives that the-intention of nature in this apparent
                    imperfection is, that they may be exposed to the mortal sting of the queen, to
                    whom they may be given up as a sacrifice.</p>
                <p>When the old queen has taken her departure along with the first swarm, the young
                    queens are liberated in succession, at intervals of a few days, in order to
                    prevent their attacking and destroying one another, which would be the
                    infallible consequence of their meeting. This exterminating warfare is prevented
                    by the vigilanee of the bees who guard them, so long as new swarms are expected
                    to take place. When a young queen is liberated, she is, like others of her sex,
                    anxious to get rid of her rivals, and even at that early age seeks to destroy
                    her sisters, who are still confined in the other royal cells; but as often as
                    she approaches them she is bit, pulled, and chased without ceremony by the
                    sentinels. But when the season is too far advanced for swarming, or when the
                    hive is too much exhausted in its population by the swarms that have already
                    been sent off, they no longer interfere in preserving peace, and the first that
                    acquires her libertyproceeds to massaere all her rivals. If two or more queens
                    should happen to issue out at the same moment, they mutually seek each other,
                    and fight till one is killed, and the survivor is immediately received as the
                    sovereign of the hive. The bees, far from seeking to prevent these battles,
                    appear to excite the combatants against each other, surrounding and bringing
                    them back to the charge when they are disposed to recede from each other; but
                    when either of the queens shows a disposition to approach her antagonist, all
                    the bees forming the elusters instantly give way to allow her full liberty for
                    the attack. The first use which the conquering queen makes of her victory is to
                    secure herself against fresh dangers by destroying all her future rivals in the
                    royal cells; while the other bees, who are spectators of the earnage, share in
                    the spoil, greedily devouring any food which may be found at the bottom of the
                    cells, and even sucking the fluid from the abdomen of the pupae before they toss
                    out the carcasses.</p>
                <p>The impregnation of the queen-bee was formerly involved in the deepest obscurity,
                    and has given rise to a multitude of very fanciful opinions. Some have denied
                    that any intercourse with the male was necessary for the fecundation of the
                    eggs. Swammerdam supposed that the mere effluvia proceeding from the males,
                    where they were collected in clusters, was sufficiently active to produce this
                    effect, by penetrating the body of the female. Huber proved, by a decisive
                    experiment, that no such consequence resulted from these effluvia. Maraldi
                    imagined that the eggs were fecundated by the drones, after being deposited in
                    the cells, in the same way that the spawn of fishes is rendered prolific by the
                    milters. Mr Debraw of Cambridge, in a paper published in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions,</hi> fancied that he had seen the milt-like fluid m
                    the cells. But this appearance has been shown by Huber to be a mere optical
                    illusion, arising from the reflection of light at the bottom of the cell. When
                    the males are excluded from the hive, the queen is as fertile, and the eggs as
                    prolific, as when they are present. Hattorff supposed that the queen is capable
                    of impregnating herself; an opinion which was supported by Schirach and
                    Wilhelmi, and was even favourably received by Bonnet, as it in some measure
                    accorded with his discoveries respecting the aphis, of which our readers will
                    find an account in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Aphis.</hi> (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Entomology,</hi><hi rend="italic">Index.')</hi> Linnaeus was of
                    opinion that an actual union between the sexes took place, and Reaumur fancied
                    that he had seen this happen within the hive. There is, however, great reason to
                    think that he was mistaken. Huber has clearly proved that the queen is never
                    impregnated as long as she remains in the interior of the hive; and, if confined
                    within it, continues barren, though surrounded by males. It is only during her
                    flight, at a considerable height in the air, that the male has complete access
                    to her so as to effect the impregnation. In half an hour the queen-bee returns
                    to the hive with unequivocal proofs of the intercourse that has taken place, for
                    she has in fact robbed the drone of the organs concerned in this operation; and
                    the drone, thus mutilated, is left to perish on the ground. From its being
                    necessary that the queen should fly to a distance in order to be impregnated,
                    Huber infers the necessity of a great number of drones being attached to the
                    hive, that there may be a sufficient chance of her meeting one of them during
                    her aerial excursion.</p>
                <p>We are now to direct our attention to the migrations of bees, by which new
                    colonies, similar to that which had originally peopled the parent hive, are
                    founded. The final causes of this phenomenon are sufficiently obvious; but it
                    does not so clearly appear to what circumstances it is immediately owing. The
                    increasing population of a hive probably occasions inconvenience from the want
                    of room, the increase of heat, and the greater vitiation of the air;
                    inconveniences which become still more serious as the summer advances. The
                    spring is accordingly the commencement of the swarming season; no swarm, indeed,
                    will ever take place while the weather is cold, nor until the hive is well
                    stocked with eggs of every kind. The queenbee, in consequence of the great
                    number of eggs she has been laying, is now reduced to a more slender shape, and
                    is well fitted for flight. Her aversion for the royal brood, which she seems to
                    foresee will in no long time become able to dispute the throne with her, and the
                    vain attempts she makes to destroy them in the cradle, in which she is
                    invariably repelled by the'bees who guard them, produce in her a constant
                    restlessness and agitation, which, as Huber represents it, rises to a degree of
                    delirium. This frenzy, from whatever cause it may originate, is communicated to
                    the workers; they may be seen hurrying to and fro in the combs, with evident
                    marks of impatience; the heat of the hive is increased by their tumultuous
                    movements; it sometimes rises suddenly, on these occasions, from 92° to above
                    104°. A general buzz is heard throughout the hive. This state recurs from time
                    to time, for some days before the swarm is actually on the wing; and the
                    interval is occupied in making preparations for the approaching expedition.
                    Provisions are collected in greater quantity by the working bees. Mr Hunter
                    killed several of those that came away, and found their crops full, while those
                    that remained in the hive had their crops not near so full. Scouts are sent out
                    to look for a proper habitation. Mr Knight, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions,</hi> gives us a curious account of his observations
                    on their manoeuvres in this respect. In the cavity of a hollow tree, which, by
                    the application of a board, had been fitted up for the reception of the swarms,
                    he constantly observed, “that, about fourteen days previous to their arrival, a
                    small number of bees, varying from twenty to fifty, were every day employed in
                    examining, and apparently in keeping possession of, the cavity; for if molested,
                    they showed evident signs of displeasure, though they never employed their
                    stings in defending their proposed habitation. Their examination was not
                    confined to the cavity, but extended to the external parts of the tree above;
                    every dead knot particularly arrested their attention, as if they had been
                    apprehensive of being injured by moisture, which this might admit into the
                    cavity below; and they apparently did not leave any part of the bark near the
                    ca<pb break="no" facs="nls:193196205" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6205-0530"/>vity
                    unexamined. A part of the colony which purposed to emigrate appeared in this
                    case to have been delegated to search for a proper habitation; and the
                    individual who succeeded must have apparently had some means of conveying
                    information of his success to others; for it cannot be supposed that fifty bees
                    should each accidentally meet at and fix upon the same cavity, at a mile distant
                    from their hive, which Mr Knight has frequently observed them to do, in a wood
                    where several trees were adapted for their reception; and indeed he observed
                    that they almost uniformly selected that cavity which he himself thought was the
                    best adapted to their use. It not unfrequently happened that swarms of his own
                    bees took possession of these cavities, and such swarms were in several
                    instances followed from his garden to the trees; and they were observed to
                    deviate very little from the direct line between the one point and the other,
                    which seems to indicate that those bees who had formerly acted as purveyors now
                    became guides.”</p>
                <p>On the day on which the swarm quits the hive, few of the workers roam to any
                    distance, but several are seen performing circles in the air round the hive. The
                    noise is on a sudden hushed, and all the bees enter the hive; this silence
                    announces their immediate departure. A few workers appear at the door, turn
                    towards the hive, and striking with their wings, give, as it were, the signal
                    for flight. All those who are to accompany the expedition rush towards the door,
                    and issue forth with wonderful rapidity, rising in the air and hovering for some
                    time, as if in order to wait for the assemblage of the whole troop; then,
                    following the motions of the queen, they settle wherever she alights, forming a
                    dense cluster around her. Sometimes, from weakness, or some other cause, she
                    returns back to the hive, and is immediately attended thither by the rest. But
                    if the weather be fine, the expedition is only deferred for one or two days, and
                    they again take their departure. If their return be owing to the loss of their
                    queen, they remain a fortnight or longer before the attempt to migrate is
                    renewed, and then the swarm is much larger than before, which renders it
                    probable that they have waited for the queen that was to go off with the next
                    swarm. Sometimes, when every thing indicates an approaching emigration, the
                    passage of a cloud across the sun will suspend all their operations, and the
                    previous bustle gives place to a state of perfect calm. But, if the day be not
                    far advanced, the breaking out of sunshine will renew the commotion, and
                    determine the moment of actual flight.</p>
                <p>The swarm having rested for some time on the first landing-place, and collected
                    the whole of its numbers, soars again in the air, keeping in a close phalanx,
                    and directing its course with great velocity to the spot which their guides had
                    selected; giving out, at the same time, a loud and acute-toned hum by the action
                    of their wings.</p>
                <p>The parent hive, thus deserted by its queen and a large proportion of its
                    inhabitants, is busily occupied in repairing its loss. The bees which remain
                    quietly pursue their labours; the young brood, soon arriving at maturity,
                    quickly fill up every deficiency; and young queens, being allowed their liberty,
                    one after the other, conduct in their turns new swarms, in the same manner as
                    the first. The second swarm is not sent off till after the space of from five to
                    ten days after the first. The following swarms succeed quicker to each other,
                    but consist of smaller numbers than the earlier ones. If it happen that two
                    queens are found in a swarm, either the swarm divides itself into two, and have
                    separate destinations,or a single combatbetween the queens decides on which of
                    them the empire is to devolve. Sometimes, indeed, they appear not to perceive
                    each other, and the parties belonging to each construct separate combs within
                    the same hive; but no sooner do these combs come in contact, and thus give
                    occasion to the queens meet⅛ each other, than the contest begins, and it does
                    nottermi. nate but by the death of one of the rival queens. Successive swarms
                    are sent off as long as the increase of population admits of it, and the number
                    thus produced in a season depends on a variety of circumstances, such as the
                    abundance of flowers, and the warmth of the climate, and the capacity of the
                    hive. Bosc, while he was French consul in Carolina, found a hive in the woods
                    which had been robbed of its wax and honey by the negroes: he contrived to
                    convey the bees in his hat to a hive in his garden; he obtained from this hive
                    eleven swarms before the end of autumn; and these again afforded him the same
                    number of secondary swarms, so that, by the end of the year, he had twenty-two
                    hives stocked from the one he had thus saved from destruction. In this country a
                    hive commonly sends off only two, and sometimes three swarms in the course of
                    the summer.</p>
                <p>Very few drones accompany the new colonies, so that almost all those produced in
                    the spring remain in the hive.' But when the queens are impregnated, and no new
                    swarms' are about to take place, the workers, who had till then suffered them to
                    live unmolested in the hive, are on a sudden seized with a deadly fury towards
                    them, and a scene of carnage ensues. This usually happens in July or August.
                    They chase their unhappy victims in every quarter, till they seek a refuge at
                    the bottom of the hive, where they collect in crowds, and are indiscriminately,
                    and without a single exception, massacred by the working bees, who, with
                    implacable fury, transfix them with their stings, and throw the dead bodies out
                    of the hive. So great is their antipathy to all the race of drones, that they
                    destroy, at the same time, the male eggs and larvae, and tear open the cocoons
                    of their punae, in order to devote them to one common destruction. This
                    sacrifice of the males is not, however, the effect of a blind and
                    indiscriminating instinct; for if a hive be deprived of its queen, the massacre
                    does not take place, while the hottest persecution rages in all the surrounding
                    hives. In this case the males are allowed to survive one winter.</p>
                <p>Having thus got rid of the useless mouths, which consumed, without any advantage
                    to the public, a large portion of their provisions, the bees spend the remainder
                    of the summer in collecting stores of honey and of pollen for the ensuing
                    winter. Their gleanings are now less abundant than in the spring, and require
                    more labour in the search and collection. But at this season the leaves of many
                    kinds of trees, which are covered in the morning with a saccharine fluid that
                    transudes through them, furnish them with a species of nourishment, which,
                    though of very inferior quality to the fluid of the nectarea, still contributes
                    to their support. Fruit is also attacked by bees, after the cuticular covering
                    has been broken through by birds or snails. They also find nutriment in the <hi
                    rend="italic">honeydew,</hi> which, as already stated, is an excrementitious
                    fluid from the aphis. Often, however, these resources fail, and the hive is
                    threatened with famine. On these occasions the distressed bees frequently betake
                    themselves to plunder. Spies are sent out to examine the neighbouring hives;
                    allured by the smell of honey, they examine the appearance and strength of its
                    possessors; and, selecting the weakest hive as the object of attack, they begin
                    a furious onset, which costs great numbers their lives. If the invaders should
                    fail in their attempt to force the entrance, they retreat, and are not pursued
                    by those whom they have assailed; but if they succeed in making good the
                    assault, the war continues to rage in the interior of the hive, till one party
                    is utterly exterminated; reinforcements are sent for by the invading army, and
                    the bees <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196218" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6218-0531"/>from
                    the neighbouring hives often join the assailants and share in the plunder. In a
                    short time the whole of the enemy’s magazines are completely emptied. If, on the
                    other hand, the invaders should be defeated, the successful party is by no means
                    safe from the attacks of the bees from other hives, if any of them should chance
                    to have mingled in the fray, and especially if they have once penetrated as far
                    as the magazines, for in that case they are sure to return, accompanied with a
                    large reinforcement, and the unfortunate hive that has once been attacked
                    ultimately falls a sacrifice to these repeated invasions.</p>
                <p>The close of autumn puts a period to their labours abroad. They then live on the
                    provisions they have amassed, till the cold of winter reduces them to a torpid
                    state; from which they awake on the return of vernal warmth, and renew the same
                    circle of labours. Sometimes the strong light reflected from the snow during a
                    clear sunshine deceives them with the appearance of warmth, and some bees are
                    tempted to issue forth in order to collect provisions. All who thus venture out
                    perish by the cold in a few minutes.</p>
                <p>Bees seldom die a natural death. They are at all times exposed to a variety of
                    accidents, which thin their numbers; so that the average duration of their lives
                    does not exceed one year. We may conclude that the whole generation is renewed
                    in that space of time, from the results of experiments which have been tried of
                    marking all the individuals of a hive in the spring, when it was found that none
                    were in existence the next season. They are the natural prey of a number of
                    quadrupeds, birds, and insects; many are overtaken by stormy weather, or fly to
                    too great a distance, and never find their way back again to the hive; others
                    are benumbed by cold; and numbers perish in battle with others of their own
                    species, or lose their lives by being unable to withdraw the stings which they
                    have employed against their enemies. The fecundity of the queen-bee is, however,
                    adequate not only to repair these losses, but to multiply the population in a
                    very high progression. It is computed that in France a single queen will lay
                    from 30,000 to 60,000 eggs. This however varies according to the climate; for in
                    Carolina and the West Indies they are known to produce at least three times this
                    number. A single intercourse with the male is sufficient for the fecundation of
                    all the eggs which the queen lays for at least two years, as has been proved by
                    Huber; but its influence probably extends to all the eggs which the queen may
                    lay during the rest of her life. The same queen has been observed to conduct
                    swarms for two successive years; but the natural period of their lives is not
                    known with any certainty. The ancients supposed it to be seven years; but
                    Féburier suspects that, like the males, they are destroyed by the labourers when
                    they have fulfilled their destination; for he was witness to an attack made by
                    six labourers on a queen, whom he rescued with difficulty. Mr Hunter observes,
                    that, judging from analogy, a bee’s natural life is limited to a certain number
                    of seasons; for he conceives that no individual insect of any species lives one
                    month longer than the others of the same species. In the bee, one might suppose
                    the period of life to be equal to the time that a hive can last; but this is not
                    a necessary consequence, since they keep up a succession of generations. The
                    comb of the hive may be said to be the furniture and storehouse of the bees,
                    which by use must wear out; but, independently of his, it will in time become
                    unfit for use, by the accumu-ation of cocoons, together with the excrements of
                    the maggots, which are never removed. The former, indeed, mes the whole cell,
                    top, sides, and bottom; and may be ιstmguished from the cocoons of former
                    maggots that have been hatched in the same cell, by a portion of dried
                    excrement, which is interposed between them at the bottom of the cell. Mr Hunter
                    counted above twenty different linings in one cell, and found the cell about one
                    quarter or one third filled up. A piece of comb so circumstanced, when boiled
                    for the wax, will keep its form, and the small quantity of wax is squeezed out
                    at different parts, as if squeezed out of a sponge, and runs together in the
                    crevices; while a piece of comb that never has been bred in, even of the same
                    hive, melts almost wholly down. Hence the combs can only last a certain number
                    of years. However, to make them last longer, the bees often add a little to the
                    mouth of the cell, which is seldom done with wax alone, but with some sort of
                    mixture; and they sometimes cover the silk lining of the last chrysalis; but all
                    this, observes Mr Hunter, makes such cells clumsy, in comparison of the original
                    ones.</p>
                <p>We have thus given an account of the principal facts in the history of bees, as
                    far as they relate to the usual or natural condition of these insects. We shall
                    conclude with the relation of several curious phenomena which they exhibit under
                    particular and unusual circumstances, in which accident, or the designs of the
                    experimenter, may have placed them.</p>
                <p>The loss of the queen is an event which has the most marked influence on their
                    conduct. Although the queen: is constantly an object of attention and of strong
                    affection to the whole community, they are not immediately sensible of her
                    absence when she is removed from the hive. The ordinary labours are continued
                    without interruption, and it is not till a whole hour has elapsed that symptoms
                    of uneasiness are manifested, and it is even then only partially displayed. The
                    inquietude begins in one part of the hive, the workers become restless, abandon
                    the young which they were feeding, run to and fro, and, by striking each other
                    with their antennae, communicate the alarming intelligence very quickly to their
                    companions. The ferment soon extends to the whole community; the bees rush
                    precipitately out of the hive, and seek for their lost queen in every direction.
                    This state of confusion continues for two or three, and sometimes for five
                    hours, but never longer. Tranquillity is again re-established; they return to
                    their labours; and selecting one of the larvae that is not more than three days
                    old, they break down two of the contiguous cells, sacrificing the larvae
                    contained in them, and proceed to build up one royal cell from their ruins. They
                    then supply the worm with the food necessary to promote its quick growth, and,
                    leaving untouched the rhomboidal bottom, they raise around it a cylindrical
                    inclosure. In three days the larva has grown to such a size as to require an
                    extension of its lodging, and must inhabit a cell nearly of a pyramidal figure,
                    and hanging perpendicularly. A new pyramidal tube is therefore constructed with
                    the wax of the surrounding cells, which is soldered at right angles to the
                    first, and the bees, working downwards, gradually contract its diameter from the
                    base, which is very wide, to the point. In proportion as the worm grows the bees
                    labour in extending the cell, and bring food, which they place before its mouth
                    and round its body, forming a kind of coiled zone around it. The worm, which can
                    move only in a spiral direction, turns incessantly to take its food before its
                    head; it insensibly descends, and at length arrives at the orifice of the cell.
                    It then transforms itself into a pupa, is inclosed with a covering of wax, as
                    before described, and, in the space of ten days, the original loss is thus
                    repaired by the birth of a new queen. Schirach found, that if a number of bees
                    be confined with even a single larva, which, in the natural course would have
                    become a working bee, they immediately set about giving it the royal education
                    above related, and thus raise it to the dignity of queen.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196231" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6231-0532"/>
                <p>This discovery, which has since been amply confirmed by recent experiment and
                    observation, was at first chiefly admired for its singularity in a physiological
                    point of view. But it is evidently capable of being very advantageously applied
                    towards the formation of artificial swarms, or new colonies of bees, by which
                    the produce in honey and wax may be proportionally augmented. In the early
                    months of spring, and even during the succeeding months, so late as November, M.
                    Schirach cut off from an old hive a piece of that part of the comb which
                    contained the eggs of the working bees, taking care, however, that it likewise
                    included some worms hatched within the three preceding days. He fixed this in an
                    empty hive, or box, together with a portion of honey-comb, &amp;c.; or, in other
                    words, with a sufficiency of food and building materials, or wax, for the use of
                    the intended colony. He then put into, and confined within the box, a sufficient
                    number of common working bees, taken from the same or any other hive. As soon as
                    the members of this small community found themselves deprived of their liberty,
                    and without a queen, a dreadful uproar ensued, which continued generally, with
                    some short intervals of silence, for the space of about 24 hours; during which
                    time it is to be supposed they were alternately meditating and holding counsel
                    on the future support of the new republic. On the final cessation of this
                    tumult, the general and almost constant result was, that they betook themselves
                    to work, first proceeding to the construction of royal cells, and then taking
                    the proper measures for hatching and feeding such of the brood as were placed
                    within them. Sometimes even on the second day the foundations of one or more
                    royal cells were perceptible. This operation has been hitherto conducted within
                    doors. The new colony may now be safely trusted in the garden, if the weather be
                    warm, and have the liberty allowed them of passing out of the box; of which they
                    instantly avail themselves, and are seen in a short time almost totally to
                    desert their new habitation. In about two hours, however, they begin to re-enter
                    it. We should not neglect to observe, that if they should be placed near the old
                    hive from which they were taken, they will very often attempt to enter it, but
                    are as constantly repulsed by their former companions and brethren. It is
                    prudent, therefore, to place them at a distance from the mother state, in order
                    to avoid the inconveniences of a civil war. The final result of the experiment
                    is, that the colony of working bees thus shut up, with a morsel of common brood,
                    not only hatch it, but are found, at the end of eighteen or twenty days, to have
                    produced from thence one or two queens, which have apparently proceeded from
                    worms of the common sort, pitched upon by them for that purpose; and which,
                    under other circumstances, that is, if they had remained in the old hive, would,
                    in the course of their metamorphosis, have attained only to the condition of
                    working bees. In the present instance, the common worm appears to be converted
                    by them into a queen-bee merely because the hive was in want of one. Hence we
                    may justly infer that the kingdom of the bees is not, if the expression may be
                    used, a <hi rend="italic">jure divino,</hi> or hereditary monarchy, but an
                    elective kingdom; in which the choice of their future ruler is made by the body
                    of the people.</p>
                <p>While the hive remains without a queen, swarming can never take place, however
                    crowded the hive may be. The young queens are suffered to come out of their
                    cells without impediment, and, after a number of deadly combats, the empire
                    remains with the survivor. Huber has made the singular observation, that two
                    queens, however inveterate may be their mutual hostility, never actually both
                    destroy each other; and that when, in the course of their contest, they are
                    placed in such a relative position as that each has it in her power to strike a
                    mortal blow on the other with its sting, they suddenly separate, and fly from
                    each other with every appearance of being panic-struck. The final cause of the
                    instinct that prompts this conduct is sufficiently obvious, as, without it, the
                    hive would be altogether deprived of a queen.</p>
                <p>The bees recognise the individual person of their own queen. If another be palmed
                    upon them, they seize and surround her, so that she is either suffocated or
                    perishes with hunger; for it is very remarkable that the workers are never seen
                    to attack a queen-bee with their stings. If, however, more than eighteen hours
                    have elapsed before the stranger queen be introduced, she has some chance of
                    escape. The bees do, indeed, at first seize and confine her, but less rigidly;
                    and they soon begin to disperse, and at length leave her to reign over a hive,
                    in which she was at first treated as a prisoner. If twenty-four hours have
                    elapsed, the stranger will be well received from the first, and at once admitted
                    to the sovereignty of the hive. If a supernumerary queen be introduced into the
                    hive, she is laid hold of by the bees, and presented to the reigning queen,
                    while a ring is formed by the bees, who continue to be spectators, and even
                    promoters of the combat, in which one or other of the queens is destined to
                    perish. Schirach and Reims had imagined that, in these circumstances, the
                    stranger met her death from the hands of the working bees; but this mistake has
                    been rectified by Huber, who gives the account above stated.</p>
                <p>If the impregnation of the queen be delayed beyond the twenty-first day of her
                    life, she begins soon after to lay the eggs of drones, and produces no other
                    kind of eggs during the remainder of her life. This very curious and unexpected
                    fact was discovered by Huber, and has been satisfactorily established by his
                    very numerous and varied experiments, although its explanation is perhaps
                    attended with insuperable difficulties. The body of a queen whose impregnation
                    has thus been retarded is shorter than common, and the extremities remain
                    slender, while the first two rings of the abdomen, or those next the thorax, are
                    uncommonly swollen. On dissecting the double ovary, both branches were found to
                    be equally expanded and equally sound, but the eggs were apparently not placed
                    so closely together as in common queens. It was not correctly ascertained
                    whether the queens whose impregnation was retarded laid a number of drone eggs
                    corresponding to the whole number of eggs, both of workers and drones, which
                    they ought to have deposited; but it is certain that they laid a greater number
                    of drone eggs than they ought naturally to have done. On these occasions the
                    instinct of the queen-bee appears to suffer, for she then lays her eggs
                    indiscriminately in large and in small cells, those laid in large cells
                    producing large drones, those in small cells small drones; and she has been
                    known to lay the eggs of drones even in royal cells, some of which are always
                    constructed when the queen begins to lay male eggs. It is curious that the
                    workers were, on these last occasions, deceived, and treated the embryo drones
                    as if they had been truly of the royal brood.</p>
                <p>One of the most remarkable facts concerning the generation of bees, is the
                    existence occasionally of prolific workers, the discovery of which we owe to
                    Reims. Although it was doubted by Bonnet, its reality has been fully confirmed
                    by the researches of Huber; and ŗt explains what was before unaccountable, the
                    production of eggs in hives absolutely destitute of a queen. It is also
                    remarkable, that the cggs thus produced are always those of drones. The origin
                    of these supplementary queens is accounted for from their having passed the
                    vermicular state in cells contiguous to the royal ones, and from Hιen having, at
                    an early period, devoured some portion of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193196244" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6244-0533"/>stimulating jelly which was
                    destined for the nourishment of the royal brood; and from their ovaria thus
                    receiving a partial development, which renders them susceptible of being
                    impregnated. It is curious that these imperfect queens are still objects of
                    jealousy and animosity to the queen-bee. How they become impregnated has not
                    been ascertained; but the fact of their being productive was a strong
                    confirmation of the truth of Schirach’s theory concerning the sexes of bees.
                    Needham, to whom the fact was known, had eluded the force of the argument by
                    pretending that these bees did not belong to the working class, but were real
                    queens of an unusually small size. The supposed absence of ovaria in the working
                    bee was still, indeed, a difficulty which tended to throw some degree of doubt
                    on the correctness of Schirach’s doctrine. No person, as Bonnet repeatedly
                    alleges, could suppose that these organs, however minute they might be, had
                    escaped the penetration of Swammerdam, who was unrivalled in his anatomical
                    skill in all that related to insects, and who had bestowed great labour in the
                    examination of the structure of the bee. What had eluded his scalpel and
                    microscope was reserved for the still finer hand and more dexterous dissection
                    of a lady. Miss Jurine, the daughter of the celebrated naturalist of Geneva, has
                    discovered, by adopting a particular method of preparing the object to be
                    viewed, the rudiments of ovaria in the common working bee; she examined a great
                    number, and never failed to find them. Cuvier, in his <hi rend="italic">Leçons d
                    Anatomie Comparée,</hi> mentions a suspicion that he had seen some very small
                    oviducts in the working bees, a suspicion which we now find to be completely
                    verified.</p>
                <p>We have next to relate the results of experiments of a more cruel kind, but which
                    illustrate several points in the physiology of these insects. The amputation of
                    the four wings of the queen did not interfere with her laying of the eggs, and
                    the workers did not show her the less attention on account of her being thus
                    mutilated. Of course, if the operation be performed before she is impregnated,
                    she remains barren, since it is necessary for the sexual congress that she
                    should fly out of the hive. The amputation of a single antenna appeared to be
                    productive of no bad consequence of any kind; but the removal of both the
                    antennae was followed by singular effects. The queen who had suffered this
                    operation ran about in apparent disorder, dropping her eggs at random, and was
                    incapable of directing her trunk with precision to the food that was offered
                    her. At times she appeared desirous of escaping from the hive, and when this was
                    prevented, she returned in a state of delirium, was indifferent to the caresses
                    of the workers, and received another similarly mutilated queen, that was
                    presented to her, without the least symptom of dislike. The workers, on the
                    other hand, received the stranger queen with great respect, although the first
                    still remained in the hive. A third queen, not mutilated, was next introduced;
                    she was very ill received, and immediately detained and kept close prisoner.
                    When the queen, deprived of her antennae, was allowed to quit the hive, she was
                    followed by none of the workers, and was abandoned to her fate.</p>
                <p>Bees naturally build from above downwards, but may, by a particular artifice,
                    devised by Huber, be induced to reverse this process. For this purpose a glass
                    hive, with slender laths fixed at the bottom of it, must be provided, and the
                    bees confined in it. They are unable to fasten themselves to the smooth
                    surfaces, and, therefore, establish the foundations of the combs on the wood,
                    and are forced to proceed in a direction opposite to the usual one; in this way
                    Huber was enabled to observe their proceedings. But the readiest mode of
                    inducing them to build in any particular direction is to supply them with
                    portions of ready-made combs, which should be fixed with wires in the proper
                    position; and they will always continue to complete them upon the model
                    presented to them. The hive which Huber recommends is constructed on this
                    principle, consisting of upright frames of a square form, fitted to each other,
                    and of such a size as just to contain each of them a single comb; by separating
                    these, every part of the hive can be laid open and examined with the utmost
                    ease. Féburier has improved upon this construction by changing the shape of the
                    frames from a square to a trapezium, having an acute angle at the summit; a form
                    which allows the moisture that collects at the top to run down the sides more
                    easily than it would do from a flat roof. In this way, any portion of the honey
                    or wax may be removed at pleasure, without hurting or incommoding any one of the
                    bees; and artificial swarms may, at the proper season, be readily procured, by
                    dividing the hive into two portions, and adapting empty frames to each
                    portion.</p>
                <p>The wasp and the hornet have long been known as the; determined enemies of the
                    bee, committing great ravages' among these weaker insects: they attack them
                    individually, but oftener commit their aggressions in large armies, on which
                    occasions numbers perish on both sides. In some parts of America, wasps have
                    multiplied to so great a degree, as to render it impossible to rear bees. Among
                    quadrupeds, the ant-eater occasionally devours them. The bear and the badger
                    overturn the hives, and plunder their contents. Rats and mice are very
                    formidable enemies, as they invade them at all seasons, and especially during
                    their torpid state, when they are incapable of revenging the aggression. The
                    woodpecker may succeed in breaking through the hive, and then speedily destroys
                    all its inhabitants; the swallow, the sparrow, the titmouse, the cuckoo, and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Merops apiaster,</hi> or bee-eater, and poultry of every kind,
                    prey upon them separately. According to Bose, they are also food for the
                    shrikes, and for the <hi rend="italic">Falco apivorus.</hi> Lizards watch for
                    them, and seize them as they alight near the hive. Toads occasionally devour
                    them. They are in some danger from the larger kinds of spiders, and of <hi
                    rend="italic">Libelluloe,</hi> as also from the <hi rend="italic">Philanthus
                    apivorus</hi> of Fabricius. But the most insidious and destructive enemy of
                    these insects is the moth; various species of which, particularly the <hi
                    rend="italic">Phalena ιnellolena,</hi> insinuate themselves into the hive, and
                    deposit their eggs unperceived between the cells in such numbers, that the hive
                    is soon overrun with the larvae, where they are hatched, and the bees are forced
                    to abandon the hive. A new enemy of the same tribe has been lately discovered by
                    Huber, in the <hi rend="italic">Sphinx atropos,</hi> well known by the name of
                    death’s head. Towards the end of autumn, when the bees
                    havefilledtheirmagazines,aloud hum is sometimes heard near their habitation, and
                    a multitude of þees come out during the night, and fly about in the utmost
                    confusion. The tumult continues for several hours, and the next morning a number
                    of dead bees are strewed before the hive. On examining the hive, it is found to
                    have been robbed of all its honey, and the bees do not return to it.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There appears to be some
                    exaggeration or misconception in this statement of the Genevese observer. The
                    death’s head moth is one of the largest of the lepidopterous insects of Europe,
                    and could not possibly effect an entrance into any hive constructed with
                    ordinary care. Noris it probable that it could consume more than a very small
                    portion of honey, even if it were to obtain admission.</p></note> These effects
                    result from the incursions of the sphinx, which watches its opportunity to
                    introduce itself into the hive during the night, when the bees are depriv<pb

                    advantages of vision, which the sphinx enjoys in greater perfection at this
                    period. By rendering the door-way extremely narrow, so as only to admit a single
                    bee at a time, this accident may be prevented; and it is curious that the bees
                    themselves frequently anticipate this danger, and provide against it by
                    employing, of their own accord, the very same mode of defence. They construct a
                    thick wall, which barricades the entrance, and resembles a regular
                    fortification, with bastions, casemates, and massive gateways. They often,
                    indeed, have recourse to a similar contrivance for protection against the
                    pillaging bees, enabling them to repel the assault with greater effect. At other
                    times, when the danger is less pressing, the inconveniences of so narrow a
                    gateway being strongly felt, they enlarge it by removing the fortification they
                    had built, and do not again construct it unless the appearance of the enemy in
                    the ensuing season should inspire them with fresh alarms. If, on the other hand,
                    the precaution of narrowing the gateway should already have been taken by the
                    cultivator, the bees, feeling themselves secure, spare themselves the
                    unnecessary labour of erecting these walls. This single trait in their history
                    is a sufficient refutation of those theories which ascribe all their actions to
                    the operation of a blind indiscriminating instinct, and would exclude every
                    species of foresight and reflection, <hi rend="smallcaps">(y.)</hi></p>
                <p>In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Apiary</hi> of this work we have already
                    described the leaf and book hives of Μ. Huber, with the proposed improvements of
                    several other apiarians. The chief objection to some of these is the expense and
                    difficulty of their construction, and the greater degree of attention which they
                    exact on the part of the cultivator. Those made of straw are generally
                    preferred, as being less liable to be overheated by the rays of the sun: theyare
                    likewise of easy purchase, from their cheapness; and in winter they exclude the
                    cold better than hives made of other materials. The following is Mr Wildman’s
                    account of the structure and general management of his hives :— " My hives are
                    seven inches in height and ten in width. The sides are upright, so that the top
                    and bottom are of the same diameter. A hive holds nearly a peck. In the upper
                    row of straw there is a hoop of about half an inch in breadth, to which are
                    nailed five bars of deal, full a quarter of an inch in thickness and an inch and
                    quarter wide, and half an inch asunder from one another; a narrow short bar is
                    nailed at each side, half an inch distant from the bars next them, in order to
                    fill up the remaining parts of the circle; so that there are in all seven bars
                    of deal, to which the bees fix their combs. The space of half an inch between
                    the bars allows a sufficient and easy passage for the bees from one comb to
                    another. In order to give great steadiness to the combs, so that, upon moving
                    the hive, the combs may not fall off, or incline out of their direction, a stick
                    should be run through the middle of the hive, in a direction directly across the
                    bars, or at right angles with them. When the hives are made, a piece of wood
                    should be worked into the lower row of straw, long enough to allow a door for
                    the bees, of four inches in length, and half an inch in height.</p>
                <p>“The proprietor of the bees should provide himself with several flat covers of
                    straw, worked of the same thickness as the hives, and a foot in diameter, that
                    so it may be of the same width as the outside of the hives. Before the cover is
                    applied to the hive, a piece of clean paper, of the size of the top of the hive,
                    should be laid over it; and a coat of cow-dung, which is the least apt to crack
                    of any cement easily to be obtained, should be laid all round the circumference
                    of the hive. Let the cover be laid upon this, and made fast to the hive with a
                    packing-needle and pack-thread, so that neither cold nor vermin may enter.</p>
                <p>“Each hive should stand single on a piece of deal or other wood, somewhat larger
                    than the bottom of the hive. That part of the stand which is at the mouth of the
                    hive should project some inches for the bees to rest on when they return from
                    the field. This stand should be supported upon a single post, two and a half
                    feet high, to which it should be screwed very securely, that high winds or other
                    accidents may not blow down both stand and hive. A quantity of soot mixed with
                    barley chaff should be strewed on the ground round the post, which will
                    effectually prevent ants, slugs, and other vermin, from rising up to the hive.
                    The soot and chaff should from time to time be renewed as it is blown or washed
                    away, though, as it is sheltered by the stand, it remains a considerable time,
                    especially if care be taken that no weeds rise through it. Weeds, indeed, should
                    not be permitted to rise near the hive, for they may give shelter to vermin
                    which may be hurtful to the bees.</p>
                <p>“The stands for bees should be four yards asunder, or, if the apiary will not
                    admit of so much, as far asunder as may be, that the bees of one hive may not
                    interfere with those of another hive, as is sometimes the case when the hives
                    are near one another, or on the same stand; for the bees, mistaking their own
                    hives, light sometimes at the wrong door, and a fray ensues, in which one or
                    more may lose their lives.”</p>
                <p>He further directs, that whoever intends to construct an apiary should purchase a
                    proper number of hives at the latter part of the year, when they are cheapest.
                    These should be full of combs, and well stored with bees. The purchaser should
                    also examine the combs, with a view to ascertain the age of the hives. The combs
                    of the season are white; those of the former year are of a darkish yellow; and
                    where the combs are black, the hive should be rejected, because when old they
                    are more subject to the attacks of vermin and other accidents. If the requisite
                    number of hives have not been purchased in the autumn, it will be necessary to
                    remedy this neglect as soon as the severity of the cold has passed in spring. At
                    this season, according to Mr Wildman, bees which are in good condition will go
                    into the fields early in the morning, return well laden, enter boldly, and will
                    seldom leave their home in bad weather. They are alert on the least disturbance;
                    and we may judge of their strength by the loudness of their humming. The summer
                    is not an advisable season for purchasing bees, because the heat of the weather
                    softens the wax, and renders the combs liable to break and give way, if they are
                    not well secured in the interior. The honey, too, being thinner than at other
                    times, is more apt to run from the cells, which not only occasions a loss of the
                    material, but daubs, and possibly destroys, the bees.</p>
                <p>Mr Wildman’s feats in the handling of these irritable and pugnacious creatures
                    have been the frequent subject of surprise. As it is often of consequence to be
                    able to regulate the settling of a swarm, we shall here subjoin his method in
                    his own words, “Long experience has taught me, that as soon as I turn up a hive,
                    and give it some taps on the sides and bottom, the queen immediately appears to
                    know the cause of this alarm, but soon retires again among her people. Being
                    accustomed to see her so often, I readily perceive her at first glance; and long
                    practice has enabled me to seize her instantly with a tenderness that does not
                    in the least endanger her person. This is of the utmost importance, for the
                    least injury done to her brings immediate destruction to the hive, if you have
                    not a spare queen to put in her place, as I have too often experienced in my
                    first attempts. When possessed of her, I can without injury to her, or exciting
                    that degree of resentment that may tempt her to sting me, slip her into my other
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196270" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6270-0535"/> hand, and,
                    returning the hive to its place, hold her there, till the bees, missing her, arc
                    all on wing, and in the utmost confusion. When the bees are thus distressed, I
                    place the queen wherever·I would have the bees to settle. The moment a few of
                    them discover her, they give notice to those near them, and those to the rest,
                    the knowledge of which soon becomes so general, that in a few minutes they all
                    collect themselves round her, and are so happy in having recovered this sole
                    support of their state, that they will long remain quiet in their situation.
                    Nay, the scent of her body is so attractive of them, that the slightest touch of
                    her along any place or substance will attach the bees to it, and induce them to
                    pursue any path she takes.” This was the only witchcraft used by Mr Wildman, and
                    is that alone which is practised by others who have since made similar
                    exhibitions.</p>
                <p>In the management of bees a great deal must of course depend on supplying them
                    with an abundant pasture. A rich corn country is well known to be to them as a
                    barren desert during a great portion of the year. Hence the judicious practice
                    of shifting them from place to place according to the circumstances of the
                    season. It was the advice of Celsus, that after the vernal pastures were
                    consumed, bees should be transported to places abounding with autumnal flowers;
                    and it was in accordance with such advice that they were annually carried in
                    ancient times from Achaia to Attica, and from Euboea and the islands of the
                    Cyclades to Scyrus. In Sicily, also, they were brought to Hybla from other parts
                    of the island. So also in our own country the people of the lowlands, as soon as
                    the “bright consummate flowers” of summer are on the wane, dispatch their hives
                    in cart loads to the blooming heather of the mountain pastures, where a
                    never-ending wilderness of sweets is spread before them. It is indeed to be
                    regretted that our moorlands, in this respect, are so much more neglected than
                    they ought to be. The very air of the highland hills is often redolent with the
                    rich perfume, while here and there a solitary bee is seen or heard labouring
                    with wearied wing among the inexhaustible stores of nature, and scarcely able to
                    regain its lonely shieling in the distant vale. WΙιen we consider the poverty of
                    our mountaineers, and their frequent want of occupation, it is the more to be
                    lamented that so easy a source of emolument should lie open to them in vain. It
                    has been calculated that the pastures of Scotland could maintain as many bees as
                    would produce 4,000,000 pints of honey and 1,000,000 pounds of wax; and were
                    these quantities tripled for England and Ireland, the produce of the British
                    empire would be 12,000,000 pints of honey, and 3,000,000 pounds of wax per
                    annum. If we allow five shillings per pint for the honey and one shilling and
                    sixpence per pound for the wax, we have an annual produce in money of
                    L.3,225,000. But, in consequence of the present neglect of this branch of rural
                    economy, we pay every year a large sum to foreign nations for articles which we
                    could raise ourselves, with scarcely any outlay either of capital or time.</p>
                <p>We learn from Pliny that the practice of removing bees from place to place was
                    frequent in the Roman, territories. “As soon,” says he, “as the spring food for
                    bees has tailed in the valleys near our towns, the hives of bees are put into
                    boats, and carried up against the stream of the river in the night, in search of
                    better pasture. The bees go out in the morning in quest of provisions, and
                    return regularly to their hives in the boats, with the stores they have
                    collected. This method is continued till the sinking of the boats to a certain
                    depth in the water shows that ıe hives are sufficiently full; and they are then
                    carried ack to their former homes, where their honey is taken out of them. And
                    this is still the practice of the Italians who live near the banks of the Po,
                    the river which Pliny instanced particularly in the passage above quoted.</p>
                <p>M. Maillet relates, in his description of Egypt, that, in “spite of the ignorance
                    and rusticity which have got possession of that country, there yet remain in it
                    several footsteps of the industry and skill of the ancient Egyptians. One of
                    their most admirable contrivances is, their sending their bees annually into
                    distant countries, in order to procure them sustenance there, at a time when
                    they could not find any at home; and their afterwards bringing them back, like
                    shepherds who should travel with their flock, and make them feed as they go. It
                    was observed by the ancient inhabitants of Lower Egypt, that all plants
                    blossomed, and the fruits of the earth ripened, above six weeks earlier in Upper
                    Egypt than with them. They applied this remark to their bees; and the means then
                    made use of by them to enable these usefully industrious insects to reap
                    advantage from the more forward state of nature there, were exactly the same as
                    are now practised for the like purpose in that country. About the end of
                    October, all such inhabitants of Lower Egypt as have hives of bees, embark them
                    on the Nile, and convey them up that river quite into Upper Egypt; observing to
                    time it so that they arrive there just when the inundation is withdrawn, the
                    lands have been sown, and the flowers begin to bud. The hives thus sent are
                    marked and numbered by their respective owners, and placed pyramidi-cally in
                    boats prepared for the purpose. After they have remained some days at their
                    farthest station, and are supposed to have, gathered all the wax and honey they
                    could find in the fields within two or three leagues around, their conductors
                    convey them in the same boats two or three leagues lower down, and there leave
                    the laborious insects as long time as is necessary for them to collect all the
                    riches of this spot. Thus the nearer they come to the place of their more
                    permanent abode, they find the productions of the earth, and the plants which
                    afford them food, forward in proportion. In fine, about the beginning of
                    February, after having travelled through the whole length of Egypt, gathering
                    all the rich produce of the delightful banks of the Nile, they arrive at the
                    mouth of that river, towards the ocean, from whence they set out, and from
                    whence they are now returned to their several homes; for care is taken to keep
                    an exact register of every district from whence the hives were sent in the
                    beginning of the season, of their numbers, of the names of the persons who sent
                    them, and likewise of the mark or number of the boat in which they were
                    placed.”</p>
                <p>In many parts of France floating bee-houses are very common. They have on board
                    one barge three score or a hundred bee-hives, well defended from the inclemency
                    of an accidental storm. With these the owners suffer themselves to float gently
                    down the river, the bees continually choosing their flowery pasture along the
                    banks of the stream; and thus a single floating bee-house yields the proprietor
                    a considerable income.</p>
                <p>They have also a method of transporting their bees by land, well worth our
                    imitation in many parts of this kingdom. Their first care is to examine those
                    hives, some of whose honeycombs might be broken or separated by the jolting of
                    the vehicle; they are then made fast one to the other, and against the sides of
                    the hive, by means of small sticks, which may be disposed differently as
                    occasion points out. This being done, every hive is set upon a packing-cloth, or
                    something like it, the threads of which are very wide; the sides of this cloth
                    are then turned up and laid on the outside of each hive, in which state they arc
                    tied together with a piece of small packthread wound several times round the
                    hive. As many hives as a cart built for the purpose will hold are after<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193196283" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6283-0536"/>wards placed in
                    the vehicle. The hives are set two and two, the whole length of the cart. Over
                    these are placed others, which make as it were a second story or bed of hives.
                    Care is taken in this stowage not to let one hive stop up another, it being
                    essentially necessary for the bees to have air; and it is for this reason they
                    are wrapped up in a coarse cloth, the threads of which have been wove very wide,
                    in order that the air may have a free passage, and lessen the heat which these
                    insects raise in their hives, especially when they move about very tumultuously,
                    as often happens in these carts. Those used for this purpose in Yevre hold from
                    thirty to forty-eight hives. As soon as all are thus stowed, the caravan sets
                    out. If the season is sultry, they travel only in the night; but a proper
                    advantage is taken of cool days. These caravans do not travel fast. The horses
                    must not be permitted even to trot: they are led slowly, and along the smoothest
                    roads. When there arc not combs in the hives sufficient to support the bees
                    during their journey, the owner takes the earliest opportunity of resting_them
                    wherever they can collect the materials for wax. The hives are taken out of the
                    cart, then set upon the ground, and after removing the cloth from over them, the
                    bees go forth in search of food. The first field they come to serves them as an
                    inn. In the evening, as soon as they are all returned, the hives are shut up;
                    and being placed again in the cart, they proceed on their journey. When the
                    caravan has arrived at the journey’s end, the hives are distributed in the
                    gardens, or in the fields adjacent to the houses of different peasants, who, for
                    a very small reward, undertake to look after them. Thus it is that, in such
                    spots as do not abound in flowers at all seasons, means are found to supply the
                    bees with food during the whole year.</p>
                <p>These instances of the great advantages which attend the shifting of bees in
                    search of pasture afford an excellent lesson to many places in this kingdom:
                    they direct particularly the inhabitants of the rich vales, where the harvest
                    for bees ends early, to remove their stocks to places which abound in heath;
                    this plant continuing in bloom during a considerable part of autumn, and
                    yielding great abundance of food to bees. Persons in the neighbourhood of hills
                    and mountains will save the bees a great deal of labour, by also taking the
                    advantage of shifting their places of abode.</p>
                <p>The degree of cold which bees can endure has not been ascertained, though it is
                    no doubt considerable. They survive the winter in many cold parts of Russia, in
                    hollow trees, without any attention being paid to them; and their hives are
                    frequently made of the bark of trees, which does not afford a very complete
                    protection from the effects of frost. Many hives which are thought to die of
                    cold in winter die in reality of famine, when a rainy summer and cold autumn
                    have prevented their laying in a sufficient store of provisions. The hives
                    should therefore be carefully examined in the after-part of the season, and the
                    amount of food ascertained. Mr White judiciously observes, that bees which stand
                    on the north side of a building whose height intercepts the sun’s beams all the
                    winter will waste less of their provisions than others which stand in the sun;
                    for, coming forth seldom, they eat little and yet are as forward in the spring
                    to work and swarm as those which had twice as much honey left with them the
                    preceding autumn. The owner ought, however, to examine their condition in the
                    course of the winter, and if he finds that, instead of being clustered between
                    the combs, numbers have fallen to the bottom of the hive, it should immediately
                    be shifted to a warmer place.</p>
                <p>In regard to the destruction of bees, it has been observed that no true lover of
                    these industrious insects ever lighted the fatal match without concern. One of
                    the easiest and most simple methods of obtaining possession of a portion of
                    their store is the following: Uncover the hole in the upper centre of a
                    flat-topped straw hive or box, and place a glass vessel over it in such a way
                    that no bee can get either in or out except by the ordinary opening of the lower
                    hive. The glass hive must be covered with an empty hive or with a cloth, that
                    too much light may not prevent the bees from working. As soon as they have
                    filled the straw hive or box, they will begin to work up into the glass hive. Mr
                    Thorley, junior, informs us, that he himself has had one of these glass hives
                    filled by the bees in thirty days in a fine season; and that it contained 38
                    pounds of fine honey. When the glass is completely filled, slide a tin plate
                    between it and the hive or box, so as to cover the passage, and in half an hour
                    the glass may be taken off with safety. What few bees remain in it will readily
                    go to their companions. He has added a glass window to his straw hives, in order
                    to see what progress bees make; which is of some importance, especially if one
                    hive is to be taken away whilst the season still continues favourable for their
                    collecting honey; for when the combs are filled with honey, the cells are scaled
                    up, and the bees forsake them and reside mostly in the hive in which their works
                    are chiefly carried on. Observing also that the bees were apt to extend their
                    combs through the passage of communication in the upper hive, whether glass or
                    other, which rendered it necessary to divide the comb when the upper hive was
                    taken away, he now puts in that passage a wire screen or netting, the meshes of
                    which are large enough for a loaded bee to go easily through them. This prevents
                    the joining of the combs from one box to the other, and consequently obviates
                    the necessity of cutting them, and of spilling some of the honey, which running
                    down among a crowd of bees, used before to incommode them much, it being
                    difficult for them to disencumber their wings.</p>
                <p>We shall conclude by observing, that the honey-bee <hi rend="italic">(apis
                    mellifica)</hi> is supposed to be of Asiatic origin. They were imported from
                    Europe to America, where they are now found wild in great numbers, and ata vast
                    distance from human habitations. (<hi rend="smallcaps">T.</hi>)</p>
