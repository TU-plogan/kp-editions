                <p><label type="entry">BLACK</label>, Dr <hi rend="smallcaps">Joseph,</hi>
                    distinguished for his discoveries in chemistry, was born in France, on the banks
                    of the Garonne, in the year 1728. His father was a native of Belfast, but
                    descended from a Scottish family which had been some time settled there. Mr
                    Black, the father, was engaged in the wine trade; and for the purpose of
                    carrying it on, he resided chiefly at Bordeaux.</p>
                <p>He is represented as a man of extensive information, of candid and liberal
                    sentiments, and of amiable manners; but particularly distinguished by the
                    strength of his attachments, and the warmth of his heart. These amiable and
                    estimable qualities in the character of Mr Black attracted the attention, and
                    procured the friendship and intimacy, of the discerning and benevolent
                    Montesquieu, who was one of the presidents of the court of justice in the
                    province while Mr Black resided at Bordeaux. Letters and fragments of
                    correspondence between the president and Mr Black are still preserved in the
                    family, as precious relics and memorials of the intercourse, honourable to both,
                    which subsisted between that great man and their ancestor.</p>
                <p>Some time before Mr Black retired ft om business, he sent his son Joseph, then in
                    his twelfth year, to Belfast, on account of his education; and having completed
                    the usual course of instruction in a grammar school, he was sent to the
                    university of Glasgow in the year 1746. During the time he studied at that
                    seminary, his attention seems to have been principally directed to physical
                    science; and he became a favourite pupil of Dr Dick, then professor of natural
                    philosophy. When Dr Black had finished the ordinary^ course of general study at
                    the university, he made choice of the profession of medicine; and he directed
                    his views to those pursuits and studies which were necessary to qualify him for
                    that profession.</p>
                <p>About this time Dr Cullen was appointed to the lectureship of chemistry in the
                    university of Glasgow. Hitherto the science had only been treated as a curious,
                    and in some respects a useful art. This great man, conscious of his own
                    strength, and taking a wide and comprehensive view, saw the unoccupied field of
                    philosophical chemistry expanded before him. He was satisfied that the science
                    was susceptible of very great improvement by means of liberal inquiry and
                    rational investigation. He was therefore determined to enter the unbeaten path,
                    and to conduct his followers to those unexplored regions which are included in
                    the wide range of this comprehensive and attractive science. While these views
                    were opening in his mind, Black became the pupil of Dr Cul <hi
                    rend="superscript"> len</hi>; and it was perhaps to this fortunate circumstance
                    that he was indebted for the foundation of his future reputation as a
                    philosopher and a chemist. The liberal and extensive views of Cullen happily
                    accorded with the-enlarged habits of thought which the young philosopher had
                    previously acquired. Dr Cullen took a deep interest in the progress of his
                    students. He delighted in encouraging and aiding their efforts; and, therefore,
                    perceiving the bias of Black’s pursuits, soon attached him to himself. By the
                    intercourse and intimacy which followed, Black was led into the same train of
                    thought, and conducted into the same course of studies; he was received into a
                    closer connection, and became a most valuable assistant in all Dr Cullen’s
                    chemical operations. The experiments of Black were frequently adduced to prove
                    facts which were stated in the lecture, and they were considered as
                    unexceptionable authority. Thus commenced a mutual confidence and friendship,
                    which was highly honourable to both, and was never afterwards mentioned by Dr
                    Black but with grat’tude and respect.</p>
                <p>In the year 1751, Dr Black went to Edinburgh to complete the course of his
                    medical studies. There he resided in the house of his cousin-german, Mr Russell,
                    professor of natural philosophy in that university, a gentleman of enlarged
                    views and liberal sentiments, whose conversation and studies must have been both
                    agreeable and profitable to his young friend.</p>
                <p>At this time the mode of action of lithontriptic medicines, but particularly
                    lime-water, in alleviating the pains of stone and gravel, divided the opinions
                    of professors and practitioners. This subject became extremely interesting both
                    to the physician and chemist. And as it is usual for the students to enter
                    warmly into those discussions which give rise to much difference of opinion
                    among their teachers, this subject, being quite suited to his taste,
                    particularly attracted and interested the attention of Dr Black, who was then
                    one of Dr Cullen’s most zealous and intelligent pupils. It appears from some of
                    his memorandums, that he at first held the opinion that the causticity of
                    aìkalies was owing to the igneous matter which they derived from quicklime. But
                    having prosecuted his experiments on magnesia, this grand secret of nature was
                    laid open to his view, and he was led to conclude that the acrimony of these
                    substances was not owing to their combination with igneous particles; that it
                    formed their peculiar property; and that they lost this property and became mild
                    by combining with a certain portion of air, to which he gave the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">fixed air,</hi> because it was fixed or became solid in the
                    substances into the composition of which it entered.</p>
                <p>This grand discovery, which marks one of the most important eras of chemical
                    science, formed the subject of his inaugural dissertation, published at the time
                    when he was admitted to his medical degree in the university of Edinburgh. He
                    had not availed himself of the time he had studied at Glasgow, but took the
                    whole course prescribed by the rules of the university. This delay, it has been
                    supposed, may have been owing to the investigation of the subject in which he
                    had engaged not having been completed; which determined him to proceed with
                    caution till he had established h &gt; doctrine by a train of decisive
                    experiments.</p>
                <p>About the time that Dr Black took his medical degree, Dr Cullen was removed to
                    Edinburgh, which created a vacancy in the chemical chair at Glasgow. While he
                    remained at that university, Dr Black had been a diligent and attentive student;
                    and the discovery published in his inaugural essay had added much to his
                    reputation. He was therefore looked up to as a person amply qualified to fill
                    the vacant chair; and accordingly', in the year 1756, he was appointed professor
                    of anatomy and lecturer on chemistry in the university of Glasgow. And it was
                    perhaps fortunate for himself, fortunate for the public and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193197843" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7843-0656"/>for science, that a situation
                    so favourable presented itself; a situation which allowed him full time to
                    dedicate his talents to the cultivation of chemistry, which had now become his
                    favourite science.</p>
                <p>Along with the lectureship on chemistry, Dr Black’s first appointment in the
                    university of Glasgow was to the professorship of anatomy. But the latter branch
                    of medical study was either not so suitable to his taste, or he did not consider
                    himself so well qualified to be useful in it; for, soon after, arrangements were
                    made with the professor of medicine, by which the professors exchanged
                    departments, Dr Black undertaking that of the institutes and practice of
                    medicine.</p>
                <p>At this time his lectures on medicine formed his chief occupation; while the
                    perspicuity and simplicity, the caution and moderation, which lie discovered in
                    the doctrines which he delivered, gave great satisfaction. The time and
                    attention which were occupied in these lectures, and in the medical practice in
                    some measure necessarily connected with his situation, are supposed by some to
                    have been the principal cause of Dr Black’s having suddenly stopped short in
                    that brilliant career on which he had at first so successfully entered. It is
                    more probable, however, that the calm and unambitious temper which seems to have
                    formed a striking feature of his character, and which a less friendly hand than
                    his learned biographer might have set down as nearly allied to indolence,
                    checked the ardour and perseverance which were necessary to excite and carry him
                    forward in the path of research and discovery. Whatever may have been the cause,
                    it is to be regretted that Dr Black, so conspicuous for his patient, judicious,
                    and elegant mode of investigation, and so distinguished for the simplicity,
                    perspicuity, and precision of his reasonings and deductions, should have
                    contributed so little in rearing the noble superstructure of chemical science,
                    the foundation of which he had been the means of establishing on a firm and
                    solid basis.</p>
                <p>The theory of the nature of quicklime, and the cause of its causticity, soon
                    became known to the German chemists, and from them it met with strong
                    opposition. Various mysterious doctrines at this time prevailed in the German
                    schools concerning the peculiar nature of fire; and as the notions there
                    entertained of the causticity of alkaline substances involved some of these
                    doctrines, a great many objections were started to a theory which threatened to
                    overthrow long established and favourite opinions. The most formidable opponent
                    of the new theory was Professor Meyer of Osnaburg. All the phenomena of the
                    causticity and mildness of lime and alkali were, acc'ording to his explanation,
                    to be accounted for by the action of a substance of a peculiar nature, to which
                    he gave the name of <hi rend="italic">acidum pingue.</hi> This substance, which
                    was supposed to be formed in the lime during calcination, consisted of an
                    igneous matter in a certain state of combination with other substances. It is a
                    matter of some surprise that Dr Black should have experienced any uneasiness on
                    account of the opposition made to this discovery on mere hypothesis unsupported
                    by facts or even by plausible arguments, when his own doctrine had been fully
                    and irrefragably established by the test of decisive experiment. Nor is it less
                    surprising that, in the course of his lectures for several years, he should have
                    taken great pains in refuting the arguments and in combating the objections of
                    Meyer.</p>
                <p>Dr Black’s reception at the university of Glasgow was highly flattering and
                    encouraging. As a student he had not only done himself much credit by his
                    successful progress in the different pursuits in which he was engaged, but he
                    had also during his residence there conciliated, in a high degree, the
                    attachment and affection of the professors. ∖∖ hen he returned as a professor,
                    he immediately became connected in the strictest friendship with Dr Adam Smith,
                    then professor of moral philosophy in that university; and the friendship thus
                    commenced grew stronger and stronger, and was never interrupted throughout the
                    whole of their lives. A simplicity and sensibility, an incorruptible integrity,
                    the strictest delicacy, and singular correctness of manners, marked the
                    character of each of these philosophers, and firmly bound them together in the
                    closest union.</p>
                <p>At Glasgow Dr Black soon acquired great reputation as a professor, and became a
                    favourite physician in that large and active city. His engaging countenance, his
                    agreeable and attractive manners, free from all studied endeavours to please,
                    and the kind concern he took in the cases intrusted to his care, made him a most
                    welcome visitor in every family.</p>
                <p>It was between the years 1759 and 1763 that he brought to maturity his
                    speculations concerning heat, which had occupied his attention at intervals,
                    from the very first dawn of his philosophical investigations. His discoveries in
                    this department of science were by far the most important of all that he made,
                    and perhaps indeed among the most valuable which appeared during the busy period
                    of the eighteenth century. To enter fully into the nature of his investigations
                    would be improper in this place; but the sum of them all was usually expressed
                    by him in the following propositions.</p>
                <p>When a solid body is converted into a fluid, there enters into it and unites with
                    it a quantity of heat, the presence of which is not indicated by the
                    thermometer; and this combination is the cause of the fluidity which the body
                    assumes. On the other hand, when a fluid body is converted into a solid, a
                    quantity of heat separates from it, the presence of which was not formerly
                    indicated by the thermometer; and this separation is the cause of the solid form
                    which the fluid assumes.</p>
                <p>When a liquid body is raised to the boiling temperature, by the continued and
                    copious application of heat, its particles suddenly attract to themselves a
                    great quantity of heat; and by this combination their mutual relationis so
                    changed that they no longer attract each other, but are converted into an
                    elastic fluid like air. On the other hand, when these elastic fluids, either by
                    condensation or by the application of cold bodies, are reconverted into liquids,
                    they give out a vast quantity of heat, the presence of which was not formerly
                    indicated by the thermometer.</p>
                <p>Thus water, when converted into ice, gives out 140° of heat; ice, when converted
                    into water, absorbs 140° of heat; and water, when converted into steam, absorbs
                    about 1000° of heat, without becoming sensibly hotter than 212°. Philosophers
                    had long been accustomed to consider the thermometer as the surest method of
                    detecting heat in bodies; yet this instrument gives no indication of the 140° of
                    heat which enter into air when it is converted into water, nor of the 1000°
                    which combine with water when it is converted into steam. Dr Black, therefore,
                    said that the heat is concealed <hi rend="italic">(latet)</hi> in the water and
                    steam; and he briefly expressed this fact by calling the heat in that case <hi
                    rend="italic">latent heat.</hi></p>
                <p>Dr Black having established this discovery by simple and decisive experiments,
                    drew up an account of the whole investigation, and read it to a literary society
                    which met every Friday in the faculty-room of the college, consisting of the
                    members of the university, and several gentlemen of the city who had a relish
                    for philosophy and literature. This was done on the 23d of April 1762, as
                    appears by the registers. The doctrine in question was immediately applied by
                    its author to the explanation <hi rend="italic">of ý</hi> vast number of natural
                    phenomena; and in his expe <hi rend="superscript"> ri</hi> '</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197856" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7856-0657"/>
                <p>mental investigations lie was greatly assisted by his two celebrated pupils, Mr
                    Watt and Dr Irvine.</p>
                <p>As Dr Black never published an account of his doctrine of latent heat, although
                    he detailed it every year subsequent to 1762 in his lectures, which were
                    frequented by men of science from all parts of Europe, it became known only
                    through that channel; and this gave an opportunity to others to pilfer it from
                    him piece-meal. Dr Crawford’s ideas respecting the capacity of bodies for heat
                    were originally derived from Dr Black, who first pointed out the method of
                    investigating that subject.</p>
                <p>The investigations of Lavoisier and Laplace concerning beat, published many years
                    after, were obviously borrowed from Dr Black, and indeed consisted in the
                    repetition of the very experiments which he had suggested. Yet these
                    philosophers never mention Dr Black at all; every thing in their dissertation
                    assumes the air of entire originality; and indeed they appear to have been at
                    great pains to prevent the opinions and discoveries of Dr Black from being known
                    among their countrymen. But perhaps the most extraordinary proceeding was that
                    of Μ. Deluc. This philosopher had expressed his admiration of Dr Black’s theory
                    of latent heat, and had offered to become his editor. Dr Black, after much
                    entreaty, at last consented, and the proper informatión was in consequence
                    communicated to M. Deluc. At last the <hi rend="italic">Idée sur la
                    Météorologie</hi> of that philosopher appeared, in 1788. But great was the
                    astonishment of Dr Black and his friends when they found the doctrine claimed by
                    Deluc as his own, and an expression of satisfaction at the knowledge which he
                    had acquired of Dr Black’s coincidence with him in opinion. Μ. Deluc has, in his
                    own vindication, published an answer to this charge. See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edinburgh Review,</hi> No. 12, 1805.</p>
                <p>Dr Black continued in the university of Glasgow from 1756 to 1766. In 1766 Dr
                    Cullen was appointed professor of medicine in the university of Edinburgh, and
                    thus a vacancy was produced in the chemical chair of that university. Dr Black
                    was with universal consent appointed his successor; and in the new scene on
                    which he entered his talents became more conspicuously and more extensively
                    useful. But whilst he could not fail to be highly gratified by the great
                    concourse of pupils which the high reputation of the medical school of Edinburgh
                    attracted to his lectures, his mind was forcibly impressed with the importance
                    of his duties as a teacher. This had an effect which, perhaps, was on the whole
                    rather unfortunate. He directed his attention exclusively to his lectures, and
                    his object was to make them so plain as to be on a level with the capacity of
                    the most illiterate of his hearers. The improvement of the science seems to have
                    been altogether abandoned by him. And never did any man succeed more completely.
                    His pupils were not only instructed, but delighted. Many became his pupils
                    merely in order to be pleased; and this contributed greatly to extend the
                    knowledge of chemistry. It became in Edinburgh a fashionable part of the
                    accomplishment of a gentleman.</p>
                <p>Perhaps also the delicacy of his constitution precluded him from exertion; the
                    slightest cold, the most trifling approach to repletion, immediately affected
                    his chest, occasioned feverishness, and, if continued for two or three days,
                    brought on a spitting of blood. Nothing restored him but relaxation of thought,
                    and gentle exercise. The sedentary life to which study confined him was
                    manifestly hurtful, and he never allowed himself to indulge in intense thinking,
                    without finding these complaints sensibly increased.</p>
                <p>So completely trammelled was he in this respect, that although his friends saw
                    others disingenuous enough to avail themselves of the novelties announced by Dr
                    Black <hi rend="superscript"> ln</hi> his lectures, and therefore repeatedly
                    urged him to publish an account of what he had done, this remained
                    unaccomplished to the last. Dr Black often began the task, but was so nice in
                    his notions of the manner in which it should be executed, that the pains he took
                    in forming a plan of the work never failed to affect his health, and oblige him
                    to desist. Indeed he peculiarly disliked appearing as an author. His inaugural
                    dissertation was the work of duty. His <hi rend="italic">Experiments on
                    Magnesia, Quicklime, and other Alkaline Substances,</hi> was necessary to put
                    what he had indicated in his inaugural dissertations on a proper foundation. His
                    <hi rend="italic">Observations on the more ready Freezing of Water that has been
                    Boiled,</hi> published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1774, was also
                    called for; and his <hi rend="italic">Analysis of the Waters of some Boiling
                    Springs in Iceland,</hi> made at the request of his friend T. I. Stanley, Esq.
                    was read to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and published by the council. And
                    these are the only works of his which appeared in print during his lifetime.</p>
                <p>The aspect of Dr Black was comely and interesting. His countenance exhibited that
                    pleasing expression of inward satisfaction, which, by putting the beholder at
                    his ease, almost never fails to please. His manner was wholly unaffected and
                    graceful. He was affable, and readily entered into conversation, whether serious
                    or trivial. He was a stranger to none of the elegant accomplishments of life. He
                    had a fine musical ear, with a voice which obeyed it in the most perfect manner;
                    for he sung, and performed on the flute, with great taste and feeling, and could
                    execute a plain air at sight, which many instrumental performers cannot do.
                    Without having studied drawing, he had acquired considerable power of expression
                    with his pencil, and seemed in this respect to have the talents of an historical
                    painter. Figure indeed of every kind attracted his attention; even a retort, or
                    a crucible, was to his eye an example of beauty or deformity.</p>
                <p>He had the strongest claim to the appellation of a man of propriety and
                    correctness. Fie did every thing in its proper season, and he always seemed to
                    have leisure in store. He loved society, and felt himself beloved in it; and,
                    throughout his whole life, he never lost a friend, except by the stroke of
                    death.</p>
                <p>The only apprehension he entertained was that of longcontinued sickness, less,
                    perhaps, from any selfish feeling, than from the consideration of the trouble
                    and distress which it would occasion to attending friends; and never was this
                    generous wish more completely gratified. On the 26th of November 1799, and in
                    the seventy-first year of his age, he expired without any convulsion, shock, or
                    stupor, to announce or retard the approach of death. Being at table with his
                    usual fare, some bread, a few prunes, and a measured quantity of milk diluted
                    with water, and having the cup in his hand when the last stroke of the pulse was
                    given, he set it down on his knees, which were joined together, and kept it
                    steady with his hand in the manner of a person perfectly at his ease; and in
                    this attitude he expired without a drop being spilt, or a feature in his
                    countenance changed, as if an experiment had been required to show to his
                    friends the facility with which he departed. His servant opened the door to tell
                    him that some one had left his name; but getting no answer, stepped about
                    half-way towards him, and seeing him sitting in so easy a posture, supporting
                    his basin of milk with one hand, he thought that he had dropt asleep, which
                    sometimes happened after his meals. He went back and shut the door; but before
                    he went down stairs, some anxiety which he could not account for made him return
                    and look again at his master. Even then he was satisfied after coming pretty
                    near, and turned to go away; but returning a second time, and going close up, he
                    found his master a corpse. Sleep, says the poet, is the kinsman of death. Dr
                    Black found the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197869" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7869-0658"
                    />relationship very close indeed, and slept (we had almost said <hi
                    rend="italic">slipt’)</hi> away from time to eternity, by a transition so easy
                    as to be imperceptible even to the eye of affection.</p>

                    blacken these establishments, and thus hasten their dissolution.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">BLACK-Mail,</hi> a certain rate of money, corn, cattle, or
                    other valuable, anciently paid by the inhabitants of towns in Westmoreland,
                    Cumberland, Northumberland, and Durham, to divers persons on or near the
                    borders, being men of name, and allied with others in those parts, known to be
                    great robbers and plunderers, in order to be by them freed and protected from
                    pillage. This composition with thieves, or rather the protectors and supporters
                    of thieves, was strictly prohibited by the 43 Elizabeth, c. 13, and in point of
                    fact seems to have been early checked in the English border counties. But, in
                    the Highlands of Scotland, which were brought under the dominion of the law at a
                    much later period, the exaction of black-mail from the lowland borderers
                    continued in spite of every effort that could be made to put it down, till after
                    the quelling of the insurrection in 1745.</p>
                <p>Black-mail is defined by Dr Jamieson “a tax or contribution paid by heritors or
                    tenants, for the security of their property, to those freebooters who were wont
                    to make inroads on estates, destroying the corns, or driving away the cattle ;”
                    and such was the power of these freebooters, and so feeble was the arm of the
                    law, that this illegal contribution received, at one time, a kind of judicial
                    sanction. At all events, where the government could afford no protection against
                    the <hi rend="italic">liftings</hi> or <hi rend="italic">herschips</hi>
                    practised by the cearnachs and caterans, it would have been absurd to attempt,
                    and impossible to enforce, any prohibition against the prospective composition
                    of such felonies, which were of constant occurrence in the Highlands or on the
                    borders. Rob Roy Macgregor, one of the most noted of these freebooters, overawed
                    the country as late as the year 1744, and frequently robbed the Duke of
                    Montrose’s factor of the rents after they had been collected from the tenants,
                    and before they could be conveyed to his grace’s coffers. M ith regard to the
                    meaning of the word, Spelman thinks that this illegal imposition received the
                    name of blackmail from the poverty of those who were thus assessed, and as being
                    paid in <hi rend="italic">black</hi> money, not in silver; and Du Cange adopts
                    this idea with little variation, stating that while brass money is called <hi
                    rend="italic">blanque</hi> or <hi rend="italic">blanche maille,</hi> or white
                    money, by the French, the Saxons and English denominate it <hi rend="italic"
                    >black,</hi> in opposition to silver, which they account <hi rend="italic"
                    >white</hi> money. But the more probable opinion is, that the epithet <hi
                    rend="italic">black</hi> is here used in a moral sense, to indicate the
                    illegality or iniquity of the exaction. Wachter, however. defines “black-mail,”
                    <hi rend="italic">tributum pro redimenda vexa,</hi> deriving it from the German
