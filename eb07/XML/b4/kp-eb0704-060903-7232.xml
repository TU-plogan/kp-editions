                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">BEZA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Theodore</hi></label>, one of the
                    principal pillars of the reformed church, was born at Vezelai in Burgundy on the
                    24th June 1519. He was brought up by his uncle Nicholas Beza, counsellor of the
                    parliament of Paris, till the month of December 1528, when he was sent to study
                    at Orleans, and afterwards at Bourges, where, under the care of Melchior Wolmar,
                    he made extraordinary progress in learning, and imbibed the principles of
                    Calvinism. His uncle intended him for the bar; but the law not suiting his
                    disposition, he spent most of his time in reading the Greek and Latin authors,
                    and in composing verses. In 1539 he took his licentiate’s degree, and went to
                    Paris, where he fell into snares in his youth, and wrote some licentious things.
                    But sickness awakened him to a sense of his folly, and he determined to perform
                    a vow he had -formerly made of entering into the reformed church. With this
                    resolution he went to Geneva and made a public profession of the reformed
                    religion. In 1549 he accepted of the Greek professorship at Lausanne, where he
                    also read lectures in French on the New Testament to the refugees of both sexes
                    who dwelt in that city. Having settled at Geneva, he adhered to Calvin in the
                    strictest manner, and became in a little time his colleague in the church and in
                    the university. At the solicitation of some great men of the kingdom he was sent
                    to Nerac to convert the king of Navarre, and to confer with him upon affairs of
                    importance. This was when the Guises had got the authority, under the reign of
                    Francis II., to the prejudice of the princes of the blood. The king of Navarre
                    having testified, both by letters and deputies, that he desired Beza might
                    assist at the conference of Poissi, the senate of Geneva consented. The assembly
                    hearkened attentively to his harangue, till, speaking of the real presence, he
                    said, that the body of Jesus Christ was as distant from the bread and wine, as
                    the highest heaven is from the earth. This produced a murmur: some cried out,
                    “Blas-phemavit ;” and others got up to go away. Cardinal de Tournon, who sat in
                    the first place, desired the king and queen either to silence Beza, or to permit
                    him and his company to withdraw. The king did not stir, nor did any of the
                    princes; and leave was given him to proceed. Throughout the whole conference he
                    acquitted himself with great ability. He often preached before the queen of
                    Navarre, the prince of Condé, and in the suburbs of Paris. After <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193197245" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7245-0610"/>the massacre of Vassi, he was
                    deputed to the king to complain of this violence. The civil war followed soon
                    after, during which the prince of Condé kept Beza with him; and while the prince
                    was imprisoned, he lived with Admiral de Coligni, and did not return to Geneva
                    till after the peace of 1563. In 1571 he was chosen moderator of the national
                    synod of Rochelle, and in the year after assisted at that of Nismes; after which
                    he was present at the conferences of Montheliard, and at those of Berne. The
                    infirmities of age beginning to fall heavy upon him, he seldom spoke in public,
                    and at last left it off entirely in the beginning of the year 1600. However, in
                    1597, he wrote some animated verses against the Jesuits, on the occasion of a
                    report that was circulated of his death, and of his having before he died made
                    profession of the Romish faith. He lived till the 13th of October 1605, on which
                    day he expired. Beza was a man of extraordinary merit, and one who did great
                    service to the Protestant cause. This, however, exposed him to innumerable
                    slanders and calumnies; but he showed, both to the Catholics and Lutherans, that
                    he understood how to defend himself. He wrote, 1. A Translation of the New
                    Testament; 2. A Version of the Psalms into Latin verse; 3. A Treatise on the
                    Sacraments; 4. Some Sermons on the Passion of Jesus Christ and on Solomon’s
                    Song; 5. A Version of the Canticles, in lyric verse; 6. A French tragi-comedy,
                    entitled The Sacrifice of Abraham; and many other pieces.</p>
