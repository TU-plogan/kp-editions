                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">It</hi> was remarked in the preceding article, that the
                    decisive experiment by which Pascal established the reality of atmospheric
                    pressure, had likewise suggested to this ingenious philosopher the method of
                    determining the elevations of distant points on the surface of the globe. But
                    the first attempts were very rude, proceeding on the inaccurate supposition that
                    the lower mass of air is a fluid of uniform density. Different authors estimated
                    variously from eighty to ninety feet as the altitude, which corresponds to a
                    variation of the tenth part of an inch in the mercurial column. The Torricellian
                    tube or cane, as it was then called, was, on its first introduction to England,
                    carried accordingly to the tops of mountains, or conveyed to the bottom of pits
                    and mines, or even let down to great depths in the sea.</p>
                <p>Among those experimentalists who laboured most assiduously in the study and
                    application of the barometer in this part of the island, we may mention George
                    Sinclair. This ingenious person had been professor of philosophy in the
                    university of Glasgow, but seems to have conscientiously resigned his office
                    soon after the Restoration, rather than comply with that hated episcopacy which
                    the minions of Charles II. had forced upon the people of Scotland. He then
                    retired to the village of Tranent, not far from Edinburgh, and was employed as a
                    practical engineer, in tracing the levels of coal-pits, in directing the
                    machinery employed in the mines at Leadhills, and afterwards in the great
                    undertaking of conducting water from the heights of the Pentlands to supply the
                    northern metropolis. Though not a profound mathematician, he was skilled in
                    mechanics and hydrostatics, and possessed no small share of invention. Sinclair
                    is said to have been the first who applied to the mercurial tube the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">baroscope,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">indicator of weight;</hi> the
                    more definite appellation of <hi rend="italic">barometer,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">measurer of weight,</hi> not having been appropriated till many
                    years afterwards. During his excursions in 1668 and 1670, he employed that
                    instrument to measure the heights of Arthur’s Seat, Leadhills, and Tinto, above
                    the adjacent plains. He followed the original mode of using a tube sealed at the
                    top, with a paper scale pasted against the side, which he carried to the top of
                    the mountain, where he filled it with mercury; and, inverting it in a basin, he
                    noted the altitude of the suspended column, and repeated the same experiment
                    below; a very rude method, certainly, but no better was practised in England
                    during the succeeding thirty years.</p>
                <p>In a small scarce tract, printed in 1688, and bearing the quaint title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Proteus bound with Chains,</hi> Sinclair gives some judicious
                    remarks on the variations of the barometer, considered as a weather-glass, and
                    delivers very sound opinions, on the whole, respecting the causes of the chief
                    meteorological phenomena. In a postscript to that piece, he proposes a most
                    efficient and ingenious method of weighing up wrecks from the bottom of the sea.
                    It consisted in employing two large arks, or square wooden boxes, fastened to
                    the sides of the ship, and charged with air carried down to them by a succession
                    of inverted casks, open at the lower end. An arc of a cubical shape, and twenty
                    feet in every dimension, the smallest which he mentions, would, as he computes,
                    have a buoyancy equivalent to 448,000 pounds Troy. It is remarkable that the
                    celebrated Mr Watt always employed this very mode, using a large gazometer,
                    floating in a pond dug in the court of his manufactory, and charged gradually by
                    the action of bellows, for raising the ponderous engines constructed at Soho,
                    and lifting them over his walls into the boats, which were stationed to receive
                    them in the adjacent canal.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Sinclair was author of a well-known little book entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Satan’s Invisible World Displayed,</hi> which, at a former period, was sold at
                    all the public fairs in the country, and devoured with eagerness and dismay by
                    the Scottish peasantry. In a quarto volume, <hi rend="italic">on Hydrostatics,
                    and the Working of Coal-mines,</hi> printed in Holland, and published by
                    subscription in 1C72, he digressed so widely from his subject as to insert <hi
                    rend="italic">A True Relation of the Witches of Gleniuce.</hi> But this was the
                    folly of the age, from which several of the most learned men had not been able
                    to escape. It is painful to observe, that James Gregory, the inventor of the
                    reflecting telescope, who, although endowed with talents of the highest order,
                    appears to have had a keen temper, and to have imbibed an hereditary attachment
                    to royalism and episcopacy, should have stooped to attack an unoffending and
                    less fortunate rival. He wrote a little tract against Sinclair’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Hydrostatics,</hi> with the title of the Arŕ <hi rend="italic">of
                    Weighing Vanity,</hi> and under the thin disguise of Patrick Mather, archbeadle
                    to the university of St Andrew’s. It is a piece full of low scurrility, and
                    memorable only for a very short Latin paper appended to it, containing the
                    series first given to represent the motion of a pendulum in a circular arc. In
                    the British Museum, there is a letter of Gregory to Collins, the secretary of
                    the Royal Society, boasting of his project, and soliciting information with
                    which to overwhelm the poor author. But with all his eagerness to hunt down
                    Sinclair, he never touches on the strange episode of the Witches of Glenluce.
                    What a picture of times approaching so near to our own! Sinclair was restored to
                    his chair at the Revolution, and lived a few years longer. He answered Gregory’s
                    attack in the same coarse style, charging him with total want of skill in the
                    use of astronomical instruments, though by help of subscriptions he had erected
                    a sort of observatory at St Andrew’s. The manuscript of this reply is preserved
                    in the College Library of Glasgow.</p></note></p>
                <p>In all the computations hitherto made from different altitudes of the barometer,
                    the air was considered as a uniform fluid; no regard being had to the gradual
                    diminution of density which must evidently take place in ascending the
                    atmosphere. To estimate the effect of that gradation, it became requisite
                    previously to determine the actual relation subsisting between the density of
                    the fluid and its elasticity. This was first ascertained in England by Townley,
                    who inferred, from some experiments of Boyle, that the elastic force which the
                    air exerts is exactly proportional to its density. A similar conclusion was
                    about the same time drawn by Mariotte, a French philosopher, from a still better
                    series of experiments. Following out this very simple law, he thought of
                    computing heights from barometrical observations, by the rules usually employed
                    in constructing tables of logarithms; and had, therefore, obtained some glimpse,
                    no doubt by a sort of conjectural process, of the remarkable result, that the
                    density of the atmosphere decreases in a geometrical progression, corresponding
                    to the elevations taken after an arithmetical one. But seemingly not aware of
                    the importance of the principle at which lie was pointing, Mariotte immediately
                    deserted it; and calculating from a repeated bisection of the column of air
                    between the two stations into successive horizontal strata, he contented himself
                    with interpolating the densities according to a harmonic division, which he next
                    abandoned for the simplicity of a series with equal differences. This able
                    experimenter hence only sketched out a mode of investigating the problem of
                    barometrical measurements, without arriving at any very definite or consistent
                    rule of solution.</p>

                <p>In 1686 that ingenious and active philosopher Dr Hal-resumed the subject, and
                    discovered the law that connects the elevation of the atmosphere with its
                    density; of which he gave a clear demonstration, derived from the well-known
                    properties of the hyperbola referred to its asymptotes.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It appears, however, that he was anticipated
                    by Huygens, who had found, as early as the year 1662, that the altitudes of
                    successive strata of air being taken in arithmetical progression, the
                    corresponding densities will form a geometrical series. This beautiful
                    proposition he never published, indeed, but left it recorded upon one of the
                    blank leaves of a Dutch almanac, containing various other speculations, and now
                    preserved in the library of the university of Leyden.</p></note> Since the
                    height of the mercury indicates the pressure, and consequently the elasticity of
                    the external <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> ir it must be proportioned likewise to
                    the density. Wherefore the breadth of a given mass of air, or the thickness of a
                    stratum which corresponds to a certain portion of the mercurial column, will be
                    inversely as this altitude. Let 0 be the centre of a rectangular hyperbola, of
                    which OA and OP are the asymptotes; and conceive the distances OA and OB to
                    represent the heights of the mercury at two stations. The perpendiculars AC and
                    BD, which are reciprocally as OA and OB, must hence express the relative
                    thickness of strata corresponding to equal portions of the barometric scale.
                    Divide AB into a multitude of equal segments, and erect the perpendiculars EM,
                    FL, GK, and III. The intercluded spaces, from AC to BD, will denote the
                    successive thickness of the series of strata into which the whole mass of air
                    between the two stations is subdivided. Consequently the aggregate or
                    mixtilineal space DBAC, which is proportional to the logarithm of the ratio of
                    OB to OA, will express the difference of atmospheric elevation when the
                    mercurial column mounts from B to A. Taking equal ascents, therefore, in the
                    atmosphere, the corresponding densities must, from the property of the
                    hyperbola, form a decreasing geometrical series.</p>
                <p>To apply this elegant theorem, Dr Halley availed himself of the best experiments
                    which had been performed to determine the relative densities of air, water, and
                    mercury. In different trials made near the earth’s surface, it was found, when
                    the barometer stood at 29J inches, that the air is 840, 852, or even 860 times
                    lighter than water. Employing round numbers, therefore, and assuming the
                    specific gravity of mercury to be 131, he reckoned 800 × 13-į X 30 = 10,800
                    inches, or 90 feet, as the altitude of an atmospheric column which, near the
                    level of the sea, would exert a pressure equivalent to that of an inch of
                    mercury. For the co-efficient, which answers to the actual constitution of the
                    atmosphere, Halley should have taken the thirtieth part of ∙4342945, the modulus
                    of the common system of logarithms, or ∙0144748. But he proceeded less directly,
                    having satisfied himself with taking the arithmetical mean between the
                    differences of the logarithms of 29 and 30, and of those of 30 and 31; a
                    compensation of errors which gives ∙0144765, hardly deviating from the former.
                    Hence he gave this simple analogy for computing the heights of mountains by the
                    barometer: <hi rend="italic">As the constant number</hi> Ό144765 <hi
                    rend="italic">is to the difference between the logarithms of the barometric
                    columns at the two stations, so is</hi> 900 <hi rend="italic">feet to the
                    elevation required.</hi> The result of this operation is evidently the same as
                    if the logarithmic difference had been multiplied by the number 62170; a very
                    tolerable approximation at all seasons for a northern climate, and quite
                    accurate, indeed, if the mass of intervening air had a medium temperature of 46°
                    by Fahrenheit’s scale. Dr Halley supposed that the observations themselves
                    might, from the influence of heat, differ about a fifteenth part between summer
                    and winter. But the thermometer was still so imperfect an instrument, that it
                    could not be applied with confidence in correcting such variations.</p>
                <p>The principle which Halley thus investigated might be derived from a simpler
                    process. Conceive the atmosphere to be divided into a multitude of equally thin
                    horizontal layers, it is evident that each successive stratum would, to the
                    pressure of the superincumbent stratum, add its own weight, which being as its
                    density or elasticity, is therefore proportioned to the collective pressure;
                    and, consequently, those densities must continually increase in going downwards,
                    exactly in the same way, and after a like progression, as money accumulates at
                    compound interest, where a constant portion of the aggregate fund is regularly
                    joined to the capital.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>To illustrate still further this comparison; if we reckon the mean altitude
                    of a uniform atmosphere to be 26000 feet, it will follow that, for every descent
                    of 26 feet, the density of the air will increase one thousandth <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> part. This rate of progression corresponds precisely
                    with the weekly improvement of money invested at 5 per cent, per annum,
                    supposing, for the sake of simplicity, the year to contain only 50 weeks. Since
                    money at the statute interest doubles in 14 ⅛ years, so the air has its
                    dilatation doubled at the height20 X 50 X 14∙2 or 18466 feet, answering to three
                    miles and a half.</p></note> Such, in fact, is the distinguishing character of a
                    geometrical progression, that the increase or decrease of each succeeding term
                    is always proportional to the term itself. The logarithmic curve is hence the
                    best adapted for exhibiting the relations which connect the densities with the
                    elevations in the atmosphere; the axis of the curve expressing the elevation,
                    while each ordinate represents the corresponding density of the stratum of air.
                    It being a fundamental property of the logarithmic curve, that every subtangent
                    applied to it has the same length, the exact determination of this in the case
                    of our atmosphere is the only thing wanted for the final solution of the general
                    problem.</p>
                <p>Let AB, the absciss of a logarithmic curve, represent a line descending
                    perpendicular through the atmosphere; the ordinates AC and BD will indicate the
                    elasticity of the strata at A and B, and consequently, abating the influence of
                    temperature, their densities. Draw the tangent DT, and form the elemental
                    triangle <hi rend="italic">Ðdò</hi>; then BD: BT:: <hi rend="italic">od</hi>:
                    ĉD, or inversely BD: <hi rend="italic">od:</hi>: BT: &lt;5D. But the thickness
                    AD of each accrescent stratum being assumed to be the same, and the subtangent
                    being constant, from the nature of the curve; the ratio of BT to δD is given;
                    therefore the ratio of BD to <hi rend="italic">od</hi> is likewise given, or the
                    increment of the density in the successive strata is proportional to <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193194489" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4489-0398"/> the density
                    itself, the leading property of air. The pressure of the thin stratum at B is
                    represented by BD&lt;Z∕&gt;, which is equal to the rectangle under BT and <hi
                    rend="italic">od.</hi> Hence, drawing the parallel DE, the collective area ABDC,
                    which represents the weight of the atmosphere between the altitudes A and B, is
                    equal to the rectangle under the subtangent and EC. But AB expresses the
                    difference of the logarithms of the ordinates AC and BD, or the densities at A
                    and B; and consequently this difference multiplied by the length of BT will
                    indicate AB. In relation to our atmosphere at the point of congelation, the
                    numerical value of the subtangent is about 26,000 feet, which is very nearly the
                    product of 60,000 into the <hi rend="italic">'modulus</hi> of the ordinary
                    logarithms.</p>
                <p>Eleven years after Dr Halley had given his rule for barometrical measurements,
                    this philosopher had an opportunity of applying it to discover the height of
                    Snowdon in North Wales. He found that the barometer which stood at 29∙9 inches
                    on the sea-shore near Caernarvon, fell a few hours after, when planted on the
                    summit of the mountain, to 26∙1 inches, the altitude having been ascertained
                    previously, by a trigonometrical observation, to be 1240 yards.</p>
                <p>The year 1687 is memorable as being the date of the first publication of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Principia,</hi> which was drawn up chiefly at the urgent request
                    of Halley, from disjointed materials that had lain a considerable time in the
                    author’s closet. In that immortal work, Newton resumed the problem of the
                    gradation of atmospheric density, and solved it in that general way which suited
                    his penetrating genius. He demonstrated that, supposing the particles of air,
                    like other bodies, to have their weight or gravitating tendency diminished as
                    the squares of their distances from the centre of the earth, if those distances
                    be taken in harmonic progression, the corresponding densities of the atmosphere
                    will form a geometrical one. But since the diminution of attraction at the
                    greatest height we are able to reach amounts only to the two thousandth part of
                    the whole, this difference is too minute to be adopted in practice; and the
                    simpler law first established by the sagacity of Halley may be deemed
                    sufficiently accurate for every real purpose.</p>
                <p>Newton has given a sort of geometrical solution of the problem. But a more
                    precise, and, in this case, a clearer investigation, is obtained by help of the
                    symbols of the integral calculus. Let <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and V express the
                    altitudes of two strata of atmosphere, <hi rend="italic">y</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">y’</hi> the corresponding densities, <hi rend="italic">r</hi> the
                    radius of the earth; and suppose further, that <hi rend="italic">e</hi>
                    represents the altitude of the equiponderant column which measures the
                    elasticity of the air. Since the density of the air depends on the incumbent
                    pressure, its decrement must evidently be proportional to the weight of each
                    superadded minute stratum, or to the density of this stratum multiplied into its
                    thickness and power of gravitation. Whence — <hi rend="italic">edy = ydx

                <p>Little seemed wanting, therefore, to complete the practice of barometrical
                    measurements, but the application of the thermometer to correct the results.
                    This instrument, however, advanced slowly to perfection, and more than forty
                    years yet elapsed before it came into current use. Some of the continental
                    philosophers likewise, biassed perhaps, by a secret jealousy of the superiority
                    which England had acquired in science, began to throw out doubts respecting the
                    reality or accuracy of the law of geometrical progression in the atmosphere.
                    Daniel Bernoulli, a man of candour on the whole, as well as ingenuity, but who,
                    with some proneness to speculative reasoning, had unfortunately imbibed many of
                    the prejudices of the Cartesian and Leibnitzian schools, proposed in his capital
                    work, the <hi rend="italic">Hydrodynamica,</hi> which appeared in 1736, some
                    vague hypotheses regarding the constitution of the atmosphere, as deduced from
                    certain internal motions attributed to its component strata. The specious
                    results of those calculations led him hastily to deviate from the principle of
                    the geometrical progression of density in the upper regions. In this departure
                    from nice theory he was followed by Cassini and Horrebow, who concluded, from
                    some partial observations they had made, that the barometer, in its indications
                    of atmospheric pressure, is subject to irregularity; and that, near the surface
                    of the earth, it obeys a different law from that which obtains at great
                    elevations. A strong light, however, was thrown upon the subject in 1753 by
                    Bouguer, an able mathematician and very skilful and ingenious observer, who,
                    with other academicians, had been employed for several years in measuring a
                    degree of the meridian along the stupendous ridge of the Andes. From the
                    comparison of more than thirty distinct observations, he deduced a simple and
                    elegant rule for computing heights by means of the barometer. It is this, that
                    the difference between the logarithms of the mercurial columns at the two
                    stations being <hi rend="italic">diminished</hi> by one thirtieth part, and the
                    decimal point shifted four places to the right, will express the required
                    elevation in <hi rend="italic">toises.</hi> Since the English was to the French
                    foot nearly as fifteen to sixteen, the rule would be accommodated to our
                    measures, and the result expressed in feet if the logarithmic difference were
                    <hi rend="italic">augmented</hi> by the thirtieth part, then multiplied by six,
                    and the decimal point thrown back four places; or, which is the same thing, ií
                    that logarithmic difference were multiplied at once by 62,000. But Bouguer
                    imagined, that this rule would not hold exactly in Europe, or in the lower
                    regions of the torrid zone; and to explain the deviation, he had recourse to the
                    forced supposition that the particles of air possess different degrees of
                    elasticity. Lambert, a philosopher of great originality and penetration,
                    afterwards published some excellent remarks on the comparison of barometrical
                    measurements. But no material progress was made till 1755, when Μ. de Luc of
                    Geneva resumed the subject, and carefully combined experiment with observation.
                    For the space of fifteen years and upwards, he prosecuted his inquiries with
                    diligence and perseverance, aided by the peculiar advantages of local situation,
                    in a city abounding with skilful artists, and seated in the neighbourhood of
                    lofty mountains. The discrepancies which had hitherto created so much
                    embarrassment proceeded mostly from the inattention of observers to the -
                    disturbing influence of heat, and particularly its effect in expanding the air,
                    and consequently augmenting the elevation due to a given difference of
                    atmospheric pressure. De Lucs first object was to improve the thermometer of
                    Reaumur, which, though greatly inferior to that of Fahrenheit, had been adopted
                    in France and the adjacent parts of the Continent. Having ascertained that
                    mercury has the valuable property of expanding equably with equal additions of
                    heat, he substituted that metallic fluid for spirit of wine, but retained its
                    arbitrary and inconvenient scale of eighty degrees between the points of
                    freezing and boiling water. He next examined the dilatation of air <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193194502" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4502-0399"/> where ∙ψ denotes
                    the latitude of the place, T and <hi rend="italic">t</hi> the temperatures of
                    the air at the two stations, as indicated by the centesimal thermometer, and H
                    and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> the heights of mercurial columns corrected for the
                    effects of heat.</p>
                <p>This active writer has likewise given tables for expediting the calculation of
                    barometrical measurements; in which he was anticipated, however, by Oltmans of
                    Berlin, who published, in 1809, large <hi rend="italic">Hypsometrical
                    Tables,</hi> as they are called, accommodated to the complex formula of Laplace.
                    Such tables might no doubt prove useful where very frequent computations are
                    wanted, as in the case of the reduction of the numerous observations brought
                    home by Baron Humboldt, for which, indeed, they were first designed. But still
                    they contain a needless profusion of figures, and hold forth a show of extreme
                    accuracy which the nature of the observations themselves can never justify. The
                    mere calculation of barometrical measurements is a secondary object. The great
                    difficulty is to procure good observations, and to combine tolerable accuracy
                    with expedition. For this purpose, a very portable barometer is still wanted;—an
                    instrument light and commodious, exempt from injury or derangement, and yet
                    sensible to minute changes of atmospheric pressure. These properties, indeed,
                    are seldom conjoined, and one advantage must generally be sacrificed to obtain
                    another. A modification of the conical barometer already suggested would seem,
                    on the whole, to be well adapted for the geological traveller. The two unequal
                    tubes are cemented into a small cylinder of steel, with a fine stop-cock of the
                    same metal confining the mercury. This renders the instrument so portable that
                    it may be inclosed in a walkingstick; on turning the steel-cock, and inverting
                    the staff, the height of the mercurial column is readily found.</p>
                <p>A barometer of the most improved construction is represented in fig. 19; a
                    portion of the tube is shown in fig. 20; and a section of its cistern in fig.
                    21. By help of a screw pressing against the bottom of a leathern bag, inclosed
                    within a cylindrical ivory box, the mercury is always brought up through a
                    tubular aperture to the same precise level; or till its convex surface appears
                    to touch a very thin line of light, which is admitted through a slip of ivory
                    applied against the side of the chink or separation of this tube from a wider
                    one immediately over it. The lower end of the mercurial column being thus
                    adjusted, the length is easily measured by drawing gradually down a hollow brass
                    tube, divided at intervals by wide slits, covered on one side by thin bits of
                    ivory, till by that softened light a contact is observed with the edge of a slit
                    and the convex top of the column. The fine Vernier which the movable tube
                    carries gives the altitude of the mercury in thousandth parts of an inch. A
                    thermometer is likewise constantly attached to the instrument, for the purpose
                    of indicating the temperature of the mercury, which, from the heat of the hand
                    in carrying, or the influence of the solar beams, is commonly warmer than the
                    external air.</p>
                <p>This mountain barometer is suspended fin observation by jimbols from a tripod, as
                    exhibited in fig. 18; but its several parts can be folded up together into a
                    convenient compass, tolerably well fitted for carriage, as represented in fig.
                    19. The whole apparatus may not exceed the weight of ten pounds; yet even this,
                    moderate as it might seem, would be felt a serious encumbrance by a traveller
                    who is engaged, day after day, in the labour of climbing mountains. The risk
                    which the instrument incurs, besides, in transporting it perhaps over rough
                    precipices, imposes a perpetual constraint, while to make correct observations
                    with it must always require time and patient attention. A lighter and more
                    compact, though less accurate, barometer will generally be preferred by the
                    geo-</p>
                <p>at different temperatures, and corrected those results by numerous observations
                    made on the mountains of Savoy, and the mines of the Hartz, in which the
                    barometer was combined with the thermometer. The <hi rend="italic">formula</hi>
                    which he thence deduced for the computation of barometrical measurements was, in
                    1772, published in his <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur les Modifications de l’
                    Atmosphere,</hi> and seemed to attract, especially in England, a very
                    considerable degree of notice. Dr Maskelyne, the astronomer-royal, adapted it to
                    our system of measures, and De Horsley made annotations and comments on it. But,
                    what was of more importance, other accurate observers, incited by De Luc’s
                    example, entered the same field of inquiry, provided with instruments of greater
                    delicacy and much better construction. In 1775 Sir George Shuckburgh Evelyn
                    visited the Alps, and combined trigonometrical operations with corresponding
                    observations by barometers and thermometers from the hands of Ramsden; and about
                    this time likewise, General Roy not only measured, with instruments made by that
                    excellent artist, some of the principal mountains in Scotland and Wales, but
                    instituted a series of manometrical experiments. It resulted from all these
                    researches that, for each degree on Fahrenheit’s scale, mercury expands the
                    9700th part, and air the 435th part of their respective bulks. It further
                    appeared that the atmosphere has its temperature almost uniformly diminished at
                    equal ascents; and that the logarithmic difference, reckoning as integers the
                    first four digits, expresses in English fathoms the height of an aerial column
                    as cold as the point of congelation. General Roy proposed likewise another
                    correction depending on the enfeebled gravity, and consequently the augmented
                    altitude, of the equiponderant column of atmosphere in the lower latitudes,
                    occasioned by the influence of centrifugal force arising from the earth’s
                    rotation. Several years afterwards, Professor Playfair, in a learned paper,
                    printed in the first volume of the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Royal
                    Society of Edinburgh,</hi> examined all the circumstances which can affect
                    barometrical measurements, and discussed each question with the correctness and
                    perspicuity that we [might expect from his distinguished abilities. At nearly an
                    equal interval of time the celebrated Laplace resumed the subject in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Mécanique Céleste,</hi> and brought all the conditions together in
                    a very complicated formula. Such an appearance of extreme accuracy, however, is
                    perhaps to be regarded merely as a theoretical illusion, unsuited and
                    inapplicable to any real state of practice. Biot has since attempted to arrive
                    at a similar conclusion, by setting out <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> from
                    some careful experiments on the relative density of air and mercury, performed
                    by him in conjunction with Arago. He thence infers that, in the latitude of
                    Paris, and at the point of congelation, air, under a mercurial pressure of 76
                    metres, or 29,922 English inches, is 10,463 times lighter than mercury at the
                    temperature of water at its lowest contraction. This would give 26,090 feet for
                    the height of a column of homogeneous fluid, whose pressure is equivalent to the
                    elasticity of die atmosphere. The co-efficient adapted to common logarithms, and
                    adjusted to the force of attraction at the level of the sea, would therefore be
                    60,148 feet, or 18,334 metres; scarcely differing sensibly from the quantity

                    extend our acquaintance with the altitudes of mountains, than to aim at a
                    superfluous and often illusory precision. The portable instrument, invented by
                    Sir Henry Englefield, and represented in fig. 14, will, on the whole, answer
                    those views. Its cistern is formed of box-wood, sufficiently tight to hold the
                    mercury, without preventing the access and impression of the external air. When
                    this barometer is inverted, the mercury, therefore, subsides very slowly in the
                    tube, which must be firmly suspended in a vertical position. For greater
                    security, the mercury is now put into a leathern bag introduced within the
                    cistern.</p>
                <p>. A very simple and convenient sort of portable barometer was lately invented in
                    France by that celebrated chemical philosopher M.. Gay-Lussac. (See fig. 15 and
                    16.) It consists of rather a wide syphon tube, filled with mercury, and sealed
                    hermetically at the inverted end, having a very fine capillary hole formed about
                    an inch under this, by nicely directing the flame of a blow-pipe against the
                    side of the glass, and drawing a melted spot of it out to a point. The lower
                    portion of the principal branch has its bore contracted to less than the tenth
                    part of an inch, to prevent the mercurial column from dividing in the act of
                    inverting it. The mereury is boiled as usual, and the tube may be concealed in a
                    walking-stick, or lodged, like the complete mountain barometer, in a cylinder of
                    brass, with movable sliders bearing the divisions of a Vernier at both ends.
                    (See fig. 17.) For greater simplicity, however, the larger divisions might be
                    engraved on the tube itself. This kind of barometer is of ready use, and very
                    little exposed to hazard in carriage. It is commonly held in a reclined or
                    inverted position; but, in making an observation, it must be gently turned back,
                    and kept perpendicular till the mercury descends through the contracted bore,
                    and slowly rises again in the opposite short branch; the scale is noticed at
                    both ends of the incurved column, and the difference of those indications gives
                    its correct altitude.</p>
                <p>A modification of the conical barometer, which, in travelling, we have ourselves
                    employed with great ease and advantage, should likewise be mentioned. The
                    principal part of it consists of a small stop-cock made of steel, and
                    represented in fig. 13. A glass tube of 31 or 32 inches long, with a bore of the
                    tenth part of an inch hermetically sealed at the top, and filled with
                    quicksilver, is cemented into the one end of the stop-cock; and into the other
                    end is cemented an open and wider tube, 16 inches or more in length, and having
                    its diameter above the eighth part of an inch. This compound tube is lodged in a
                    walking-stick, divided into inches and tenths through its whole extent, or only
                    at the upper part, if uniform tubes be selected. In making an observation, the
                    cock is turned, and the instrument inverted. The upper column then descends
                    partly into the lower tube, till it becomes shortened to the proper
                    altitude.</p>
                <p>We have already stated the principles on which the calculation of barometrical
                    measurements proceeds. But there still are some points, either assumed or
                    overlooked, which may considerably modify the results. It is presumed, that, at
                    equal successive heights, the temperature of the atmosphere decreases uniformly.
                    This property, however, does not hold strictly, and it may be shown, from a
                    comparison of the best observations, that the decrements of heat follow a
                    quicker progression in the higher regions. But we shall soon have another
                    opportunity to examine this subject, and trace out its various consequences.</p>
                <p>The humidity of the air also materially affects its elasticity, and the
                    hygrometer should therefore be conjoined with the thermometer in correcting
                    barometrical observations. But nothing satisfactory has yet been done in regard
                    to that subject. The ordinary hygrometers, or rather hygroscopes, are mere toys,
                    and their application to science is altogether hypothetical. A most
                    unphilosophical course has lately been pursued, by multiplying calculations
                    grounded on very loose data, instead of instituting a nice and elaborate train
                    of original experiments.</p>
                <p>In the actual state of physical science, it is preposterous, therefore, to affect
                    any high refinement in the formula for computing barometrical measurements. The
                    whole operation may be reduced to a very short and easy process. But the
                    simplicity of the calculation would be still greater, if the centesimal
                    thermometer were generally adopted. It will be sufficiently accurate, till
                    better data are obtained, to assume the expansion of mercury by heat as equal to
                    the 5000th part of its bulk for every centesimal degree, while that of air is
                    twenty times greater, being an expansion for each degree of the 250th part of
                    the bulk of this fluid. 1. <hi rend="italic">Correct the length of the mercurial

                    decimal point being shifted four places to the left.</hi> 2. <hi rend="italic"

                    three places bach to the right, and multiplying by twice the sum of the degrees

                    elevation.</hi></p>
                <p>If it were judged worth while to make any allowance for the effect of centrifugal
                    force, this will be easily done before the last multiplication takes place, by
                    adding to twice the degrees on the detached thermometers the fifth part of the
                    mean temperature corresponding to the latitude. The mean temperature itself is
                    formed by multiplying the square of the cosine of the latitude by
                    twenty-nine.</p>
                <p>In illustration of these rules, we shall subjoin some real examples. General Roy,
                    in the month of August 1775, observed the barometer on Caernarvon Quay, at 30Ό91
                    inches, the attached centesimal thermometer indicating 15° ∙7, and the detached
                    15° ∙6; while, on the peak of Snowdon, the barometer fell to 26’409 inches, and
                    the attached and detached thermometers marked respectively 10 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 0 and 8° ∙8. Here twice the difference of the
                    attached thermometers is 11° ∙4, and twice the sum of the detached thermometers
                    is 48° ∙8, which becomes 50 ’ 8 when augmented by the fifth part of the mean
                    temperature on that parallel. Now, omitting the lower decimals, the first
                    correction is ∙00264 X 11∙4 —. ∙030, to be added to 26 ’ 409. Wherefore,</p>
                <p>Log. 30∙091 = 1∙4784866 Log. 26∙439 = <hi rend="underline">1∙4223450</hi></p>
                <p>Difference = ∙0561416 Constant multiplier = <hi rend="underline">60000</hi></p>
                <p>Approximate height =≡ 3368∙496 And, for the true height, the correction is 3∙37 ×
                    50’8 = 171∙2, which gives 3340 for the final result.</p>
                <p>M <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> e shall take another example from the
                    observations made by Sir George Shuckburgh Evelyn, at the same period, among the
                    mountains of Savoy. This accurate philosopher found the barometer, placed in a
                    cabin near the base of the Mole, and only 672 feet above the surface of the lake
                    of Geneva, to stand at 28’152 inches, while the attached and detached
                    thermometers indicated 16° ∙3 and and 17° ∙4; but, in another barometer carried
                    to the summit of that lofty insulated mountain, the mercury sunk to 24Ί76
                    inches, the attached and detached thermometeis markingr 14 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0,</hi> 4 and 13° ∙4. Wherefore, twice the difference <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193194528" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4528-0401"/> of the degrees on
                    the attached was 3° ∙8, and twice the sum of the degrees on the detached
                    thermometers was 6l <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> ∙6. Consequently the
                    correction to be applied to the higher column was ∙0024 × 3∙8 = ∙009, which
                    makes it M85. Now,</p>
                <p>Log. 28∙152 = 1∙4495092 Log. 24∙185 = <hi rend="underline">1∙3835461</hi></p>
                <p>Difference = ∙0659631 Constant multiplier = 60000</p>
                <p>Approximate elevation = 3957-786</p>
                <p>To correct this approximate elevation, remove the decimal point three places
                    back, and multiply it by 61°-6, increased by 2° ∙9, the fifth part of the mean
                    temperature, corresponding to the latitude; but 3∙96 × 64∙5 = 255∙4, and 3957-8
                    + 255∙4 = 4213. Hence the summit of the Mole is 4885 feet above the lake of
                    Geneva, or 6083 feet above the level of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
                <p>The last example we shall give is drawn from the observation which Baron Humboldt
                    made among the Andes, near the summit of Chimboraço, the highest spot ever
                    approached by man. This celebrated traveller found there, that the barometer
                    fell to 14∙850 English inches; the attached thermometer in the tent being at
                    10°, and the detached in open air being 1° ∙6 under zero. But the same
                    barometer, carried down to the shore of the Pacific Ocean, rose exactly to
                    thirty inches, while both the attached and detached thermometers stood at 25°-3.
                    Consequently the correction to be applied to the upper column is = ∙0015 X 30 ’
                    6 = ∙045. Wherefore,</p>
                <p>Log. 30-000 = 1∙4771213 Log. 14-895 = 1-1730405</p>
                <p>Difference = -3040808 Constant multiplier = 60000</p>
                <p>Approximate elevation = 18244-848 Now, the difference of the detached
                    thermometers, or 26° ∙9, being doubled and further increased by 5° ∙8, the fifth
                    part of the mean temperature at the equator, makes 59° ∙6; and the final
                    correction to be applied is therefore = 18-24 X 59° ∙6 = 1087, which gives
                    19,332 feet for the true elevation observed, or 2140 feet below the summit of
                    Chimboraço.</p>
                <p>_ These calculations are performed by the help of logarithms. It is desirable,
                    however, to approximate at least to barometrical measurements without such aid.
                    A very simple rule for this object has been given by Professor Leslie in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements of Geometry.</hi> Since log. — = 2 M (≡^i <hi

                    determining any altitude that exceeds "not feet. But it will extend to greater
                    elevations if the second term of the series be likewise taken, which is done by
                    striking off three figures, and cubing the half of this number. Thus, resuming
                    the mensuration of Chimboraço, 44-895 :15-105:: 52,000: 17,496, and (8-75)^ =
                    670, making together 18,166 for a nearer approximation.</p>
                <p>The calculation of barometrical measurements, including the corrections required,
                    is rendered most easy and expeditious by means of a sliding rule made by Mr
                    Cary, optician in London. This small instrument should always <hi rend="italic"
                    >go</hi> along with mountain barometers; and it will be found a very agreeable
                    companion to every geological traveller.</p>
                <p>But portable barometers, in spite of every precaution, are yet so liable to be
                    broken or deranged, that other auxiliary methods are desirable for ascertaining
                    distant elevations. In this view, the variation of the boiling point of water
                    was proposed by Fahrenheit as far back as the year 1724; the idea having
                    occurred to him, as it had done before to Amontons, while engaged with
                    experiments to perfect his thermometer. Little regard, however, seems to have
                    been paid to the suggestion till De Luc and Saussure made a series of
                    observations on the heat of ebullition at different elevations above the
                    surface. About thirty years since, Cavallo attempted to revive the scheme of
                    Fahrenheit, but experienced much difficulty in preventing the irregular starts
                    of the thermometer plunged in boiling water. The best and surest way of
                    examining the heat of ebullition, is to suspend the bulb of the thermometer iń
                    the confined steam as it rises from the water.</p>
                <p>The heat at which water boils, or passes into the form of steam, depends on the
                    weight of the superincumbent atmosphere. By diminishing this pressure, the point
                    of ebullition is always lowered. It appears that, while the boiling heat sinks
                    by equal differences, the corresponding atmospheric pressure decreases exactly,
                    or at least extremely nearly, in a geometrical progression, it being found that
                    every time such pressure is reduced to one half, the temperature of boiling
                    water suffers a regular diminution of about eighteen centesimal degrees. This
                    beautiful relation assimilates with the law which connects the density and
                    elevation of the successive strata of the atmosphere. The interval noticed
                    between the boiling points at two distinct stations must be proportional to
                    their difference of altitude above the level of the sea. We have, therefore,
                    only to determine the co-efficient or constant multiplier, which may be
                    discovered either from an experiment under the rarefied receiver of an air-pump,
                    or from an actual observation performed at the bottom and on the top of some
                    lofty mountain. We shall prefer at present the observation made by Saussure on
                    the summit of Mont Blanc. This diligent philosopher found, by means of a very
                    delicate thermometer constructed on purpose, that water which boiled at 101° ∙62
                    in the plain below when the barometer stood at 30-534 English inches, boiled at
                    86° ∙24 on the top of that mountain, while the barometer had sunk to 17-136.
                    Wherefore the distance between the points of ebullition, or 15-38 centesimal
                    degrees, must correspond to an approximate elevation of 15,050 feet, which gives
                    978į feet of ascent for each degree, supposing the mean temperature of the
                    atmospheric column to be that of congelation. But it will be more convenient to
                    assume 1000 for the constant multiplier, which corresponds to the temperature of
                    5⅜°.</p>
                <p>To reduce this very simple result into practice, it would be requisite to have a
                    thermometer with a fine capillary bore, and nicely constructed, the stem six or
                    eight inches long, and bearing ten or a few more degrees from the boiling point;
                    these degrees to be divided into twenty or perhaps fifty equal parts engraved on
                    the tube, which should be rather thick, and terminating in a bulb of about half
                    an inch diameter. This thermometer, being fitted <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193194541" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4541-0402"/>with a brass ring two inches
                    above the bulb, should screw into the narrow neck of a small copper flask, which
                    holds some water, but has a hole perforated near the top for allowing the steam
                    to escape. The water may be made to boil by the application of a lamp. The
                    difference between the indications of the thermometers at the two stations being
                    multiplied by a thousand feet, will give the elevation corresponding to a
                    temperature of 5^∙ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>. The correction for the actual
                    mean temperature can easily be applied. If a more correct co-effi cient be
                    afterwards determined, the same thousand, retained as a multiplier, may easily
                    be adapted to another temperature.</p>
                <p>This method of measuring elevations on the surface of the globe is, therefore,
                    capable of great improvement, and might be employed with advantage in a variety
                    of cases where observations with the barometer are not easily obtained. Its
                    application would be most important to physical geography, in ascertaining the
                    capital points for tracing the outline of the profile or vertical section of any
                    country. The common maps, which exhibit mere superficial extension, are quite
                    insufficient to represent the great features of nature, since the climate and
                    productions of any place depend as much on its elevation above the sea as its
                    latitude. Scientific travellers have accordingly turned their attention of late
                    years to the framing of vertical sections. As a specimen, we give, in fig. 22,
                    from Humboldt’s <hi rend="italic">Geography of Plants,</hi> a section across the
                    American continent, one of the best and most interesting that has yet appeared.
                    It consists, in fact, of four combined sections, traversing through an extent of
                    425 miles. The line begins at Acapulco, on the shore of the Pacific Ocean, and
                    runs 195 miles, about a point of the compass towards the east of north, to the
                    city of Mexico then 80 miles, a point to the south of east, to La Puebla de los
                    Angeles; again it holds a north-east direction of 70 miles, to the Cruz Blanca;
                    and finally bends 80 miles east by south, to Vera Cruz, on the coast of the
                    Atlantic. A scale of altitudes is annexed, which shows the vast elevation of the
                    table-land of Mexico An attempt is likewise made in this profile to give some
                    idea of the geological structure of the external crust. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Limestone</hi> is represented by straight lines slightly inclined from the
                    horizontal position; <hi rend="italic">JBasalt,</hi> by straight lines slightly
                    reclined from the perpendicular; <hi rend="italic">Porphyry,</hi> by waved lines
                    somewhat reclined; <hi rend="italic">Granite,</hi> by confused hatches; <hi
                    rend="italic">Amygdaloid,</hi> by confused points.</p>
                <p>By this mode of distant levelling, a very interesting discovery, in another
                    quarter of our globe, was made by Engelhardt and Parrot, two Prussian
                    travellers. They proceeded,, on the 13th July 1814, from the mouth of the Kuban,
                    at the island of Taman, on the Black Sea; and, examining carefully every day the
                    state of the barometer, they advanced with fifty-one observations, the distance
                    of 990 wersts, or 711 English miles, to the mouth of the Terek, on the margin of
                    the Caspian Sea. Similar observations were repeated and multiplied on their
                    return. From a diligent comparison of the whole, it follows that the Caspian is
                    334 English feet below the level of the Black Sea. That the Caspian really
                    occupies a lower level than the Ocean, had been suspected before, from a
                    comparison of some registers of barometers kept at St Petersburg, and on the
                    borders of that inland sea; but the last observation places the question beyond
                    all doubt. It further appears, that within 250 wersts, or 189 miles, of the
                    Caspian, the country is already depressed to the level of the Ocean, leaving,
                    therefore, an immense basin, from which the waters are supposed to have retired
                    by a subterranean percolation.</p>
                <p>If the same plan of barometrical measurements had been followed by the
                    adventurous explorers of the African continent, and the altitudes of the central
                    lakes ascertained, the question regarding the course of the Niger would have
                    been much sooner settled, and much vague and unsatisfactory discussion avoided.
                    Even thermometrical observations of the temperature of springs, or of the ground
                    at moderate depths, would have furnished an approximation to those elevations
                    sufficiently near for solving that great problem in geography on scientific
                    principles alone.</p>
                <p>The spirit of modern enterprise has more lately carried barometers to the
                    remotest and loftiest stations on the surface of our globe. It has been thus
                    ascertained that some of the mountains in the equatorial parts of America attain
                    the stupendous altitude of 25,000 feet, while the great chain of Upper India
                    seems to rear its vast summit about 2000 feet still higher. See <hi
