                <p><label type="entry">BATHING</label>, the act of using or applying a bath; that
                    is, of immersing the body, or part of it, in water or other fluid.</p>
                <p>Bathing is a practice of great antiquity. It prevailed among the Greeks as early
                    as the heroic age; and we even find mention made by Homer of hot baths in the
                    Trojan times, although these seem to have been rare; indeed Athenaeus speaks of
                    hot baths as unusual even in his age. Public baths were in fact discouraged, and
                    even prohibited, by the ancient Greeks, who were content to perform their
                    ablutions in private, and without either luxury or parade. The method of
                    lavation among this people consisted in heating water in a large three-footed
                    vessel, and thence pouring it on the head and shoulders of the bather while
                    seated in a tub, and he, on coming out, was anointed with oil.</p>
                <p>It was also long before the Romans came into the use of baths; the very name of
                    which, <hi rend="italic">thermae,</hi> shows that the practice had been borrowed
                    from the Greeks. As the ancient Romans were chiefly employed in agriculture,
                    their custom was, every evening after work, to wash their arms and legs, that
                    they might sit down to supper with more decency; for it is to be observed that
                    the use of linen was then unknown, and the people of that age went with their
                    arms and legs bare, and consequently exposed to dust and filth. But this was not
                    all. Every ninth day, when they repaired to the city, either to the nundinae or
                    to attend at the assemblies of the people, they bathed in the Tiber, or some
                    other river which happened to be nearest them.</p>
                <p>This seems to have been all the bathing known till the time of Pompey, when the
                    custom of bathing every day appears to have been introduced.</p>
                <p>The Celtic nations were not unacquainted with bathing, although it must be
                    confessed that some of their descendants have evinced but little taste for
                    scrupulous ablution. The ancient Germans bathed every day in warm water during
                    winter, and in cold water during summer. In England, the famous bath in
                    Somersetshire is said by some to have been in use eight centuries before Christ.
                    Of this, however, it must be owned, we have but slender evidence; although Dr
                    Musgrave makes it probable that it was a place of considerable resort in Geta’s
                    time, the remains of a statue erected to that general, in gratitude for some
                    benefactions he had conferred upon it, being still in existence.</p>
                <p>Although bathing, among the ancients, made, as it were, a part of diet, and was
                    used as familiarly as eating or sleep; yet, as we learn from Strabo, Pliny,
                    Hippocrates, and Oribasius, it was in high esteem among their physicians as a
                    cure for certain diseases; and hence their frequent exhortations to washing in
                    the sea and plunging into cold water. The first instance of cold bathing for
                    medicinal purposes is that of Melampus, who bathed the daughters of the king of
                    Argos; and the first instance of warm bathing is that of Medea, who was said to
                    boil people alive, probably with some reason, since Pelias king of Thessaly died
                    in a hot bath under her hands. The cold bath was used with success by Antonius
                    Musa, physician to the emperor Augustus, for the recovery of that prince; but it
                    fell into neglect after the death of Marcellus, who was believed to have met his
                    death from indulging in it to excess. Towards the close of the reign of Nero,
                    however, it was again brought into vogue by a physician of Marseilles named
                    Charmis; but the fashion proved short-lived, and, during the succeeding ages,
                    when the physical condition of the people became as much deteriorated as their
                    intellectual and moral character, this cleanly practice was altogether
                    abandoned.</p>
                <p>A methodical arrangement of the medical and physiological effects of the practice
                    of bathing, referred to the a respective divisions of therapeutic agencies,
                    would be of great use in enabling us to attain a distinct idea of their nature;
                    but such an arrangement is, in fact, a matter of extreme difficulty, for two
                    reasons: <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> because the temperature, the continuance,
                    and the impregnation of the bath, are capable of being so varied, as materially
                    to vary the nature of the remedy without any distinct limit between its
                    different forms; and, <hi rend="italic">secondly,</hi> because the classes of
                    medical agents to which several of these effects belong are by no means
                    distinctly defined, to say nothing of the additional complexity arising from the
                    division of the effects into immediate and remote, which is often extremely
                    important. The remote effects, however, being of a more general nature, and
                    relating chiefly to the improvement or deterioration of the actions of the whole
                    system, it is only the immediate effects that require to be accurately analyzed
                    and distinguished, and these we must endeavour to reduce to some methodical
                    classification of therapeutic powers.</p>
                <p>Baths, as depending on water, have been naturally referred to the class of <hi
                    rend="italic">diluent</hi> remedies, in which water is comprehended; and they
                    have sometimes even been recommended as <hi rend="italic">nutrients:</hi> they
                    may also act as <hi rend="italic">excitante</hi> of cutaneous sensation; as
                    stimulants, or rather <hi rend="italic">calefaciente,</hi> increasing the
                    velocity of the circulation of the blood; as <hi rend="italic">sudorifics,</hi>
                    as <hi rend="italic">diuretics,</hi> as “sorbentia” or <hi rend="italic"
                    >sorbefaednte,</hi> refrigerants or <hi rend="italic">astringents,</hi> as <hi
                    rend="italic">tonics,</hi> and as <hi rend="italic">retardante</hi> o the pulse,
                    a capacity in which some would call them re<pb break="no" facs="nls:193195074"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5074-0443"/>laxants, while they seem in many cases to be
                    useful as antispasmodics, or to relieve certain nervous affections, by something
                    like a <hi rend="italic">narcotic</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sedative</hi> power.
                    We might also refer the mechanical effect of ablution, in removing the natural
                    secretions of the skin, to the dietetic <hi rend="italic">habits</hi> conducive
                    to the preservation of health; but this process, though highly necessary for our
                    comfort, is perhaps less essentially important to health than has often been
                    imagined; and, in some particular cases, the practice of the very frequent
                    removal of the unctuous and volatile secretions of the skin has even appeared to
                    be injurious, and to occasion indolent tumours of the absorbent glands belonging
                    to the parts concerned.</p>
                <p>If we admit that baths are ever, strictly speaking, either <hi rend="italic"
                    >diluent</hi> or <hi rend="italic">nutrient,</hi> we must suppose the cutaneous
                    absorbents to be the channels of these actions; and the majority of authors,
                    both ancient and modern, have certainly considered the skin as imbibing, with
                    great facility, not only water, but also any kind of substance capable of being
                    dissolved in it; nor is there any doubt that, under some circumstances, the
                    cutaneous absorbents have been found to possess such a power in a certain
                    degree; but M. Séguin and Dr Currie have shown that, in common cases, very
                    little or no effect is to be expected from this absorption;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Currie’s <hi rend="italic">Medical Reports on
                    the Effects of Water,</hi> 8vo, Liverpool, 1798, p. 244.</p></note> that the
                    strongest medical agents, when dissolved in the water of a bath, exhibited no
                    operation on the system while the skin was entire; and that no perceptible
                    advantage was obtained from a continued immersion in a bath of nutritive fluids,
                    notwithstanding the extreme exhaustion of the system in a case of completely
                    obstructed deglutition; and they suppose that where weight has been gained
                    during immersion in a bath, the absorption occasioning its increase has been
                    principally performed by the lungs retaining the moisture, which they receive in
                    abundance with the air inhaled.</p>
                <p>The other immediate effects of bathing must depend on the contact of the fluid
                    with the skin, either as simply moistening and softening the cuticle, or as <hi
                    rend="italic">exciting</hi> a peculiar sensation in the cutaneous nerves,
                    whether of touch only, or of heat or cold, or, in some cases, of slight pain,
                    where the skin has been previously in a state of irritation, especially if the
                    water contains a saline impregnation; or, <hi rend="italic">lastly,</hi> as
                    altering the state of the circulation by any of these means, especially by the
                    change of temperature; this effect being also often modified by the change of
                    the position of the body, and by the distribution of the pressure or resistance
                    which supports its weight throughout almost the whole surface, instead of its
                    being confined, as usual, to the parts on which we sit or stand. The excitement
                    of the nerves of the skin appears to be salutary in many cutaneous diseases,
                    which are benefited by warm bathing, whether in fresh or in salt water, or in
                    sulphureous or other mineral waters, as at Harrowgate, and at Baden, and Pfeffer
                    andLeuck in Switzerland, the bathers sometimes remaining whole days in the water
                    for weeks together, until a peculiar efflorescence has appeared on the skin, and
                    has again disappeared.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    are of a nature somewhat similar, and ire said to be of considerable advantage
                    in some paralytic eases. But if we allow the truth of the opinion of Seguin and
                    Currie, we must infer that there are few instances in which the effects of
                    bathing on the system in general can depend much on the impregnation of the
                    water; and we <hi rend="superscript"> 0u</hi> ght perhaps to attribute the
                    acknowledged advantage °f sea-bathing, in a variety of diseases, in a great
                    measure to the mildness and equability of the temperature of the sea. It is
                    true, that persons accidentally wetted with salt water are but little liable to
                    take cold; and this fact has been supposed to indicate some stimulant property
                    in the contents of the fluid; but it may be explained with greater simplicity
                    from the slower evaporation of salt water, which causes it to carry off heat
                    much less rapidly than fresh, the cooling process being also retarded by the
                    greater moisture of the sea air.</p>
                <p>In order to determine how far any kind of bathing may properly be called a
                    stimulant or <hi rend="italic">calefacient,</hi> we must consider what are the
                    tests by which we judge of the increased rapidity of the circulation of the
                    blood. The term calefacient is, indeed, somewhat objectionable, as implying that
                    animal heat depends solely or principally on the motion of the blood, which is
                    not, in the present state of our knowledge, the most probable opinion; and
                    besides this etymological inaccuracy, the definition of the term, as implying an
                    accelerated circulation, involves a considerable difficulty, since we have no
                    means of ascertaining whether increased frequency of pulsation compensates or
                    not, in any particular instance, for diminished fulness and strength. On the
                    other hand, the operation of almost all medical agents is such as to relieve us
                    from this ambiguity in the application of the definition; for we can scarcely
                    mention any remedy which materially accelerates the pulse without at the same
                    time increasing its strength. There are, indeed, many medicines which are often
                    designated by the vague denomination of stimulants, and which have no effect
                    whatever on the circulation, but either simply <hi rend="italic">awaken</hi> the
                    nervous energies in general, or <hi rend="italic">excite</hi> local sensations
                    of heat or pain; and this multiplicity of significations is a sufficient reason
                    for rejecting the term from a correct classification. It happens, however, not
                    unfrequently, that astringent and febrifuge medicines will reduce the frequency
                    of the pulse, and increase its fulness; and it becomes necessary, for an
                    accurate analysis of the operation of remedies which affect the circulation, to
                    distinguish the <hi rend="italic">accelerants</hi> of the pulse from the <hi
                    rend="italic">auy-mentatives</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">intensitives,</hi>
                    all of which may possibly be independent of the production of an increase of
                    temperature; and this increase may also in some cases be produced, at least in
                    the extremities and the superficial parts, and apparently also in the whole
                    system, without any change in the circulation, by the operation of certain
                    remedies, which might be called <hi rend="italic">thalptics,</hi> if it were
                    necessary to distinguish them as independent agents: and to these four classes
                    we might add four others of an exactly opposite nature, which might be called
                    <hi rend="italic">retardants, diminutives,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >remissives</hi> of the pulse, and <hi rend="italic">psyctics,</hi> or direct
                    refrigerants; and the last four classes would belong to a general division of
                    remedies comprehending those which lessen the force of animal actions; a
                    division which it has not commonly been found necessary to establish, for any
                    practical classification of the materia medica.</p>
                <p>Now it appears that a hot bath, of a temperature exceeding 98°, the usual heat of
                    the human body, will commonly act both as an accelerant and an augmentative of
                    the pulse, but probably not as an intensitive; it may, however, very properly be
                    classed as a calefacient, if such a description of remedies be admitted. Dr
                    Parr<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >De Balneo, Med. Comm. Ed.</hi> i. 297; or Marcard by Parant, p. 66.</p></note>
                    says, that a bath of 100° rendered the pulse fuller and more frequent; but that,
                    after the bath, it was slower than usual; at higher temperatures the effects
                    were still more marked; and in Marcard’s experiments, p. 71, the results were
                    nearly similar. Dr Haygarth observed (Marcard, p. 67), that in a bath of 114°
                    the pulse was considered more frequent, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195087"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5087-0444"/>and the arteries were evidently dilated. In
                    Finland, according to Martin (Marcard, p. 223), the vapour baths are usually
                    heated to about 120°, and they often increase the frequency of the pulse from 70
                    in a minute to 110 or 120. Fourcroy mentions a bath of 66°, which must have been
                    of the centigrade scale, making 151° of Fahrenheit, and not 181°, as Marcard
                    supposes (p. 216), which was followed, an hour afterwards, by a fatal apoplexy.
                    Whatever exaggeration there may be in this report, it may still serve to explain
                    to us the excesses which were frequently committed in the use of baths by the
                    Greeks and Romans, and the pernicious effects attributed to them by the ancient
                    physicians. Hippocrates observes <hi rend="italic">(Aph. N.</hi> 16), that the
                    too frequent employment of hot bathing causes a softness and debility of the
                    muscles, a want of firmness of the nerves, and a dulness of the faculties, with
                    occasional hemorrhages and faintings, sometimes even terminating in death; and
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Clouds</hi> of Aristophanes we have a mock defence of
                    warm bathing deduced from the usual dedication of hot springs to Hercules, which
                    implies a perfect confidence in the opinion of the pernicious tendency of the
                    practice, accompanied, or followed, as it frequently was, by other indulgencies,
                    to which it has too often given occasion. This traditional condemnation of hot
                    bathing has been erroneously transferred by some of the moderns to warm or tepid
                    bathing; and since it has been asserted by authors of high celebrity that air
                    above 60° will generally occasion a sensation of warmth, it seems to have been
                    inferred that water above 60° must constitute a warm bath, and consequently
                    produce enervating and debilitating effects. The fact is, however, that a bath
                    below 100° is scarcely ever heating in any material degree; and even at 100°,
                    the pulse, though somewhat accelerated, is often not at all augmented in
                    fulness; nor are the subsequent effects materially different from those which
                    usually result from an equal acceleration produced by any kind of moderate
                    exercise. It is observed by Galen, in his∙ <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the
                    Pulse (Oρρ.</hi> vol. iii. p. 3, ed. Bas.), that “baths, when moderately warm,
                    cause the pulse to be full, and strong, and frequent; when excessively hot,
                    small and obscure, but frequent and hard, sometimes, however, after a time,
                    becoming slow, though still feeble.” Of this retardation of the pulse in a very
                    hot bath we have no experience in modern times: it is obvious, that what Galen
                    calls moderately warm, we should at present term a hot bath; and probably his
                    excessively hot baths somewhat resembled that which is mentioned by Fourcroy.
                    "Cold baths,” he says, "at first make the pulse slow and weak; afterwards, if
                    they disagree, and produce torpor, the pulse remains weak; but if the bath is
                    likely to strengthen the system, producing a salutary glow, then the pulse
                    becomes full and strong, and natural in point of frequency.”</p>
                <p>It is, however, remarkable, that the cold bath not uncommonly renders the pulse
                    considerably more frequent at the first immersion; a circumstance which was
                    particularly observed by Athill,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">On Cold Bathing,</hi> Marcard, p. 239; <hi

                    notwithstanding Marcard’s doubts, has been since fully confirmed by Dr

                    painful sensation of cold occasioned by the first immersion, especially while it
                    is incomplete; it is commonly very transitory, and is succeeded by a
                    retardation, while the fulness of the pulsations is diminished from the
                    first.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sudorific</hi> effect of the hot bath seems to be, in a
                    great measure, the natural consequence of the acceleration of the circulation,
                    and to be nearly proportional to this acceleration, being also favoured by the
                    softening of the cuticle and perhaps by the dilatation of the cutaneous
                    exhalants’. It is principally recommended in rheumatism, and it is also
                    considered as conducive to the cure of some cutaneous affections; and when this
                    effect is thought particularly desirable, it is usual to take the bath late in
                    the evening, and to promote its operation by going into a warm bed immediately
                    after it.</p>
                <p>In considering these and other changes produced in the system by bathing, we must
                    be careful to avoid the very common error of applying inaccurately and
                    indiscriminately the laws of mechanical and physical agents to the effects
                    produced in the animal economy. Some of the latest and best authors on
                    therapeutics have talked of the expansion of the fluids contained, in the
                    vessels, in consequence of the elevation of temperature occasioned by the warm
                    bath, and of the contraction of the vessels themselves by the cold bath, as if
                    they were phenomena of the same kind, arid simply opposed to each other. The
                    truth is, that the mean temperature of all the fluids in the body is seldom
                    elevated more than a degree or two by the effect of a bath of any kind; and even
                    if the elevation were 10°, the expansion of all the circulating fluids would not
                    exceed the bulk of a single additional ounce of blood or of water. The
                    mechanical effect of cold, on the other hand, would immediately tend to lessen
                    the tension of the vessels, by contracting the fluid contained within them more
                    than the vessels themselves; but this effect would be scarcely more sensible
                    than the former, even if we allowed that the general temperature might be
                    depressed 10° or I2°, as it seemed to be in some of Dr Currie’s experiments; and
                    the actual contraction, which is really observable in the superficial parts
                    during immersion in the cold bath, can only be referable to the action of living
                    powers, which fall decidedly under the description of involuntary muscularity.
                    Dr Parry’s late experiments have very clearly shown the existence of such
                    powers, and exhibited their temporary and local action.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Experimental Inquiry on the
                    Arterial Pulse,</hi> 8vo, Bath, 1816, p. 41.</p></note> He found, that when the
                    carotid of a ewe was laid bare, its circumference was 525 thousandths of an
                    inch; “but it almost immediately shrunk, through the whole space which was
                    exposed, so as to become in circumference only ∙470; at the same time, a portion
                    of the artery, before the contracted part, and which had been more recently
                    exposed, was ∙635; the pulse in the dilated part was very strong and full, that
                    in the contracted part very weak and soft.” Dr Parry has chosen to distinguish
                    these effects from those which are observed in other muscular parts by a
                    peculiar denomination; but the distinction appears to be perfectly arbitrary;
                    and Dr Young, whom he quotes as denying the muscular powers of the arteries, on
                    account of the chemical nature of their coats, has expressly asserted their
                    muscularity, in contradiction to the conclusions of Bichat and Berzelius. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Medical Literature,</hi> 8vo, Lond. 1813, p.'502.) But by
                    whatever term we choose to denote the effect, there is little doubt that an
                    unusual degree of cold has a tendency to produce such a general contraction of
                    the coats of all the superficial capillary arteries; and the diminution of their
                    diameter must necessarily increase that part of the resistance to the blood’s
                    motion, which is derived from its friction against the sides of the vessels, and
                    must, therefore, tend materially to lessen its velocity. Again, if the
                    contractions of the heart are at all proportional in magnitude or <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193195100" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5100-0445"/>in frequency to the quantity
                    of blood entering it, and acting as a stimulus to its motions, it is not
                    unnatural to suppose that its pulsations will be rendered feebler by the
                    diminution of that quantity, occasioned by the increase of the resistance, and
                    that the primitive retardation will be redoubled by the operation of this cause.
                    At the same time, however, that the cutaneous vessels are contracted, those of
                    the internal parts must necessarily b⅛enlarged. Hence arises the sensation of
                    oppression on the chest, with the sobbing or panting for breath, which generally
                    occurs at the first immersion in cold water, from the fulness of the vessels of
                    the lungs, and which is increased, in some measure,.when the immersion becomes
                    total, by the pressure of the water on the abdomen, and consequently of the
                    contents of the abdomen on the diaphragm. From the same cause arises also the
                    pulsation in the descending aorta, which has been observed to be much more
                    distinguishable after swimming than at other times <hi rend="italic">(Medical
                    Transactions,</hi> vol. v.); the internal vessels being distended so as to
                    exhibit the effects of the heart’s action more violently, and the heart itself
                    beating with more than usual force in consequence of the exertion, while the
                    contents of the abdomen are compressed, and arc enabled, by the presence of the
                    surrounding fluid, to transmit the pulsation very completely to the superficial
                    parts, to which the hand is applied. The <hi rend="italic">diuretic</hi> effect
                    of a cold bath may be partly explained from a similar distension of the renal
                    vessels, which must be favourable to the secretion of the kidneys; and if the
                    same effect is sometimes produced in a hot bath, when the superficial vessels
                    are rather dilated than contracted, it is in this case much less considerable
                    than in the cold bath, and probably only takes place in consequence of the
                    increased rapidity of the circulation, which affects the whole sanguiferous
                    system.</p>
                <p>The glow which succeeds to the first sensation of cold may be attributed in a
                    great measure to the increased sensibility of the nerves after a partial torpor,
                    rendering them more susceptible of the sensation of heat, which is always
                    relative to the actual temperature of the skin; but it appears, from Dr Currie’s
                    experiments, that there is also sometimes a real increase of heat as measured by
                    the thermometer; and it is probable that the causes concerned in the production
                    of animal heat are called up into a more vigorous exertion, in a strong
                    constitution, whenever dιey are required for the purposes of life; so that they
                    first supply the superficial parts of the body, during the immersion, with as
                    much heat as is necessary to overcome the painful sensation of cold, and
                    afterwards, by a continuation of the same action, occasion an actual elevation
                    of temperature above the natural standard. Dr Currie found, that, during the
                    affusion of a bucket of cold salt water on the heads and whole bodies of two
                    healthy persons, no depression of temperature was observable; but in a minute or
                    two afterwards, although they remained without motion, the mercury rose 2°; in a
                    third person of a feebler constitution, although the temperature remained
                    equally unchanged during the affusion, it sunk, in a minute after, half a
                    degree. These effects seem to be almost entirely independent of any change in
                    the state of the circulation, which must be rather retarded than accelerated,
                    while the generation of heat is increased. It is true, that the heart might be
                    called into more powerful action at the same time that the pulsation at the
                    wrist became feeble, from the permanent contraction of the radial artery; but
                    the action of the heart would still be exhibited by the carotids, undisguised by
                    this modification; and the carotids have not been observed to beat more strongly
                    in the cold bath than at other times, although Dr Currie has remarked, that when
                    “the pulse could hardly be felt at the wrist, the heart pulsated with great
                    steadiness and due force a fact precisely analogous to Dr Parry’s interesting
                    experiment on the carotid of the ewe.</p>
                <p>Warm baths may be classed with propriety among the most useful <hi rend="italic"
                    >sorbefacient</hi> remedies; but it is not easy to decide whether they are much
                    more active in promoting absorption than other sudorifics, or than évacuants in
                    general. When the weather deprives a valetudinarian of his accustomed walk, the
                    bath often affords him a valuable substitute, increasing the appetite and
                    promoting the digestion; but too great an appetite without muscular exercise is
                    sometimes an evil, and this may have been one of the causes of the
                    inconveniences occasioned by an abuse of bathing. A warm bath has often been of
                    advantage in pronioting the absorption of dropsical fluids, especially when they
                    are of limited extent, as in cases of partial anasareous swellings; but the most
                    important sorbefacient effect of bathing is exhibited in the cure of glandular
                    diseases, for which sea-water, whether in the form of a warm or a cold bath, has
                    long been considered as a specific remedy; and there is no doubt that a
                    residence by the sea-side, with a judicious employment of bathing, and the
                    occasional internal use of sea-water, or of some equivalent remedy, has been of
                    the most essential service to many constitutions which have exhibited these
                    symptoms of general debility and languid absorption, the tonic and sorbefacient
                    powers of the remedy being happily combined for invigorating and calling into
                    activity the diminished energies of the constitution.</p>
                <p>The refrigerant or <hi rend="italic">astringent</hi> powers, both of warm and of
                    cold bathing, have been abundantly elucidated by the late Dr Currie, who has
                    introduced the remedy into general practice as a febrifuge, especially in the
                    form of cold or tepid affusion, with the most salutary effects. It is not easy
                    to determine how far the contraction of the superficial vessels by the
                    astringent powers of cold, and how far the <hi rend="italic">retardation</hi> of
                    the pulse, which may possibly be dependent on that contraction, are concerned in
                    the advantage derived from bathing in fevers; but it is at least obvious that
                    the remedy does not operate simply by the abstraction of heat, since the tepid
                    affusion is often more rapidly successful in abating fever than the cold. We may
                    also collect from the experiments of Marcard, that a bath at about 90° is more
                    efficacious in abating the frequency of the pulse, than at any lower or higher
                    temperature; and these facts appear to afford a very strong argument against the
                    hypothesis, that the principal utility of the cold affusion depends on the
                    sudden shock which is given to the nervous system. Dr Currie has frequently
                    found the pulse reduced by a single cold affusion from 120 or 130 to 80 or 90,
                    and the heat from 104° or 106° to the natural standard. But he very properly
                    limits the employment of the remedy to those cases in which the temperature is
                    considerably elevated, apd the arterial system is in strong action, without
                    local inflammation; and where there is less vigour in the system, he often
                    employs the tepid instead of the cold affusion, or even contents himself with
                    moistening the face and the extremities; for instance, in hectic fever, the
                    hands and feet only, which he finds actually hotter than the rest of the body. A
                    late writer on consumption has very justly remarked how much of Dr Currie’s
                    reasoning on the effects of cóld bathing had been anticipated by Galen,
                    although, for want of a thermometer, he had not been able to employ the remedy
                    in fever with safety. “Bathing,” says Dr Young <hi rend="italic">(On Consumptive
                    Diseases,</hi> 8vo, Lond. 1815, p. 135), “is very strongly recommended in the
                    Method of Healing, and the process is very minutely described: first warm air is
                    employed, next warm water, and then cold water, and, lastly, the sweat is wiped
                    off. When we are fatigued or dried up by exercise, the bath restores us to
                    comfort, and defends us from fevers.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195113" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5113-0446"/>
                <p>A strong young man in the country will plunge into cold water at once when
                    heated, and be much refreshed by it. Animals also wash themselves when they are
                    hot, by a natural instinct, as they eat when they are hungry and seek warmth
                    when they are cold. In fevers, if we had sufficient powers of discrimination, we
                    might probably sometimes derive material advantage from the use of the cold
                    bath, without premising the hot; and some persons have been actually benefited
                    by this remedy. But without a more intimate knowledge of diseases than we
                    possess, we cannot generally venture on the practice; and least of all in hectic
                    fever, where there is not strength enough to bear the shock. A stout young man
                    having a fever in warm weather, without visceral inflammation, would bring on a
                    salutary perspiration by bathing in cold water; and if he were in the habit of
                    cold bathing, he might have recourse to it with the more confidence; but for the
                    hectic it is unsafe, especially when there is much emaciation: thus, in a hot
                    and a dry summer, those who have travelled far, and are become thin and weak,
                    have no need of being cooled, nor would it be safe for them to use the cold bath
                    without first going into the warm. For we seem to be hardened by the cold bath
                    like iron, when heated first; and if we previously warm ourselves by exercise,
                    the effect is the same.” Dr Currie’s relation of an adventure of his own might
                    almost be supposed to have been intended as a commentary on these remarks of
                    Galen. <hi rend="italic">(Reports,</hi> p. 120.) “On the 1st of September 1778,
                    two students of medicine at Edinburgh set out on foot on a journey, a
                    considerable part of which lay along one of the rivers of Scotland. They started
                    by sun-rise, and proceeded with alacrity in the cool of the morning. At the end
                    of eight miles they breakfasted, rested for ân hour, and then resumed their
                    journey. The day grew warm as it advanced, and after a march of eight miles
                    more, they arrived heated, but not fatigued, on the banks of the river
                    above-mentioned, about eleven in the forenoon. Urged by the fervour of the day,
                    and tempted by the beauty of the stream, they stripped instantly, and threw
                    themselves into the river. The utmost refreshment followed; and when they
                    retired to the neighbouring inn, this was succeeded by a disposition to sleep,
                    which they indulged. In the afternoon they proceeded, and travelling sixteen
                    miles further at a single stretch, arrived at the inn where they were to sleep,
                    a little after sunset. The afternoon had been warm, and they perspired
                    profusely; but the evening was temperate, and rather cool. They had travelled
                    for some miles slowly, and arrived at the end of their journey stiffened and
                    wearied with their exercise. The refreshment which they had experienced in the
                    morning from bathing induced, however, one of them to repeat the experiment, and
                    he went perfectly cool into the same river, expecting to relax his limbs in the
                    water, and afterwards to enjoy profound sleep. The consequences were very
                    different. The Tweed, which was so refreshing in the morning, now felt extremely
                    cold; and he left the water hastily. No genial glow succeeded, but a feverish
                    chill remained for some time, with a small frequent pulse, and flying pains over
                    the body. Warm liquids and frictions brought on at length considerable heat, and
                    towards morninġ perspiration and sleep followed. Next day about noon they
                    proceeded on foot, but the traveller who bathed was extremely feeble; and though
                    they had to perform a journey of a single stage only, as some part of it was
                    difficult and mountainous, he was obliged to take the assistance of a carriage
                    which overtook them on the road. It was several days before he recovered his
                    usual vigour.”</p>
                <p>The experiments of the Same judicious author, published in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1792, afford some striking illustrations of
                    the effects of severe cold. He employed baths at the temperature of 44° and 40°;
                    the natural pulse of the person subjected to the experiment was about 70 in a
                    minute, and it was generally raised to 85 or more by the preparation for
                    immersion; but in the water it invariably sunk to about 65, becoming firm,
                    regular, and small. The change of temperature, as measured under the tongue, was
                    still more remarkable, and greater than could have been expected either from
                    reasoning or from former observations; for the mercury fell, within a minute or
                    two after immersion, from 90° or 100° to 87° or 88°; it then rose gradually, but
                    not regularly, in a quarter of an hour, to about 96°. Upon a second exposure to
                    the wind, it fell to about 90°, and was in one instance lowered 2° more at the
                    first immersion in a bath of 97∣ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>, in which the
                    natural temperature was by degrees recovered, although not much more rapidly
                    than it had risen during the former immersion in the very cold water; but what
                    raised it by far the most speedily was the application of very hot water to the
                    region of the stomach. When, however, Dr Currie himself went slowly into a bath
                    of 36°, in a light flannel dress, and remained in it for two minutes, no
                    observable alteration was produced in the heat of his body; and this
                    circumstance might almost induce us to suspect that the other subjects of his
                    experiments had incautiously allowed their mouths to be cooled by the inhalation
                    of the cold air. Dr Marcard’s experiments (p. 71) not only confirm the fact of
                    the general retardation and diminution of the pulse by the cold bath; but they
                    show that the retardation commonly extends to all temperatures below that of the
                    human body, becoming, indeed, much more remarkable in the tepid bath than in a
                    bath of the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere, which does not appear to
                    produce the effect with equal uniformity. Thus, in a bath at 60° and at 63° the
                    pulse was rather accelerated than retarded. In six experiments from 70° to 80°
                    inclusive, taking the mean of all the quantities in order to obtain a result
                    less liable to accidental errors, and representing all the experiments in a
                    compendious form, the temperature was 75°, and in 20 minutes the pulse was
                    reduced from 78° to 70°; in four from 80° to 90°, the mean temperature was 87°,
                    and the pulsations were reduced in 54 minutes from 91° to 75°; in three at 90°,
                    the mean reduction in 36 minutes was from 97° to 75°; and three experiments
                    above 90° give for a mean temperature 92°, and a reduction from 82° to 70°,
                    effected in 35 minutes. Martean found a slight reduction of frequency at 93°;
                    but at 96°, according to Dr Parr, there is commonly no observable change.
                    (Marcard, p. 63, 66.)</p>
                <p>From these experiments Dr Marcard very justly infers, that in a great variety of
                    cases, the warm bath affords the only direct and certain mode of lowering the
                    pulse without inconvenience (p. 88); and we must be contented with the empirical
                    knowledge of this fact, without attempting to explain why a temperature of 90°
                    is more favourable for the retardation of the pulse, than a much lower
                    temperature, at which the thermometrical heat would certainly be more rapidly
                    reduced. Dr Stock has also made several observations on the effect of cold
                    bathing on the pulse; but, in his experiments, the retardation was much less
                    constantly observable than the diminution; a variation which frequently occurs
                    when the temperature is very low.</p>
                <p>The salutary effects of cold applications, in some cases of gout, were well known
                    to Hippβcrates, and have been more lately extolled by Homberg, Floyer, and
                    Pietschen. Marcard (p. 256) very properly states the objections to their
                    employment; and, notwithstanding all that Dr King-lake has done to recommend
                    them, they have not been adopted by prudent practitioners, except in very recent
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195126" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5126-0447"/> cases, and in
                    young and unbroken constitutions. Aretaeus prescribes the affusion of cold water
                    for giddiness and headache, and it has certainly been successful in some
                    obstinate cases of this kind (Marcard, p. 255)'; and has even appeared to be a
                    powerful palliative in some descriptions of mania. In fevers, Dr Currie found
                    its effects more permanent than those of the tepid affusion, although not always
                    so speedy. . ,</p>
                <p>We have ample experience of the <hi rend="italic">tonic</hi> powers of bathing in
                    more than one of its forms, although for a long period the great majority of
                    practitioners in Great Britain were disposed to confine these powers within the
                    limits of the cold, or at most of the tepid bath. But travellers in warmer
                    countries had often informed us of the invigorating effect of a warm bath taken
                    after fatigue; and Bruce, in particular, extolled its comforts and its
                    salubrity, from having used it in Egypt. The opinions of Marcard on the same
                    subject were partly made known through Beddoes. Count Rumford, in his thirteenth
                    essay, has exhibited, in a popular point of view, the benefits which he himself
                    derived from taking the warm bath habitually in the middle of the day rather
                    than at night; and Dr Alexander Buchan, in his work on sea-bathing, has assisted
                    in dissipating the remaining prejudices against its employment as a mild tonic.
                    For feeble or enervated constitutions, and for persons who have suffered from
                    great fatigue, it is decidedly preferable to the cold bath; but as the strength
                    is gradually recovered, it may often increase its efficacy to lower the
                    temperature by degrees. We may begin, for instance, with a warm bath at 96° or
                    98°, and lower it by degrees to 90° or a little less; and hence the transition
                    to the open sea in the middle of a summer’s day will not be too abrupt, the
                    water being often heated to 70° or more on a coast well suited for bathing; and
                    if the constitution appears to acquire strength under the experiment, the hour
                    of bathing may be made earlier and earlier, until the temperature is no higher
                    than about 60°. The time of remaining in the water may also be modified
                    according to the powers of the constitution, a single immersion being the most
                    easily supported, and a longer continuance in the water, till the sensation of
                    cold has subsided, calling forth the faculty of generating heat into fuller
                    action; observing always not only how the health appears to be affected, but
                    which mode is the most conducive to the pleasure or comfort of the individual,
                    which will often throw some light on the operation of the remedy. In most cases
                    it will be found, that where either warm or cold bathing agrees with the
                    constitution, it is followed by a sense of youth and vigour, and
                    self-complacency, which is equally agreeable and salubrious. We must also make
                    allowances for peculiarities of constitution, which may require a deviation from
                    the temperature usually recommended. Thus there are some persons who have so
                    singular a sensibility as to feel a bath of 110° not too warm, and to be
                    absolutely chilled by a bath of 100°; and in such cases it is probable that at
                    105° the pulse would not be materially accelerated. In other instances the cold
                    bath produces headache and dejection of spirits. This inconvenience is sometimes
                    obviated by proper evacuations, which should also always be premised to bathing,
                    where there is any appearance of visceral disease, or of congestion of any kind.
                    The sea-water will answer this purpose sufficiently well, either alone or mixed
                    with warm milk, or with some chamomile flowers infused in it; but it has no
                    material advantage over any other cathartic which may be preferred by the
                    patient. It is also recommended by all authors on cold bathing to plunge in head
                    foremost, and this precaution is highly proper where there is any apprehension
                    of headache; but in other cases it is °f little moment. If, after all, the cold
                    bath continues to disagree, it will be generally advisable to exchange it for
                    the warm; and after a time it may be proper to give the cold a second trial.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary to enter into a minute detail of the diseases in which bathing
                    is useful as a tonic. It is, however, particularly indicated in a variety of
                    complaints which are peculiar to females; and to weakly children, especially
                    such as are ricketty and scrofulous, sea bathing is most essentially necessary.
                    On the other hand, cold bathing is almost universally to be avoided where there
                    is any consumptive disease, or any inflammatory affection of any of the internal
                    parts; an exception which is easily understood, from the natural tendency of
                    cold to cause a congestion of blood in the vessels of those parts, in
                    consequence of the contraction of the superficial vessels. The sudorific effect
                    of the warm bath, followed by the refrigerant quality of the tepid, and the
                    tonic powers of the cold, exhibit a succession of remedies nearly analogous to
                    the mode of treatment which is usually found to be most successful in fevers of
                    various kinds; in most of which we begin with sudorific medicines, and proceed
                    to astringents and tonics. Hippocrates, in his book on the use of liquids,
                    observes that gout is one of the diseases in which both hot and cold
                    applications afford effectual relief; and the remark is equally just with
                    respect to some cases of rheumatism; but, more commonly, the best mode of using
                    baths in rheumatism is to begin with a bath raised, during the immersion, to as
                    high a temperature as the patient can bear, so as to act as a powerful
                    sudorific, and to continue the course, when the pain has been relieved, at lower
                    and lower temperatures, ending it with cold bathing in the open sea.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the acknowledged utility of warm bathing in a variety of
                    circumstances, there may possibly have been some exaggeration in the marvellous
                    opinions which have been sometimes entertained of its utility for the
                    prolongation of life. Galen has indeed mentioned a number of persons who had
                    attained a great age, and who were in the habit of making daily use of the bath,
                    which is enough to prove that such a habit cannot be extremely pernicious; and
                    if we supposed a constitution to retain all its energies, but to have them
                    concealed and obscured for want of proper stimuli, the warm bath might tend to
                    remove the evil; but it is more natural to believe that the approach of old age
                    has a tendency to weaken the radical powers of the constitution, which cannot
                    afford to be roused into disproportionate exertion; and to apprehend that the
                    temporary vivacity and activity superinduced by any foreign agent, whether by
                    warm bathing or by a removal to a warmer climate, would only tend still more to
                    exhaust the already diminished store of vitality.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">narcotic</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sedative,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">specifically</hi> antispasmodic, effects of bathing are most
                    effectually exhibited, in ordinary cases, by the warm or tepid bath, which is
                    often employed for the relief of pain, and for the removal of any irregular or
                    convulsive affection. Possibly also the effect of the warm bath in retarding the
                    pulse may be partly derived from its sedative power as affecting the heart; and
                    if we take this connection for granted, we may infer from it, that the
                    antispasmodic effect will be most advantageously obtained from a bath at 90°,
                    which has been found to retard the pulse most effectually. But where there is
                    internal inflammation, it may be desirable to dilate the superficial vessels by
                    a bath somewhat hotter than this, so as to relieve the internal parts from a
                    part of the fluid which distends them, but without increasing the velocity of
                    the circulation by too high a temperature. The cold affusion is also a powerful
                    remedy in many cases of tetanic disease. Hippocrates <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Aph.</hi> v. 21) has remarked, that it often creates a glow which overpowers
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195139" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5139-0448"/> the
                    convulsive contraction, especially where the subject is young and athletic, the
                    weather hot, and the disease independent of local injury; and the modern
                    experience of Dr Wright and Dr Currie has confirmed and extended the
                    observation. In another passage he tells us (∠4∕&gt;A. V. 25), that the abundant
                    affusion of cold water generally relieves and removes swellings and pains in the
                    limbs, as well as spasms, producing a moderate degree of torpor, which
                    supersedes the pain; but, in fact, the relief of inflammatory affections by cold
                    is rather to be referred to its astringent than to its sedative powers. This is,
                    indeed, a point which has been much discussed by modern theorists; but it must
                    be confessed that all our theories are of little importance in physic, any
                    further than as they assist us in clearly comprehending and distinctly
                    remembering the facts, which we derive from immediate experience in the
                    treatment of diseases. <hi rend="smallcaps">(l. l.)</hi></p>
