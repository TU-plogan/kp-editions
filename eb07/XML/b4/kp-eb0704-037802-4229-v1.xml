                <p><label type="entry">BARD</label>, a word denoting a poet by profession, who, to
                    use the language of Ossian, “sung of the battles of heroes, or the heaving
                    breasts of love.” .</p>
                <p>Anciently bards were necessary persons at every festival and at every solemnity.
                    Their songs, which, by recording the achievements of kings and heroes, animated
                    the soul of the hearer, must have been the entertainment of every warlike
                    nation. Wc have Hesiod’s authority, that in his time bards were as common as
                    potters or joiners, and as liable to envy. Cicero reports, that anciently at
                    Roman festivals the virtues and exploits of their great men were celebrated in
                    song. The same custom prevailed in I ’ θ <hi rend="superscript"> ru</hi> and
                    Mexico, as we learn from Garcilasso and other authors. But in no part of the
                    world did the profession of bard appear with such lustre as in Gaul, in Britain,
                    and in Ireland<pb break="no" facs="nls:193194242?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-4242-0379"/>. Wherever the Celtae or Gauls are mentioned by
                    ancient writers, we seldom fail to hear of their druids and their bards, the
                    institution of which two orders was the capital distinction of their manners and
                    policy. The druids were their philosophers and priests, the bards their poets
                    and recorders of heroic actions; and both these orders of men seem to have
                    subsisted among them as chief members of the state from time immemorial. The
                    Celtae possessed, from very remote ages, a regular system of discipline and
                    manners, which appears to have had a deep and lasting influence. Ammianus
                    Marcellinus expressly declares, that there flourished amongst them the study of
                    the most laudable arts, introduced by the bards, whose office it was to sing in
                    heroic verse the gallant actions of illustrious men; and by the druids, who
                    lived together in colleges or societies, after the Pythagorean manner,
                    philosophizing upon the highest subjects, and asserting the immortality of the
                    human soul. Though Julius Caesar, in his account of Gaul, does not expressly
                    mention the bards, yet it is plain that, under the title of druids, he
                    comprehends that whole college or order, of which the bards, who, it is
                    probable, were the disciples of the druids, undoubtedly made a part. It deserves
                    remark, that, according to his account, the druidical institution first took its
                    rise in Britain, and passed from thence into Gaul; so that they who aspired to
                    be thorough masters of that learning were wont to resort to Britain. He adds,
                    too, that such as were to be initiated among the druids were obliged to commit
                    to memory a great number of verses, insomuch that some employed twenty years in
                    this course of education; and that they did not think it lawful to record these
                    poems in writing, but handed them down by tradition from race to race.</p>
                <p>So strong was the attachment of the Celtic nations to their poetry and their
                    bards, that amidst all the changes of their government and manners, even long
                    after the order of the druids had been extinct, and the national religion
                    altered, the bards continued to flourish, not as a set of strolling songsters,
                    like the Greek <hi rend="italic">aωδoι</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >rhapsodists</hi> in Homer’s time, but as an order of men highly respected in
                    the state, and supported by a public establishment. According to the testimonies
                    of Strabo and Diodorus, they existed before the age of Augustus Caesar; and we
                    find them flourishing under that sovereign, and exercising the same functions as
                    of old, in Ireland and in the north of Scotland, almost down to our own times.
                    It is well known that, in both these countries, every <hi rend="italic"
                    >regulus</hi> or chief had his own bard, who was considered an officer of rank
                    and consequence in his little court.</p>
                <p>The bards, as well as the druids, were exempted from taxes and military services,
                    even in times of the greatest danger; and when they attended their patrons in
                    the field to record and celebrate their great actions, they had a guard assigned
                    them for their protection. At all festivals and public assemblies they were
                    seated near the person of the king or chieftain, and sometimes even above the
                    greatest nobility and chief officers of the court. Nor was the profession of the
                    bards less lucrative than it was honourable. For, besides the valuable presents
                    which they occasionally received from their patrons when they gave them uncommon
                    pleasure by their performances, they had estates in land allotted for their
                    support. Nay, <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> θ great was the veneration which
                    the princes of these times entertained for the persons of their poets, and so
                    highly were they charmed and delighted with their tuneful strains, that they
                    sometimes pardoned even their capital crimes for a song.</p>
