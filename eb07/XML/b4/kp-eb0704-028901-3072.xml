                <p><label type="entry">BAILLY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Jean Sylvain</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated philosopher and astronomer, was born at Paris on the 15th of
                    September 1736. He was .originally intended for the professicn of painting,
                    which his family had pursued for several generations, and he even had made some
                    progress in the art. But the bias of his mind leaned too much to literary
                    pursuits, especially to poetry and works of imagination, to permit him to give
                    that application which is necessary to secure success and eminence in any
                    profession.</p>
                <p>The friends of Bailly, who had witnessed the early dawn of his genius, saw that
                    it was alike fitted to appear with advantage in the study of polite literature,
                    or to shine in the walks of science; and they recommended the latter chiefly to
                    his attention. His acquaintance with Lacaille, the celebrated geometer,
                    commenced; and this at once decided the object of his studies, which were now
                    almost entirely devoted to scientific investigations. The first of his labours
                    was a calculation of the comet which appeared in the year 1759. In January 1763
                    he was admitted a member of the Academy of Sciences; and in the same year he
                    published a reduction of the observations made by Lacaille in 1760 and 1761 on
                    the zodiacal stars: an elaborate compilation, and of very extensive utility. His
                    attention was afterwards directed to the consideration of the theory of
                    Jupiter’s satellites. Lagrange, who now promised<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193193085" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3085-0290"/> to become the first
                    mathematician in Europe, was the formidable rival of Bailly in the competition
                    for this prize question in 1764. The results of his investigations were
                    collected into a treatise, which also contained the history of that part of
                    astronomy, and were published in 1766. In 1771 appeared his interesting and
                    important memoir on the Light of the Satellites, which was marked with a degree
                    of precision and accuracy till that time unknown in the observations of their
                    eclipses.</p>
                <p>The studies of Bailly were not entirely limited to the cultivation of abstract
                    science, nor to profound physical speculations; his genius shone with equal
                    lustre in those departments of literature which require a discrimination of
                    character, and no common powers of eloquence, in order to attain excellence. His
                    <hi rend="italic">Eloges</hi> on Charles V., Corneille, Leibnitz, Molière, Cook,
                    Lacaille, and Gresset, were universally admired as valuable specimens of fine
                    writing, and they added much to his reputation. The distinguished place of
                    secretary of the Academy of Sciences became vacant in 1771; and, supported by
                    the patronage and influence of Buffon, he offered himself a candidate. But, in
                    this instance, he was unsuccessful. Condorcet, then rising into reputation, and
                    supported by the active influence of D’Alembert, was preferred to the
                    office.</p>
                <p>In the year 1775 he published at Paris the first volume of his great work, the
                    <hi rend="italic">History of Astronomy,</hi> containing the history of astronomy
                    from its origin to the foundation of the Alexandrian School; and this was
                    followed by three volumes on the history of modern astronomy, published between
                    1776 and 1783. This work, which is of inestimable value, is distinguished alike
                    for animated description, luminous narration, and interesting detail. Besides,
                    he published, in 1777, a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Letters on the Origin
                    of the Sciences, and of the People of Asia;</hi> and this was followed by
                    another series of <hi rend="italic">Letters on the Atlantis of Plato, and the
                    Ancient History of Asia,</hi> as a continuation of the same work. These volumes
                    were addressed to Voltaire, with whom he had commenced an ingenious
                    correspondence and discussion on this curious subject. The coincidence of his
                    opinions with those of Buffon in points respecting some of the favourite
                    theories of the latter, brought on an intimate acquaintance and close friendship
                    with that celebrated naturalist; which, however, declined and was entirely
                    dissolved, in consequence of the opposition which Bailly made to the election of
                    the Abbé Maury into the French Academy. Bailly had been chosen secretary of the
                    academy in 1784; and in the following year he was admitted into the Academy of
                    Inscriptions and Belles Lettres. This was the only instance, since the time of
                    Fontenelle, of the same person being at once a member of all the three
                    academies.</p>
                <p>In the year 1784 he was nominated one of the commission to investigate the nature
                    of the animal magnetism of Mesmer; and he drew up a very elegant report, which
                    was presented to the academy of Sciences. This report, which was soon afterwards
                    translated into English, not only marked the acuteness and discernment of the
                    author, and contained the most satisfactory and decisive evidence with regard to
                    its object, but it may be held up as an excellent model of imitation for those
                    who are engaged in similar investigations. In developing the physical effects
                    produced by moral causes, it is of the greatest value; and it is particularly
                    interesting when we consider the political influence which causes of this nature
                    have exerted on the general opinions of society, and even on the destiny of
                    nations.</p>
                <p>In 1787 he published, in one volume 4to, the <hi rend="italic">History of Indian
                    and Oriental Astronomy ļ</hi> a work of great erudition and ability, but in
                    which he is thought to have made some erroneous calculations, and to have
                    overrated the antiquity of the Indian observations.</p>
                <p>Hitherto we have contemplated Bailly in the shades of retirement, and in the calm
                    undisturbed retreats of philo- ' sophy, employing the energy of a vigorous and
                    comprehensive mind in the profound researches of physical truth. We are now to
                    follow him in his political career, and to behold him struggling with the
                    adverse interests of factions, and contending with the unbridled fury of a
                    lawless mob, in defence of the rights of a people whose minds were not prepared
                    to understand, and whose habits were not yet formed to enjoy, the blessings of
                    rational liberty. He was one of the first and most zealous promoters of the
                    revolution in France; and in the part which he acted in this bloody struggle, he
                    has had the good fortune to be well spoken of by opposite factions. He has never
                    been charged with want of integrity or with selfish designs; but apparently
                    actuated by a misguided zeal, and dazzled with the prospect of freedom which the
                    warmth of his imagination held out, he rashly committed himself in a cause
                    which, as he had espoused it with enthusiasm, so he supported it with his utmost
                    exertions. But in that cause he fell a sacrifice to the unrelenting spirit of
                    violence and faction which had been easily roused, but which it was found
                    impossible either to subdue or to regulate. When the states-general of France
                    were assembled in 1789, he was elected a deputy to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tiers-etat,</hi> of which he was afterwards chosen president; and when the
                    national assembly had been constituted, he continued in the chair, and
                    officiated as president at the time the king’s proclamation was issued ordering
                    that body to disperse. During the struggle which took place between the national
                    assembly and the court, Bailly was amongst the most forward in asserting those
                    popular rights which were then new in France; and it was he who dictated the
                    famous oath to the members of the <hi rend="italic">tiers-état,</hi> by which
                    they pledged themselves “to resist tyrants and tyranny, and never to separate
                    till they had obtained a free constitution.” On the 14th of July following, the
                    day on which the Bastille was stormed and taken by the people, he was appointed
                    mayor of Paris with universal consent. In this high office he is allowed to have
                    acted with great integrity, courage, and moderation, and to have discharged its
                    arduous and sometimes perilous duties in a manner highly honourable to his
                    character. While he held this conspicuous situation, he was instrumental in
                    promoting the various measures by which the popular party at length prevailed
                    over that of the court; for which, as well as for his conduct in other respects,
                    he obtained a high degree of favour among the people. But the tide of public
                    opinion now swelled beyond all bounds; and no restraint could oppose its violent
                    course. The multitude, newly unshackled from the fetters of despotism, greedy of
                    novelty fired with enthusiastic and unsettled notions of freedom, and daily
                    panting for change, would brook no opposition. Bailly, who now perhaps saw when
                    it was too late the general disposition of the people to anarchy, still wished
                    the laws to be respected, and hoped by their vigorous execution to restore and
                    maintain tranquillity. He ordered some deputies from the military insurgents of
                    Nancy to be arrested, and firmly opposed the rash proceedings of Marat and
                    Hebert; he became a member of a less promiscuous club than that of the Jacobins;
                    and he exerted himself strongly to persuade the populace to permit the king and
                    royal family to depart to St Cloud. By these measures, which were little
                    relished by a fickle and infuriated people, he lost their confidence and favour.
                    But what finally destroyed his popularity, was his conduct on the occasion of
                    the tumultuous meeting of the populace on the 17th of July 1791, to demand the
                    abolition of monarchy; for being called by the national assembly to disperse the
                    mob, who had assaulted the soldiery, he ordered <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193193098" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3098-0291"/>the latter to fire, by which
                    means forty persons were killed and above a hundred wounded. Having thus become
                    obnoxious to the people, whom he had faithfully served, it was no longer
                    desirable for him to hold his charge. He therefore resigned his office at the
                    dissolution of the constituent assembly in the end of the year 1791; and having
                    resumed his philosophical researches, lived for some time in retirement. But the
                    times of bloody proscription approached; and he was doomed to fall a sacrifice
                    to the ferocious vengeance of the plebeian tyrant who now bore unlimited sway.
                    He was accordingly denounced as an enemy to the republic, arrested, and thrown
                    into prison. Arraigned before a sanguinary tribunal, he was summarily condemned
                    to death as a conspirator, and executed the day following, near the spot where
                    he had given the order for the military to fire on the people. On the day of
                    execution, his sufferings, which he bore with the utmost calmness and
                    magnanimity, were studiously protracted. Instead of that sympathy and compassion
                    which even the worst and the lowest criminal often experiences when he is about
                    to expiate his offences with his life, he was treated by an incensed and
                    fanatical populace with the most ignominious indignity and cruelty. He wore the
                    red shirt, or badge of conspiracy, and was placed in a cart with his hands tied
                    behind his back. During the whole time of his progress to the place of
                    execution, the rain poured incessantly on his head. ’ The populace, as he
                    passed, threw mud at him, and cruelly insulted him with every kind of
                    opprobrious language. Arrived at the place of execution, it was found necessary
                    to remove the guillotine from the spot where it had first been erected, to
                    firmer ground. During this time he was forced to get out of the cart, and walk
                    round the field, in order to gratify more fully the implacable and unrelenting
                    malice of the populace. While he was ascending the platform, a spectator who
                    happened to be near him, exclaimed, in a tone of insult, “Bailly, you tremble
                    “Yes,” he instantly replied, “but it is from cold.”</p>
                <p>Several works written by Bailly, and found in manuscript, have been published
                    since his death; particularly an <hi rend="italic">Essay on Fables and their
                    History,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of a Witness of the Revolution,</hi>
                    which come down to October 1789.</p>
                <p>In his person Bailly was tall, and of a sedate but striking countenance. He
                    possessed great firmness and decision of character; but in him these qualities
                    were far removed from sullenness or apathy. Few philosophers have been more
                    distinguished in so many various departments of science and literature, or have
                    acquired such deserved reputation. In his public stations, as well as in the
                    retirement of domestic life, his integrity and disinterestedness remained pure
                    and untainted. In the time of his magistracy he spent part of his fortune in
                    relieving the wants of the poor. His wife, whom he married in 1787, survived
                    him. She was the widow of Raymond Gaye, who had been his intimate friend for
                    twenty-five years.</p>
