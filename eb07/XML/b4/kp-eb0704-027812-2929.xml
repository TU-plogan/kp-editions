                <p><label type="entry">BAGDAD</label>, a city of Asia, formerly the capital of the
                    empire of the caliph, and long renowned for its commerce and its wealth. It is
                    situated on an extensive and desert plain, with scarcely a tree or village
                    throughout its whole extent; and, though it is intersected by the Tigris, it
                    stands mostly on its north-east bank, close to the water’s edge. Old Bagdad on
                    the west is now considered only as a suburb to the larger and more modern city
                    on the eastern shore. It has, however, numerous and extensive streets, well
                    furnished with shops, and is protected by strong walls, and three gates opening
                    towards Hillah on the Euphrates and Kazameen. Beyond these recent bulwarks,
                    vestiges of ancient buildings, spreading in various directions, are visible in
                    the plain, which is strewed with fragments of brick, tiles, and rubbish. A
                    burying-ground has extended itself over a large tract of land formerly occupied
                    by the streets of the city; and here is the tomb of Zobeida, the favourite wife
                    of Haroun el Raschid, built of brick, of a high octagonal shape, and surmounted
                    by a lofty superstructure in the form of a cone. The two towns of Old and New
                    Bagdad are connected by a ruinous bridge of thirty pontoons, so decayed that few
                    of the natives venture across it. The form of the new city is that of an
                    irregular oblong, about 1500 paces in length by 800 in breadth; and a brick
                    wall, 1500 paces in length and about five miles in circuit, incloses the town on
                    both sides of the river. This wall, which is built of brick, has been
                    constructed and repaired at different periods; and, as in most other works of
                    the same nature in Mahommedan countries, the oldest portion is the best, and the
                    more modern the worst part of the fabric. At the principal angles are large
                    round towers, with smaller towers intervening at short distances; and on these
                    large towers batteries are planted, with about fifty brass cannon of different
                    calibre, badly mounted. On two of these angular towers, Mr Buckingham remarked
                    that the workmanship is equal to any ancient masonry that he had ever seen. The
                    wall has three gates, one on the south-east, one on the north-east, and a third
                    on the north-west of the city; and it is surrounded by a dry ditch of
                    considerable depth. The town has been built without the slight· est regard to
                    regularity. The streets are even more intricate and winding than those in many
                    other eastern towns; and, with the exception of the bazars and some open
                    squares, the interior is little else than a labyrinth of alleys and passages.
                    The streets are unpaved, and in many places so narrow that two horsemen can
                    scarcely pass each other; and as it is seldom that the houses have windows
                    facing the great public thoroughfares, and the doors are small and mean, they
                    present on both sides the gloomy appearance of dead walls. All the buildings,
                    both public and private, are constructed of furnace-burnt bricks, of a yellowish
                    red colour, taken chiefly from the ruins of other <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193192942" xml:id="kp-eb0704-2942-0279"/>edifices, as their rounded
                    angles evidently show. A house is generally laid out in ranges of apartments
                    opening into a square interior court, and furnished with subterranean rooms
                    called <hi rend="italic">serdaubs,</hi> into which the inhabitants retreat
                    during the day for shelter from the intense heats of summer; and with terraced
                    roofs, on which they take their evening meal, and sleep in the open air. In the
                    months of June, July, and August, the thermometer at break of day generally
                    stands at 112° of Fahrenheit; at noon it rises to 119°, and a little before two
                    o’clock to 122°; at sunset it is about 117°, and at midnight H4°. In some
                    seasons it rises even higher; and at these times the inhabitants during the day
                    take refuge in the subterranean apartments, where they contrive, by every
                    possible device, to mitigate the intolerable heat. In the interior the houses of
                    the rich are splendidly furnished, and ornamented in the ceilings with a sort of
                    chequered work, which has a grand appearance. A great portion of the ground
                    within the walls of the town is unoccupied by buildings, especially in the
                    north-eastern quarter; and even in the more populous parts of the city, near the
                    river, there is a considerable space between the houses, occupied by gardens, in
                    which are produced pomegranates, grapes, figs, olives, and dates, in great
                    abundance, so that the city, when seen from a distance, has the appearance of
                    rising out of the midst of trees.</p>
                <p>The public buildings in Bagdad are chiefly the mosques, the khans or
                    caravanserais, and the serai or palace of the pasha. This latter building, which
                    is situated in the north-western quarter of the town, not far from the Tigris,
                    is rather distinguished for extent than grandeur; it is a comparatively modern
                    structure, and being built at different periods, it forms a large and confused
                    pile, without either architecture, beauty, or strength. There are no remains of
                    the ancient palace of the caliphs.</p>
                <p>In all Mahommedan cities the mosques are conspicuous objects. The number in
                    Bagdad is above 100; but of these not more than thirty are distinguished by
                    their particular minarets or steeples, the rest being merely chapels and
                    venerated places of prayer. The most ancient of these mosques was erected in the
                    year of the Hegira 633, or 1235 of the Christian era, by the Caliph Mostanser.
                    All that remains of the original building is the minaret, and a small portion of
                    the outer walls; the former a short, thick, heavy column of the most ungraceful
                    proportions, built of bricks, diagonally crossed, and of various colours. The
                    jamah or mosque of Merjameeah, not far distant from the former, though the body
                    of it is modern, has some remains of old and very rich arabesque work on its
                    surface. The door is formed by a lofty arch of the pointed form, bordered on
                    both sides by rich bands exquisitely sculptured, and having numerous
                    inscriptions. The mosque of Khassakey is chiefly distinguished by the niche for
                    prayer, which, instead of a simple and unadorned recess, is crowned by a Roman
                    arch, with square pedestals, spirally-fluted shafts, a rich capital of flowers,
                    and a fine fan or shell-top in the Roman and not in the Arabic taste. Around the
                    arch is a sculptured frieze; and down the centre, at the back of the niche, is a
                    broad band, richly sculptured with vases, flowers, &amp;c. in the very best
                    style of workmanship; the whole executed on a white and fine ground marble. The
                    mosque of the vizier, near the Tigris, has a fine dome and ļofty minaret; and
                    the great mosque in the square of El - Iaidan is also a noble building. The
                    others do not merit any particular notice. The domes at Bagdad are mostly high,
                    and disproportionately narrow. They are richly ornamented with glazed tiles and
                    painting, the colours chiefly green and white, which being reflected from a
                    polished surface, give rather a liveliness than a magnificence to the aspect of
                    these buildings. But, in the opinion of Mr Buckingham, they are not to be
                    compared to the rich and stately domes of Egypt, as the minarets, although they
                    have the same bright assemblage of colours, are far from being equal “to the
                    plain and grave dignity of some of the Turkish towers at Diarbekir, Aleppo, and
                    Damascus, or to the lighter elegance of many of those in the larger towns on the
                    banks of the Nile.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>There are about thirty khans or caravanserais in Bagdad, all of inferior
                    construction to those in the other large towns of Turkey. The bazars, which are
                    numerous, are mostly formed of long, straight, and tolerably wide avenues. The
                    one most recently built is the longest and the best, though it has still an air
                    of meanness about it not common in the bazars of large Turkish cities. It is
                    long, wide, and lofty, and well filled with dealers and wares of all sorts.
                    Several of these bazars are vaulted over with brick work; but the greater number
                    are merely covered with flat beams laid across, to support a roof of straw,
                    dried leaves, or branches of trees and grass. There are about fifty baths in
                    Bagdad, which are also far inferior in their accommodations to those in the
                    other large towns of Mesopotamia.</p>
                <p>Bagdad is about 500 miles from the mouth of the Tigris, including its windings,
                    and about 400 from Bussora; and with this latter place it carries on a constant
                    communication by means of boats, from twenty to fifty tons burden, though the
                    river is navigable for larger vessels. With a northerly wind these boats will
                    make the passage to Bussora in seven or eight days; in calms, when they have
                    merely the aid of the current, the passage occupies from ten to fifteen days.
                    Sir R. K. Porter mentions that the stream of the Tigris runs at the rate of
                    seven knots an hour. This, however, is probably during floods, since, with such
                    a powerful current, a boat could not occupy ten or fifteen days on its passage
                    from Bagdad to Bussora. In coming up the stream, thirty or forty days are
                    consumed before reaching Bagdad. The smaller craft, used for bringing supplies
                    of provisions and fruit to the city, are circular boats of basket-work, covered
                    with skins, the same that have been employed from the remotest antiquity. The
                    communication with Bussora used formerly to be carried on by the way of Hillah
                    on the Euphrates; but the banks of this river are now in possession of a tribe
                    of Arabs, who detain and plunder all vessels sailing down the river, and
                    frequently murder the crews. The Euphrates and the Tigris are liable to spring
                    floods; and the streams of both rivers being joined, inundate the desert plain
                    on which Bagdad stands, when the city appears like an island in the midst of the
                    sea. The inhabitants are supplied with water from the Tigris, which is brought
                    to their houses in goats’ skins; the convenience of waterworks, cisterns, and
                    pipes, being entirely unknown.</p>
                <p>Bagdad has declined from its ancient importance. It was formerly a great emporium
                    of eastern commerce; and it still receives, by way of Bussora, from Bengal, the
                    manufactures and produce of India, which are distributed over Arabia, Syria,
                    Koordistan, Armenia, and Asia Minor. This trade has increased, owing to the
                    moderate demands of the government, from two annual vessels to six under the
                    English flag, besides those under Arabian colours. At the same time the inland
                    trade from Persia and the East has declined. The productions and manufactures of
                    Persia which were intended for the Syrian, Armenian, and Turkish markets, and
                    were sent to Bagdad as a central depot, now reach Constantinople by the more
                    direct route <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192955" xml:id="kp-eb0704-2955-0280"
                    />of Erzerum and Tocat. Wealth appears to be deficient among all classes, and
                    Bagdad has many symptoms of a decayed city.</p>
                <p>The population is a mixture of nations from various quarters of the East. The
                    chief officers of government, whether civil or military, are of the families of
                    Constantinopolitan Turks, though they are mostly natives of the city; the
                    merchants and traders are almost all of Arabian descent; while the lower classes
                    consist of Turks, Arabs, Persians, and Indians. There are some Jews and
                    Christians, who still remain distinct from the other classes; while the
                    strangers in the town are Koords, Persians, and Desert Arabs in considerable
                    numbers. The dress of the Bagdad Turks is not nearly so gay or splendid as that
                    of their northern countrymen; and the costume of the Bagdad residents is, upon
                    the whole, unusually plain in comparison with that of other Asiatics. As every
                    nation retains its own peculiar dress, it may be easily conceived what an
                    amusing variety of costume must be seen in the streets of Bagdad. The dress of
                    the females is as mean as that used in the poorest villages of Mesopotamia;
                    women of all classes being enveloped in a blue checked cloth, such as is worn by
                    the lowest orders in Egypt, and having their faces covered by hideous veils of
                    black horse-hair.</p>
                <p>Bagdad is governed by a pasha, assisted by a council. The pasha receives his
                    appointment from the sultan of Constantinople; which, however, has to be
                    ratified by the public voice, not ascertained by votes, but expressed in the
                    tumultuous acclamations of the populace. The pasha is chosen from a body of
                    Georgian Mamelukes, maintained by importations from Georgia, which are said to
                    increase every year. Among this body are distributed all the lucrative offices,
                    as well as all the military commands. The pasha has a force of 2000 horsemen, 10
                    pieces of artillery, and a body-guard consisting of 1000 men. On particular
                    emergencies he can call for the service of some Arab tribes of the Desert, who
                    are bound to this duty in return for provisions supplied by the pasha; the
                    pashas of Koordistan also aid him with 5000 or 6000 horse in case of need; so
                    that on a short notice he can collect a force of 20,000 or 30,000 undisciplined
                    troops for the defence of the city. He is generally considered as quite
                    independent of the sultan of Constantinople. His revenue arises from a
                    custom-duty on all merchandise entering Bagdad; and he seldom resorts to forced
                    exactions for the supply of his treasury. The moderation and justice pursued by
                    the government has the effect of giving great activity to commerce, and general
                    satisfaction to all engaged in it. The police of Bagdad is extremely defective,
                    and murders frequently take place at the gates of the palace and of the great
                    mosque, without any attempt being made to bring the criminals to justice. Mr
                    Buckingham mentions, that one murder was committed in open day, on the street,
                    before a hundred witnesses, no one of whom thought of interfering; it being,
                    according to the maxims of the Arabs, an affair of blood, which it belonged to
                    the relatives of the slain to revenge, or the pasha to investigate, and which
                    they had no business to meddle with. Robberies are also frequently committed
                    with impunity. The English and French maintain each a consul at Bagdad. The late
                    Mr Rich, whose amiable qualities furnish a theme of praise to every traveller,
                    was appointed to that situation by the East India company, with a large
                    establishment, and was considered the most powerful man in Bagdad next to the
                    pasha.</p>
                <p>Bagdad was founded by Al Mansour, second caliph of the race of Abbas, in the
                    145th year of the Hegira <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. d.</hi> 747). It was adorned
                    with many noble and stately edifices by the magnificence of the renowned Haroun
                    el Racshid, who also built on the eastern side of the river, connecting the two
                    quarters of the town by a bridge of boats. Under the auspices of Zobeida, the
                    wife of that prince, and Jaffer Barmecide, his favourite, the city may be said
                    to have attained its greatest splendour, lt continued to flourish and increase,
                    and to be the seat of elegance and learning, until the 656th year of the Hegira
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. d.</hi> 1257), when Holakoo the Tartar, the grandson of
                    Genghis Khan, took it by storm, and extinguished for ever the reign of the
                    Abbassides. The Tartars retained possession of Bagdad till about the year 1400
                    of our era, when it was taken by Tamerlane, from whom the sultan Ahmed Ben Avis
                    fled, and finding refuge with the Greek emperor, contrived afterwards to
                    repossess himself of the city, whence he was finally expelled by KaraŸusefin
                    1417. In 1477 his descendants were driven out by Usum Cassim, who reigned 39
                    years in Bagdad, when Shah Ismael the First, the founder of the royal house of
                    Sefé, made himself master of it. From that time it continued for a long period
                    an object of contention between the Turks and Persians. It was taken by Soliman
                    the Magnificent, and retaken by Shah Abbas the Great; and it was afterwards
                    besieged by Amurath the Fourth, with an army of 300,000 men. After an obstinate
                    resistance, it was forced to surrender, A. <hi rend="smallcaps">d.</hi> 1638,
                    when, contrary to the terms of the capitulation, most of the inhabitants were
                    massacred by torch-light. Since this period it has remained under a nominal
                    subjection to the Turks. Ashmed, the greatest of the pashas of Bagdad, and the
                    first who rendered the pashalic independent of the porte, defended the town with
                    such courage and success against Nadir Shah, that he was compelled to raise the
                    siege, after suffering great loss. The population of Bagdad is variously
                    estimated at from 50,000 to 100,000. Mr Buckingham’s estimate is 80,000, which
                    is probably not far from the truth. Long. 44. 24. E. Lat. 33. 21. N.

                    of Asia, and is computed to extend 840 miles in length by 636 in breadth. It
                    stretches, in a north-west direction, from the mouth of the Shat-ul-Arab at
                    Bussora, to Merdin, situated near the source of the Tigris; and from the
                    confines of Persia west to the banks of the Khabaur, which separates it from the
                    pashalic of Orfa. Its general boundaries are the Euphrates and the Arabian
                    desert of Nedjed to the west and south, Kusistan and Mount Zagros to the east,
                    the pashalic of Diarbekir to the north-west, and Armenia with the territories of
                    the Kurdish chief of Julamerick to the north. This great tract comprehends
                    ancient Babylonia, and the greatest part of Assyria Proper. The first includes
                    the space inclosed by the Tigris and the Euphrates, which is also known under
                    the general appellation of Mesopotamia; and the second, that which is beyond the
                    Tigris, commonly called the Lower Koordistan. This tract of country is an
                    extensive plain, extremely fertile, and is watered by the Tigris and the
                    Euphrates, which at Bagdad approach within 25 miles of each other, and afford an
                    inexhaustible supply of the finest water. Only some parts of those fertile
                    districts, however, are cultivated, as the population consists in many places of
                    wandering Arabs, who are averse to agriculture, and who, in their vagrant life
                    of idleness and rapine, neglect all the natural advantages of a fertile country.
                    The most productive portion of the pashalic is on the banks of the Shat-ul-Arab,
                    in the neighbourhood of Bussora. This tract, for upwards of 30 miles below that
                    city, is well cultivated, and yields vast quantities of dates, wheat, barley,
                    and various kinds of fruits. The banks of the Euphrates produce abundant crops
                    of dry grain. Higher up the Euphrates, the country which <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193192968" xml:id="kp-eb0704-2968-0281"/>is possessed by the Arabs is
                    a low marshy tract, formed by the expansion of the Euphrates, and is famed for
                    plentiful crops of rice. Among the mountainous districts of the Upper Euphrates
                    the country is highly picturesque and beautiful; it is watered by the river
                    Mygdonius, and is in a tolerable state of cultivation. The finest fruits, such
                    as grapes, olives, figs, pomegranates, which are esteemed the most delicious in
                    the East; apples, pears, apricos of an inferior quality; and the finest dates,
                    on which the inhabitants, as in other parts of Asia, depend in many cases for
                    subsistence; are produced in abundance. The domestic animals are, the horse, for
                    which the country has long been famed, the ass, camels, dromedaries, buffaloes,
                    and mules. Of the wild animals, the jackal is the most destructive. The lion,
                    the hyena, the wolf, and the wild boar, are also common; and antelopes are seen
                    in great numbers. Hares are plentiful, but foxes are seldom seen. All sorts of
                    poultry are-bred excepting the turkey. On the cultivated lands, and on the
                    borders of the rivers, the black partridge is met with in great numbers. Snipes
                    and almost every species of wild fowl may be found in the marshes, and pelicans
                    on the banks of the Euphrates and Tigris. In addition to these two rivers, the
                    country is watered by the Khabaur or Chaboras, formed of a variety of little
                    brooks about ten miles to the southwest of Merdin; by the Mygdonius, which joins
                    the Khabaur; and also by the Hermes, a tributary of the Mygdonius.</p>
                <p>In ancient times the plain of Mesopotamia was occupied by the great and wealthy
                    cities of Nineveh, Babylon, Seleucia, Ctesiphon, &amp;c. and was in a high state
                    of cultivation. It was intersected by many well-constructed canals and other
                    works, which, in dispersing over the country the superfluous waters of the
                    Tigris and of the Euphrates, proved extremely useful to agriculture. These works
                    are now all ruined, and not a vestige remains of many of the canals, while the
                    course of others can only be faintly traced in their imperfect remains. One
                    canal is still to be seen, which connects the Euphrates and the Tigris exactly
                    half-way between Bussora and Bagdad, and is navigable in spring for large
                    boats.</p>
                <p>The pashalic of Bagdad is occupied by Arabian tribes, some of them very powerful.
                    The sheik of Montefidge, whose tribe inhabits the banks of the Euphrates from
                    Koma to Samavat, can bring into the field 4000 horse and a proportionate number
                    of foot. The Beni Lam, who possess the western bank of the Tigris between Korna
                    and Koote, can muster 1500 horse and 2000 foot. The Beni Hashem, between Samavat
                    and Khuzil, are a small tribe. The Khuzil are more numerous, and possess the
                    country near the marshes of Lemloon. The Gerbai is a powerful and licentious
                    tribe, who have lately come from Nedjed, the central district of Arabia, and
                    they are continually roving about from Kerkesia to Bagdad. There are about
                    thirteen other smaller tribes, who wander about the pro- <hi rend="superscript">

                    Tigris and the Euphrates.</p>
