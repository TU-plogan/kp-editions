                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    riding of the county of York, 182 miles from London, on the river Hull. It has a
                    considerable trade in malt and corn at its markets, which are held on Wednesday
                    and Saturday. It has two churches; that of St John, or the Minster, founded by
                    King Athelstane, being of a collegiate kind, and a fine building. It returns two
                    members to the House of Commons, who are chosen by a numerous body of resident
                    and non-resident freemen, from which cause much money is usually expended at the
                    elections. The number of inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 6100, in 1811 to 6235,
                    and in 1821 to 7503.</p>

                    justly esteemed one of the best scholars of his time. He "' <hi

                    °f St Hilda; when his merit recommended him to the favour of Alfred, king of
                    Northumberland, who, in the year 685, advanced him to the see of Hagustald or
                    Hexham, and, in 687, translated him to the archbishopric of York. 1his prelate
                    was tutor to the famous Bede, and lived in the strictest friendship with Acca
                    and other Anglo-Saxon doctors, several of whom he engaged to write comments on
                    the Holy Scriptures. In 704 he founded a college at Beverley for secular
                    priests; and after he had governed the see of York thirty-four years, being
                    wearied with the tumults and confusions which then prevailed in the church, he
                    divested himself of his episcopal character, and retired to Beverley, where he
                    died four years after, on the 7th of May 721. Bede and other monkish writers
                    ascribe several miracles to him. This prelate wrote some pieces, which are
                    mentioned by Bale and Pitts, namely, 1. <hi rend="italic">Pro Luce
