                <p><label type="entry">BALE, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, bishop of
                    Ossory, in Ireland, was bornât Cove, near Dunwich, in Suffolk, in the year 1495.
                    At twelve years of age he was entered in the monastery of Carmelites at Norwich,
                    and thence sent some years afterwards to Jesus College in Oxford. He was
                    educated a Roman Catholic, but afterwards converted to the Protestant religion
                    by Thomas Lord Wentworth. On the death of Lord Cromwell, the favourite of Henry
                    VIII. who protected him from the persecutions of the Romish clergy, he was
                    obliged to fly into the Low Countries, where he continued eight years. Soon
                    after the accession of Edward VI. he was recalled; and being first presented to
                    the living of Bishop’s Stocke in Hampshire, in 1552, he was nominated to the see
                    of Ossory. During his residence in Ireland he was remarkably assiduous in
                    propagating the Protestant doctrines; but to very little purpose, it would seem,
                    and frequently at the hazard of his life. On the accession of Queen Mary the
                    tide of opposition became so powerful that, to avoid assassination, he embarked
                    for Holland; but he was very unfortunate in his attempt to escape, being first
                    taken by a Dutch man-of-war, and robbed by the captain of all his effects, then
                    forced by stress of weather into St Ives in Cornwall, where he was arrested on
                    suspicion of treason. Having obtained his release, however, after a few days’
                    confinement, the ship anchored in Dover road, where he was again seized on a
                    false accusation, but soon liberated. On his arrival in Holland he was kept
                    prisoner for three weeks, but at length obtained his liberty on paying L.30.
                    From Holland he travelled to Basil in Switzerland, where he continued till Queen
                    Elizabeth ascended the throne. After his return to England he was in 1560 made
                    prebendary of Canterbury; and died in November 1563, at Canterbury, in the
                    sixty-eighth year of his age. He was the author of many works, the most noted of
                    which is his collection of British Biography, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Illustrium Majoris Britannice Scriptorum Catalogus, a Japheto sanctissimi Noae
