                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">BOCHART, <hi rend="smallcaps">Samuel</hi></label>, one of the
                    most learned men of the seventeenth century, was born atRoucn in Normandy in the
                    year 1599. He early made great progress in learning, and became a proficient in
                    the oriental languages. He was many years pastor of a Protestant church at Caen,
                    and became tutor to Wentworth Dillon, earl of Roscommon, and author of the Essay
                    on Translated Verse. While at Caen, he particularly distinguished himself by his
                    public disputations with Father Veron, a Jesuit, and celebrated as a polemic.
                    The dispute was held in the castle of Caen, in the presence of a great number of
                    Catholics and Protestants, including among the former the duke of Longueville.
                    Bochart came off with great honour; and his reputation was not a little
                    increased, in the year 1646, by the publication of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phaleg</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chanaan,</hi> which are the titles of the two
                    parts of his <hi rend="italic">Geographia Sacra.</hi> He also acquired great
                    fame by bis <hi rend="italic">Hierozoicon,</hi> printed in London in 1675, which
                    treats of the sacred animals of Scripture. The great learning he displayed in
                    his works rendered him esteemed not only among those of his own <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193198753" xml:id="kp-eb0704-8753-0726"/>profession, but amongst all
                    lovers of knowledge, of whatsoever denomination. In 1652, Christina, queen of
                    Sweden, invited him to Stockholm: he repaired thither accompanied by Huet, and
                    was very well received. On his return to Cacn he resumed the functions of the
                    ministry, married, and was received into the academy of that city. Bochart was a
                    man of profound erudition; he possessed a thorough knowledge of the principal
                    oriental languages, including the Hebrew, Syriac, Chaldaic, and Arabic; and such
                    was his zeal for extending his acquirements, that at an advanced age he wished
                    to learn Ethiopic. He was also remarkable for modesty and candour; but, like all
                    scholars who have become deeply imbued with the language which has formed the
                    favourite object of their studies, he saw Phoenician, and nothing but
                    Phoenician, in every thing, even in the words of the Celtic; and hence the
                    prodigious number of chimerical etymologies which swarm in his works. He died on
                    the 16th of May 1667, in the sixty-eighth year of his age. A complete edition of
                    his works was published at Leyden, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Sam.
