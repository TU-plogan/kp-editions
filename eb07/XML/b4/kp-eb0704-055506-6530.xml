                <p><label type="entry">BELOOCHISTAN</label>, a country of Asia, situated on the
                    north-western coast of the Indian peninsula. It is bounded on the north by
                    Afghanistan and Seistan; on the west by the Persian provinces of Kirman and
                    Laristan; on the south by the Indian Ocean; and on the east by a part of Sinde
                    and Shikarpoor. In general, it maybe said to comprehend all that space included
                    within the 25th and 30th degrees of north latitude, and the 58th and 68th
                    degrees of east longitude; and its whole superficial extent may be computed at
                    550 geographical miles in length, and 300 in breadth.</p>
                <p>Of the early history of this portion of the Asiatic continent little or nothing
                    is known. The poverty and natural strength of the country, combined with the
                    ferocious habits of the natives, seem to have equaļly repelled the friendly
                    visits of inquisitive strangers and the hostile incursions of invading armies.
                    The Greeks, from whom we derive the earliest information relative to the western
                    frontiers of India, are almost entirely silent ŵith respect to this mountainous
                    and inhospitable tract; and scarcely any notice of it occurs for many centuries
                    posterior to the Macedonian invasion. Hence it is impossible to trace the first
                    settlement of this country; and the descent of its inhabitants can only be
                    imperfectly ascertained by analogy and conjecture. As the natives have no
                    written language, their historical annals are merely traditional, and therefore
                    entitled to little credit. The Belooches ascribe their own origin to the
                    earliest Mahommedan invaders of Persia, and are very desirous of being supposed
                    to be of Arabian extraction; but the latter part of this supposition derives no
                    confirmation from their features, their manners, or their language, which bear
                    not the slightest similitude to those of the Arabs. There can be little doubt,
                    however, that they originally came from the westward; of which indeed there is
                    strong evidence in the affinity between the Beloochekee and Persian languages;
                    and their institutions, habits, and religion, seem to indicate that they are of
                    Toorkoman lineage. It seems highly probable, indeed, that, during the frequent
                    sanguinary revolutions to which the monarchy of the Seljukide Tartars was
                    subject, some of these barbarians had been forced to wander over the country in
                    quest of new settlements; and that a portion of them had found refuge in the
                    mountainous districts of Beloochistan. But, besides the Belooches, there are in
                    Beloochistan other distinct tribes of inhabitants, whose peculiar habits and
                    shades of character we shall afterwards take an opportunity of describing. These
                    are, the Brahooés, apparently a race of Tartar mountaineers, who settled at an
                    early period in the southern parts of Asia, but whose history is extremely
                    obscure and uninteresting; the Dehwars, a Persian colony, whose original
                    settlement cannot be traced; and the Hindoos, who appear to have been the first
                    settlers in the upper part of the Brahooick Mountains, on their being expelled
                    from Sinde, Lus, and Mekran, by the armies of the caliphs of Bagdad. This last
                    tribe appears to have constituted the governing <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193196543" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6543-0556"/>party at the earliest period
                    of which any thing approaching to authentic information has been obtained. The
                    Brahooés and Belooches, however, gradually spread over the country; and the
                    Hindoo power was at length subverted by a revolution, which placed the ancestors
                    of the present khan of Kelat upon the throne.</p>
                <p>The precise period at which this revolution took place cannot be accurately
                    ascertained; but it is probable that two centuries have not elapsed since that
                    event. The last rajah of the Hindoo dynasty found himself compelled to call for
                    the assistance of the mountain shepherds, with their leader, Kumbur, in order to
                    check the encroachments of a horde of depredators, headed by an Afghan chief,
                    who infested the country, and even threatened to attack the seat of government.
                    Kumbur successfully performed the service for which he had been engaged; but
                    having in a few years quelled the robbers against whom he had been called in,
                    and finding himself at the head of the only military tribe in the country, he
                    formally deposed the rajah, and assumed the reins of government.</p>
                <p>The history of this country subsequently to the accession of Kumbur is involved
                    in the same obscurity as during the Hindoo dynasty. It would appear, however,
                    that the sceptre was quietly transmitted to the descendants of that chief, who
                    seems to have persevered in a peaceable system of government, until the time of
                    Abdoolla Khan, the fourth in descent from Kumbur; who, being an intrepid and
                    ambitious soldier, turned his thoughts towards the conquest of Kutch-Gundava,
                    then held by different petty chiefs, under the authority of the Nawabs of
                    Sinde.</p>
                <p>After various success, the Kumburanees at length possessed themselves of the
                    sovereignty of a considerable portion of that fruitful plain, including the
                    chief town, Gundava. It was during this contest that the famous conqueror Nadir
                    Shah, commonly called Thamas Koolee Khan, advanced from Persia to the invasion
                    of Hindostan; and while at Kandahar, he dispatched several detachments into
                    Beloochistan, and established his authority in that province. Abdoolla Khan,
                    however, was continued in the government of the country by Nadir’s orders; but
                    he was soon after killed in a battle with the forces of the Nawabs of Sinde. He
                    was succeeded by his eldest son, Hajee Mohummud Khan, who abandoned himself to
                    the most tyrannical and licentious way of life, and completely alienated his
                    subjects by his arbitrary and oppressive system of taxation. In these
                    circumstances, Nusseer Khan, the second son of Abdoolla Khan, who had
                    accompanied the victorious Nadir to Delhi, and acquired the favour and
                    confidence of that monarch, returned to Kelat, and was hailed by the whole
                    population as their deliverer. Finding that expostulation had no effect upon his
                    brother, he one day entered his apartment, when the prince was alone, and
                    stabbed him to the heart. As soon as the tyrant was dead, Nusseer Khan mounted
                    the musnud, amidst the universal joy of his subjects, and immediately
                    transmitted a report of the events which had taken place to Nadir Shah, who was
                    then encamped near Kandahar. The shah received the intelligence with
                    satisfaction, and dispatched a firman, by return of the messenger, appointing
                    Nusseer Khan beglierbey of all Beloochistan. This event took place in the year
                    1739.</p>
                <p>Nusseer Khan proved an active, politic, and warlike prince. He took great pains
                    to re-establish the internal government of all the provinces in his dominions,
                    and improved and fortified the city of Kelat. On the death of Nadir Shah, in
                    1747, he acknowledged the title of the king of Cabûl, Ahmed Shah Abdalla. In
                    1758 he declared himself entirely independent; upon which Ahmed Shah dispatched
                    a force against him, under one of his ministers. The khan, however, levied his
                    troops and totally routed the Afghan army. On receiving intelligence of this
                    discomfiture, the king himself marched with strong reinforcements, and a pitched
                    battle was fought, in which Nusseer Khan was worsted. He retired in good order
                    to Kelat whither he was followed by the victor, who invested the place with his
                    whole army. The khan made a vigorous defence; and, after the royal troops had
                    been foiled in their attempts to take the city by storm or surprise, a
                    negociation was proposed by the king, which terminated in a treaty of peace. By
                    this treaty it was stipulated that the king was to receive the cousin of Nusseer
                    Khan in marriage; and that the khan was to pay no tribute, but only, when called
                    upon, to furnish troops to assist the royal armies, for which he was to receive
                    an allowance in cash equal to half their pay.</p>
                <p>Subsequently to this period the khan frequently distinguished himself by his
                    gallantry and judgment in the wars carried on by the monarch of Cabûl; and, as a
                    reward for his eminent services, the king bestowed upon him several districts to
                    hold in perpetual and entire sovereignty. Having succeeded in quelling a
                    dangerous rebellion, headed by his cousin Beheram Khan, this able prince at
                    length died at an extreme old .age, after a happy and prosperous reign, in the
                    month of June 1795, leaving three sons and five daughters. He was succeeded by
                    his eldest son, Muhmood Khan, then a boy about fourteen years of age. During the
                    reign of this prince, who is described as a very humane and indolent man, the
                    country has been distracted by sanguinary intestine broils; the governors of
                    several provinces and districts have withdrawn their allegiance; and the
                    dominions of the khans of Kelat have so gradually diminished, that they now
                    comprehend only a small portion of the provinces which were formerly subject to
                    Nusseer Khan.</p>
                <p>The territories of the last-mentioned prince are comprised under the following
                    divisions :—1. The provinces of Jhalawan and Sarawan, and the district of Kelat.
                    2. The provinces of Mekran and Lus. 3. The province of Kutch-Gundava and
                    district of Hurrund Dajel. 4. Kohistan, or the Belooche country west of the
                    Desert. 5. The Desert. 6. The province of Sinde.</p>
                <p>The features of this extensive tract of country vary considerably; but, in
                    general, it may be described as extremely mountainous. A stupendous range, to
                    which the appellation of the Brahooick Mountains has been assigned, and which
                    seems to be the primitive root of all the others, springs abruptly to a
                    conspicuous height out of the sea, at Cape Mowaree, or Monze, in east longitude
                    66° 58', north latitude 25°, whence it takes a north-easterly direction for
                    about ninety miles. There it projects a ridge, east by north, the base of which
                    is washed by the river Indus, at the fort of Sehwan. From the separation of this
                    arm, in latitude 25° 45' to that of 30°, the primitive body runs due north,
                    marking the western limits of Sinde, Kutch-Gundava, and a part of Seeweestan;
                    and from thence it once more regains its original inclination to the north-east,
                    and decreases in magnitude and elevation so rapidly, that, m the course of forty
                    miles, it sinks to a level with the hills inhabited by the Kaukers and other
                    Afghan tribes, with which it becomes incorporated. To the westward the Brahooick
                    Mountains send forth many collateral chains, some of which extend the whole
                    length of Beloochistan, and join the mountains of Persia; others elongate
                    southerly till they touch the sea, or come within a few miles o it, and then
                    either take the inclination of the coast, or subside in the low and barren
                    plains in its vicinity; whιe the main body, or rather its western face,
                    stretches away north-west by north, to the twenty-eighth degree of nortι
                    latitude, where it meets the south-eastern corner of tie sandy desert, about the
                    sixty-fourth degree of east longι-tude<pb break="no" facs="nls:193196556"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-6556-0557"/>; and from thence it inclines with a northern
                    aspect between the north-east and north points of the compass to Nooshky, in
                    latitude 30° north; from which place it runs more easterly, till at length it
                    gradually sinks, like the eastern front, to an equality of size with the Afghan
                    hills. Besides the Brahooick chain, there are several other ranges of mountains,
                    extending in various directions and ramifications throughout Beloochistan, but
                    all of them inferior to the former in magnitude and height. This stupendous
                    chain is believed to have attained its greatest altitude at Kelat; from which
                    city, according to the natives, a traveller, whatever route he may pursue, must
                    descend; but the descent is so very trifling for a long way on either side of
                    that capital that it is not pereeptible by the eye.</p>
                <p>Throughout the whole of this country there are no rivers of such size or
                    importance as to merit particular notice. In general they have a broad and deep
                    channel from the coast, until they reach the mountains or stony hills, where
                    they become contracted into narrow and intricate water-courses, that are quite
                    dry during the greater part of the fair season; and in the rainy one swell to
                    terrific torrents, which run off in the course of a few hours after the rain
                    that has filled them ceases.</p>
                <p>The principal city of this country is Kelat, the capital of the whole of
                    Belooehistan. This city stands on an elevated site on the western side of a
                    well-cultivated plain or valley, about eight miles long and two or three broad;
                    a great part of which is laid out in gardens and other inclosures. The town is
                    built in the form of an oblong square, three sides of which are encompassed by a
                    mud wall, eighteen or twenty feet high, flanked, at intervals of 250 yards, by
                    bastions, which, as well as the wall itself, are pierced with numberless
                    loop-holes for matchlock-men. The defence of the fourth side of the city is
                    formed by the western face of the hill, on which it is partly built, being cut
                    away perpendicularly. On the summit of this eminence stands the palace of
                    Muhmood Khan, chief of Kelat, and nominal beglierbey of Beloochistan, commanding
                    a distinct view of the town and adjacent country. That quarter of the hill on
                    which the khan’s residence is erected has been inclosed by a mud wall, with
                    bastions; the entrance to it is on the south-western side; and here, as well as
                    at the city gates, which are three in number, there is constantly a guard of
                    matchlock-men. Within the walls there are upwards of 2500 houses, and the number
                    of these in the suburbs probably exceeds one half of that amount. The houses are
                    mostly built of half-burnt brick, or wooden frames, and plastered over with mud
                    or mortar. In general the streets are broader than those of native towns, and
                    most of them have a raised pathway on either side for foot-passengers, and an
                    uncovered kennel in the centre; the latter of which is a great nuisance, from
                    the quantity of filth thrown into it, and the stagnant rainwater that lodges
                    there. The upper stories of the houses frequently project across the streets,
                    and thereby render the part beneath them gloomy and damp. This seems a very rude
                    attempt to imitate the bazars of Persia and Ca-bùl. The bazar of Kelat is
                    extensive, and well furnished with every kind of goods; all the necessaries of
                    life <hi rend="superscript"> ma</hi> y be procured daily at a moderate price.
                    The town is supplied with delicious water from a spring in the face of a hill on
                    the opposite side of the plain, whence it meanders nearly through the centre of
                    it, having the town and suburbs on one side, and on the other the gardens. It is
                    a remarkable property of this spring, that the waters, at their immediate issue
                    from the smaller channels, possess a considerable degree of tepidity, until
                    after sunrise, when ∏ey suddenly become exceedingly cold, and remain so <hi

                <p>We have no data from which we can form an accurate computation of the total
                    amount of the population of Beloochistan. The inhabitants are divided into two
                    great classes, distinguished by the appellations of Belooche and Brahooé; and
                    these two are again subdivided into an infinite number of tribes, which it were
                    tedious and unnecessary to enumerate. The most remarkable distinctions between
                    these two classes consists in their language and appearance. The Belooche or
                    Beloochekee language partakes considerably of the idiom of the modern Persian,
                    although greatly disguised under a singularly corrupt pronunciation. The
                    Brahooékee, on the other hand, has nothing analogous to the Persian idiom. It
                    appears to contain a great number of ancient Hinduwee words; and, as it strikes
                    the ear, bears a strong resemblance to the dialect spoken in that part of India
                    called the Punjab. With regard to external appearance, the contour of these two
                    classes seems to differ, in most instances, as much as their language. The
                    Belocches in general have tall figures, long visages, and raised features; the
                    Brahooés, on the contrary, have short thick bones, with round faces and flat
                    lineaments.</p>
                <p>The Belooches are a handsome active race of men, not possessing great physical
                    strength, but inured to changes of climate and season, and capable of enduring
                    every species of fatigue. In their habits they are a pastoral people, and much
                    addicted to predatory warfare, in the course of which they do not hesitate to
                    commit every kind of outrage and cruelty. The lawless excursions in which they
                    frequently engage are called <hi rend="italic">chupaos,</hi> and are almost
                    always conducted under the immediate orders of their chiefs. The depredators are
                    usually mounted on camels, and furnished with food and water, according to the
                    distance they have to travel. When every thing is prepared, they set off, and
                    march incessantly till within a few miles of the point where the <hi
                    rend="italic">elvupao</hi> is to commence; then they halt in a jungle, or some
                    unfrequented spot, to rest their camels. On the approach of night they mount
                    again; and as soon as the inhabitants have retired to repose, they begin their
                    attack by burning, destroying, and carrying off whatever comes in their way.
                    They never rest for one moment during the <hi rend="italic">chupao∙</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> but ride on, at the rate of eighty or ninety
                    miles a day, until they have loaded their camels with as much pillage as they
                    can possibly remove; If practicable, they make a circuit, which enables them to
                    return by a different route from the one by which they came. This plan affords
                    them a double prospect of plunder, and also tends to mislead those who go in
                    pursuit of the robbers.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding their predatory habits, the Belooches are proverbial for their
                    hospitality. Among them pilfering is considered a most despicable act; and when
                    they once promise to afford protection to any person who may solicit or require
                    it, they will die before they fail in their trust. Their usual habitations are
                    <hi rend="italic">ghedans</hi> or tents, made of black felt or coarse blanket,
                    stretched over a frame of wicker-work, formed from the branches of the tamarisk.
                    An assemblage of these <hi rend="italic">ghedans</hi> constitutes a toomun or
                    village, and the inhabitants of it a <hi rend="italic">hheil</hi> or society, of
                    which there may be an unlimited number in one tribe. These kheils are eommonly
                    discriminated by some appropriate title, such as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >umeeree</hi> kheil, the noble society, <hi rend="italic">Daodee</hi> kheil,
                    David’s society, &amp;c. These titles, however, they frequently change with
                    their places of residence. Some of the Belooches, particularly the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nharooé</hi> clans, prefer mud-houses to tents, and even live in
                    forts; nor is it uncommon in the western parts of Belooehistan, to find one half
                    of the kheil residing in ghedans, and the other in huts. When a visitor arrives
                    at a toomun, a carpet is spread in front of the door of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >miharn hhanu</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> or house <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193196569" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6569-0558"/>for guests, of which every
                    village has one; the <hi rend="italic">sirdar</hi> or head of the kheil
                    immediately appears, and he and the stranger having embraced, and mutually
                    kissed hands, the followers of the latter successively approach, and the sirdar
                    gives them his hand, which they press to their foreheads and lips. The parties
                    then sit down, on which the chief addresses the stranger, and asks him, four
                    several times, how he does, to which the other answers in the usual
                    complimentary terms; he then inquires, in the same manner, for his family and
                    friends, and even for the health of his followers who are present, to whom the
                    visitor turns, as if to appeal for information; they all nod assent to being in
                    good health; and the ceremony concludes by the new-comer making an equal number
                    of inquiries for the welfare of the family, kheil or society, followers and
                    friends of the sirdar.</p>
                <p>The food of the Belooches consists of wheaten and barley cakes, rice, dates,
                    cheese, and milk, which last they prefer in a sour state; soup made from <hi
                    rend="italic">dholl</hi> or peas, and seasoned with red pepper and other heating
                    herbs, and meat whenever they can procure it. The vegetables most esteemed by
                    them are onions, garlic, and the leaves and stalk of the assafoetida plant,
                    which they roast or stew in butter. They usually limit themselves to one or two
                    wives, and their chiefs to four; but this depends altogether upon choice. They
                    treat their women with attention and respect, and are not so scrupulous about
                    their being seen by strangers as most other Mussulmans. They keep a great number
                    of slaves of both sexes, captured during their <hi rend="italic">chupaos,</hi>
                    who are treated with liberality and kindness. The common dress of the Belooches
                    is a coarse white or blue calico shirt, buttoned round the neck, and reaching
                    below the knee; their trousers are made of the same cloth, or of a kind of
                    striped stuff called Soosee, and puckered round the ancles. On their heads they
                    wear a small silk or cotton quilted cap, fitted to the shape of the skull, over
                    which, when in full dress, they place a turban, either checked or blue, and a
                    <hi rend="italic">hummurbund</hi> or sash, of the same colour, round their
                    waists. In winter the chiefs and their relatives appear in a tunic of chintz,
                    lined and stuffed with cotton; and the poorer classes, when out of doors, wrap
                    themselves up in a surtout made of cloth, manufactured from a mixture of goats’
                    hair and sheeps’ wool. The women’s dress is very similar to that of the men;
                    their trousers are preposterously wide, and made of silk, or a mixture of silk
                    and cotton. A Belooche soldier carries a matchlock, sword, spear, dagger, and
                    shield, besides a multiplicity of powder-flasks, priming-horns, and pouches.
                    They are all capital marksmen, and in battle avoid, as much as possible, coming
                    to close combat. Their best warlike weapons are of foreign manufacture. At Kelat
                    there is an armoury for the manufacture of matchlocks, swords, and spears; but
                    the workmanship is very indifferent.</p>
                <p>The principal amusements of the Belooches are shooting, hunting, and coursing;
                    for which latter purpose they bestow a vast deal of attention in the training of
                    their greyhounds. Firing at marks, cudgelling, wrestling, and throwing the
                    spear, are likewise favourite diversions among them, and neighbouring kheils
                    frequently cope with each other at these exercises. Their funeral and marriage
                    ceremonies, being in a great measure such as are prescribed and regulated by the
                    Koran, are similar to those of all other Mussulmans, and therefore merit no
                    particular notice. With regard to religion the Belooches are, with a very few
                    exceptions to the westward, Soonee Mussulmans.</p>
                <p>The Brahooés, or second great class of the natives of Beloochistan, are a still
                    more unsettled and wandering nation than the Belooches. They reside in one part
                    of the country during the summer, and emigrate to another for the winter season;
                    and even change their immediate! places of abode many times in the year, for the
                    sake of pasturage for their flocks. The Brahooés are distinguished for activity,
                    strength, and hardiness; inured alike to the cold of the mountainous regions of
                    Beloochistan, and the heat of the low plain of Kutch-Gundava. They are very
                    laborious in husbandry and other domestic occupations; and those who reside in
                    the vicinity of the plains to the southward of Kelat, cultivate large tracts of
                    land and dispose of the produce for exportation to the Hindoos of Kelat, Bela,
                    and Khozdar. This, and the sale of the cheese and ghee made from the flocks,
                    with a few coarse blankets, carpets, and felts, constitute their only traffic.
                    They are famous for having voracious appetites, and devour a great quantity of
                    flesh in a half-dressed state, without bread, salt, or vegetables. The Brahooés
                    are as faithful in adherence to their promises, and as hospitable, as the
                    Belooches: they are more quiet and industrious, and although they are esteemed
                    superior to the other inhabitants of Beloochistan in personal bravery, and the
                    endurance of privations and hardships, yet their habits are decidedly averse to
                    that system of rapine and violence pursued by their neighbours. A Brahooé always
                    dresses in the same style; whether it be summer or winter, his whole clothing
                    consists of a loose white shirt, a pair of trousers of the same texture, and a
                    felt cap. The shepherds sometimes wear a covering of white felt, made so as to
                    wrap round the body, and terminate in a peak above the crown of the head; and
                    this habit is used as a defence against rain or snow. The domestic life of the
                    Brahooés is extremely simple. The men employ themselves in field labour, in
                    which, if necessary, they are assisted by the women; but in general the latter
                    are. engaged in attending to the household affairs. The dress of the women
                    consists of a long shift and pair of trousers, both of cotton cloth; and after
                    they arrive at the age of puberty they wear over the former a kind of stays,
                    made to lace behind, and decorated in front with ridiculous devices of birds or
                    animals, worked in coloured worsted. In religion, the Brahooés are all Soonnce
                    Mussulmans. All their tribes intermarry with each other, except the Kumburanees;
                    but these are distinguished by a peculiarity which does not attach to any of the
                    other tribes; that of being divided into three distinct gradations of rank,—the
                    Ahmedzgees, Khanees, and Kumburanees. The first consists of the family of the
                    prince; the Khanees are of the secondary rank, which embraces between twenty and
                    thirty; and the Kumburanees include the remainder of the tribe, although, in
                    general, the term is applied to the whole body.</p>
                <p>Besides the Belooches and Brahooés, there is a considerable number of Hindoos
                    resident at Kelat, who are principally engaged in mercantile speculations, and
                    are much respected both by the government and the people. Their religion is
                    tolerated; and they have a pagoda at Kelat. The Dehwars or Dehkans constitute
                    the only remaining class of the population which seems worthy or particular
                    notice. They may be recognised under various names in different districts of the
                    country; and they are quiet and harmless in their disposition, and addicted to
                    agricultural pursuits. Their colloquial language is Persian; from which fact
                    their origin may be deduced, although no traces of their original settlement
                    have been discovered.</p>
                <p>The fluctuation of power renders it difficult to define precisely the nature of
                    the government of Kelat. During the reign of Nusseer Khan, the whole kingdom
                    might be said to have been governed by a complete despotism; yet that ruler so
                    tempered the supreme authority by the p <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> vileges
                    granted to the feudal chiefs within their own tribes, that, to a casual
                    observer, it bore the appearance <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196582"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-6582-0559"/>of a military confederation. The tribes all
                    exercise the ri&lt;&gt;∙ht of selecting their own <hi rend="italic">sirdar</hi>,
                    or head; and the khan has the power of confirming or disapproving of their
                    nomination; but this power is never exercised, and appears to be merely nominal.
                    The khan of Kelat has the power of declaring war and making treaties connected
                    with the whole of Beloochistan, and can order the sirdar of each tribe to attend
                    in person with his quota of troops. Agreeably to a eode of regulations framed by
                    one of the earliest princes of the Kumburanee dynasty, the entire administration
                    of justice was vested in the person at the head of the government. The sirdar,
                    however, has the power of adjusting petty quarrels, thefts, and disputed points
                    of every description, among the inhabitants of a kheil or society; but in all
                    eases of importance, an appeal lies in the last instance to the khan at
                    Kelat.</p>
                <p>A register of the Belooche army, drawn up during the reign of Nusseer Khan,
                    exhibits an aggregate of 250,000 men; but this number was probably exaggerated.
                    At present the same documents comprise a list of 120,000 troops, excluding all
                    the revolted provinces and districts; but it is believed that Muhmood Khan could
                    not, on the greatest emergency, muster more than half that number of fighting
                    men. His total revenues, in their actual reduced state, may be estimated at
                    about 350,000 rupees annually, a large portion of which is paid in produce. In
                    Nusseer Khan’s time the revenue exceeded thirty lacks of rupees. The duties
                    levied at Kelat are extremely moderate. Horses or cattle pay nothing whatever
                    throughout the Belooehe territories; but there is a species of land-tax, payable
                    from all cultivated grounds. The exports from Kelat are very trifling; its
                    imports are iron, tin, lead, steel, copper, indigo, betel-nut, eochineal, sugar,
                    spices, silks, keemkhab, gold-eloth, chintz, and coarse woollens from India.</p>
                <p>The climate of Beloochistan is extremely various in the different provinces. The
                    soil in general is exceedingly stony. Of the province of Kutch-Gundava, however,
                    the soil is rich and loamy, and so very productive that, it is said, were it all
                    properly cultivated, the crops would be more than sufficient for the consumption
                    of the whole of ‘ Beloochistan. Gold, silver, lead, iron, tin, antimony,
                    brimstone, alum, sal-ammoniac, and-many kinds of mineral salts, and saltpetre,
                    are found in various parts of the country. The precious metals have only been
                    discovered in working for iron and lead, in mines near the town of Nal, about
                    150 miles south-south-west of Kelat. The different other minerals above
                    enumerated are very plentiful. The gardens of Kelat produce many sorts of fruit,
                    which are soldata very moderate rate, such as aprieots, peaches, grapes,
                    almonds, pistachio nuts, apples, pears, plums, currants, cherries, quinces,
                    figs, pomegranates, mulberries, plantains, melons, guavas, &amp;c. All kinds of
                    grain known in India are cultivated in the different provinces of Beloochistan,
                    and there is abundance of vegetables. Madder, cotton, and indigo, are also
                    produced; and the latter is considered superior to that of Bengal. The culture
                    of the date fruit is conducted with great attention in the province of Mekran.
                    The domestic animals of Beloochis-ţanare horses, mules, asses, camels,
                    dromedaries, buffaloes, ŋlack-cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, and eats, besides
                    fowls and pigeons; but there are neither geese, turkeys, nor cucks. The wild
                    animals are lions, tigers, leopards, hyenas, wolves, jackals, tiger-cats, wild
                    dogs, foxes, hares, mangooses, mountain goats, antelopes, elks, red and moose-
