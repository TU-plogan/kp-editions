                    rend="italic">philosophe-moraliste,</hi> famous for his book of essays, was born
                    at the castle of Montaigne, in Périgord, on the 28th of February 1533, being
                    descended of an ancient family named Eyghem, originally from England. His
                    father, a brave and loyal squire, who had served in Spain and Italy, where he
                    had cultivatedhis mind and improved his taste, bestowed much attention on his
                    education, and, in particular, initiated him in the knowledge of languages by a
                    process much less tardy and laborious than that pursued in the schools. The
                    expedient he adopted was to provide his son with a German master, who, being
                    entirely ignorant of French, but well versed in Latin, spoke to him only in the
                    latter tongue, which he consequently acquired as a vernacular language, and, at
                    the age of six, was able to converse in it with tolerable freedom and fluency.
                    Greek was also taught him as a sort of diversion. “Nous pelotions nos
                    déclinaisons,” says he, “à la manière de ceux qui, par certains jeux de <hi
                    rend="italic">tablier</hi> (échiquier), apprennent l’arithmétique et la
                    géométrie.” By means equally gentle and attractive, he was insensibly led to
                    acquire some knowledge of science; and, without forcing his inclination, or
                    imposing the necessity of application, his habits were formed, and his powers
                    agreeably exercised. All this care and attention he repaid by the most tender
                    affection for the memory of his father; indeed filial piety is said to have
                    formed a conspicuous trait in his character, though it must be confessed that he
                    sometimes displayed it in a manner sufficiently singular. At an early age he was
                    sent to the college of Guienne, at Bordeaux, then the most flourishing in
                    France, and there he had as masters Nicoas Grouchy, William Guérente, George
                    Buchanan, and Muretus, under whom he appears to have made considerable
                    proficiency. Having completed his studies at the age of thirteen, Montaigne
                    resolved to study law; and although his mind, naturally averse to all
                    constraint, must have been repidsed by the conflicting and complicated mass of
                    consuetudinary ju<pb break="no" facs="nls:193824747"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-4747-0426"/>risprudence with which the tribunals were then
                    surcharged, yet, in 1554, he became a counsellor or advocate at Bordeaux, and
                    continued to practise as such until the death of his elder brother, when he
                    abandoned a profession to which he never had any real liking, and which he
                    appeared afterwards to consider as derogatory. On quitting the bar, for the
                    business of which he had evidently no aptitude, he applied himself to the study
                    of men and manners, and in prosecution of this object travelled through various
                    parts of France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, making his observations on
                    every thing curious or interesting in society, and receiving several marks of
                    distinction in the course of his peregrinations. In 1581 he was admitted a
                    citizen of Rome, in which city he then sojourned; and the same year he was
                    elected mayor of Bordeaux, an office in which he seems to have given much
                    satisfaction to his fellow-citizens. In 1582 he was sent on a special mission to
                    court about some affairs of importance, and on the expiration of his mayoralty
                    he was again elected to the same office. In 1588 he appeared to some advantage
                    at the assembly of the states at Blois, and, though not a deputy, took a share
                    in the proceedings, but on what pretence or in what capacity does not clearly
                    appear. During one of his visits to court he received the cordon of the order of
                    Saint Michel, a distinction which he appears to have greatly coveted, though we
                    afterwards find him complaining of the discredit into which it had fallen.
                    Having retired to his family residence, he devoted himself to study; but his
                    tranquillity was disturbed by the civil wars which desolated Guienne; and being
                    driven from his house, he wandered about during six months seeking for his
                    family, and often with difficulty obtaining an asylum amongst those who had
                    shared his hospitality. It appears, from a statement of De Thou, that Montaigne
                    had sought to bring about a reconciliation between the Duke of Guise and the
                    King of Navarre, afterwards Henry IV.; and on his return from Paris, where he
                    had completed the impression of his Essays, in 1588, he was with the historian
                    at Blois when the Duke of Guise was there assassinated. In his old age he was
                    very much afflicted with stone and nephritic colic, which led him to observe
                    that “la mort le pinçait continuellement à la gorge ou aux reins ;” but he never
                    could be prevailed on to take physic, in which he had no faith whatever. He died
                    on the 13th of September 1589, and was buried in the church of the Feuillants at
                    Bordeaux, where a monument was erected to his memory. Notwithstanding his
                    constitutional tendency to scepticism, and certain unguarded expressions which
                    seem to intimate an entire extinction of the sentiment of religion, he is said
                    to have died a Christian, probably because he had mass celebrated in his chamber
                    in his last moments, and expired during the elevation of the host.</p>
                <p>His reputation as a writer is founded solely on his Essays, which were at one
                    time extremely popular, and which are still read with pleasure by a numerous
                    class of persons, who, pardoning the delusions of’self-love and self-deceit, are
                    charmed by the acuteness and originality mingled with good nature and
                    sensibility which he displays, and captivated by the inviting frankness and
                    vivacity with which he unbosoms himself about all his domestic habits and
                    concerns. As a writer, he imparted to the French language an energy which it did
                    not possess before, and which has not become antiquated, because it resides in
                    the thoughts and sentiments rather than in the expression. As a philosopher, his
                    object was to describe man as he is, without reserve and without exaggeration;
                    he studied himself more than any other subject, and recorded his observations
                    with an acuteness and fidelity which have rendered his work an authentic record
                    of many interesting facts relative to human nature. He united in a high degree
                    the powers of observation and reflection, without which the study of man can
                    never be successfully prosecuted; and although there is no doubt much truth in
                    the acute but severe strictures on his character contained in a masterly section
                    of the Port-royal Logic, where his vanity, his self-love, and the indulgent
                    manner in which he speaks of his vices, to say nothing of the use of language
                    indicating a total absence of religious’principle and sentiment, are very freely
                    exposed, yet, as Mr Stewart observes, “this consideration, so far from
                    diminishing the value of his Essays, is one of the most instructive lessons they
                    afford to those who, after the example of the author, may undertake the salutary
                    but humiliating task of self-examination.” In the first Preliminary Dissertation
                    (part i. section ii.), to which the reader is referred, will be found an
                    exposition of the philosophical merits and defects of Montaigne, not less
                    remarkable for ability and discrimination, than for the fair and equitable
                    spirit in which both are distinguished and appreciated. Montaigne’s life was
                    first written by the President Bouhier, and prefixed to a supplementary volume
                    of his works in 1740. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
