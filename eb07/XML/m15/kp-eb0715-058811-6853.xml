                <p><label type="entry">MUELLER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Johannes von</hi></label>, the
                    only author whom Germany can oppose to the illustrious historians of Italy and
                    Britain, was born at Schaffhausen in 1752, of which town his father was a
                    pastor. In 1769, he commenced his academical life at Göttingen, where he applied
                    himself principally to theology; a study and a profession which he soon
                    deserted. In 1772, he was appointed professor of the Greek language in the
                    gymnasium of his native town. In 1774, he removed to Geneva, where he
                    principally resided till 1781. Here he delivered his lectures on Universal
                    History, which were written originally in French; and here he formed the plan
                    and commenced the investigations towards his History of the Helvetic
                    Confederacy. In 1781 he was called, as professor of history, to the Carolinum of
                    Brunswick, an appointment which he soon abandoned; and, the following year, he
                    returned to Switzerland. By Heyne’s recommendation, he was, in 1786, called as
                    librarian, with the title of aulic counsellor, to Mentz. In 1800, he was
                    appointed librarian to the imperial library at Vienna; in 1804, he was called as
                    historiographer and counsellor of war to Berlin; and, in 1807, he was appointed
                    minister, counsellor of state, and general director of public instruction in
                    Cassel, where he died in 1809.</p>
                <p>To enter into any detail regarding the history of Mueller’s life is here the less
                    requisite, as there perhaps never existed an author whose internal character was
                    more independent of outward circumstances, or in whom the writer was in a more
                    remarkable manner distinguished from the man; whilst, at the same time, his
                    writings breathe the whole energy of the deep feelings of his ardent
                    disposition. An honest enthusiasm for truth and virtue was combined in him with
                    an ambition which could be satisfied only with the renown of a great author. No
                    exertion of intellect was for him too painful; and no perseverance in industry
                    surpassed his endurance. Of a cheerful disposition, even amidst the adversities
                    of life, he pursued, without faultering, bis determined object. From the letters
                    which, in his youth, he wrote to his friend De Bon-stetten, we see him at the
                    beginning the same as at the termination of his course. But this very
                    consistency renders the contrast between the two characters which he united in
                    his person only the more remarkable. By nature amiable, but soft even to
                    weakness; open and liberal, though without one conspicuous trait of magnanimity;
                    accommodating himself to circumstances with the pliability of a courtier, and
                    yielding to the seduction of his passions in a point where morality condemns him
                    without appeal; yet no sooner had he seized his pen, no sooner had he begun to
                    narrate the great events of former times, than this man became a hero at once in
                    firmness and elevation; and this not by any artificial discipline of his
                    imagination, but from a genuine and resistless enthusiasm in his own <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193826866" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6866-0589"/> moral
                    delineations. It then became a necessity of his nature to think and write as if
                    he himself had been one of the mighty warriors or statesmen, to glorify whose
                    names it was his chief delight; now a Roman, now a Switzer of the ancient time,
                    and now some other illustrious personage, whose character he superinduced upon
                    his own in the moment of description. Moral and political grandeur had indeed
                    for him so strong a charm, that he frequently deceived himself in his estimate
                    of their amount.</p>
                <p>With such a character of mind, Mueller could never be an historian who wrote only
                    for the intellect, and still less an historian who wrote only for the memory.
                    All that he read of remarkable persons and events became, in his imagination, a
                    series of animated pictures. - He must represent and paint, and he painted with
                    few strokes, and happily, as if from life; whilst truth, as far as this could be
                    discovered by historical research, was of greater value in his eyes than all the
                    ornaments of rhetoric. His imagination was only active to place what he read
                    before him in a living form. His historical delineations were inspired with the
                    warmth of his peculiar temperament, but not misrepresented. As he himself was
                    animated by whatever was good, and generous, and great, so he wished also to
                    animate his reader by a sympathy with his portraits, and through the
                    instructions which history conveys. But in Mueller’s view, history must be
                    instructive in a degree of which few historians have any conception. His free
                    and clear intellect, adhering to no philosophical system, and with little
                    inclination towards the abstract sciences in general, but penetrating deeply
                    into the internal connection of historical events, was able to extract from this
                    connection political and moral principles, which, though manifest even to the
                    unlearned reader when placed before him, are overlooked even by the enlightened
                    thinker when his observation is not guided by the legitimate deduction of causes
                    and effects. And in this historical deduction, if we except Thucydides and
                    Tacitus, Mueller has no superior. Not that he is equal to these great originals,
                    nor even to some modern historians, in the detailed development of events, and
                    in the arrangement of circumstances in the order of their absolute and relative
                    importance. For the adequate attainment of this great end, Mueller was
                    disqualified by a certain deficiency in the powers of abstraction and
                    combination. The ideas, in his representation, display no regular subordination;
                    and they are frequently crowded together, transposed, or dragged behind. In this
                    respect he is more peculiarly opposed to Tacitus, although the Germans have
                    fondly styled him the twin brother of that great historian, who, in the
                    distinction of what is principal and accessory, has no equal, and almost no
                    likeness, amongst the historians either of ancient or modern times. Thucydides
                    and Tacitus he more nearly resembles in the energy and laconic brevity of his
                    style. Pleased only with a strength and fulness of thought, he abhors all that
                    is empty, or trivial, or redundant. Being impelled by youthful enthusiasm to
                    write the history of his native Switzerland, and dwelling, as it were, for years
                    amongst the original documents from which his materials were compiled, his
                    powerful style insensibly contracted a certain antique colouring from the
                    language of the ancient chronicles; and thus it is that his diction more vividly
                    expresses the character of that peculiar period which, during the interval of
                    composition, was then living in his own imagination. What was tasteless and
                    offensive in the style of the old chronicles became softened down in Mueller’s
                    cultivated mind; but whilst his intellect was engrossed with the connection of
                    events, a laconic brevity had for his individual taste an irresistible charm,
                    even when purchased at the expense of easy and natural expression.</p>
                <p>Mueller’s History of the Helvetic Confederacy, the work on which he laboured
                    longest, and to which he applied the whole force of his industry and talents, is
                    the book in which we may best discover the spirit of his historical composition,
                    in all its qualities both of comprehension and detail. But this work, one of the
                    most singular productions of great historical intellect, requires so close an
                    attention to a multitude of small matters of fact, the details of which might
                    easily have been omitted, and, from the continued brevity, combined with the
                    antiquated costume of the expression, exacts from the reader, unaccustomed to
                    such a style, so vehement a stretch of thought, that we are ever and anon
                    compelled to lay aside the book and breathe, in order to collect new strength
                    for the perusal. Indeed, no book has, perhaps, been so much praised, and so
                    little read, as the Helvetic History of our author. Mueller, who, from youth
                    till death, and amidst literary and political occupations of another kind,
                    always considered the history of his native country as the principal object of
                    his life, had so accustomed himself to that character of composition which he
                    thought accommodated to a history of Switzerland, that, in his other writings,
                    he is not wholly able to divest himself of its peculiarities. His Universal
                    History, first drawn up in French, for a society of young persons who were his
                    pupils at Geneva, afterwards with greater care re-written in the German tongue,
                    and first published after the author’s death, though comprising, in abridgment,
                    all ancient and modern ages, is, however, far inferior in historical value to
                    the History of Switzerland; but the nature of its subject is more agreeable to
                    the majority of readers; and in the condensation of the matter, the style has a
                    certain facility, in which we easily recognise the man to whom French was in his
                    youth a second mother tongue.</p>
                <p>Of the other writings of Mueller, the most remarkable are the Letters, which were
                    not written for the world, but published after his death in the collection of
                    his works, of which they occupy several volumes. In these letters we discover
                    the character of the man on its fairest and most honourable side; and we
                    likewise see how far his style is removed from the affectation with which he has
                    so often been reproached. Written rapidly, without premeditation, and addressed
                    to confidential friends, the historian of the Helvetic Confederacy is recognised
                    in every sentence of these letters; and the absence of a smooth and polished
                    diction is in itself an excellence, when contrasted with the paint of letters
                    written for admiration and display.</p>
