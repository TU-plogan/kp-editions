                <p><label type="entry">MILL</label>, a machine for grinding corn and other kinds of
                    grain. There are various kinds of mills, according to the different methods of
                    applying the moving power, as watermills, wind-mills, mills worked by horses,
                    and others. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Mechanics.</hi></p>
                <p>The first obvious method of reducing corn into flour for bread would be by the
                    simple expedient of pounding; and for ages this was the only one practised by
                    the various descendants of Adam. The same method continued in use amongst the
                    Romans until after the reign of Vespasian. But the process was very early
                    improved by the application of a grinding power, and the introduction of
                    millstones. This, like most of the common refinements in domestic life, was
                    probably the invention of the antediluvian world; it certainly was practised in
                    some of the earliest ages after the Deluge; and, like most of them, it was
                    equally known in the East and the West. Hence the Gauls and Britons appear to
                    have been familiarly acquainted with the use of hand-mills before the time of
                    their submission to the Romans; the Britons particularly distinguished them, as
                    the Highlanders do at present, by the simple appellations of <hi rend="italic"
                    >querns·,</hi><hi rend="italic">carnes,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">stones.</hi>
                    To these the Romans added the very’ useful invention of water-mills. For this
                    discovery the world is indebted to the genius of Italy; and, at the conquest of
                    Lancashire, the machine was not uncommon in the country. This the Romans
                    introduced along with their other refinements. The British appellation of a <hi
                    rend="italic">water-mill</hi> suggests this of itself; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >meliη</hi> of the Welsh and Cornish; the <hi rend="italic">mull, meill</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">meliη</hi> of the

                    Britons universally adopted the Roman name, but applied it, as their successors
                    did, only to the Roman <hi rend="italic">mill;</hi> and one of these was
                    probably erected at every station or city in the kingdom. There was one at
                    Manchester, which served equally the purposes of the town and the accommodation
                    of the garrison. This water-mill was fixed immediately below the Castlefield and
                    the town, on the channel of the Medlock. There, a little above the ancient ford,
                    the sluice of it was accidentally discovered about half a century ago.</p>
                <p>During the first five or six centuries of Rome, there were no public bread-bakers
                    in the imperial city. They were first introduced from the East, at the
                    conclusion of the war with Perseus, about the year 167 before Christ; and,
                    towards the close of the first century, the Roman families were supplied by them
                    every morning with fresh loaves for breakfast. But the same custom, which
                    prevailed originally amongst the Romans and many other nations, continued long
                    afterwards amongst the Mancunians. The providing of bread for every family was
                    left entirely to the attention of the women; and it was baked upon stones, which
                    the Welsh denominate <hi rend="italic">greidiols,</hi> and we <hi rend="italic"
                    >gredles.</hi> It appears, however, from the kiln-burned pottery which has been
                    discovered in the British sepulchres, and from the British appellation of an <hi
                    rend="italic">odyn</hi> or <hi rend="italic">oven</hi> remaining amongst us at
                    present, that furnaces for baking were generally known amongst the aboriginal
                    Britons. An odyn would, therefore, be erected in the mansion of each British
                    baron, for the use of himself and his retainers; and when he and they removed
                    into the vicinity of a Roman station, the oven would be rebuilt with the
                    mansion. One bakehouse would be constructed, as we have previously shown one
                    mill to have been set up, for the public service of all the Mancunian families.
                    It appears that one oven and one mill were established in the town, and that the
                    inhabitants were immemorially accustomed to bake at the one and grind at the
                    other. Both, therefore, were in all probability constructed at the first
                    introduction of water-mills and ovens into the country. The great similarity of
                    the appointments refers directly to one and the same origin; indeed, the general
                    nature of all such’ institutions points immediately to the first and actual
                    introduction of both. And, as the same establishments prevailed equally in other
                    parts of the north, and pretty certainly obtained over the whole extent of Roman
                    Britain, the same erections were as certainly made at every stationary town in
                    the kingdom.</p>
