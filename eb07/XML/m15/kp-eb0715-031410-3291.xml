                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    by the natives called Suera or Saweera, is a considerable sea-port of Morocco,
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823304" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3304-0315"/>in the
                    province of Shedma. This town, which was built by Sidi Mohammed in 1760, stands
                    upon a sandy beach forming a peninsula, the foundation of which is rocky, and is
                    separated from the cultivated country by a range of shifting sand-hills. A chain
                    of rocks, extending from the northern to the southern gate, defends the town
                    from the encroachments of the sea; but at spring-tides it is nearly insulated.
                    It consists of two parts, a citadel and an outer town. The customhouse,
                    treasury, residence of the alcaid, and the houses of the European merchants, are
                    situated in the former. The factory of Mogadore consists of ten or twelve
                    mercantile houses of different nations, whose owners, from the protection
                    granted to them by the emperor, live in complete security from the Moors, and
                    keep them at a rigid distance. With the exception of those who belong to the
                    body of foreign merchants, the Jews are compelled to reside in the outer town,
                    which, however, is walled in and protected by batteries, as well as the citadel.
                    Mogadore was built according to plans „furnished by a French engineer; and, as
                    far as parapets, ramparts, embrasures, cavaliers, batteries, and caseinates,
                    constitute a fortress, this is one; but these are of so flimsy and imperfect
                    construction as to be incapable of protecting the place for any length of time
                    against a regular force. The streets are laid out in right lines, but they are
                    unpaved and very narrow. The houses, although lofty and regular, have a sombre
                    aspect, from there being few windows facing the street. There is a handsome
                    market-place surrounded with piazzas, and the public buildings have a neat
                    appearance; but the situation is ill chosen, the immediate neigbourhood being an
                    absolute desert. The port is formed by a curve in the land, and by an island
                    nearly two miles in circumference, situated about a quarter of a mile from the
                    shore; but as there is only ten or twelve feet of water at ebb-tide, large
                    vessels lie at anchor a mile and a half west of the battery, which extends along
                    the west side of the town. The mouth of the harbour is narrow, yet a heavy sea
                    rolls in; but behind the island the anchorage is good. The battery, like the
                    other defensive works of Mogadore, is much more remarkable for its beauty than
                    its strength. The roadstead is very much exposed at certain seasons; and this
                    port, although the only one in the empire which maintains a regular and
                    uninterrupted commercial intercourse with Europe, is in many respects inferior
                    to that of El Waladia. Besides, the town is invested with shifting sand-hills,
                    which, blown about by the winds of winter, prove a great annoyance. In the
                    neighbourhood are cultivated parts, where barley and millet are chiefly raised;
                    and there are also fruits and esculent vegetables produced, principally
                    pomegranates, melons, figs, pomatas, and pease as good as those of England.
                    Notwithstanding many disadvantages, the climate of Mogadore is salubrious, and
                    not inimical to Europeans. Considerable quantities of that leather which bears
                    the name of the empire is prepared at this place. The population, according to
                    Jackson, is 10,000; but other authorities estimate it as high as 30,000, which
                    is certainly an exaggeration. Long. 9. 35. 30. W. Lat. 31. 32. 40. N.</p>
