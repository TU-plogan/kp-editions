                <p><label type="entry">MURRAY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Alexander</hi></label>, a
                    distinguished orientalist, was born at a place called Dunkitterick, in the
                    county of Galloway, on the 22d of October 1775. His father, Robert Murray, had
                    been a shepherd all his days, and his mother, Mary Cochrane, was the daughter of
                    a person in the same humble condition of life. From the circumstances of his
                    parents, therefore, it may be inferred that their means of educating their
                    offspring were extremely limited; indeed it appears that the subject of this
                    notice was in a great measure self-taught, having learned the alphabet by
                    copying the printed letters, and thus acquired simultaneously the elements both
                    of reading and writing. In 1784, he was put to school at New Galloway, where he
                    made rapid proficiency; but in a short time he was seized with an illness which
                    obliged him to leave school, and he saw no more of it for four years. He
                    continued, however, to pursue irregularly the process of self-tuition, devouring
                    everything that came in his way, including ballads and penny histories; and, in
                    the course of the year 1788, he was engaged by the heads of two families in the
                    parish of Kirkowen to teach their children to read and write, an employment
                    which he rendered subservient to his own improvement. He afterwards went to
                    school at the village of Minigaff, where he extended his acquisitions, chiefly
                    by his own indefatigable exertions, learned a little French, and in a short time
                    mastered the rudiments of Latin. He compared French and Latin, and by this
                    practice he riveted in his memory the words of both languages. His reading now
                    became extremely various; but he confesses that, although he certainly knew “a
                    great deal of words and matters,” his prosody was bad, and his English neither
                    fluent nor elegant. Indulging uncontrolled his appetite for knowledge, accuracy
                    was scarcely to be expected; he always strove to seize the sense, yet did not
                    weary himself by analysing every sentence he read; and thus he ranged through a
                    multitude of authors, sufficient, if carefully studied, to have occupied a
                    considerable portion of a lifetime. To such a knowledge of Latin as might be
                    acquired in this desultory manner, he added a smattering of Greek, and at length
                    set about learning Hebrew, the alphabet of which he already knew. He also amused
                    himself with writing songs and pieces of poetry, some of which, particularly a
                    ballad, “excited more admiration than it really merited.” After several years
                    spent in the same course of vigorous but irregular application, he came <hi
                    rend="subscript"> fc</hi> to Edinburgh, where he was kindly received by Dr
                    Baird, to whom he had brought a letter of introduction. On the day after his
                    arrival in town, he underwent an examination in the presence of Dr Baird, Dr
                    Finlayson, and Dr Moodie,∙ and, on this occasion, read and explained a passage
                    of a French author, an ode of Horace, a page of the Iliad, and a Hebrew psalm.
                    His uncommon acquirements excited admiration, and not only procured him the
                    direct advantages of academical instruction, but likewise obtained for him such
                    pecuniary aid as seemed necessary for the prosecution of his studies. At the end
                    of two years he obtained a bursary from the town; and about the same time he
                    engaged in private teaching, which he looked to as a chief source of support.
                    His views being directed to the church, he of course applied himself to those
                    particular studies which are prescribed to candidates for the sacred office;
                    but, whilst thus occupied, he devoted every leisure moment to the prosecution of
                    his favourite studies, investigating every language to which he had access, and
                    not only making himself acquainted with the dialects of Europe, but even
                    extending his researches into the languages of Asia, particularly Sanscrit. Nor
                    was his attention confined to words merely. He studied antiquities, and the
                    philosophy of grammar. Conceiving it to be impossible to investigate the history
                    of any one language without a competent knowledge of all the idioms directly or
                    collaterally connected with it, he sought to discover the source and elements of
                    all the modern dialects of Europe by an analytical examination of the languages
                    which had prevailed in that quarter of the globe, and thus attempted to throw
                    light on the origin, early history, and affiliation of the various nations by
                    which it is inhabited. “I have been gratified,” says he, “to find, what has
                    often been vaguely asserted, that the Greek and Latin are only dialects of a
                    language much more simple, elegant, and ancient, which forms the basis of almost
                    all the tongues of Europe, and, as I hope to demonstrate on some future
                    occasion, of Sanskrit itself.”</p>
                <p>At this time Murray was not known beyond the circle of a few select friends, by
                    far the most eminent of whom was John Leyden, a man of the same age, and of
                    congenial habits and pursuits. Indeed there was no one in Edinburgh with whom
                    Murray felt so much afraid to contend in languages and philosophy as Leyden; and
                    it is not a little remarkable, that the latter was heard to express a similar
                    apprehension of Murray. Leyden, who had already a high reputation, closed his
                    bright and brief career in the island of Java, where he died of fever in August
                    1811. Murray had yet to lay the foundation of his renown, and an opportunity was
                    ere long afforded him of bringing his great and various acquirements into public
                    nc-tice. Having been for some time an occasional contributor to the Scots
                    Magazine, he was at length appointed editor of that work, and had also an
                    opportunity afforded him of contributing several articles to the Edinburgh
                    Review. He was engaged by Mr Constable to superintend a new impression of
                    Bruce’s <hi rend="italic">Travels to discover the Source of the Nile</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> an undertaking for which his previous acquisitions had
                    singularly qualified him, inasmuch as he not only understood Abyssinian, but had
                    even mastered the two principal dialects of that language as actually spoken in
                    the country. He commenced his labours in September 1802, and the work appeared
                    in July 1805. During this interval, he resided chiefly at Kinnaird House, where
                    he had access to Bruce’s papers and manuscripts, and devoted himself with
                    unremitting assiduity to the completion of his task. This edition, consisting of
                    seven large octavo volumes, was enriched by Murray with a life of the traveller,
                    together with notes and an appendix containing curious and learned discussions
                    on philology, antiquities, and a variety of other subjects illustrative of the
                    author’s narrative. In the meanwhile Murray had been licensed as a preacher,
                    though without any prospect of obtaining a living in the church. But having been
                    strongly recommended to Dr James Muirhead, minister of Urr, who wished to have
                    an assistant and successor, he was appointed to this charge in 1806, and, on the
                    death of Dr Muirhead two years afterwards, became minister of the parish. In
                    1808, he published separately his Life of Bruce; and, in 1811, he was applied
                    to, at the suggestion of Mr Salt, to translate a letter in Geez, from the
                    governor Tygré to the king of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826996"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-6996-0599"/>Great Britain, a task which he performed in a very
                    satisfactory manner. He continued to perform his clerical duties and prosecute
                    his literary researches till 1812, when, the professorship of oriental languages
                    in the University of Edinburgh having become vacant by the death of Dr Moodie,
                    he was proposed as a candidate for the chair, and, after a keen contest, elected
                    by a majority of two votes. The other candidates were Dr Alexander Brunton, Dr
                    David Dickson, and Dr David Scot. In consequence of this appointment, he removed
                    to Edinburgh in November 1811, and immediately entered on the duties of his
                    class, for the use of which he had published <hi rend="italic">Outlines of
                    Oriental Philology,</hi> a small work, containing a meagre epitome of the
                    grammatical principles of the Hebrew language and its cognate dialects. His
                    class was attended not only by theological students, of whom some knowledge of
                    Hebrew is required, or at least expected, but also by several literary men, who
                    were anxious to cultivate or renew an acquaintance with that ancient language
                    under the guidance of so celebrated an orientalist. Dr Murray, however, was not
                    destined long to enjoy his preferment. His constitution was not robust, and a
                    pulmonary complaint, with which he had previously been affected, becoming
                    aggravated by the exertion required in preparing his academical lectures, at
                    length assumed a dangerous character, and, on the 15th of April 1813, terminated
                    his existence, in the thirty-seventh year of his age.</p>
                <p>Dr Murray was an estimable, and, in several respects, a remarkable man. Born in a
                    humble station, he had been indebted for his advancement in life not less to the
                    strict propriety of his conduct than to the extent and variety of his literary
                    attainments. Being in a great measure self-taught, especially in early life, he
                    had ranged through a vast field, without perhaps being thoroughly master of any
                    subject, and had become more remarkable for the diversity than the accuracy or
                    precision of his acquisitions. If he had been spared, he would no doubt have
                    rectified the defects inseparable from such a desultory course of application,
                    and narrowed the sphere of his labours, in order to proceed with greater
                    certainty of ultimate success; but it cannot be doubted, by persons conversant
                    with philology in its more improved and scientific form, that he often mistook
                    fanciful speculation for inductive reasoning, and erected premature
                    generalizations upon the uncertain basis of an arbitrary analysis.</p>
                <p>Dr Murray left behind him in manuscript a work entitled <hi rend="italic">History
                    of the European Languages, or Researches into the Affinities of the Teutonic,
                    Greek, Celtic, Sclavonic,</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">Indian
                    Nations,</hi> which was published in 1823, in two vols. 8vo, under the auspices
                    of Sir Henry Moncrieff, who enriched it with a life of the author, whilst Dr
                    Scot of Corstorphine performed the duties of editor, and contributed a preface.
                    The task undertaken in this work is truly gigantic, and, in prosecuting it, the
                    author labours to prove, or rather states as the result of his researches, that
                    all the languages of Europe may be traced to a single radical dialect; and that
                    this dialect, again, may be analytically resolved into a few monosyllables, nine
                    in number, some of which, according to the author, may even be considered as
                    variations of the others; indeed he is of opinion that <hi rend="italic">ug</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">wag</hi> were probably the first articulate sounds. Now
                    this, to say the least, is a very bold generalization; and, if it were
                    inductively deduced from a rigid analysis of all the languages which the author
                    attempts to resolve into nine monosyllabic elements, it would unquestionably be
                    a more wonderful triumph of human ingenuity than even the discovery of an
                    alphabet. But it is impossible not to feol that such an analysis is completely
                    beyond the reach of any single mind, even supposing its practicability,
                    abstractedly considered, were admitted; and, on the other hand, in following the
                    author through what he considers as his inductive method of reasoning, it is
                    equally difficult to avoid the conviction, which is forced upon us at every
                    step, that his assumptions are gratuitous, his deductions fanciful, and his
                    results altogether hypothetical and imaginary. In inductive reasoning analysis
                    precedes and ministers to synthesis, furnishing those elements which, by
                    composition, may be arranged into something that is distinct and demonstrable.
                    But it cannot for a moment be maintained that this may be truly predicated of Dr
                    Murray’s investigations. His results, even if they were true, are such as admit
                    of no general conclusion being deduced from them, because it is impossible, by
                    any known process of reasoning, to produce synthetically out of his nine
                    elementary monosyllables any definite or recognised form of human speech; and,
                    by the known laws of permutation, it may be proved that the rudest and the
                    poorest dialect ever found amongst mankind could not, by any process of art or
                    ingenuity, be generated out of such elements. So far, therefore, is “Dr Murray’s
                    system” from being “demonstrated truth,” or even “looking very like it,” as his
                    editor has fondly imagined, that it appears to be equally absurd, fanciful, and
                    visionary,—a sort of solemn, though of course unintentional, burlesque on the
                    extravagancies of etymologists; and, independently of all other considerations,
                    it is liable to this insuperable objection, that it proceeds upon an assumption
                    of identity amongst languages which differ entirely in their grammatical
                    structure and composition, as well as in their vocabularies, and which have
                    nothing in common except some few terms which have been interchanged in the
                    course of war, conquest, and commercial relations. A posthumous work, however,
                    ought not to be judged too severely; and it may readily be believed that, if the
                    author had lived to prepare it definitively for the press, he would have seen
                    cause, as his views enlarged, to modify and improve much that now appears
                    exaggerated or defective, and to impart to his system that method and unity
                    which are altogether indispensable in such investigations. <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    of Mansfield, a celebrated English lawyer, was the fourth son of David earl of
                    Stormont, and born at Perth on the 2d of March 1705. At the age of three years
                    he was carried to England for his education, and at fourteen admitted a king’s
                    scholar at Westminster School. At this seminary he evinced a taste for poetry,
                    and excelled in declamation and other exercises. In June 1723, he was entered of
                    Christ-Church College, Oxford, where he took the degree of bachelor of arts in
                    1727, and that of master in 1730. Having completed his academical studies, he
                    made a tour on the Continent, and on his return became a member of Lincoln’s
                    Inn. Being called to the bar, Mr Murray early acquired reputation and obtained
                    practice in his profession. This was, no doubt, partly owing to his talent for
                    public speaking, in which he was allowed to excel both old and young; but there
                    is evident injustice in the impression created by his success, that he was more
                    of a speaker than a lawyer, and that a decided talent for oratory implies a
                    species of disqualification for legal research. At the same time his attachment
                    to literature, and his intercourse with Pope and other wits of the day, gave
                    countenance to the idea that he loved poetry better than plodding, and
                    cultivated letters when he should have been immersed in the depths of legal
                    study. But time and experience, as they developed his powers and matured his
                    faculties, disabused the world of this most erroneous impression, and showed
                    that his mind was equally formed for cultivating jurisprudence, and for
                    excelling in oratory.</p>

                    of the Earl of Winchilsea; and in 1742 he was appointed solicitor-general, and
                    chosen representative of Boroughbridge, for which place he was afterwards
                    returned in 1747, and again in 1754. In 1748, he acted as one of the managers
                    for the impeachment of Lord Lovat by the Commons, and, in his observations on
                    the evidence, in reply to the prisoner, displayed so much candour and ability
                    that he was complimented by the accused no less than by the Lord Chancellor
                    Talbot, who presided at the trial. In 1753, a most injurious attack was made
                    upon his character as a public man. It had been alleged that Dr Johnson, a
                    person then thought of for preferment, and an intimate friend of Murray, was of
                    Jacobitical principles, and had some twenty years before drank the pretender’s
                    health in a public company. Mr Pelham, then minister, considered the story as of
                    sufficient importance to deserve investigation, and accordingly wrote to the
                    author of it, Fawcett, the recorder of Newcastle, to learn the truth. Fawcett
                    returned an evasive answer to the inquiry, but afterwards stated, in a
                    conversation with Lord Ravensworth, that Mr Murray, and Mr Stone, a gentleman
                    holding an office about the prince, had done so several times. Lord Ravensworth,
                    thinking the statement of Fawcett not to be slighted, as impeaching the loyalty
                    and principles of persons in official stations, made it the subject of such
                    frequent remark in conversation that the ministry took it up, and advised the
                    king to have the whole matter examined. His majesty acquiesced, and, after some
                    proceedings in the council, a committee of the House of Lords was appointed to
                    investigate the affair. When Mr Murray heard of this, he sent a message to the
                    king, humbly acquainting his majesty, that if called before such a tribunal upon
                    so trivial and scandalous a matter, he would resign his office, and decline to
                    answer any questions. In the beginning of 1753, however, it was brought before
                    the Lords upon the motion of the Duke of Bedford; but although the House divided
                    it was not told, and thus ended an affair which, according to Doddington, was
                    “the worst judged, the worst executed, and the worst supported point he ever saw
                    of such expectation.”</p>
                <p>In 1754, Mr Murray was appointed attorney-general in the room of Sir Dudley
                    Ryder; and, in 1756, he succeeded the same person as chief justice of the King’s
                    Bench. He took his seat on the bench on the 11th of November, and was
                    immediately afterwards raised to the peerage by the title of Baron Mansfield, to
                    himself and to the heirs male of his body. His first care was to introduce
                    regularity, punctuality, and despatch in carrying through the business of the
                    court; his next, to prevent delay and expenses in the disposal of causes where
                    the court entertained no doubt. These and other reforms equally necessary gave
                    general satisfaction, and the business of the court increased to an extent never
                    before known, yet continued to be despatched with exemplary regularity. It is
                    stated by Sir James Burrow, in the preface to his Reports, that at the sitting
                    for London and Middlesex, there were as many as eight hundred causes set down in
                    a year, “and all disposed of.” In consequence of method, and a few distinct
                    rules laid down to prevent delay, even where the parties themselves would have
                    willingly consented to it, the business <hi rend="italic">in banco,</hi>
                    notwithstanding its immensity, was carried through with equal despatch, nothing
                    being allowed to hang in court or accumulate, and upon the last day of term
                    there was rarely a single matter of any kind that remained undetermined. It
                    appears, indeed, that excepting in the case of Perrin and Blakc, and in that
                    relating to literary property, there had not been a final difference of opinion
                    in the court upon any point whatsoever, from the 6th of November 1756 to the
                    26th of May 1776; and it is not less remarkable that, excepting these two cases,
                    no judgment given during this period had been reversed either in the exchequer
                    cham ber or in parliament, whilst, even in respect to these reversals, great
                    difference of opinion existed amongst the judges.</p>
                <p>During the very unsettled state of the ministry in 1757, Lord Mansfield accepted
                    the office of chancellor of the exchequer, and was the means of effecting a
                    coalition of parties, out of which was formed a strong and successful
                    administration. In the same year he was offered the great seal, on the
                    retirement of Lord Hardwicke, but declined it. At the commencement of the reign
                    of George III., he was marked out as an object of party rancour, and continued
                    for many years exposed to violent and unsparing invective, the most vigorous
                    specimens of which have come down to us in the Letters of Junius. But the
                    virulence of party libels occasioned no interruption in the attention which he
                    uniformly paid to the business of his court. During the Rockingham
                    administration, in 1765, he opposed the bill for repealing the stamp act, and is
                    believed to have had some share in framing the protests recorded against it,
                    although he did not sign them. The affair of Mr Wilkes’ outlawry served to
                    rekindle the animosity with which he had been regarded by the popular party, and
                    exposed him to renewed attacks. The question, whether this outlawry should be
                    reversed or not, was a dry point of law, upon the wording of the record, and
                    nothing could possibly be more remote from considerations of expediency or
                    reasons of a political character. Yet, though merely a matter of special
                    pleading, it was rendered an occasion of much popular excitement; and upon the
                    day when judgment was to be given, not only the court, but the whole of
                    Westminster Hall and Palace Yard, were crowded with anxious spectators. The
                    court had made up their minds to reverse the outlawry, and thus place Mr Wilkes
                    in a situation to receive judgment on the conviction. Upon this occasion, Lord
                    Mansfield took notice of the popular excitement which had been directed against
                    the judges of the court, particularly himself; he declared his contempt for all
                    the threats which had been employed to deter the court from doing their duty;
                    and he described such attempts as calculated to have no effect at all, or only
                    one contrary to that which they were intended to produce, though he believed and
                    knew that he had fortitude enough to resist even that weakness. “No libels, no
                    threats, nothing that has happened, nothing that can happen,” said he, “will
                    weigh a feather against allowing the defendant, on this and every other
                    question, not only the whole advantage he is entitled to from substantial law
                    and justice, but every benefit from the most critical nicety of form, which any
                    other defendant could claim under the like objection. The only effect I feel,”
                    he adds, “is an anxiety to be able to explain the grounds upon which we proceed,
                    so as to satisfy all mankind, that a flaw of form, given way to in this case,
                    could not have been got over in any other.” Upon the same occasion he gave
                    expression to a very striking sentiment. “I honour the king,” said he, “and
                    respect the people; but many things acquired by the favour of either are, in my
                    account, objects not worth ambition. I wish popularity; but it is that
                    popularity which follows, not that which is run after.”</p>
                <p>In the beginning of 1770 Lord Mansfield was once more offered the great seal,
                    which he again declined; and a similar offer, renewed the following year, found
                    him equally inflexible. About the same time he was attacked, in both houses of
                    parliament, on account of his direction to the jury in the case of Woodfall the
                    printer, who had been prosecuted for a libel. But as his lordship’s doctrine,
                    however dangerous in point of general principle, seemed to be correctly deduced
                    from preceding decisions, and in accordance with the law as it then stood, and
                    as the whole court concurred in sanctioning it, his opinion stood its ground,
                    notwithstanding the powerful arguments with which it had been assailed.' The
                    direction which he gave to the jury was, in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827022"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-7022-0601"/>effect, that the question of law belonged
                    exclusively to the court, and that the only point competent for the jury to try
                    was merely the fact of publication, leaving it to the judges afterwards to
                    decide whether the matter published did or did not amount to a libel. In 1776
                    his lordship was raised to the dignity of earl, with remainder to Louisa
                    Viscountess Stormont, and to her heirs male by David Viscount Stormont her
                    husband.</p>
                <p>In June 1780, when the metropolis of the kingdom was, for several days, exposed
                    to all the fury of lawless banditti, which took advantage of the tumultuous
                    assemblages brought together by the Protestant Association, Lord Mansfield was
                    marked out as an object of popular vengeance, and his house in Bloomsbury
                    Square, with every thing it contained, including his library and manuscripts,
                    was burned to the ground. This occurred on the night of Tuesday the 7th of June;
                    and he did not appear in court until the 14th, which was the last day of term.
                    When he took his seat on the bench, a reverential silence prevailed, expressive
                    of sentiments of condolence and respect more affecting than the most eloquent
                    address which the occasion could have suggested. His lordship submitted to his
                    loss with calmness and dignity. At one moment, however, his feelings almost
                    overpowered him. Having entered the House of Lords whilst the capital was still
                    in the hands of the mob, now maddened by intoxication, and being loudly called
                    for as soon as he had taken his seat, he rose and said, “My Lords, on the
                    present occasion I shall not express my opinion from books; God knows, I have
                    none.” This touch of natural eloquence, delivered with suppressed emotion, had a
                    powerful effect on the house. His lordship was entitled, amongst others, to
                    recover the amount of his loss from the hundred, but he preferred no claim of
                    compensation. Further, in consequence of a vote of the House of Commons, the
                    treasury directed the surveyor of the Board of Works to apply to Lord Mansfield,
                    as one of the principal sufferers, requesting him to specify the nature and
                    amount of his loss; but he declined the proposed indemnification. “It does not
                    become me,” said he, “however great the loss may be, to claim or expect
                    reparation from the state.”</p>
                <p>From this time it seemed as if popular hatred had spent its force. Party
                    animosity appeared to be mitigated by the dignity with which he bore his heavy
                    loss; and, during the remainder of his life, all parties united in a common
                    feeling of respect and reverence for his character and virtues. Notwithstanding
                    his advanced age, he continued until 1787 to discharge his judicial functions
                    with his wonted regularity; but from that time his infirmities increased so
                    rapidly, that, in June 1788, he came to the resolution of resigning his office,
                    and withdrawing into the shade of retirement. On this occasion the gentlemen who
                    practised in the court where his lordship had so long presided, addressed to him
                    an eloquent letter expressive of their admiration and regret, and at the same
                    time consoling themselves with the reflection that his lordship was not cutoff
                    by the sudden stroke of a painful distemper, or incapacitated by the ebb of
                    those extraordinary faculties which had so long distinguished him, but that it
                    had pleased God to allow to the evening of an useful and illustrious life the
                    unclouded reflections of a superior and unfading mind over its varied events,
                    and the happy consciousness that it had been faithfully and eminently devoted to
                    the highest duties of human society. This letter was drawn up and transmitted to
                    the venerable judge, by Mr, afterwards Lord Erskine, and elicited a reply, in
                    which he declared, that if he had given any satisfaction, it was owing to the
                    learning and candour of the bar, the liberality and integrity of whose practice
                    freed from difficulty the judicial investigation of truth, and facilitated the
                    administration of justice. His health continued to decline, but his mental
                    faculties remained unim paired almost to the last. He was happy to receive
                    intelligent visitors, and conversed freely upon the events of the time. Of the
                    French revolution he is said to have observed, that it was an extraordinary
                    event, and that, as it was without example, so it was without a prognostic. He
                    died on the 20th of March 1793, in the eighty-ninth year of his age, leaving his
                    immense fortune to his nephew Lord Stormont, who also, in virtue of a new patent
                    granted in 1792, succeeded to his title.</p>
                <p>The character of this noble and learned person has been ably delineated by Dr
                    Hurd in his preface to the works of Bishop Warburton. That he was, in many
                    respects, an extraordinary man, and that his name will go down to posterity with
                    distinguished honour in the public records of the nation, cannot reasonably be
                    doubted. His shining talents displayed themselves in every department of the
                    state, as well as in the supreme court of justice, his peculiar province, which
                    he filled with a reputation not exceeded by any of his predecessors. As a
                    politician, he had too little courage to be the leader, and too much ability to
                    be the dupe, of any party. He was believed to speak his own sense of public
                    measures; and the authority of his judgment was so high, that, in ordinary
                    times, the house was usually guided by it. He was not a forward nor a frequent
                    speaker, but reserved himself for occasions worthy of himself, and never spoke
                    except on subjects which he had carefully considered. In debate he was eloquent
                    as well as judicious; or rather he became eloquent by his wisdom and good sense,
                    flowing in apt terms, and in the clearest method. He affected no sallies of
                    imagination, no bursts of passion, no mere <hi rend="italic">tours de
                    force</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> much less did he condescend to personal abuse
                    or virulent altercation. All was clear and apparently candid reason, instilling
                    itself so easily into the minds of his hearers, as at once to convey information
                    and to carry conviction along with it. He shrunk from direct contention with
                    Chatham, when Chatham came forth in his might; and he is even said to have been
                    overawed by the ascendency of that great man’s powers, or at least restrained by
                    his fierce and unsparing invective. But this may, with some reason, be doubted.
                    He knew that such triumphs are always temporary, often momentary; that it is not
                    by sudden coruscations of genius or eloquence that a deliberative assembly is
                    permanently or effectually influenced; that to effect such an object, genius
                    must ally itself with reason, enlightened by knowledge, and directed by
                    judgment; and that it is by the force of persuasion alone that the decisions of
                    such a body can ultimately be determined. In this conviction he seems to have
                    formed himself to the truest and best manner of speaking. His powers of genius
                    and invention were confessedly of the first order; but he owed less to them,
                    perhaps, than to the diligent and studious cultivation of his judgment In
                    private life Lord Mansfield was easy, friendly, and engaging; extremely sensible
                    of worth in other men, and ready upon all occasions to countenance and patronize
                    it. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
