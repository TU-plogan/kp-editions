                    Seigneur Duplessis Marly, was born at Buhy or Bishuy, in Upper Normandy, in
                    France, in 1549, and was educated at Paris. He made a rapid progress in the
                    belles lettres, in the learned languages, and in theology, which was then
                    thought a prodigy in a gentleman. At first he was destined for the church; but
                    the principles of Calvinism, which he had imbibed from his mother, effectually
                    excluded him from the ecclesiastical preferments to which, by his interest,
                    abilities, and birth, he would have been entitled. After the horrible massacre
                    of St Bartholomew, Philippe de Mornay made the tour of Italy, Germany, England,
                    and the Low Countries; and he was equally improved and delighted by his travels.
                    Mornay afterwards joined the king of Navarre, at that time leader of the
                    Protestant party, and since so well known by the name of Henry IV. This prince
                    sent Mornay, who employed his whole abilities, both as a soldier and a writer,
                    in defence of the Protestant cause, to conduct a negociation with Elizabeth
                    queen of England; and left him wholly to his own discretion in the management of
                    that business. He was successful in almost every negociation, because he
                    conducted it like an able politician, and not in a spirit of intrigue. He
                    tenderly loved Henry IV. and spoke to him upon all occasions as to a friend.
                    λVhen he was wounded at Aumale, he wrote to him in these words: “Sire, You have
                    long enough acted the part of Alexander, it is now time you should act that of
                    Caesar. It is our duty to die for your majesty. It is glorious for you, Sire,
                    that I dare venture to tell you it is your duty to live for us.” This faithful
                    subject did every thing in his power to raise Henry to the throne; but when he
                    deserted the Protestant faith, he reproached him in the bitterest manner, and
                    retired from court. Yet Henry still loved him, and was extremely affected with
                    an insult which he received in 1597, when one Saint Phal beat him severely with
                    a cudgel, and left him on the ground for dead. Mornay demanded justice from the
                    king, who gave him the following answer, a proof as well of his spirit as of his
                    goodness of heart. “Monsieur Duplessis, I am exceedingly offended at the insult
                    you have received; and I sympathize with you both as your sovereign and your
                    friend. In the former capacity, I shall do justice to you and to myself; and had
                    I sustained only the character of your friend, there are few perhaps who would
                    have drawn their sword or sacrificed their life more cheerfully in your cause.
                    Be satisfied, then, that I will act the part of a king, a master, and a friend.”
                    Mornay’s knowledge, probity, and valour, made him the soul of the Protestant
                    party, and procured him the contemptuous appellation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pope of the Huguenots.</hi> He defended their doctrines both by speech and
                    writing. One of his books, on the Iniquity of the Mass, having stirred up the
                    Catholic divines, he refused to make any reply to their censures and criticisms
                    except in a public conference. This was accordingly appointed to be held in the
                    year 1600, at Fontainebleau, where the court then was. The two champions were,
                    Duperron bishop of Evreux, and Mornay. After a great many arguments and replies
                    on both sides, the victory was adjudged toDuperron. He had boasted that he would
                    point out to the satisfaction of every one five hundred errors in his
                    adversary’s book, and he partly kept his word. The Calvinists did not fail to
                    claim the victory on this occasion, and they still continue to do so. But this
                    conference, instead of putting an end to the differences, was productive of new
                    quarrels amongst the controversialists, and of much profane wit amongst the
                    libertines. A Huguenot minister, who was present at the conference, observed
                    with great concern to a captain of the same party: “The bishop of Evreux has
                    already driven Mornay from several strongholds.” “No matter,” replied the
                    soldier, provided he does not drive him from Saumur.” This was an important
                    place on the river Loire, of which Duplessis was governor, and whither he
                    retired, his attention being constantly occupied in defending the Huguenots, and
                    in making himself formidable to the Catholics. When Louis XIII. was making
                    preparations against the Protestants, Duplessis wrote him a letter, dissuading
                    him from such a measure. After employing the most plausible arguments, he
                    concludes by observing, that to make war on the subject, is an indication of
                    weakness in the government. “Authority,” says he, “consists in the quiet
                    submission of the people, and is established by the prudence and justice of the
                    governor. Force of arms ought never to be employed except in repelling a foreign
                    enemy. The late king would have sent the new ministers of state to learn the
                    first elements of politics, who, like unskilful surgeons, would apply violent
                    remedies to every disease, and advise a man to cut off an arm when his finger
                    aches.” But these remonstrances produced no other effect than the loss of the
                    government of Saumur, of which he was deprived by Louis XIII. in 1621. He died
                    two years afterwards, on the 11th of November 1623, aged seventy-four, in his
                    barony of La Foret-sur-Seure, in Poitou.</p>
                <p>The following is a list of his works: 1. Un Traité de l’Eucharistie, 1604, in
                    folio; 2. Un Traité de la Vérité de la Religion Chrétienne, 8vo; 3. A book
                    entitled La Mystère d’iniquité, 4to; 4. Un Discours sur le Droit prétendu par
                    ceux de la maison de Guise, 8vo; 5. Curious and interesting Memoirs from the
                    year 1572 to 1629, four vols. 4to, valuable; 6. Letters, which are written with
                    great spirit and good sense. David des Liques has published a life of De Mornay,
                    in a quarto volume, which is more interesting for the matter than the style.</p>
