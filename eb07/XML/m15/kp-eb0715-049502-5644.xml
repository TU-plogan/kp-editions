                <p><label type="entry">MOREAU, <hi rend="smallcaps">John Victor</hi></label>, one of
                    the greatest generals of the French revolution, was born at Morlaix, in the year
                    1763. He was the son of a respectable advocate, who had destined him for the
                    same profession; but having early conceived a decided predilection for the army,
                    he enlisted in a regiment, in which he served for a short time, until his father
                    purchased his discharge, and sent him to resume his studies. He did so with
                    considerable success, and at length became <hi rend="italic">prévôt</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de droit</hi> at Rennes, where he exercised a sort of supremacy
                    over the students, by whom he was greatly beloved. In 1787, when the ministry
                    wished to effect a revolution in the magistracy, he joined in resisting the
                    attempt, and having figured in the early troubles, as chief of the youth of
                    Rennes, was called “the general of the parliament.” At the commencement of the
                    revolution, he raised a company of volunteer gunners, of which he became
                    captain, and having organized and instructed it, he continued to serve in the
                    same capacity until the year 1792. Far from foreseeing the part which he was
                    destined one day to perform, he became tired of a situation which seemed to lead
                    to nothing, and took measures to get admitted into the gendarmerie, where he
                    aspired only to a subaltern rank. But, happily, his wishes were not complied
                    with, and he enrolled himself in a battalion of volunteers which was then
                    setting out to join the army of the North.</p>
                <p>He made his first campaign under Dumouriez, as commandant of a battalion; in
                    1793, he became general of brigade, and the following year he was promoted to
                    the rank of general of division, on the recommendation of Pichegru, who
                    immediately confided to him a corps destined to act in maritime Flanders. Moreau
                    took possession first of Menin, then of Bruges, Ostend, Nieuport, the island of
                    Cassandria, and, lastly, of Sluys, which capitulated on the 26th of August. At
                    the moment when he made this conquest for the republic, the revolutionists of
                    Brest were sending his aged father to the scaffold as an aristocrat. This
                    venerable old man, whom the people of Morlaix called the father of the poor, had
                    undertaken to manage the property of some emigrants; and this was employed as a
                    pretext to destroy him. Moreau had already become disgusted with the
                    revolutionary system, and such an event naturally increased his detestation. He
                    conceived that he had no longer any country but the camp, nor any home but his
                    tent in the field.</p>
                <p>From this time, however, he began to lay the foundation of his military
                    reputation, and commanded, with great distinction, the right wing of the army of
                    Pichegru, which, during the celebrated winter campaign of 1794, subjugated
                    Holland to France. Supported by the suffrages and friendship of his
                    general-in-chief, and esteemed by all for his talents and bravery, he was
                    appointed to the command of the army of the North, when Pichegru went to assume
                    that of the army of the Rhine and Moselle; and immediately devised a plan of
                    operations worthy of a consummate general, which he communicated to the
                    revolutionary government established in Holland, and peremptorily required them
                    to sanction. After the retreat of Pichegru, he assumed the chief command of the
                    army of the Rhine and Moselle, and, in the year 1796, opened that, campaign
                    which became the foundation of his military fame. Having driven back Wurmser
                    towards Manheim, he effected the passage of the Rhine near Strasburg, attacked
                    the Archduke Charles at Rastadt, forced him to abandon the course of the Necker,
                    and, on the 11th of August, fought a battle near Heydenheim, which lasted
                    seventeen hours. The Austrians having retired on the Danube, Moreau advanced,
                    and soon found himself opposed by General Latour, who was daily receiving
                    reinforcements; but believing himself supported by the diversion, or rather the
                    parallel invasion, of Jourdan towards Ratisbon, he continued his forward
                    movement. The discomfiture and retreat of Jourdan, however, disconcerted all his
                    combinations, and, leaving his flank completely uncovered, obliged him to
                    retire. This retreat commenced on the 11th of September, and, though severely
                    criticised by Napoleon, is unquestionably one of the finest operations of the
                    kind recorded in the history of war. At first he appeared desirous to occupy
                    both banks of the Danube; then suddenly repassing the Lech, he defeated, one
                    after another, in his retrograde march, all the enemy’s corps which sought to
                    intercept his retreat. In spite of the greatest obstacles, he succeeded in
                    debouching into the Brisgau, passed the Rhine at Brisach, and preserved on the
                    right bank two bridge-heads, one at Brisach, and the other at the fort of Kehl.
                    This fine retreat from the frontiers of Austria and Bavaria to the banks of the
                    Rhine was generally and justly admired. Though pressed by superior forces, with
                    both his flanks uncovered, he showed a religious respect for the neutrality of
                    Switzerland, and preferred forcing a passage through the defiles of the Black
                    Forest, already occupied by the imperialists, to the violation of a neutral and
                    friendly territory; an example but rarely imitated. Nor was this all. With a
                    noble superiority<pb break="no" facs="nls:193825657"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-5657-0496"/> to all feelings of rivalry, Moreau, having
                    learned that Bonaparte found himself hard pressed by the Austrian forces in
                    Italy, detached a corps sufficient to reinforce him, and received, in return for
                    this seasonable aid, the warmest acknowledgments from Carnot, then at the head
                    of the war department.</p>
                <p>At the opening of the next campaign, 1797, Moreau, resuming the offensive,
                    effected the passage of the Rhine, in open day, by main force, and in the face
                    of the enemy ranged in order of battle upon the opposite bank. This brilliant
                    operation took place on the same day that the preliminaries of Leoben were
                    signed by Bonaparte, and the immediate consequences were the surrender of the
                    fort of Kehl, and the capture of nearly forty thousand prisoners, besides
                    several standards. The army passed the rest of the summer in its positions.</p>
                <p>The republic was then on the verge of a crisis, brought on by the struggle which
                    had taken place between the executive directory and the councils, that is,
                    between the revolutionary principle and the commencement of monarchical ideas.
                    But it was not until after the 18th of Fructidor (4th of September 1797) that
                    Moreau, challenged by the directors, whom force had rendered triumphant, gave up
                    to them the correspondence of the Prince of Condé with Pichegru, which had been
                    seized at the commencement of the campaign, in the baggage-waggons of an
                    Austrian general, and which he had hitherto kept back, partly from regard to his
                    old friend and benefactor, partly from <hi rend="subscript"> κ</hi> a desire to
                    await the issue of the struggle between the government and the councils. Being
                    almost at the same moment ordered to Paris, by that portion of the directory
                    which had proved victorious, and to which he had been denounced, Moreau, on the
                    7th of September, transmitted to that body a copy of one of his proclamations,
                    the effect of which, he said, had been to convert many persons favourable to
                    Pichegru, “for whom he had long lost all esteem and respect.” This letter, which
                    was then strongly condemned by the public, as an act of excessive weakness, did
                    not, however, appear in the same light to Pichegru himself, by whom it was
                    regarded with indifference; and it is certain" that his friendship for Moreau
                    suffered no diminution in consequence. But, however this may be, it did not
                    conciliate in favour of the writer the good will of a suspicious government, and
                    Moreau was even obliged to resign, and to shelter himself in retirement.</p>
                <p>He remained unemployed until towards the end of the year 1798, when he received
                    the title of inspector-general, which was a mere nominal appointment; but in the
                    month of April 1799, the misfortunes which had attended the recommencement of
                    war rendered his talents necessary. Of all the French conquests, that of Italy
                    appeared to be in the greatest danger. Moreau was therefore sent to the army
                    commanded by Scherer, on the Adige, where he remained several months without
                    command, and witnessed defeats which his counsels could neither prevent nor
                    repair. Scherer, however, finding all his resources exhausted, devolved on him
                    the task of saving the army. Moreau had already, in a council of war, signified
                    his opinion, that the army should retire on Piedmont, avoiding any serious
                    engagementwith the Austro-Russian army, which had already acquired a decided
                    superiority, and was now rapidly advancing under Marshal Suwarof. At length,
                    after long resisting the entreaties of the other generals, he accepted the
                    command of the army, when it had retired behind the Adda. Being soon forced from
                    his position at Casano, he retired in good order on the Tesino; and having
                    carried his right towards the Apennines, he formed a sort of intrenched camp
                    behind the Po and the Tanaro, between Alessandria and Valentia. On the 11th of
                    May he repulsed the Russians near Bassignano, and then passed the Bormida; but
                    being assailed by the greater part of the forces under Suwarof, he was obliged
                    to evacuate Valentia and Alessandria. The war had now assumed a
                    counter-revolutionary character, and every advance of the allies was favoured by
                    insurrections of the peasants, who joined them on all sides. In this critical
                    situation Moreau retired upon Coni, and took up a position on the Col di Tende,
                    causing the division of General Victor to defile by his right, in order to
                    maintain his communications with General Macdonald, who was then rapidly
                    advancing from the kingdom of Naples in order to join him. In the view of
                    seconding this operation, Moreau penetrated into the country of Genoa by the
                    Apennines, the passages and heights of which he occupied; and he hoped
                    immediately to resume the offensive. But in vain did he quit Genoa with fifteen
                    thousand men, and beat the corps with which the Austrian general Bellegarde
                    attempted to oppose him; in vain did he relieve Tortona, and drive the enemy as
                    far as the Voghera: the victory which Suwarof gained over the army of Naples at
                    the Trebbia rendered all his efforts unavailing, and forced him to regain the
                    shelter of the Apennines.</p>
                <p>Moreau had just been appointed to the chief command of the army of the Rhine,
                    when Joubert arrived to replace him in that of Italy. Being on the point of
                    fighting a battle,—which, by the fall of Mantua, and the junction of Kray with
                    Suwarof, had become inevitable,—Joubert wished to leave the direction of it to
                    him; but he refused, and begged permission to combat under the orders of the new
                    chief of the army. At this battle, which was fought at Novi, and in which
                    Joubert fell, Moreau run the greatest risks, having had three horses killed
                    under him, and his uniform pierced by balls. After a fierce conflict, the French
                    army was defeated; but Moreau operated his retreat with so much superiority,
                    that he almost nullified the victory which the allies had gained.</p>
                <p>In proceeding to assume the command of the army of the Rhine, Moreau reached
                    Paris at the moment when the Directory was sinking under the weight of contempt,
                    hatred, and its own imbecility. The faction which had formed the design of
                    overturning it, persuaded that nothing but the adhesion of a general of great
                    reputation could restore consideration to the government, sounded Moreau, who,
                    distrusting his ability to direct the affairs of his country amidst the conflict
                    of parties, refused to attempt such a task. It is known that he afterwards
                    regretted bitterly this distrust in himself.</p>
                <p>On the arrival of Bonaparte, who had escaped from Egypt, Moreau consented to
                    serve under the orders of that general, and, by his influence and means, to
                    promote the revolution which was then preparing. But scarcely had it been
                    effected at Saint-Cloud, on the 18th of Brumaire (9th of November 1799), when he
                    saw reason to apprehend that he had concurred in giving a tyrant to his country.
                    Being almost immediately called to assume the command on the Rhine and the
                    Danube, he introduced several important changes into the constitution of the
                    army. He began by placing the corps of the wings and centre under the orders of
                    three lieutenants upon whom he could implicitly depend. He then formed a corps
                    of reserve, amounting to nearly one third of his whole force, and destined to
                    act only under his own orders. His plan, which consisted in penetrating into
                    Suabia, and even into the heart of the hereditary states, was not approved by
                    Bonaparte, who, thinking only of reconquering Italy, wished to make the army of
                    the Rhine merely an army of observation. But Moreau stuck firmly to his plan,
                    and resisted. Napoleon felt greatly offended; and this dispute as to the
                    co-operation of the two armies proved the germ of that mutual hatred which
                    sprung up between these celebrated rivals, and which was probably one of the
                    causes of their common ruin. Nevertheless, as the prompt success of the
                    operations on the Rhine could alone open to Bonaparte a passage into Italy, by
                    drawing off the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825670" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5670-0497"
                    />Austrians from those positions where they might have intercepted his
                    communications with France, it became necessary to yield, and to leave to Moreau
                    all the honour of the conception of the plan of campaign, and all the means for
                    carrying it into execution. Accordingly a sort of arrangement took place at
                    Paris, where General Dessoles, head of the staff of the army of the Rhine,
                    discussed the subject with Napoleon, and ultimately succeeded in inducing him to
                    give way to the opinion of Moreau.</p>
                <p>The success of the campaign which ensued was throughout decisive. At its
                    commencement Moreau, having led Field-marshal Kray, who was opposed to him, to
                    entangle himself in the valleys descending from the Brisgau, effected the
                    passage of the Rhine at Stein. He encountered the enemy, first at Stockach,
                    where he defeated him, and then fought successively the battles of Engen and
                    Moeskirch, in both of which he was victorious. Kray, forced to abandon his line
                    of operations, had retired in good order beyond the Danube. Moreau immediately
                    marched into Suabia, upon which the imperial army repassed the river; but being
                    overtaken by the French, it was once more defeated at Bibè-rach. The Austrians
                    then retired into their intrenched camp at Ulin, and being thus separated from
                    the Tyrol, could undertake nothing calculated to change the course of events, or
                    obstruct Napoleon in effecting the passage of the Great St Bernard. In this way
                    the victories gained by Moreau facilitated the conquest of Italy; and he even
                    detached a corps of twelve thousand men to reinforce the army of the First
                    Consul. Finding, however, that neither his demonstrations, nor his rapid
                    incursions into Bavaria, could induce Marshal Kray to quit his unexpugnable
                    position at Ulm, Moreau conceived the design of crossing the Danube below that
                    place, and throwing himself between the Austrian army and its magazines, that
                    is, upon its line of communications. To pass the river above Donawerth, to force
                    the enemy’s army to quit its intrenched camp by detaching it from its base of
                    operations, and to oblige it to retreat, leaving Bavaria uncovered; such was the
                    bold plan, the complete execution of which crowned the talents of the general by
                    whom it had been devised. Having advanced beyond the Lech, Moreau attacked the
                    Austrians along their whole line, crossed the Danube at Blenheim by main force,
                    and, on the left bank of the river, in the plains of Hochstadt, obtained, by
                    similar manoeuvres, on the !9th of June, an advantage similar to that which
                    Bonaparte had gained at Marengo only three days before. Kray having at length
                    abandoned his position at Ulm, Moreau marched in pursuit of the marshal, whom he
                    once more vanquished at Neuburg; he then entered Bavaria, again defeated the
                    Austrians at Landshut, and only suspended his operations after having caused
                    them to sign, on the 15th of July, the armistice of Parsdorf, in imitation of
                    the convention entered into at Alessandria.</p>
                <p>This suspension of arms continued until the end of November, when Moreau, having
                    returned to his army, announced to it the resumption of hostilities. His
                    adversary was now the Archduke John, and the army opposed to him amounted to an
                    hundred and twenty thousand men. This numerical superiority of force inspired
                    the Austrians with such confidence that they assumed the offensive. The two
                    armies were then separated by the course of the Inn. The archduke passed the
                    river, and the left wing of the French, being opposed to the mass of his army,
                    Moreau retreated, and continuing his movement on Hohenlinden, succeeded in
                    drawing the enemy into the defiles near that place. The moment for striking a
                    blow had now arrived. At this place, on the 3d of December 1800, he delivered to
                    the Austrian army that bloody and decisive battle, in which there was not a
                    French corps that did not come into action and cover itself with glory. The
                    contest began in the centre, and. soon became general; but all the efforts of
                    the Austrians to debouch from the forest into the plain proved unavailing. The
                    corps of Gen eral Richepanse, marching across the forest, turned the Austrian
                    centre, which it soon put to flight; and this was followed by that of the
                    remainder of their army. Thus terminated this memorable battle, which was
                    completely gained by the literal and precise execution of the plan prescribed by
                    the general-inchief, particularly in regard to the flank movement of Richepanse
                    on the enemy’s line of retreat, which decided the fortune of the day. At four
                    o’clock, eleven thousand prisoners and a hundred pieces of cannon were in the
                    hands of the victors; and these trophies would have been still more considerable
                    had not the long winter night and the bad state of the roads favoured the
                    retreat of so many broken and disunited corps. More than six thousand Austrians
                    remained on the field of battle, whilst the loss of the French did not exceed
                    two thousand five hundred men killed and wounded. To the congratulations of his
                    generals, Moreau replied by attributing to them the principal share in the glory
                    of the day; and the only indication of joy which escaped him was betrayed by the
                    observation he made to them: “My friends, yon have conquered peace.”</p>
                <p>The archduke having taken refuge behind the Inn, Moreau pursued him without
                    intermission, gained another victory at Lauffen, and having passed the Salza,
                    occupied Saltzburg, penetrated into the hereditary states, and, continuing his
                    advance, carried terror to the gates of Vienna. Nor did he suspend his march
                    until the Archduke Charles, who had been again placed at the head of the
                    imperial army, announced to him that the emperor had resolved to make peace,
                    whatever might be the determination of his allies; and this declaration served
                    as the basis of the armistice of Steyer, signed on the 25th of December. This
                    campaign of twenty-five days placed Moreau in the rank of the greatest captains,
                    and entitled him to the homage of public admiration, which was paid to him on
                    his return to Paris.</p>
                <p>Bonaparte presented him with a pair of pistols magnificently mounted, observing
                    that he had wished to have had his victories engraved on them, but found that
                    there would not be room; a forced eulogium, which betrayed the ill-dissembled
                    jealousy excited by so many triumphs. Napoleon knew that Moreau had been
                    indebted for his victories to the rare devotion of the secondary generals, and
                    the good spirit of the army, which he had captivated by his natural benevolence;
                    he was not ignorant that Moreau commanded with firmness, but never with
                    harshness, preserving always towards his principal officers the affectionate
                    tone of a comrade; and that his head-quarters resembled a family circle, where
                    all objects of public interest connected with war and administration were
                    discussed with the most perfect freedom.</p>
                <p>This last consideration had given great umbrage to Bonaparte; and Moreau, who was
                    deficient in civil prudence, acted in such a manner as to increase the suspicion
                    with which he was regarded. His house became the rendezvous of persons avowedly
                    inimical to the consular government; and he was by imperceptible degrees drawn
                    into that fatal connection with Pichegru and his associates which eventually
                    proved the cause of his ruin. The particulars of this affair, with the arrest,
                    imprisonment, trial, and sentence of Moreau, will be found narrated in the
                    historical portion of the article <hi rend="smallcaps">France,</hi> to which the
                    reader is accordingly referred. On the 10th of June 1804, he was sentenced to
                    two years’ detention, which, by the influence of Fouché, was commuted into
                    permission to travel, on condition that he should retire to the United States,
                    and not return to France without the leave of Bonaparte. He accordingly set out
                    for Spain, escorted by gendarmes, and in 1805 embarked at Cadiz for the United
                    States, where he resided for about eight years, beloved and respected by all who
                    knew him.</p>

                <p>After the disasters which befel the French grand army in the retreat from Moscow,
                    and when Napoleon, with incredible energy, was repairing his losses, and about
                    to renew the contest in Germany, the Emperor Alexander, aware that he had no
                    general capable of contending with that wonderful man, made secret overtures to
                    Moreau; and the latter having decided to embrace the offers of the Czar, and
                    join him in the approaching contest, embarked on the 21st of June 1813 with Μ.
                    de Svinine, counsellor of the Russian embassy, and on the 24th of July entered
                    the port of Gottenburg. At Stralsund he passed three days with his old companion
                    in arms Bernadotte, then Crown Prince of Sweden, and having concerted with him
                    the plan of the ensuing campaign, proceeded to join the allied sovereigns at
                    Prague, where, as might have been expected, he was received in the most
                    flattering manner.</p>
                <p>The plan of the allies consisted in debouching from Bohemia with their grand
                    army, in order to turn and attack Dresden, which formed the pivot of Napoleon’s
                    operations. The attack commenced on the 26th of August, and was resumed the
                    following day, when Moreau, having advanced to observe a movement of the French,
                    was struck by a cannon ball, which fractured the knee of the right leg, and,
                    passing through, carried away the calf of the left. He fell into the arms of
                    Colonel Rapatel, exclaiming, “I am done for, but it is pleasant to die in so
                    good a cause.” Being removed to an adjoining house, he there underwent
                    amputation of the right leg, and the same operation was performed on the left,
                    which had been too much shattered to admit the possibility of its being saved.
                    In this horribly mutilated condition, the allied army being now in full retreat,
                    he was transported to a considerable distance on a blanket covered with
                    curtains, and the following day carried as far as Laun, where he lingered in
                    agony till· the morning of the 2d of September, when he expired. At the time of
                    his death he had prepared for publication a proclamation to the French, which
                    the Emperor Alexander had approved, and in which he explained the object of his
                    return to Europe, the most questionable act of his life; namely, to assist the
                    French in emancipating themselves from the despotism of Bonaparte, and to
                    sacrifice his life, if necessary, to restore prosperity to his country, all the
                    true sons of which he invited to rally round the standards of independence. It
                    is unfortunate for his memory, however, that he died in arms against his
                    country; that his personal wrongs obliterated all sense of the duty which he
                    owed her as a son, whoever might be at the head of her government; and that,
                    having joined the enemies of her glory, he fell in the moment when the arms of
                    France were victorious. As a warrior, however, Moreau was superior to all the
                    generals of the Revolution, Napoleon excepted; he combined the caution of Fabius
                    with the cool determination of Turenne; in every succeeding campaign his genius
                    shone forth with increased splendour; and his last achievement at Hohenlinden
                    exhibited an union of scientific combination with precise and vigorotís
                    execution which has seldom been equalled and never surpassed, <hi
