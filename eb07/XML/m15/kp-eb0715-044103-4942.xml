                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    province of Hindustan, which formerly comprehended the country on both sides of
                    the Indus, between the 24th and 30th degrees of north latitude. It is bounded on
                    the north by Lahore and Afghanistan, on the south by Ajmeer and Sinde, on the
                    east by Lahore and Ajmeer, and on the west by Beloochistan. The following are
                    the territorial subdivisions of this province, namely, first, Mooltan Proper;
                    second, Bahawulpoor; third, Backar; fourth, Sinde; fifth, Tatta; sixth,
                    Chalchkaun. The greatest length of this territory is 110 miles, by about 70, its
                    greatest breadth; and it is comprehended between the Sutleje, or the Gurrah, as
                    it is here named, the Ravey, and the Chinaub. The northern and eastern districts
                    of this province are watered by the rivers of the Punjab, and the tract which is
                    within the reach of the inundation is extremely fertile, but becomes gradually
                    more sandy and barren as it approaches the desert situated between Sewee and
                    Backar, over which, during the summer months, the hot winds usually blow. To the
                    west of the Indus the country is still more arid and barren, and terminates in a
                    long ridge of black rocks. Fine camels are produced in many parts of this
                    province; and a breed of excellent horses, said to be descended from those of
                    Nadir Shah, stolen by the natives from him whilst on his return to Persia. It is
                    related, in the Mahommedan annals, that this province was invaded about the year
                    712, by a body of Arabs under the command of Mohammed Cossim, who converted many
                    of the natives to the Mahommedan religion. It was invaded early in the eleventh
                    century by the celebrated Mahmoud of Ghizni, and was afterwards subject to the
                    monarchs of Delhi. After the overthrow of this empire by Timour, in the end of
                    the fourteenth century, it remained an independent kingdom till the middle of
                    the sixteenth century, and soon afterwards became subject to the Mogul dynasty,
                    on the decline of which it fell into the hands of independent chiefs. It was in
                    the hands of the Mahrattas a short time before the battle of Paniput, after
                    which it was lost by them, and never subsequently recovered. At a later period
                    it was occupied by the Sikhs. The greater part of it was long held by the nabob
                    of Mooltan, who was obliged to pay tribute to the Afghans, Sikhs, and rulersof
                    Sinde, by whom he is surrounded. In 1818 it was taken possession of by Runjeet
                    Singh, under whose rule it still remains. Little is known of the internal
                    government, but it is known to be oppressive and tyrannical, being subject,
                    besides the extortions of the government, to those of a licentious soldiery. The
                    population consists of Afghans, Jats, and other Hindu tribes; but the cities are
                    occupied by people from all parts of the East. Its principal towns are
                    Behawulpore, Adjodin, Cutch, Mooltan, and Debalpore.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mooltan,</hi> the capital of the above province, situated
                    four miles from the left bank of the Chinaub or Acesines, below the points where
                    it receives the waters of the Ravey (Hydraotes) and the Jhylum (Hydrastes), and
                    about thirty miles above its confluence with the Indus. It is enclosed by a fine
                    wall from forty to fifty feet in height, with towers at regular distances; and
                    has a citadel on a rising ground, with several fine tombs, two of which have
                    very high cupolas, and are ornamented with painted and glazed tiles, which give
                    them a magnificent appearance. There are other places of interment scattered
                    round the town; and Elphinstone, who visited this place in his journey to
                    Peshawer, in Afghanistan, mentions that the country immediately around the city
                    is fertile, well cultivated, well watered from wells, and productive of wheat,
                    millet, cotton, turnips, carrots, and indigo. Mooltan is noted for the
                    manufacture of silks, and for a species of carpet, which, however, is much
                    inferior to those of Persian manufacture. This is supposed to have been the city
                    known anciently by the name of Malli; and in 1582 it is described by Abul Fazel
                    as one of the most ancient cities of Hindustan. It was plundered by Mahmoud of
                    Ghizni about the year 1006, and was again plundered by Timour in 1398. For many
                    years the nabob paid a tribute annually, for protection, to the sovereign of
                    Cabul. In 1806 it was captured and plundered by Runjeet Singh. In 1809 the nabob
                    was obliged to pay tribute to the Ameers of Sinde; and in 1818 it was again
                    captured by Runjeet Singh, who still retains possession of it. Long. 71. 7. E.
