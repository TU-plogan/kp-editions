                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> shall consider this very important, as well as
                    curious subject, under two distinct heads; the first of which will treat of the
                    History and Formation of Bills of Mortality; the second, of the Law of
                    Mortality.</p>
                <p>I. MORTALITY, BILLS OF.</p>
                <p>Bills of Mortality are abstracts from parish registers, shewing, as their name
                    imports, the numbers that have died in any parish or place during certain
                    periods of time, as in each week, month, or year; and are, accordingly,
                    denominated weekly, monthly, or yearly bills. They also include the numbers of
                    the baptisms during the same periods, and generally those of the marriages.</p>
                <p>The objects of the present article are these :—First, to give a brief history of
                    the principal things that have been done in this way, which may suffice for such
                    as are not disposed to go further into the subject, and may, at the same time,
                    indicate the best sources of information to those who take more interest in
                    it.</p>
                <p>Asboth mortuary registers and enumerations of the people are much more valuable
                    when combined than when separate, we shall also notice some of the principal
                    enumerations, the results of which have been published. We shall then point out
                    some of the principal defects in most of the published registers and
                    enumerations; and, lastly, shall submit some forms, according to which, if
                    enumerations be made, and registers kept, they will be easily convertible to
                    useful purposes.</p>
                <p>The ancients do not appear to have kept any exact mortuary registers, at least no
                    account of any registers of that kind, with the ages of the deceased, have come
                    down to us; and although, in the Roman <hi rend="italic">Census,</hi> first
                    established by Servius Tullius, both the ages and sexes of the people were
                    distinguished, we have no exact account of these particulars in any one of their
                    enumerations.</p>
                <p>Indeed the principal object of the <hi rend="italic">census</hi> among that
                    warlike people, was the levying of men and money for the purposes of conquest;
                    the duration of human life appears to have occupied very little of their
                    attention, and their proficiency in the science of quantity was not sufficient
                    either to shew them what the necessary <hi rend="italic">data</hi> were, or to
                    enable them to draw just inferences from them, had they been in their
                    possession.</p>
                <p>A g∞d account of what the ancient Romans did in this way, with references to the
                    original authorities, may be found in the Italian translation of Μ. Demoivre’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Treatise of Annuities on Lives,</hi> by Gaeta and Fontana,
                    which was published at Milan, in the year 1776, in 8vo. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Discorso Preliminare,</hi> parte 2).</p>
                <p>The keeping of parish registers commenced in England in the year 1538, in
                    consequence of an injunction issued in that year by Thomas Cromwell, who, after
                    the abolition of the Pope’s authority in this kingdom, in the reign of Henry
                    VIII., had been appointed the king’s vicegerent in ecclesiastical affairs.</p>
                <p>Some parish registers in Germany appear to have commenced with the sixteenth
                    century; and in the <hi rend="italic">Göttliche Ordnung</hi> of Süssmilch (t.
                    iii. s. 23), we are informed, that at the time of Lord Cromwell’s injunction,
                    they had already old registers of that kind both at Augsburgh and Breslaw.
                    However, the extracts there given from the Augsburgh registers do not go back
                    further than the year 1501, nor those for Breslaw beyond 1555. About the
                    beginning of the seventeenth century, such registers appear to have been
                    established in most parts of Europe; but it was not until the year 1662 that
                    they began to attract public notice, and to be considered as the sources of
                    valuable and interesting information.</p>
                <p>In that year, John Graunt, a citizen of London, (afterwards an officer in the
                    trained bands of the city, and a Fellow of the Royal Society), published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Natural and Political Observations on the Bills of Mortality,</hi>
                    principally those for London. The London bills, or accounts of baptisms and
                    burials, appear to have been occasioned by the plague, and to have been begun in
                    the year 1592, a time of great mortality. They were afterwards discontinued, but
                    were resumed in 1603, after the great plague of that year. They have ever since
                    been continued weekly, and an annual bill also has been regularly published. In
                    1629, the number of deaths by the different diseases and casualties, were first
                    inserted in them, also the distinction of the sexes; and these have been
                    continued ever since. But it is in the totals only of the baptisms and burials
                    that the sexes are distinguished in these bills. They do not shew how many of
                    each sex died of each disease, neither have they, since 1728, when the
                    distinction of the ages of the dead was first introduced, shewn how many of each
                    sex died in each interval of age, but only the total number of both sexes.</p>
                <p>This book of Graunt’s, although the first, is also one of the best that have been
                    published on the subject. It contains many judicious observations on the
                    imperfections of the bills, on the proportions of the deaths from different
                    diseases and casualties, and on their increase and decrease, with the probable
                    causes of such fluctuations. He also observed, that “the more sickly the years
                    are, the less fecund or fruitful of children also they be.”</p>
                <p>Besides the London bills, he gave one for a country parish in Hampshire, in the
                    first edition of his book; and, in an appendix to the later editions, two
                    others, one for Tiverton, the other for Cranbrook in Kent, with a few
                    observations on foreign bills. He almost always reasons justly from his <hi
                    rend="italic">data;</hi> but, as these were very imperfect, in his endeavours to
                    draw more information from them than they could supply, he has sometimes fallen
                    into error.</p>
                <p>Even in this enlightened age, when a much greater proportion of the people devote
                    a portion of their leisure to the acquisition of knowledge than in Graunt’s
                    time, subjects of this kind have but few attractions for the generality even of
                    reading men, who cannot endure the fatigue of thinking closely for any length of
                    time. The author, accordingly, expected his readers to be rather select than
                    numerous, and was ambitious of that distinction, as appears by the motto he
                    prefixed to his work,</p>
                <p>Non, me ut miretur turba, laboro, Contentus paucis lectoribus.</p>
                <p>The book was, however, favourably received by the public, and went through five
                    editions in fifteen years, the two first in 4to, the three others in 8vo; the
                    last of them, published in 1676, two years after the author’s death, was edited
                    by his friend Sir William Petty, who, in consequence of having sometimes spoken
                    of this edition as his own, has by some writers been erroneously considered as
                    the author.</p>
                <p>Graunt’s observations, like all others of a similar kind, by shewing the
                    usefulness of parish registers and bills of mortality, contributed to form a
                    taste for these inquiries amongst thinking men; and, consequently, to improve
                    both the registers and the bills derived from them; so that, from his time, the
                    subject has been continually cultivated more and more. Parish registers, in most
                    parts of Europe, have been kept with more care; and a succession of works of
                    considerable merit have been published on the subject, containing an <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193825891" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5891-0514"/> important part of
                    the natural and political history of our species, and affording valuable
                    materials for the science of political economy.</p>
                <p>The principal of these works we shall proceed to give a short account of, in the
                    order of their publication.</p>
                <p>As the ages at which the deaths took place were not inserted in the London bills
                    till 1728, Captain Graunt could not avail himself of that important information,
                    but made a fruitless attempt to determine the law of mortality without it.</p>
                <p>The Breslau bills appear to have been the first wherein the ages at which the
                    deaths took place were inserted, and the most important information which bills
                    of mortality can afford was first drawn from them by Dr. Halley; who, in 1692,
                    constructed a table of mortality for Breslau from these bills for the five
                    preceding years, and inserted a paper on the subject in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions,</hi> (No. 196.)</p>
                <p>In 1o99, Dr. Davenant, in <hi rend="italic">An Essay upon the probable Methods of
                    making a People Gainers in the Eallance of Trade,</hi> published some extracts
                    from <hi rend="italic">Natural and Political Observations and Conclusions upon
                    the State and Condition of England,</hi> by permission of their author, Mr.
                    Gregory King, Lancaster herald, who had completed them in 1696, though they
                    still remained in manuscript; and the whole of this very curious production was
                    published by Mr. Chalmers at the end of his <hi rend="italic">Estimate</hi> in
                    1802. Mr. King derived his information from the poll-books; from actual
                    observations in particular places; from the assessments on marriages, births,
                    and burials; and from the parish registers. Many of his conclusions agree
                    surprisingly well, considering the time he wrote, with those which are the
                    results of a hundred years of further observations and inquiries. He had access
                    to much better <hi rend="italic">data</hi> than Graunt, and his conclusions are
                    more accurate; but he does not explain so fully how he arrived at them.</p>
                <p>From the publication of Davenant’s essay, above mentioned, nearly forty years had
                    elapsed without any thing further being done in this way, when Μ. Kersseboom
                    published an essay, in the Dutch language, on the probable number of people in
                    Holland and West Friesland, which he deduced from the Bills of Mortality, Hague,
                    1738, 4to; and two others in 1740 and 1742. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Law of
                    Human Mortality.)</hi></p>
                <p>In 1742 was published the first edition of the celebrated work, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Göttliche Ordnung</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi><hi rend="italic">den Veranderungen des menschlichen Geschlechts aus der
                    Geburt, dem Tode und der Fortpflanzung desselben erwiesen von</hi> Johann Peter
                    Süssmilch. The second edition appeared in 1761, enriched with the materials
                    which had been laid before the public through various channels in the interim;
                    the third in 1765, and in 1775 a fourth edition of the two volumes of Süssmilch
                    was published by Christian Jacob Baumann, to which this editor himself added, in
                    1776, a third volume, consisting of additions to the other two, and remarks upon
                    them, with many new tables, and a copious index. The last edition of this work
                    was published in 1798, but it does not appear to have been augmented or improved
                    since 1776. It contains long dissertations on every thing not mathematical
                    connected with the subject, and, besides original information, includes the
                    substance of all the other publications on it previous to 1776; with an immense
                    collection of materials, which, when borrowed, are often better arranged and
                    rendered more convenient for reference, than they will be found to be in the
                    works they were extracted from; besides. the original sources of information are
                    always referred to, and these advantages, with that of a full index, render it a
                    valuable work for occasional reference. The three thick octavo volumes contain
                    upwards of two thousand three hundred pages, closely printed with a small type,
                    and the tables alone occupy three hundred and thirty pages.</p>
                <p>In 1746 was published the <hi rend="italic">Essai</hi> of Μ. Deparcieux, which
                    has been already mentioned in the historical introduction to the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Annuities.</hi> Information much wanted on this subject, was
                    there given in a very clear and popular manner, and the work no doubt
                    contributed greatly to the advancement of the science. It probably had some
                    influence in promoting the establishment of what is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >TabeU-varket</hi> in Sweden, which took place in 1749, and of which we shall
                    have occasion to take further notice presently.</p>
                <p>In 1750 appeared, in octavo, <hi rend="italic">New Observations natural, moral,
                    civil, political, and medical, on City, Town, and Country Bills of

                    Weather and Meteors,</hi> by Thomas Short, M.D. which he had “had on the anvil”
                    for eighteen years, as he informs us in the preface to his <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of Air, Weather,</hi> &amp;c. This author, with incredible labour,
                    collected extracts from the motuary and baptismal registers in a great many
                    market-towns and country parishes in England, chiefly in the northern counties,
                    in almost every variety of soil and situation, and reduced them into tables in
                    various ways, so as to enable him to draw useful inferences from them.</p>
                <p>He informs us that Lord Cromwell’s injunction in 1538 was but little regarded in
                    many places till the year 1559, when another was issued for the same purpose by
                    Queen Elizabeth; nevertheless, he had procured several exact country registers,
                    commencing with 1538, and continued without one chasm, for more than two hundred
                    years; and the registers before 1644, he considered to be much more valuable
                    than afterwards, on account of the increase of dissenters from that time. He
                    likewise procured both the numbers of families and of souls in seven of the
                    market towns, and fifty-four of the country parishes, for which he had
                    registers; and thus arrived at satisfactory information on several points,
                    which, till then, had been very imperfectly understood. But the sexes were not
                    distinguished in his enumerations; neither were the ages, in any of the
                    enumerations or registers he has given accounts of, except in the London Bills
                    of Mortality, and what he has taken from Dr. Halley, respecting those for

                <p>Although Dr. Short took so much trouble in collecting materials, and has
                    generally reasoned well upon them, he has shown but little skill, and does not
                    appear to have taken much pains in communicating his information to his readers;
                    so that it costs them considerable labour to find what they want, especially in
                    his tables; and when found, to understand it.</p>
                <p>In 1751 was first printed a tract by Corbyn Morris, entitled, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observations on the past growth and present state of the City of London,</hi>
                    with the most convenient and instructive tables of the London bills that have
                    been printed; they contained the annual baptisms and burials from the year 1603,
                    the number of annual deaths by each disease from 1675, and of each age from
                    1728; all brought down to the year 1750. This tract was reprinted in 1758, with
                    a continuation of the tables to the end of 1757; these also contain useful
                    annual averages and proportions. Mr. Morris’s observations are generally very
                    judicious, but he was one of those authors who appear to have laboured under
                    much misconception with regard to the evils to be apprehended from the mortality
                    of London, and what they considered to be its baneful effects in drawing
                    recruits from the country. These writers did not perceive, or did not
                    sufficiently consider, that the natural procreative power is much more than
                    adequate to supply any waste of that kind, and that the real obstacle to the
                    increase of the people, is the limited means of subsistence. This had been
                    observed by Dr. Halley in his <hi rend="italic">Further Considerations on the
                    Breslau Bills of Mortality, (Phil. Trans.</hi> 1693,J though it there also
                    appears, that he had not sufficiently considered the mode of its operation: this
                    was first fully illustrated by Dr. Franklin in his excellent <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observations on the Increase of Mankind, Ρeoρ-</hi><pb break="no"

                    Mr. Morris’s pamphlet was first published. The author also pointed out in that
                    pamphlet, material defects in the Bills of Mortality, and proposed a better
                    method of keeping them, not only in London, but throughout the kingdom. This
                    gave occasion to a paper by Mr. James Dodson, which was inserted in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for that year (1751,) wherein he
                    showed the importance of their being so kept as to afford the means of valuing
                    annuities on lives, and proposed other alterations which appeared to him
                    calculated to fit them for the purpose.</p>
                <p>Nicoaas Struyck of Amsterdam, who, in his <hi rend="italic">Introduction to
                    General Geography,</hi> published there in 1740, had inserted <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Gissingen over den</hi><hi rend="italic">Staat</hi><hi rend="italic">van</hi>

                    enumerations of the people in many Dutch villages, principally in North Holland,
                    wherein the sexes are distinguished, and the numbers in childhood, celibacy,
                    marriage, and widowhood; but with respect to their ages, it is only stated for
                    each sex, how many were under ten years, and how many of the unmarried were
                    above that age; except in two instances, wherein the number of each sex is given
                    in each interval of five years of age, from birth to the extremity of life: they
                    amount altogether to 2728, of whom not one was above the age of eighty-five, and
                    only four above eighty.</p>
                <p>He generally gives, for each place, the names and professions or occupations of
                    the persons who made the enumeration, and the precise day on which it was made;
                    or if it occupied the parties more days than one, those on which it was
                    commenced and completed are given; a practice which shows a laudable solicitude
                    about particulars, and a title to our confidence, the want of which we have
                    great cause to lament in too many other writers.</p>
                <p>Extracts from many parish registers are also given; in these, too, the ages are
                    seldom noticed; but in a few cases they are given very minutely, especially in
                    that of West-zaandam, for which, the numbers who died in each interval of five
                    years of age, from birth to the extremity of life, are given; also the number in
                    each year of age under fifteen, the number in each month of the first year of
                    age, even the number that died in the first hour from birth, in the first
                    twenty-four hours, and in each day of the first week of their age. During a term
                    of nineteen years, the whole number of deaths thus registered was 3328; but the
                    sexes were not distinguished under fifteen years of age, which Struyck himself
                    lamented. The work also contains much information respecting the population and
                    parish registers of <hi rend="italic">Amsterdam, Haarlem,</hi> &amp;c. with some
                    accounts of other countries, and of other works on the subject.</p>

                    This is a valuable compilation, and has been generally attributed to Dr. Birch,
                    the Secretary and Historian of the Royal Society; the preface is very judicious,
                    and contains a good deal of information. For the following history of this
                    publication, the author of the present article is indebted to the kindness of
                    Dr. Heberden :—</p>
                <p>“The bills were collected into a volume by his father, the late Dr. Heberden. He
                    procured, likewise, observations from several of his friends, rectors of some
                    large parishes, or others likely to give him information; particularly from
                    Bishop Moss, Bishop Green, Bishop Squire, and Dr. Birch. These, together with
                    some of his own remarks, were thrown into the form of a preface; and the whole
                    was committed to the care of Dr. Birch. To make the calculations which appear at
                    the end of the book, Dr. Heberden employed James Postlcthwayt, Esq. a very
                    distinguished arithmetician.”</p>
                <p>In the year 1766, this branch of knowledge was enriched with new materials, of
                    more value than all that had previously been laid before the public. These were
                    contained in three publications, of which we shall first notice the <hi
                    rend="italic">Recherches sur</hi><hi rend="italic">la Population</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des généralités dû Auvergne, de Lyon, de Rouen, et de quelques
                    Provinces et Villes du Ro-yame.</hi> Par Μ. Messance, Receveur des Tailles de
                    l’Election de Saint Etienne.</p>
                <p>Most of the political writers in France, for some years previous to the date of
                    this publication, had asserted confidently that the kingdom was depopulated, but
                    without producing any proofs. The object of Μ. Messance was, to enable his
                    readers to judge of the merit of such assertions, and to pronounce less vaguely
                    on a subject in itself so interesting, the knowledge of which can only be
                    obtained by a great number of facts and actual observations. The work,
                    accordingly, is filled with tables, exhibiting the results of actual
                    enumerations of the people, and of extracts from the parish registers. They
                    show, for each sex, how many were under fourteen, or in celibacy above that age;
                    those in the states of marriage and of widowhood; and the number of domestic
                    servants. The numbers of families are also stated; and the enumerations of the
                    ecclesiastics, properly classed, are given separately; but no other information
                    respecting the ages of the living is given than that mentioned above. A great
                    many statements are also inserted of the numbers that died in different parishes
                    and more extensive districts, under five years of age, between five and ten, and
                    in each interval of ten years, from thence to the age of one hundred; during
                    different periods of from ten to forty years or more, generally ending about the
                    year 1760; but in these the sexes are not distinguished.</p>
                <p>In all cases, he has given the general results of his tables, and the proportions
                    they afford, very distinctly stated; and among these results, the increase of
                    the population during the preceding sixty years, to which his researches were
                    generally limited, is clearly ascertained.</p>
                <p>The work also contains many interesting tables, in which the rate of mortality
                    and the produce of manufacturing labour, are compared with the contemporaneous
                    prices of grain, in various places, generally for periods of twenty years
                    each.</p>
                <p>In the same year was published, at Yverdon, in octavo, the work entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoire sur</hi><hi rend="italic">l’Etat</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    la Population, dans le Pays de Vaud, qui a obtenu la prix propose par la Société
                    Economique de Berne.</hi> Par Μ. Muret, premier Pasteur à Vevey, et Secretaire
                    de la Société Economique de Vevey.</p>
                <p>The Pays de Vaud contains 112 parishes, and the population at that time was about
                    113,000 souls. Μ. Muret wrote for information to all the clergymen in the
                    country, who made him returns of the numbers of baptisms and burials in their
                    respective parishes, for different periods, from ten to forty years, in many of
                    which both the ages and sexes were distinguished; and from about two-thirds of
                    them he obtained also the numbers of marriages and families actually subsisting;
                    also the number of souls, “or at least of communicants,” in their parishes: but
                    neither the ages nor sexes were distinguished in any of the enumerations of the
                    living.</p>
                <p>This performance does much credit both to the author’s industry and judgment, but
                    it has also material defects. He gave upwards of fifty tables, by which he
                    intended to show the probabilities and expectations of life till five years of
                    age, and at every fifth year after that, in different parishes <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193825917" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5917-0516"/> and places, under various
                    circumstances of soil and situation, and for people of different habits and
                    occupations; also for the two sexes separately. These must have cost him a good
                    deal of labour, and would have been extremely valuable had they been correct;
                    but, unfortunately, he did not understand the construction of such tables, and
                    they are not to be depended upon. He also took considerable pains to determine
                    the rates of mortality among married and single women, considered separately,
                    and thought he had proved that it was less among the married; but the proofs he
                    adduced were not conclusive. Some of his observations on the state of the
                    population, and the plans he recommended for encreasing it, also show, that he
                    did not understand the principle on which its progress depends.</p>
                <p>It is with much reluctance that we make, on so respectable an author, remarks
                    which apply equally to almost all his predecessors in these inquiries; but this
                    we consider to be rendered necessary, by the <hi rend="italic">Memoir</hi>
                    generally, and the Tables in particular, having been praised for their extreme
                    accuracy, in a very good abridgment of them, inserted in the second volume of a
                    book, entitled <hi rend="italic">De Re</hi><hi rend="italic">Rustica,</hi> or
                    the Repository, Lond. 1770, 8vo.</p>
                <p>The disadvantages of her soil and climate necessarily keep Sweden thinly peopled
                    in comparison with the countries which, in these respects, are more happily

                    object of anxious solicitude with the government; which, in 1749, established
                    what, in this country, would probably be called a Board of Population, but is
                    there denominated <hi rend="italic">Tabetl-Varket,Úí3Á,is,

                    the commissioners appointed for these purposes. The extracts from the registers
                    are made and transmitted annually, but the enumerations only once in three

                    distributed throughout the country, to enable the people to make these returns
                    correctly and uniformly; and the information thus acquired, respecting the state
                    of population and mortality, is much more correct and satisfactory than what has
                    been obtained in any other place of considerable extent; but from causes which
                    we have not room to explain here, the results were not laid before the public
                    until some years after the returns wore made.</p>
                <p>Μ. Wargen tin who was one of the Royal Commissioners of the Tabell-Värket,
                    inserted in the Transactions of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockholm for
                    the years 1754 and 1755, six papers on the usefulness of annual registers of
                    births and deaths in a country; which, like all his other productions, were
                    written with much judgment and modesty; but, to illustrate the subject, he was
                    generally under the necessity of borrowing materials from the writings of
                    others; as, at that time, he was only in possession of the results of complete
                    Swedish returns for the years 1749 and 1750. In the same Transactions for the
                    year 1766, he inserted a paper on the mortality in Sweden, in which he gave
                    Tables exhibiting the number of the Living of each six in each of the following
                    intervals of age :—between birth and one year completed, between one and three,
                    between three and five, and then in each consecutive period of five years of age
                    till ninety, the last including all those above ninety years of age; at the
                    three enumerations of the people which were made in the years 1757, 1760, and
                    1663; with the annual average number of still-born children and of those born
                    alive, also the number of deaths that took place in each of those intervals of
                    age, during each of the periods of three years, which ended at the times of
                    these three enumerations, the sexes being always distinguished. These
                    particulars he gave both for all Sweden and Finland, and for Stockholm
                    separately; with other interesting results of the registers and enumerations,
                    and many judicious observations on them. The ages of the living at the different
                    enumerations, and those at which the deaths took place in all the subsequent
                    publications of them, have been given for the intervals of age stated above.</p>
                <p>This paper of Μ. Wargentin is more valuable than all that had previously been
                    published on the subject; it is also to be found in the French abridgment of the
                    Stockholm <hi rend="italic">Transactions,</hi> in the eleventh volume of the <hi

                    étrangère),</hi> which abridgment was also published separately in 4to at Paris,
                    in 1772.</p>
                <p>Condorcet in his <hi rend="italic">Eloge</hi> of Μ. Wargentin states, that he had
                    collected the results of his labours as Commissioner of the Tabell-Verket in a
                    great work which he had not time to publish; but in that statement, there is
                    probably some mistake. In the Stockholm Transactions for the first quarter of
                    the year 1801, Μ. Nicander informs us, that Μ. Wargentin at his death, left in
                    manuscript a continuation of the observations published in 1766, consisting of
                    four statements similar to those just mentioned; the first for die years 1765,
                    1766, and 1767, the second for the two following years, the third for the year
                    1772 alone, and the fourth for 1774, 1775, and 1776; and having taken the mean
                    of all the seven, he sent it a little before his death to Dr. Price, who
                    published it in the fourth edition of his <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Observations on Reversionary Payments,”</hi> which appeared in
                    1783, the same year in which Wargentin died.</p>
                <p>In 1767, Dr. Short published, in quarto, <hi rend="italic">A Comparative History

                    influence of great towns on health and population,” which had been published in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1769, and added
                    considerably to the information on those subjects which had been previously
                    before the public; also observations on the proper methods of constructing
                    tables of mortality.</p>

                    1775, were inserted two excellent papers by Dr. Haygarth∣ of Chester, in which
                    he gave the Bills of Mortality for that city, for the years 1772 and 1773
                    respectively, in a form calculated to exhibit, at one view, the most useful and
                    interesting information such bills can afford without calculation, and

                    in the same <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> about this time, relating

                    published in 1775; in which he gave a good historical account of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193825930" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5930-0517"/> the first institution of
                    Registers of Births, Marriages, and Deaths, and of their gradual progress and
                    useful applications down to his time; also twenty-six tables derived from the
                    Berlin Bills of Mortality for a period of seventeen years, commencing with 1758,
                    and ending with 1774.</p>
                <p>For each of the seventeen years he gave in the text what he calledaYcar Table,
                    shewing for that year the number of deaths by small-pox, which took place during
                    each month, in each of the first five years of age separately, and also in each
                    interval of five years of age above that, with the number during the whole year
                    in each of those intervals of age, the total number in each month of the year
                    and also in the whole year; so far without distinction of sex or condition. But
                    he added in each of those tables, the distribution of the number who died in the
                    year by the small-pox into the civil and military population, shewing for each
                    of these classes how many of each sex were children and how many adults, taking
                    the age of fifteen years as the limit between them, without noticing the month
                    or the interval of age in which the deaths took place. And in an 18th table he
                    gave the same information for the first half of the year 1775. At page 152, he
                    gave a table shewing the number of deaths in Berlin during each of those
                    seventeen years, from all causes without distinction, but distinguishing the
                    civil from the military population, and the sexes in each case. Amongst these
                    deaths the still-born are included, which it is important to notice here, as he
                    did not mention it. At the end he gave seven other which he called Principal
                    Tables; the three first are summaries of his Year Tables; the first exhibiting
                    at one view the number of deaths by small-pox in each month of each of the
                    seventeen years, also those in each month during the whole term, with the whole
                    number during each year, and the total during the whole term of seventeen years,
                    without distinction of age, sex, or condition. The second shews the number of
                    those deaths in each year, and the sum of them in all the years, distinguishing
                    the sexes, the civil from the military population, and children from adults. The
                    third shews the number of those deaths in each interval of age that took place
                    in each year, and also during the whole term, without noticing the particulars
                    given in the two first tables. In the fourth table he gave the numbers of male
                    and female children separately which were born in each month of each of the
                    seventeen years, with the total number in each year, and the total number born
                    in each month during the whole term of seventeen years, but without mentioning
                    whether the still-born were included in these statements or not; it seems
                    probable that they were, as he included them in the deaths.</p>
                <p>Taking the numbers of births and deaths, as stated by Dr. Moehsen, without
                    attending to the still-born, it appears that</p>

                <p>His fifth table shews how many children were still-born, and how many died during
                    each of those seventeen years, also during the whole term, by each of thirteen
                    different diseases which are the most prevalent amongst “children and others,”
                    but without distinction of age, sex, or condition, and without including the
                    small-pox, respecting which the same information was given both in his first and
                    third tables; that makes fourteen, of which he has given this information. But
                    two of them, <hi rend="italic">Rittlen</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Masern,</hi>
                    appear to be only different forms or varieties of what we denominate measles,
                    whilst of some other heads or denominations in the Berlin bills, probably each
                    included several distinct diseases; as <hi rend="italic">disease of the
                    chest</hi> and <hi rend="italic">consumption,</hi> both distinguished from <hi
                    rend="italic">phthisis (Swindsucht)</hi> which is given separately· But these
                    Dr. Moehsen could only give as he found them in the Weckly Bills of Mortality,
                    from which he states that he formed his Tables.</p>
                <p>His sixth table shews the number of suicides that took place in each month of
                    those seventeen years, and also during the whole term, in the five different
                    divisions following, viz., by shooting, hanging, cutting the throat, drowning,
                    and otherwise; also the number of deaths by accidents in forty-nine different
                    ways, the whole number being 447; distinguishing the civil from the military
                    population, males from females, and children from adults, but without stating
                    the months in which the deaths took place. Amongst those causes of death, except
                    drowning and sudden death, the numbers by which were ninety and one hundred and
                    thirty-one respectively, the greatest number, thirty-nine, was of those who died
                    by hunger and misery in the year 1772. Always excluding the still-born; the
                    number of deaths in 1772 was 8314, whilst the annual average number of the
                    remaining sixteen years was only 4339; so that in 1772 the mortality was nearly
                    twice as great as on the average of the other sixteen years of the term, which
                    shews how small a number of deaths is imputed in the bills to hunger and
                    destitution in comparison with those which, although ascribed to other causes,
                    were hastened and chiefly produced by want and misery.</p>
                <p>The seventh table shews for the year 1774 alone, the number of the still-born,
                    the number of deaths by unknown diseases, and the number of them produced by
                    each of seventy-three different diseases and casualties according to the Berlin
                    Weckly Bills, which took place in each month of that year and during the whole
                    year, with distinction of the civil from the military population, males from
                    females, and children from adults. The whole number of deaths, including the
                    still-born in that year, was 4401; still-born 259, deaths by unknown diseases
                    276.</p>
                <p>Dr. Moehsen states that the diseases were first introduced into the Bills of
                    Mortality at Berlin in the year 1721. The sexton of every parish had some years
                    before been ordered to leave at the senate-house, at the end of every week, a
                    list of the names of all who had been baptized, married, or buried during that
                    week; and in the case of the buried, the age at which, and the disease by which,
                    each death took place, were also to be stated. But these orders were not
                    properly attended to until 1733; from that year he made and preserved abridged
                    extracts from them until 1753, when these were destroyed by fire. In 1757, he
                    resumed his labours which we have here given an account of, more minute than in
                    most other cases, but not more so than their value appears to entitle them to,
                    whether for their useful applications or as examples worthy of being
                    followed.</p>
                <p>In 1778 was published at Paris, in octavo, the work entitled <hi rend="italic"

                    popular, and will probably be perused with more pleasure by the generality of
                    readers than most others on the subject of population. It contains a great
                    number of tables, for many of which he was indebted to other writers, especially
                    to Μ. Messance; but he has also given many that are original, derived from the
                    Bills of Mortality and actual enumerations of the people, though without
                    explaining in a satisfactory manner how he obtained his information, which, if
                    it be correct, must have cost great labour. In his preface he says, “il est tel
                    page de ce livre qui a coûté nécessairement deux mois de travail, et un volume
                    de chiffres.” <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825943" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5943-0518"/>
                    The fourth edition of Dr. Price’s <hi rend="italic">Observations on Reversionary
                    Payments</hi> appeared in 1783, and contained much new and valuable information
                    on these subjects, as has already been stated above, and in the historical
                    introduction to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Annuities.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1786 was published, at Petersburgh, in the <hi rend="italic">Acts of the

                    marriages, births, and burials, at St. Petersburgh, during a period of seventeen
                    years, from 1764 to 1780, preceded by a general exposition of the uses such
                    tables might be applied to, if the observations they record were extended over
                    entire governments in Russia. This paper contains seventeen tables, which shew
                    the number of deaths at each age, and by each of the principal diseases,
                    together with the numbers of marriages and baptisms; the numbers in each case,
                    being given for each of the seventeen years separately, as well as for the whole
                    term; and the sexes are always distinguished; as are likewise foreigners from
                    the native Russians.</p>
                <p>These tables would have been rendered very valuable, had they been accompanied by
                    statements of the numbers of the living of each sex in the different intervals
                    of age; but for want of this information, it is difficult to apply them to any
                    useful purpose, and many of the inferences Μ. Krafft has drawn from them are
                    very uncertain.</p>
                <p>During a period of nine years, commencing with 1779, and ending with 1787, Dr.
                    Heysham of Carlisle kept accurate registers of the births, and of the deaths at
                    all ages, in the two parishes which comprehend that city and its environs; also
                    the diseases or casualties which the deaths at each age were occasioned by; and
                    the sexes were in all cases distinguished. These excellent registers were kept
                    with great care and skill on the plan of Dr. Haygarth above mentioned, and
                    included all dissenters within the two parishes. Dr. Heysham published them from
                    year to year as they were made, and accompanied them with valuable observations
                    on the state of the weather and diseases in each year. Their value was greatly
                    enhanced by two enumerations of the people within the two parishes, one made in
                    January 1780, the other in December 1787, in both of which the ages were
                    distinguished, but not the sexes of each age, though the totals of each sex
                    were. These documents, printed in convenient forms, with further information
                    respecting them, and many useful tables deduced from them, may be found in Mr.
                    Milne’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Annuities.</hi></p>
                <p>In the third volume of the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the American
                    Philosophical Society,</hi> published in 1793, were inserted <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observations on the probabilities of the duration of human life, and on the
                    progress of population in the United States of America,</hi> contained in a
                    letter from Mr. Barton, which had been read to the Society in March 1791; also a
                    postscript to that letter, read in December following; the returns of an actual
                    enumeration of the people of the United States having been made in the meantime.
                    The information there given from the parish registers is of little value. In the
                    enumerations the sexes were distinguished but not the ages, except the numbers
                    of free white males under and above sixteen; but even that information with
                    regard to the population of America is very interesting, whether we contrast the
                    early with the more recently settled counties, or the whole of the United States
                    with the population of Europe.</p>
                <p>Μ. Wargentin having died in 1783, Μ. Henrich Nicander was in the following year
                    appointed his successor as astronomer and secretary of the Royal Academy of
                    Sciences at Stockholm; and in 1791 as one of the royal commissioners of the
                    Tabell-Verket, and their secretary. Af ter the death of Μ. Wargentin, and
                    perhaps for some time before, owing to his infirmities, the Tabell-Verket would
                    appear not to have been duly attended to; no communications of the results
                    having been made to the public for fifteen years after his decease. But other
                    new commissioners were appointed at the same time as Μ. Nicander, and he
                    commenced the performance of the duties of his office by forming a catalogue of
                    the acts add tables in the archives of the commissioners, when he found so many
                    deficiencies in the returns from different parts of the kingdom, and so little
                    assistance was afforded him, that it was not until the year 1799 that he was
                    enabled to commence the publication of the most important results for the term
                    of twenty-three years ended with 1795, and he continued to insert papers on that
                    subject in the same transactions for the remainder of his life; he died in 1815.
                    The following statement will facilitate reference to those papers, eighteen in
                    number.</p>
                <p>The most valuable information contained in these papers is the mean number of
                    persons living of each sex, in each interval of age during a certain number of
                    years, and the annual average number of deaths of persons of each sex in the
                    same intervals of age which took place during the same time; as these data are
                    sufficient for determining the law of mortality for each sex separately, and
                    also for the whole population« without distinction of sex. That information Μ.
                    Nicander has given for all Sweden and Finland in his first paper in the
                    transactions for 1801, both for the whole period of twenty years, 1776-1795, and
                    for each of the four consecutive periods of five years contained in the same
                    term; also derived from these, the proportion of the annual average number of
                    deaths to the mean number of the living of each sex in each interval of age. And
                    in the volume for 1809, (tab. B,) he gave the same information as to the
                    population and mortality during the term of five years ending with 1805. In the
                    volume for 1813, he gave the number of deaths of persons of each sex, which took
                    place in each interval of age during every one of the five years, 1806-1810;
                    also the number of living persons of each sex in each interval of age at the end
                    of the year 1810. In the volume for 1814, he gave the number of deaths of
                    persons of each sex in each interval of age which took place in each of the two
                    years 1811 and 1812. And in all cases the numbers born alive and still-born of
                    each sex were also given separately, but the still-born were never included
                    among the deaths.</p>
                <p>Sweden having lost Finland by the war with Russia m 1808, the observations
                    recorded by Μ. Nicander in the volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Stockholm
                    Transactions</hi> for 1813 and 1814, were made in Sweden alone. The operations
                    of the Tabell-Verket never extended to Swedish Pomerania, the Isle of Rugen, or
                    the town of Wismar.</p>
                <p>In the sixth and last paper of Μ. Wargentin, in the <hi rend="italic">Stockholm
                    Transactions</hi> for 1755, he gave a table shewing the proportion of the whole
                    number of deaths produced by each of about thirty of the principal diseases; in
                    all Sweden, in Stockholm alone, within the London bills of mortality, and in
                    Berlin. But at that time complete returns from the whole of Sweden had only been
                    received tor die two years 1749 and 1750; and from Stockholm fur the five years
                    1749-1753. Forty-six years from that time had elapsed without any thing further
                    having been published on the mortality from different diseases in Sweden, when
                    Μ.</p>

                <p>Nicander resumed it in his second paper in the <hi rend="italic">Stockholm
                    Transactions</hi> for 1801, where, in table T, he gave for each of the
                    twenty-one years 1775-1795, the number of deaths produced by each of
                    thirty-seven different diseases, besides these four other causés, child-bearing,
                    the infirmities of age, unknown diseases, accidents and other violent deaths;
                    with the annual average number by each cause, and the proportionate number
                    produced by each cause, out of a total number of 10,000 deaths.</p>
                <p>In table U he gave for each diocese in the kingdom, for Stockholm and for
                    Carlscrona, each separately, also for the whole of the kingdom, the annual
                    average number of deaths during the same period of twenty-one years, produced by
                    each of the causes above mentioned, without distinction of the sexes, except for
                    the whole kingdom taken together; for which the average was given from each
                    cause for males and females separately, and also for the whole population,
                    without distinction of sex. Μ. Nicander continued his papers on the mortality
                    produced by different diseases in Sweden, in the same <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions</hi> for the years 1805,1809,1813, and 1814, which appears in the
                    tabular statement of his papers given above, for the term of years there set
                    against their respective dates of publication. But in these four papers, the
                    mortality produced by several kindred diseases taken together was given, without
                    distinguishing that which was produced by each disease separately. In his paper
                    published in 1809, besides the number of deaths produced in each of the five
                    years 1801-1805, by each disease or class of diseases, the annual average number
                    produced by each, in every month during the same term, was given, so as to shew
                    the effects of the seasons in increasing or diminishing the mortality from
                    each.</p>
                <p>Μ. Nicander’s papers contain much valuable information which, not coining within
                    the scope of this article, it may suffice merely to mention here. Besides the
                    statements above mentioned, of the births and deaths in the whole of the kingdom
                    taken together, the numbers of them which took place in the city of Stockholm,
                    and in each of the läns or governments the country is divided into, are given
                    separately for the period between each two consecutive enumerations of the
                    people, with the excess or defect of the births in each case, as compared with
                    the deaths; and the difference is compared with the increase or decrease of the
                    population in the same period, determined by actual enumerations at its
                    extremities. The number of marriages contracted, and the number dissolved by
                    death during given periods, are also stated; with'the number of pregnant women
                    delivered in each interval of five years of age, from fifteen to fifty, and
                    those above fifty; the number of those women who were married, and who were
                    single; the numbers of double, triple, and quadruple births, distinguishing
                    those born alive from the still-born, the legitimate from the illegitimate, and
                    males from females. In the enumerations, the number of married persons of each
                    sex, the numbers of widowers and widows, and the numbers unmarried above fifteen
                    years of age, of each sex; also the number of children of each sex under that
                    age, were given.</p>
                <p>The numbers of the people, classed according to their ranks, conditions, and
                    employments, were stated, with distinction of the sexes, and the number of
                    children vaccinated in each year, from 1804. In the volume for 1813, the number
                    of families in each of the four following classes was given :—1. the opulent; 2.
                    other persons of property; 3. those subsisting by their labour; 4. the destitute
                    poor; which consisted of two persons, from two to five, from five to ten, from
                    ten to fifteen, and of more than fifteen persons; with the whole number of
                    families of each of those five magnitudes, and also the whole number of families
                    of each class or condition. In addition to these, tables were given for 1802,
                    and the subsequent years, shewing how many Swedish tuns were sown of each kind
                    of grain, also of pease, and of potatoes put into the ground, with the produce
                    derived from each; the quantity of live stock of each kind; and the quantity of
                    land under cultivation for each government of the kingdom separafely.</p>

                <p>After the death of Μ. Nicander, which took place in 1815, no reports on the state

                    any information concerning them, can hardly ever be obtained from Sweden through
                    the London booksellers, it was not till the summer of 1836 that the author of
                    this article learnt from Professor Nilsson of Lund, who was then in London, in
                    what way they had been published; and to that gentleman and Mr. Charles Tottie,
                    consul-general in London for Sweden and Norway, he is indebted for a manuscript
                    copy of the 1st, 2d, and 3d tables, at the end of this article, which give the
                    most important information on the subject; their authenticity he considers to be
                    sufficiently guaranteed, by his having received them through Mr. Tottie, from Μ.
                    John Ad. Leyonmarck, the successor of Μ. Nicander, as the secretary to the
                    Tabell-Verket, or Registry Commission; also by comparing them with the printed
                    tables under mentioned.</p>
                <p>The principal printed documents on the progress of population in Sweden, since
                    the death of Μ. Nicander, which the author has yet succeeded in obtaining are
                    the following:—</p>
                <p>1. An oblong folio pamphlet, consisting of forty leaves, (each twenty-one inches
                    by eighteen), and containing forty-two lithograph tables, most of the pages
                    being very much crowded with small figures, shewing all the particulars above
                    stated with respect to Μ. Nicander’s tables, not only for the whole of Sweden,
                    but also for the city of Stockholm, and each of the läns or governments
                    separately, which the kingdom is divided into, for the five years 1821-1825. The
                    number in each of the usual divisions of age, at the enumeration. of 1825, is
                    given, with distinction of the sexes, and of the country people from those
                    residing in towns. The following were the numbers for the whole of the kingdom

                <p>The numbers of the people in that year, classified according to rank or
                    condition, profession or occupation, are also given. And the number of deaths in
                    each of the five years (1821-1825) by childbirth, also those of each sex
                    separately, by eleven different diseases, including the principal of those
                    prevailing among children, and those by seven different kinds of violent deaths
                    or casualties, are stated for the city of Stockholm, and each län in the kingdom
                    separately.</p>
                <p>For that city, and each of those läns separately, the numbers of the people in
                    1805 and 1810, without distinction of age or sex; and the numbers in 1815, 1820,
                    and 1825, both with and without that distinction are given; with the numbers of
                    births and deaths during the two quinquennial periods 1816-1820, and 1821-1825.
                    The divisions are indeed much more minute than these; the population of the city
                    of Stockholm is given for nine different districts separately, and the births
                    and deaths for twenty; this arises from the population being divided into those
                    districts for the purposes of taxation, and the twenty others are the different
                    congregations or places of worship, where the registers of births, deaths, and
                    marriages, are kept. But every län in the kingdom being divided into several
                    districts, and each district into its separate parishes; the particulars above
                    mentioned, are <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825969" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5969-0520"
                    /> given for each parish separately, and also the sum of those in each district,
                    which shows the same things for it.</p>
                <p>This is a very imperfect statement of the contents of these valuable tables, but
                    sufficient it is hoped, to show those who take interest in such subjects, that
                    they are worth being consulted and studied. The title is as follows: <hi

                <p>2. A quarto of sixty pages, with the same title, containing an abstract of the
                    above, printed with types in the usual way, and observations and remarks which
                    were absent from the larger tables. In it, the results of the observations made
                    in that quinquennium (1821-1825) are compared with those of the preceding, by
                    placing the corresponding numbers on the same line; those of the next preceding
                    quinquennium (1816-1820) on the left; and those of the present (1821— 1825) on
                    the right of the page, with the explanation of their import between them.</p>
                <p>These contain almost all the more important information in the larger tables, at
                    least to persons residing out of Sweden, and are much more convenient to use.
                    But this is defective in giving only the numbers of violent or sudden deaths,
                    and those without distinction of sex, with hardly any information as to the
                    numbers by different diseases, except stating in what parts of the country they
                    produced the greatest mortality in different years.</p>
                <p>3. A similar quarto of seventy-four pages for the quinquennium 1826-1830, with a
                    similar title, was in 1833, handsomely printed with much larger and more
                    beautiful types, especially the figures, which is important. The contents of the
                    tables in possession of the Commissioners, twenty-five in number, are here
                    stated, and then very satisfactory extracts from them are given. The number of
                    deaths from childbirth and twelve different diseases are given; for the
                    preceding quinquennium, the annual averages only; but for this, 1826-1830, they
                    are stated for each year separately; but the annual average only for violent
                    deaths, casualties, and unknown causes. As each of these gives the results of
                    the preceding quinquennium, the two together give them for fifteen years,
                    1816—1830; and Μ. Nicander’s papers in the <hi rend="italic">Stockholm
                    Transactions,</hi> gave the observations to the end of 1812; those for the years
                    1811 and 1812 being contained in the volume for 1814. So that only the
                    observations for the three years, 1813, 1814, and 1815, are wanting to complete
                    the series; and the most important parts of these and others are contained in
                    the tables above mentioned, which are given at the end of this article. Whether
                    two other quartos similar to those above mentioned, were published, with the
                    observations made in the two preceding quinquenniums, 1811-1815, and 1816-1820,
                    the author had not been able to ascertain when this article was printing, (in
                    February 1837 ;) nor whether any other large folio tables, similar to those
                    above mentioned, have been published; but it is probable there have not; for in
                    the German translation of the second edition of <hi rend="italic">ForselΓs
                    Statistics of Sweden,</hi> by the Rev. A. G. F. Freese, preacher to the royal
                    court of Sweden, and rector of the German National Lyceum at Stockholm, (8vo,
                    Lubeck 1835,) it is stated in a note at page sixty-seven, on entering upon the
                    subject of the Swedish tables, that they are often quoted by foreign authors,
                    and that the very large and instructive tables published in 1829, deserve much
                    attention. There can be no doubt that these were the tables ordered by the king
                    to be printed in 1828; although they might not have been published before 1829.
                    Had there been any others of the kind, those probably would not have been so
                    noticed, and as the translator must have had the best information on the
                    subject, the obvious inference is, that no others existed in 1835.</p>
                <p>4. A folio pamphlet of three sheets extracted from the Tabell-Verket, showing the
                    number of persons carried off by epidemic cholera in Sweden in the year
                    1834.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Utdrag af

                    Stockholm 1836.</p></note> It contains five tables, but we shall only notice the
                    first and most important of them here; it shows the number of deaths which were
                    produced by that disease in the year 1834,—in every län in the kingdom, and in
                    every town and every subdeanery in each län, in each of the usual intervals of
                    age till twenty-five, those between twenty-five and fifty, and the number above
                    fifty years of age; also the number in each month, without distinction of age.
                    The estimated number of the people in each place at the commencement of that
                    year, and the proportion of them who died of the disease are also given, the
                    sexes being distinguished throughout. This appears to be the first publication
                    of the number of deaths in Sweden classed according to the ages of the deceased,
                    as well as, and together with, the causes of death. For their assistance in
                    procuring the last mentioned and other valuable books from Sweden, the author
                    makes his grateful acknowledgments to Mr. George Warde Norman, and Mr. H. James
                    Prescott; also to Mr. Norman, for a manuscript table showing the number of
                    children of each sex born alive, and the number of the still-born, without
                    distinction of sex; with the number of deaths of persons of each sex, which took
                    place in each of the intervals of age there mentioned, in every one of the ten
                    years 1824-1833, in the kingdom of Norway, the authenticity of which, that
                    gentleman has no doubt of, and therefore, neither has the author of this. In the
                    fourth table at the end of this article, the total of those numbers for the
                    whole term of ten years are given.</p>
                <p>It is gratifying to see this table from Norway, so similar to the excellent form
                    of the Swedish. In every point in which they differ, the Swedish is entit!ed to
                    preference; especially in the smaller intervals of age, in which the numbers of
                    children are given in the Swedish; and it is to be regretted, that in giving the
                    numbers of the still-born, the sexes were not kept distinct; as the great excess
                    of stillborn males above still-born 'females, is an interesting subject of
                    inquiry. It is much to be desired that these should be continued in Norway, and
                    that periodical enumerations of the people on the Swedish plan should also be
                    made regularly. But the author has not yet succeeded in his endeavours to
                    ascertain whether those have been made, or are intended or not.</p>
                <p>In the year 1800 was published, at Paris, in octavo, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Essai de Statistique,</hi> a memoir by J. A. Mourgue, on the
                    births, marriages, and deaths, that took place in Montpellier during a period of
                    twenty-one years, ending with 1792, with the ages at which the deaths happened,
                    the sexes are also distinguished, and the population of the place appears to
                    have been nearly stationary. The tables and observations of Μ. Mourgue appear to
                    be more valuable than any others relative to the pepulation of France, that had
                    previously been published, except those of Μ. Deparcieux, which related only to
                    select orders of the people. This memoir was read at a meeting of the French
                    National Institute in 1795, and printed in the <hi rend="italic">Mem. des Sαv.

                <p>An enumeration of the people in Spain was made by royal authority in the years
                    1768 and 1769, and again in 1787; a minute account of this last was printed at
                    Madrid, showing for each province separately, the numbers of parishes, cities,
                    towns, villages, &amp;c. &amp;c. with the number of people in each class
                    according to their ranks, professions, occupations, &amp;c. and the monastic
                    orders of both sexes were particularly distinguished: to these was prefixed a
                    summary of the census of 1768 and 1769- In these two enumerations, the ages of
                    the people were not distinguished with sufficient minuteness; they only showed
                    how many were under seven, between seven and sixteen, sixteen and twenty-five,
                    twenty-five and forty, forty and fifty, and above fifty. In both enumerations,
                    together with the ages, the distinction of the sexes was given; in the first,
                    the married were only distinguished from the single; but that of 1787 showed how
                    many of each sex, and in each interval of age, were in the states of celibacy,
                    marriage, and widowhood.</p>
                <p>A third enumeration of the people in Spain and the Spanish possessions in Europe
                    and Africa, including the Canary Islands, was made in 1797; and a full account
                    of it, occupying nearly fifty large tables, was printed at Madrid in 1801. The
                    distinction of the ages in this enumeration was still not sufficiently minute;
                    under forty it was the same as in the two preceding; but after that age, the
                    number of the living in each interval of ten years to one hundred was given, and
                    the number above one hundred.</p>
                <p>No information from the parish registers in Spain was given in any of these
                    cases; although satisfactory extracts from them all, distinguishing the ages and
                    sexes of the deceased, or even from those only which could be most depended
                    upon, during the ten years that intervened between the two last enumerations,
                    would have rendered the results of these incomparably more valuable, provided
                    that the population of the places for which correct registers were given, could
                    be distinguished from the rest. Those to whom the superintendence of these
                    measures were entrusted in Spain, seem to have been well aware of this, and to
                    have actually entered upon the formation of these necessary supplements to the
                    enumerations, as appears by the following passage extracted from the

                    marriages, have not yet (in the year 1836,) been published, neither does it
                    appear probable that they were ever formed.</p>

                    from the London bills. In the advertisement prefixed to this valuable tract, we
                    are informed that it had been intended to be subjoined to a new edition of the
                    Bills of Mortality; which edition, however, was not published. We are also
                    indebted to the same ingenious physician for other interesting observations on
                    the mortality in London, inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical

                    inserted in some periodical publications. The author’s observations were made
                    both on the Bills of Mortality, and on the cases that occurred in his own
                    practice.</p>
                <p>Dr. Bateman commenced a series of similar observations and reports on the
                    diseases of London with September 1804, which he continued till the end of
                    August 1816. The subjects of those reports were, the cases that occurred at the
                    Public Dispensary in London, in which he was a physician; they were first
                    published quarterly in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Medical and Physical
                    Journal,</hi> but the author collected them into a separate octavo volume, which
                    he published in 1819, with an introduction, in which he gave a Historical Survey
                    of the Diseases of London.</p>
                <p>All of the three works last mentioned, are very interesting and instructive; but
                    it would not be consistent with the objects of this article, to notice them
                    further here.</p>
                <p>By art. 1, sect. 2, of the constitution of the United States of America, it was
                    provided that the representatives and direct taxes should be apportioned amongst
                    the several states which should be included within the union according to their
                    respective numbers. The first actual enumeration to be made within three years
                    after the first meeting of the Congress of the states, and within every
                    subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they should by law direct.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr. Seybert, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Statistical Annals of the United States of America,</hi> published
                    in 1818, (p. 17) makes the following statement: “The United States of America
                    alone require an actual enumeration of the inhabitants to be made at regular
                    intervals; as far as our knowledge extends, no other instance can be furnished
                    from the history of mankind; our practice is worthy of being followed by other
                    nations.” And a statement to the same effect is made in the American Almanac for
                    the year 1832, (p. 106) by which it would appear, that the writers were not
                    aware of Sweden having set a still better example of that kind more than thirty
                    years before.</p></note> In consequence of this, five enumerations of the
                    inhabitants of the United States have been made, viz. in 1790, 1800,1810, 1820,
                    and 1830; statements of the first four are given in the American Almanac for
                    1832, and of the last in the same Almanac for 1833. In the first, as was stated
                    above, no attention was paid to the ages, except the distinction of the numbers
                    of free white males under and above sixteen years of age. In the enumerations of
                    1800, 1810, and 1820, the numbers of free white persons of each sex in five
                    different intervals of age were ascertained; but three of the intervals were
                    much too long to admit of the enumerations being available for determining the
                    law of mortality; the first of those long intervals being all under ten years of
                    age; the second, those between twenty-six and forty-five years; and the third,
                    all above that age. Of these three enumerations, it was in that of 1820 only,
                    that the free coloured persons and the slaves were classified according to their
                    ages and sexes; and the intervals of age into which they were distributed, were
                    longer than those for the free whites.</p>
                <p>In 1830, the numbers of free white persons of each sex, in thirteen different
                    intervals of age were determined; the four divisions under twenty years of age
                    being of five years each; the eight between twenty and a hundred, of ten years
                    each; and the thirteenth division included those of a hundred years of age, and
                    upwards. The numbers of each sex, of free coloured persons, and of slaves
                    separately of each sex, in each of the following divisions of age, were
                    ascertained. Between 0 and 10, 10 and 24, 24 and 36, 36 and 55, 55 and 100, and
                    above 100. These particulars were given for each state and territory separately,
                    and also the totals for the whole of the United States. Statements of all the
                    five enumerations from that of 1790 to that of 1830, both inclusive, may be seen
                    in the American Almanac for the year 1832. That of 1830, with the ages of the
                    living for each state and territory will be found in the same Almanac for 1833.
                    No general returns of the numbers of births, marriages, and deaths, appear to
                    have been required or made throughout the United States; and previous to the <pb

                    few births were registered there. Many marriages were till then, and probably
                    still are, contracted before magistrates, whose records of them were seldom
                    preserved.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In

                    Esq·, the Librarian of the American Philosophical Society, had the goodness to
                    communicate to the author in June 1818, most of the information given above, as

                    and in Philadelphia in particular; with eight of the annual statements (all he
                    could procure and part with,) of the Board of Health in Philadelphia, showing
                    the number of deaths at every age by each disease or other cause, in that city
                    and its liberties; and several American newspapers, showing the number of deaths

                <p>In the city and liberties of Philadelphia more attention appears to have been
                    paid to these subjects than in almost any other part of the United States. In
                    the first number of the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of the Medical
                    Sciences,</hi> published at Philadelphia in November 1827, in octavo, there is
                    an excellent article (the 8th), entitled, <hi rend="italic">Medical
                    Statistics</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi><hi rend="italic">being a series of
                    Tables, showing the Mortality in Philadelphia, and its immediate causes, during
                    a period of twenty years, by</hi><hi rend="italic">Gouverneur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Emerson, ME.</hi> Dr. Emerson states, that the subject of the
                    diseasesand mortality of Philadelphia, was first made one of regular record in
                    the year 1807, through the influence and exertions of Professor James, and that
                    “their authenticity may be régarded as resting on very solid grounds.” From
                    authority vested in the Board of “Health, this municipal power makes it
                    obligatory upon physicians to give certificates designating the name, age, and
                    sex, of all who die under their care; and sextons are bound by still heavier
                    penalties, not to permit the interment of any dead body, until such certificate
                    is obtained, which he returns to the health office on the last day of every
                    week, for publication. The accuracy with which the diseases are designated in
                    these certificates, rests chiefly upon the general intelligence of the medical
                    profession in that city, the members of which are very much in the practice of
                    testing their pathological opinions by autop-sical examinations. For the purpose
                    of ascertaining the number born, the various practitioners of midwifery are
                    required to render an account at the health office of all births. With regard,
                    however, to this department, there is some reason to suspect a deficiency in the
                    returns, especially from the outskirts of the city and liberties. But the
                    registry of the dead has, for the most part, been kept with a care and fidelity
                    creditable to those who have had its superintendence.”</p>
                <p>Dr. Emerson after making some general observations on the topography and climate
                    of Philadelphia, proceeds with his observations on the eleven valuable tables
                    which are inserted at the end of the article.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> shows the results for each calendar month of
                    thermometrical observations made at Philadelphia, during the term of ten years,
                    which commenced with March 1811, and ended with February 1820. The <hi
                    rend="italic">second</hi> is an abstract of the census of the city and county of
                    Philadelphia, taken by order of the general government in 1820.</p>
                <p>All the observations on the Mortality were made within the period of twenty
                    years, which commenced with 1807 and ended with 1826; the still-born being
                    always, as they should be, given separately, and not included amongst the
                    deaths; except in Table IV., which shows the number of deaths in each month of
                    each of the twenty years; the Board of Health having found it impracticable to
                    make an accurate monthly estimate of them for deduction.</p>
                <p>In the number stated in the Philadelphia bills to be stillborn, the abortions are
                    included. The fifth and eleventh of these tables are the most valuable. In the
                    fifth are stated the numbers of deaths from the principal diseases during the
                    whole period of twenty years in the following intervals of age, viz. between
                    birth and one year completed, between one and two years, between two and five,
                    between five and ten; then in each interval of ten years of age to a hundred and
                    twenty; fifty-five deaths having happened between the ages of a hundred and a
                    hundred and ten, and six between a hundred and ten and a hundred and twenty.
                    After the columns set apart for those fifteen different intervals of age, in a
                    sixteenth the number of deaths produced by each disease at ages not ascertained,
                    is given; and in the seventeenth and last column, the total number of deaths
                    produced by each of those diseases. The total number of diseases in the table is
                    sixty-six, and the number of causes of death, old age being included, is
                    sixty-seven.</p>
                <p>A few cases of deaths occasioned by accidents and diseases of vague character,
                    Dr. Emerson omitted, as tending rather to perplex than to elucidate the subject;
                    and adopted the alphabetical arrangement in this table, as the most
                    convenient.</p>
                <p>The total number of deaths registered during the term of twenty years was 53,004,
                    whilst the number included in this fifth table was 50,614; so that 2390 were
                    excluded for the reason just stated.</p>
                <p>Dr. Emerson’s other tables and his observations on the whole of them, will be
                    found well worth the attention of those who take interest in the subject.</p>

                    at that census, is given; and die same information is given as to the coloured
                    population at that time, but distributed into the six intervals of age only,
                    above stated to have been adopted for them. The number of whites was 173,345; of

                    intervals of age in which they happened, viz. under one year, between one and
                    two, between two and five, then in each of the three intervals of five year’s
                    each to twenty, and the remaining ten intervals of ten years each between twenty
                    and a hundred and twenty; thirty-two persons having died between a hundred and a
                    hundred and ten years of age, and five between a hundred and ten and a hundred
                    and twenty. The whole number of those deaths, which did not include the
                    still-born, was 37,914.</p>
                <p>The number of births of each sex in each of the ten years 1821-1830, is also
                    given, including the still-born, but without distinction of colour; and the
                    number of still-born for each year separately, but without distinction either of
                    colour or sex.</p>
                <p>The number of deaths in each of the ten years is stated separately, both with and
                    without distinction of sex, but always without distinction of age; and it is
                    only where the whole number of deaths of both sexes without distinction, in each
                    of the ten years is stated, that the division of it into <pb break="no"

                    age, the stillborn are included. So that these documents do not enable us to
                    determine out of how many persons of each sex, one died annually during the ten
                    years 1821-1830.</p>
                <p>Taking the limits of the Bills of Mortality from Dr. Emerson’s second table,

                <p>(Hazard’s Register, vol. viii. p∙ 65.)</p>
                <p>Here the inhabitants of Blockley, amounting in 1820 to 2655, in 1830 to 3401, are
                    included within the suburbs and bills of mortality. It is much to be regretted
                    that in the census of 1830, the coloured population were not distributed into
                    the same intervals of age as the whites; also that the colours and sexes of
                    those who died within the bills of mortality during the ten years, 1821—1830,
                    were not distinguished in the published statements, as well as the ages. Dr.
                    Emerson was of opinion that the rate of mortality amongst the coloured
                    population was much greater than amongst the whites.</p>
                <p>It is equally to be regretted that, while the bills of mortality extended only to
                    the city and suburbs, of which the mean population during the ten years,
                    1821-1830, was 146,596, the enumeration of that portion of the population of the
                    city and county distributed into the different intervals of age, with
                    distinction of the colours and sexes, was not given separately. For with such
                    documents as are before us, even if the enumeration of 1820 had been made
                    exactly in the same manner as that of 1830; in attempting to determine the rate
                    of mortality in any interval of age, we should only have the means of comparing
                    the annual average number of deaths which took place in that interval within the
                    bills of mortality, with the mean number of the people in the same internal of
                    age in the whole of the city and county. But the mean population within the
                    bills of mortality was only 146,596</p>
                <p>while that of the whole city and county was 163,029</p>
                <p>that is 16,433</p>
                <p>or about one-ninth greater.</p>
                <p>The difficulty arising from this would not be great, if the population without
                    the bills were known to be distributed into the different intervals of age in a
                    manner similar to that within them; but there is no doubt of the distribution in
                    the two cases being very dissimilar; for, excluding the stillborn both from the
                    numbers of the births and of the deaths, during the ten years ended with
                    1830,</p>
                <p>The total number born within the bills of mortality was 61,945</p>
                <p>Total number of deaths in the same time...... 37,814</p>
                <p>Increase of population, within the bills, by procreation 24,131</p>
                <p>While the increase from all causes during these ten years, was 49,232</p>
                <p>So that the increase by migration must have been 25,101</p>
                <p>within the bills of mortality; that is, one twenty-fourth part greater than by
                    procreation. The part of the county without the bills certainly could not have
                    been increased in a like proportion in the same way; therefore the population
                    without the bills must have been much more dense at early ages, and more rare at
                    the advanced ones, in comparison with the population within them, than in
                    proportion to the mean number of the people of all ages, without and within the
                    bills respectively. Whence it is manifest that nothing but enumerations of the
                    people in each interval of age, within the limits of the bills, at each
                    extremity of the period for which the annual deaths at the different periods of
                    life are given, can make either those enumerations or the registers of deaths,
                    available for the most important purposes they can be applied to.</p>
                <p>In pursuance of an act of Parliament (41 Geo. III. cap. 15), an enumeration of
                    the people in Great Britain was made in 1801; also returns of the baptisms and
                    burials in England and Wales, during the year 1700, and every tenth year after
                    that till 1780, then for every year to 1800 inclusive, with the number of
                    marriages in each year, from the commencement of 1754 to the end of 1800. Large
                    and clear abstracts of the answers and returns to this act were printed <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193826021" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6021-0524"/> by order of the
                    House of Commons in 1802, and occupy more than one thousand pages folio. In
                    1811, another act (51 Geo. III. cap.6),was passed, “for taking an account of the
                    population of Great Britain, and the increase or diminution thereof ;” in
                    consequence of which, returns were that year made to Parliament, of the number
                    of persons in every part of Great Britain; also of the numbers of baptisms,
                    burials, and marriages in England and Wales, during each of the preceding ten
                    years; very satisfactory abstracts of these were also printed by order of the
                    House of Commons, in 1812, with some preliminary observations, in which
                    corrections of the preceding returns are given.</p>
                <p>The sexes were distinguished both in these enumerations and extracts from the
                    registers, but the ages in none of them; and the proportions of males to females
                    among the living are not to be depended upon,, a number of males in the army and
                    navy, which it is difficult to estimate, not being natives of Great Britain, nor
                    usually resident there. The returns of baptisms and burials were also defective,
                    but few registers of Dissenters having been included in them.</p>
                <p>These abstracts are, however, with respect to the objects they extend to, more
                    minute and satisfactory, than any other accounts of the same kind that had
                    previously been published; and it was very desirable that such returns should
                    have continued to be made, and abstracts of them to be printed at regular
                    intervals; for nothing is so well calculated to shew the influence of different
                    causes on the prosperity of a nation, as the comparison of the different states
                    of the population, and the rate of its progress or declension, under different
                    circumstances; besides, the value of the abstracts, once obtained, will be much
                    enhanced by the publication of others of a similar kind thereafter.</p>
                <p>It is much to be regretted, that no information as to the ages of the living, or
                    those at which the deaths took place, was required by either of the acts above
                    referred to, nor any encouragement or facility afforded to those who might be
                    disposed to collect such information; and, consequently, that none was given in
                    the returns.</p>
                <p>Without better regulations for the keeping of mortuary registers than those
                    heretofore in force, without such as should extend to dissenters of every
                    denomination, it would probably be better not to require returns of the ages of
                    the deceased from all parts of the kingdom; for defective or inaccurate returns
                    would only mislead; and, not to mention the difficulty and expense of procuring
                    returns of the ages of all the living, they would be comparatively of little
                    use, where those of the dead were wanting.</p>
                <p>But if government were to print forms for making returns both of the numbers of
                    the living and of the annual deaths in proper intervals of age, throughout the
                    extent of life; only sending these forms along with those now in use, to such as
                    should apply for them; then persons who take an interest in such inquiries, and
                    have the means of making correct returns, might do so with advantage. And a
                    summary of all of that kind made from different parts of the kingdom, would
                    convey much important information. Returns also, from such places only as were
                    similarly circumstanced, might be collected into as many summaries as there were
                    material varieties in the circumstances; and thus would afford the means of
                    determining the different modifications of the law of mortality, which different
                    circumstances produce. If the diseases that occasioned the deaths were also
                    inserted, the greater prevalence of particular diseases in some circumstances
                    than in others, would be apparent, with their effects, and the probable means of
                    preventing them, or lessening their mortality.</p>
                <p>But, <hi rend="italic">the population enumerated must always be precisely that
                    which produces the deaths registered; the grand desi</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    its publication; these will, we believe, be found to be much more valuable than
                    any thing of the kind that was extant when that respectable author wrote, whose

                    registers of England and Wales, two other enumerations have been made in 1821
                    and 1831; and abstracts of the answers and returns under the acts that required
                    them, (1 Geo. IV. cap. 94, and 11 Geo. IV. cap. 30), have been printed by order
                    of the House of Commons, (in 1822 and 1833 respectively.) The extracts from the
                    parish registers, shewing in each case the numbers of births, marriages, and
                    burials, returned for each of the ten years next preceding that of the
                    enumeration. The principal difference between the queries put at the two
                    enumerations of 1811 and 1821 was, that in 1811 no inquiry was made as to the
                    ages of the people, while in 1821, after nearly the same questions had,
                    according to the act, been put to the overseers in England, and to the
                    schoolmasters in Scotland, the following instructions as to the ages of the
                    people were given: “If you are of opinion that in making the preceding
                    inquiries, (as to the number of families and persons), the ages of the several
                    individuals can be obtained in a manner satisfactory to yourself, and not
                    inconvenient to the parties, be pleased to state the number of those who are
                    under five years of age,” &amp;c. The thirteen intervals of age into which the
                    persons of each sex separately were to be distributed, being these: 4 of 5 years
                    each from birth to 20 years of age; then 8 of 10 years each to 100; the
                    thirteenth including all those above 100 years of age. Thus it was left optional
                    with the returning officer whether this important question should be put, and
                    with the party interrogated, whether it should be answered or not; from which it
                    would appear that this part of the inquiry was not intended to be made with much
                    correctness, and those whose onerous duty it was to put the question in populous
                    places, might easily lighten the burden; accordingly, from such places the ages
                    of a considerable part of the population were not returned. None were obtained
                    from Manchester, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, or Sunderland. The proportion of the ages
                    which were not returned was, in Birmingham, about ½ğths, in Leeds, ½th, in
                    Bristol, ½th of the returned population. In Middlesex, ∣th, York, east riding,
                    ∣th, north riding, ½th, in Lancashire, ½th, in Warwickshire, ½d, evidently owing
                    to the large manufacturing towns they contain, especially Birmingham, the
                    population of which is more than a third of that of the county of Warwick. These
                    deficiencies in the returns may reasonably be ascribed to the option which was
                    offered to the overseers, who, however, performed the duty imposed upon them
                    with great good will and attention, as appears by the complete return of ages
                    where the obstacles were not too great.</p>
                <p>That the people were not unwilling to state their age⅝ may be inferred from the
                    complete returns of them from Hull, Liverpool, Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Great
                    Yarmouth, as well as from every city in England, if we mistake not, except
                    London, Canterbury, and Bristol. From the counties of Bedford, Chester, Rutland,
                    and Leicester, nearly the whole were obtained; and from those of Lincoln,
                    Norfolk, Suffolk, and Wilts, the deficiency was only on an aver <pb break="no"

                    while from all Wales it was only a forty-second part of the whole.<note

                <p>With regard to the extracts from the parish registers, the principal difference
                    between the questions put in 1831 and at the three preceding decennial periods
                    of enumeration, was, that in these no inquiry was made as to the ages at which
                    the deaths happened, while in 1831 the officiating minister of every church or
                    chapel was requested to state the ages of the individuals of each sex entered in
                    his burial register, during each of the eighteen years 1813—1830, in consequence
                    of which the ages of 3,938,496 persons buried during those eighteen years were
                    returned, 1,996,195 males, and 1,942,301 females. The number of each sex
                    separately, and of both sexes, who died in each year of age during every one of
                    the eighteen years, in all England and Wales, according to the returns, were
                    given in the preface to the <hi rend="italic">Enumeration Abstract,</hi> (pp.
                    36-42); besides which, a similar table was also given for each county
                    separately, and sometimes for its principal town, at the end of the returns from
                    that county, in the <hi rend="italic">Parish Register Abstract.</hi></p>
                <p>Omitting the army, &amp;c., as above mentioned, the whole returned population in
                    1821 was 11,978,875 persons; but the ages of 10,530,671 only were obtained, the
                    number of persons whose ages were not obtained havingbeen 1,448,204. As the ages
                    withheld were generally those of residents in large manufacturing towns, whilst
                    those returned were from the rest of the population, and a considerable
                    proportion of the former class had migrated from the latter, many of them
                    probably about the age of puberty; there are good reasons for believing that the
                    ages returned and those omitted were not similarly distributed, as to their
                    numbers, into the different periods of life; so that, although the total number
                    omitted be given, they cannot be interpolated in their proper places by
                    calculation or otherwise, among the ages returned.</p>
                <p>In the returns of burials at different ages, there are also omissions, which can
                    only be guessed at. Thus it appears that these documents, after all the pains
                    and expense they have cost, do not afford the means of determining the law of
                    mortality, although that undoubtedly is the most important purpose to which
                    enumerations and registers of these kinds can be applied.</p>
                <p>The act 6 and 7 Wm. IV., cap. 86, passed in August 1836, is likely to secure
                    satisfactory records of marriages, births, and deaths, in England; but the
                    abortive and stillborn should be distinguished from the children born alive,
                    which does not appear to be provided for. They may, indeed, be entered as
                    abortive or still-born, under the cause of death, in the register of burials; if
                    that be done, they should be carefully excluded from the number of deaths, in
                    making extracts or returns, and stated separately. And if, at the future
                    decennial enumerations, the ages of the people be determined with corresponding
                    accuracy, the values both of the enumerations and registers will be greatly
                    enhanced, and the law of mortality, with much other important information, may
                    be derived from them. The insertion of the <hi rend="italic">cause</hi> of
                    death, in the register of it, is of itself a great improvement.</p>
                <p>As has already been Observed in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Annuities,</hi>
                    (p. 209, col. 2), it is much to be regretted that in the population returns of
                    1831, the people were not classed according to their ages, as in 1821; but
                    without giving any option either to the party by whom or to whom the question on
                    that subject was required to be put, as to putting or answering it. It appears
                    highly probable that there would be no occasion to impose any penalty for
                    refusing to answer that question, or for giving wilfully an incorrect answer;
                    and in the few cases where it might be so given, or altogether withheld, if a
                    memorandum were made of it, the desired information might afterwards be obtained
                    nearly enough from other parties; if it came but within the right interval of
                    age, that would be sufficient. It is true that in the present defective state of
                    the returns of births and deaths, that would not have enabled us to determine
                    the law of mortality in a satisfactory manner; but with the returns of 1821, and
                    those of a similar kind to be made at the future enumerations, it would have
                    been of great use. Indeed it must be obvious to all, that one of the greatest
                    uses of such periodical inquiries into the state of the population, is to
                    ascertain its progress, by comparing the returns at the several successive
                    periods, which can only be done satisfactorily when the same method of
                    proceeding is adhered to at each, or as nearly so as may be consistent with the
                    introduction of improvements into it.</p>

                    1813.</p>
                <p>He states, (p. 336,) that, “on inquiring into the state of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193826047" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6047-0526"/> the Registers of the City,
                    he found something of that kind had existed from a very remote period; but that
                    it was only from the commencement of the year 1783 that they had been kept in a
                    regular manner.” The Bills extended to the suburbs as well as the city, and he
                    stated that so early as the year 1798, more than half of the funerals were
                    without the city. With the most laudable zeal and unwearied industry, he
                    collected from the different registers of burials contained in fifteen folio
                    volumes, for every one of those thirty years, the number of children under ten
                    years of age who died in each month of that year, by each of eight different
                    diseases, (counting fevers of all kinds as one disease only, designated by the
                    term <hi rend="italic">fever,</hi> according to the bills,) the number of the
                    abortive and still-born, and the numbers of deaths under two years of age,
                    between two and five, and between five and ten; and gave a separate table
                    exhibiting those particulars for each of the thirty years; shewing also the
                    total number of deaths during the whole of each year from each of the causes,
                    and in each of the intervals of age above mentioned; with the whole number of
                    deaths at all ages, and from all causes that took place in each year.</p>
                <p>Then, dividing the whole term of thirty years into five periods of six years
                    each, he gave a table (his 31st) shewing how many deaths took place in that
                    period from each of the causes and in each of the intervals of age above
                    mentioned, for every hundred in the whole numbers of deaths, including the
                    abortive and still-born, which took place during the same period.</p>

                <p>Dr. Watt, in common with almost all others who have well considered the subject,
                    was an advocate for vaccination; and if he overrated the degree in which the
                    reduction of mortality effected by it was counteracted by the contemporaneous
                    increase of mortality from other diseases; he has given abundant proof that it
                    was neither from the want of an earnest desire to discover the truth, nor of
                    persevering industry in the pursuit of it.</p>
                <p>At the conclusion of his work he recommended scarlatina to be thenceforward
                    carefully distinguished from other fevers in the bills, and expressed his
                    opinion that it had been a very considerable cause of mortality among children
                    for some years previous to the date of his publication.</p>
                <p>Medical men in general, both in London and in Glasgow, dissent from the opinion
                    of Dr. Watt, that the mortality from measles had materially increased since the
                    introduction of vaccination; but it is supported by the Bills of Mortality both
                    of London and Sweden, as well as those of Glasgow; the increase has also been
                    observed both in Cornwall and at Plymouth, although the numbers there are
                    small.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    Institution.</p></note> Perhaps this increase of mortality may take place
                    principally among the children of die poor, who, in such cases, seldom have
                    proper medical assistance; and either from ignorance or necessity do not
                    sufficiently protect the patients from cold whilst labouring under the
                    disease.</p>
                <p>The third edition of Dr. Cleland’s <hi rend="italic">Statistical Tables relative
                    to the City of Glasgow,</hi> was published there (in 8vo.) in 1823, containing a
                    good account of the population and mortality both of the city and suburbs down
                    to that time; he there gave the bills of mortality of the city and suburbs for
                    the year 1822, which appears to have been the first published, and continued to
                    prepare these bills during fourteen years, 1821-1834, with great care and
                    attention, and to publish them in the Glasgow newspapers, with the approbation
                    of die magistracy, who cheerfully defrayed the expense.</p>
                <p>These bills were similar to those published by Dr. Haygarth at Chester, and by
                    Dr. Heysham at Carlisle; except that the intervals of age the numbers of deaths
                    were given in under five years, were much less minute, and that the causes of
                    death were not stated in Dr. Cleland’s bills. That gentleman was also appointed
                    to superintend the two enumerations of the people in the city and suburbs of
                    Glasgow in 1821 and 1831; and having been appointed on this last occasion by the
                    sheriff of Lanarkshire to superintend the enumeration of the county also, in a
                    letter to the author of this article, dated February 15th 1831, he expressed his
                    apprehensions that he should not be able to give a classification of the
                    inhabitants of Glasgow and its suburbs according to their ages at that
                    enumeration in the same manner as in 1821; but upon being informed, in reply,
                    that in that case all the labour he had bestowed upon the parish registers
                    during the ten years then elapsed would be fruitless, he answered, that,
                    notwithstanding the extra trouble, he would prepare fresh schedules, and give
                    the number of the people of each sex in each of the same intervals of age as in
                    1821, which he did accordingly; and that is the only instance, except the
                    Carlisle enumerations in January 1780 and December 1787, of its having been done
                    in this country.</p>
                <p>In the year 1831, Dr. Cleland published, in a folio volume, his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Enumeration of the Inhabitants of Glasgow and Lanarkshire,</hi> including all
                    the details of his labours above mentioned, and, in 1832, a second edition of
                    nearly twice the bulk; in the first, the bill of mortality for each year of the
                    ten, 1821-1830, is given; but in the second, only those for the first and the
                    last of them.</p>
                <p>The following is an extract from the folio volume, (first edition, p. 11.) “From
                    my official situation I am enabled to state, that the books of the church-yard
                    wardens are kept with such perfect accuracy that every reliance may be placed on
                    the number of burials in the city and suburbs.” ∙</p>
                <p>Since the year 1834 the Glasgow bills of mortality have been prepared by Henry
                    Paul, Esq. convener of the Committee of Churches and Church-yards, under the
                    superintendence of a committee of the magistrates and town council, with some
                    material improvements upon those of Dr. Cleland. The bill for 1835 contains six
                    tables, besides <hi rend="italic">General Remarks,</hi> the principal
                    improvements are in the third and fourth tables, which were not given by Dr.
                    Cleland, in both of them the sexes are always distinguished; in the third, the
                    number of still-born children, and the number of deaths in each interval of age
                    that took place in each month of the year is given separately; and the sum of
                    the monthly numbers shews the same thing in each case for the whole year. But
                    the fourth table, which is still more valuable, shews the number of deaths of
                    each sex in each interval of age, by each of the causes most easily
                    discriminated.</p>
                <p>Part of these two bills have been published in the Glasgow newspapers; of that
                    for 1836, in the <hi rend="italic">Scottish Guar</hi><pb break="no"

                    of the 3d of February 1837; but only the contents of the first two of the tables
                    above mentioned for that year had been published when this article was put to
                    press, and the author acknowledges his obligations to Mr. Paul for the copies
                    sent him by that gentleman of the papers already published. In these the
                    intention of the council committee is announced, to improve as they proceed, the
                    statements of the diseases by which the deaths were occasioned; also their
                    intention to detail, in the future bills of mortality, the particular trades and
                    professions of those who have died; and to give a table exhibiting the mortality
                    among children from one month up to five years of age, with a statement of the
                    various diseases which have proved fatal at those ages; all of which
                    improvements are very desirable. .</p>
                <p>It is much to be regretted that only about one half of the births in Glasgow and
                    its suburbs are registered, also that certain registers in the Barony Parish
                    burying-grounds contain no record of the cause of death. The act passed in 1836,
                    for registering births, deaths, and marriages, extends to England only; and the
                    committee of the city council express their opinion that these defects cannot
                    well be supplied without some legislative enactment.</p>
                <p>In the bills of mortality for London, Glasgow, and too many other places, the
                    still-born have been included among the burials, as the numbers are obtained
                    from the burial registers; although, as was observed before, p. 525, col. 1,
                    they never should be, for in that case they are generally included among the
                    deaths in calculating the rate of mortality, in consequence of which, that rate
                    comes out greater than the truth in the ratio of the whole number of the
                    re-gisterial burials to the number interred who had lived and breathed.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Observations on the Mortality and Physical Management of
                    Children,</hi> by Mr. Roberton of Manchester, were published (in 12mo.) in 1827;
                    it is the first part only of that valuable work, namely, the observations on the
                    mortality amongst children, which we have occasion to notice here; and we
                    consider that no gentleman of the medical profession has treated it better, few,
                    if any, so well. Mr. Roberten informs us that no bill of mortality is published
                    in Manchester, and that, before the year 1812, the ages were not entered in the
                    registers. He extracted, with great care, the numbers of deaths under ten years
                    of age from the register of the collegiate church of Manchester, for the term of
                    eight years, 1816-1823; and from the valuable register at the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rush-οlme Road</hi> cemetry there, for the term of four years, ended with April
                    1825. The results he has stated shortly, (p. 19.) with the proportion in each
                    interval of age under ten, to the whole number of deaths in each register; and
                    has given a valuable table, shewing, without distinction of sex, the number of
                    children buried in the Rusholme Road cemetry during the four years 1821-1825,
                    who died under one month old, between one and two, two and three, three and six,
                    six and nine, and between nine and twelve months; also between one and two
                    years, two and three, three and five, and between five and ten years old, with
                    the total under ten; by each of forty-seven different diseases, and twelve other
                    causes separately. The total number of deaths under ten having been 2056, and at
                    all ages 3559∙</p>
                <p>We have already stated in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Annuities,</hi>
                    (vol.iii. p. 203,) that Mr. Finlaison’s Report to the Lords of the Treasury, on
                    the mortality among government annuitants in this country, was printed by order
                    of the House of Commons in 1829∙ Government having raised money at different
                    times by the sale of life annuities, either by way of tontines, with benefit of
                    survivorship, or otherwise; a separate register of the nominees or annuitants on
                    whose lives the annuities depended, was on each occasion kept; the name, and
                    consequently the sex, also the age, satisfactorily certified, of each nominee at
                    the time when the annuity commenced, with the day of death, and the age
                    attained, were entered in the register. For each of these classes of nominees
                    generally, but in some instances for two or three of the smaller ones combined,
                    Mr. Finlaison has given a table, showing for each sex, 1. The number enrolled at
                    each age last completed, during the observations; 2. The number alive of each
                    age when the observations terminated; 3. The number who died at each <hi
                    rend="italic">age</hi> during the observations; and, 4. The number who passed on
                    from that to the next greater age.</p>
                <p>Mr. Finlaison calls each of his tables above mentioned an observation, although
                    each records several thousands of observed facts or occurrences. Of these tables
                    he has given twenty-one, but the recorded facts, which alone we have occasion to
                    notice here, are contained in six only of them, the other fifteen being
                    combinations of two or more of the six, or of selections from them.</p>
                <p>These six are the following :—</p>

                <p>In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Annuities</hi> (pp. 202 and 203) we mentioned
                    the desire of the members of the Equitable Assurance Society to ascertain the
                    law of mortality which had obtained among them; and that the late Mr. Morgan,
                    their then actuary, had been able to form a table which had induced him to alter
                    his opinion on the subject; accordingly, in February 1834, the Society printed
                    for the use of the members a folio pamphlet of “Tables showing the total number
                    of persons assured in the Equitable Society, from its commencement in September
                    1762, to January 1,1829, distinguishing their ages at the time of admission into
                    the Society, and exhibiting the number of years during which they have continued
                    members of it, the periods of life at which their assurances have terminated,
                    and the ages which the surviving membershad attained on the first of January
                    1829∙ To which are added, Tables of the Probabilities and Expectations of the
                    duration ofhumanlife, deduced from these documents; a statement of disorders (as
                    certified to the Court of Directors) of which 4095 persons assured have died, in
                    thirty-two years, ending December 31, 1832; and a Supplement, showing the
                    mortality of the Society for the years 1829, 1830, 1831, and 1832.” With an
                    introduction by Mr. Arthur Morgan, who succeeded his father as actuary of the
                    Society.</p>

                </table>
                <p>The number in each column on the extreme right and left shows the age at which
                    the lives in the horizontal line passing through it were insured; and each large
                    column, with the age written over it, gives in its four subdivisions the
                    information there expressed for each age of admission separately.</p>
                <p>1.-The number of lives who attained that over-written age.</p>
                <p>2. * How many of them were living of that age when the observations
                    terminated.</p>
                <p>3. How many went out of the Society alive, by discontinuance of insurance at that
                    age, during the observations.</p>
                <p>4. How many of them died insured during the same time.</p>
                <p>And as none of the last three descriptions of lives could have entered into the
                    next greater year of age during the observations, while all the rest of the
                    lives of the first description must have done so; if the sum of the 2d, 3d, and
                    4th numbers be subtracted from the first, the remainder, being the number who
                    entered on the next greater age, is inserted in the first division of the column
                    for that greater age.</p>
                <p>The numbers in each horizontal line of the table always begin with the number
                    admitted during the observations at the age of admission standing on the same
                    line in the marginal columns; and the number admitted is placed in the first
                    division of the column with the same age at its head; from which it necessarily
                    follows that the number of lives insured at any age, is always the last number
                    in the first division of the column with that age written over it. Thus, the
                    numbers admitted of the ages 29, 30, and 31, were 783, 762, and 785
                    respectively. 785, the number admitted at 31, that is, in the 32dyear of age, is
                    greater than the number admitted at any other age, which shows that to be the
                    time of life at which assurances were most frequently effected in the Equitable
                    Society previous to the year 1829, and may be taken as a proof that they are
                    most generally wanted at that age, although no such inference could be safely
                    drawn from the records of that or any other office, during a period of twenty
                    years or more, commencing with 1829, on account of the great diversity in the
                    rates of premium required for life assurance by different offices, and in the
                    advantages held out by them, since about 1825 or 1830. The numbers admitted at
                    the four ages 29-32, vary but little. The three first are given in the above
                    specimen of the table, that for the age 32 was 780; they decrease gradually on
                    both sides of that interval of age, so that from the commencement of the 30th to
                    the end of the 33d year of age, appears to be the period of life in which most
                    life assurances are applied for; probably also that in which most first
                    marriages of men are contracted in this country.</p>
                <p>There are in the table 70 ages of admission, beginning with 7, and ending with
                    88; but only ten lives were admitted after completing their 67th year. As the
                    greatest age attained by any life assured, and that by one only, was 94 years
                    completed, there are 88 columns with the ages from 7 to 94 written over them,
                    each divided into four.</p>
                <p>Thus, it appears, that in this very valuable table, which had long been wanted
                    before it appeared, and is one of the many important benefits derived by the
                    public from the Equitable Assurance Society; the progress of all the 21,398
                    lives through the different ages from seven to ninety-four, so long as they
                    respectively remained insured, the respective ages at which they entered the
                    society, and at which they went out of it, whether by death or discontinuance of
                    assurance, are distinctly shewn, and the means of determining the law of
                    mortality amongst the lives are given, even for determining it amongst those
                    separately which were admitted at any one age, so far as their limited numbers
                    will allow. Immediately after this, two other tables, undistinguished for
                    reference either by number or letter, are given; the first exhibiting for each
                    of the four divisions of every column with the age set over it, that age
                    standing in the margin of this table on the same line, the sum of the numbers in
                    that division set against all the ages of admission. The numbers in the first
                    column of this table we consider to be of very little importance in comparison
                    with those in the three other columns; they shew the number of observations of
                    each kind obtained in each year of age, and consequently the different degrees
                    of confidence the rates of mortality derived from them at different ages are
                    entitled to. It shews, that between twenty and seventy-four years of age, the
                    number of observations, or of lives passing into, and in whole or in part
                    through each year of age, was always above 1,000; that number increased from the
                    age of seven where it was forty, to the age of forty-three, where it attained
                    its maximum of 7,725, arid then decreased gradually to the age of ninety-four,
                    where there was but one life left which did not reach ninety-five. But the same
                    things were shewn, although not at one view, in table A, where the sum of the
                    numbers in each column standing <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826086"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-6086-0529"/> against all ages of admission were given;
                    therefore the numbers in that first column might well have been omitted, 'and
                    the number of admissions at each age substituted for them; or if the first were
                    retained, a column for the number admitted at each age should have been added,
                    for then that table would have exhibited at one view, and in small compass, all
                    the data necessary for determining the law of mortality.</p>
                <p>The other small table merely gives the same information as the first, not for
                    each year of age separately but for the interval between seven and ten, and then
                    for every interval of five years of age between ten and ninety-five years.</p>
                <p>A table marked B differs much from A both in its contents and value; it is stated
                    to shew “the duration of the lives of those persons <hi rend="italic">only</hi>
                    who became members of the Equitable Society between September 1762 and January
                    lst 1829, and who either continued their assurances to the latter date or died
                    during the intervening period ;” all those lives the insurances on which were
                    discontinued, having been omitted. But all of those omitted lives were, while
                    insured in the society, subjected to the chances of mortality equally with the
                    others which continued insured till they either survived the period in which the
                    observations were made or became extinct. By the extract given above from table
                    A, it appears that 783 lives were ad-mited at 29 years of age; but that table
                    shews, that of these, 379 went out of the society during the observations by
                    discontinuance of the assurances on them; the remaining 404 <hi rend="italic"
                    >only</hi> are inserted in table B, as having been exposed to the chances of
                    mortality in that year of age during the observations, and the three deaths
                    which happened in the same year of age, are assumed to have taken place out of
                    404 instead of 783 persons admitted in the same year of age. The same number,
                    379 of those admitted at 29 years of age, also went out after the age of 30,
                    which number being taken from 780, leaves 401; 334 of them went out after the
                    age of 31, which, taken from 729, leaves 395; and in this manner table B has
                    been formed from table A. The following extract from table B corresponds with
                    that given above from table A.</p>

                </table>
                <p>Let us now consider those lives only which were twenty-nine years of age when
                    admitted, and since the number of deaths among them at that and each of the
                    greater ages was the same according to both tables, whilst the number attaining
                    the age 29, 30, 31, was, according to table A, 783, 780, 729,</p>
                <p>B, 404, 401, 395, it is manifest that the mortality, at each age according to
                    table B, will be greater than according to table A, in the ratio of the number
                    attaining that age according to table A, to the number attaining the same age
                    according to table B;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Here we omit the deduction shewn in the section on the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Law of Mortality</hi> to be necessary for the number of lives entering the
                    society remaining insured when the observations terminated, and leaving it by
                    discontinuance of insurance at each age. To make and to explain it here might
                    perplex some readers, and the false views of the subject table B is calculated
                    to give, are here, we trust, sufficiently exposed without it.</p></note> that
                    is, at these three ages nearly in the ratio of two to one. But the younger the
                    lives are at admission the greater is the proportion of them who leave the
                    society by discontinuance of insurance; and after the lapse of eight or ten
                    years from the age of admission, the number of lives which leave the society in
                    that way diminishes rapidly as the age increases, so that the two tables (A and
                    B) approximate closer and closer as old age comes on, and differ but little
                    after sixty.</p>
                <p>It is also to be borne in mind that the numbers attaining the age of thirty, and
                    dying of that age, are obtained by taking the sum of all the numbers in the
                    first and last divisions respectively of the column in table A with 30 at its
                    head, from seven, the least age of admission, to the age thirty, the mortality
                    in which is the object of inquiry; and the higher in the column any number is,
                    or the less the age of admission, the longer have the lives then thirty years of
                    age been insured, both in table A and B. Hence it is evident that the error in
                    excess of the mortality according to table B in any year of age (thirty for
                    instance) will not be so great as among those lives only which were admitted at
                    that age. And all that is shewn here, with regard to lives admitted at thirty
                    years of age, and attaining that age, applies equally to those admitted at and
                    attaining to any other age.</p>
                <p>Those marked C and D are tables of mortality derived from A and B respectively;
                    and two other tables, marked E and F, shew the expectation of life at every age
                    from ten to ninety-seven years according to tables C and D.</p>
                <p>After these a valuable table is given, shewing the number of deaths which took
                    place amongst the persons insured in the society during the term of thirty-two
                    years, 1801— 1832, in each interval of ten years of age from ten to eighty and
                    those above eighty, by each of forty-three different causes, as certified to the
                    Court of Directors. The whole number of deaths during that term was 4,095, of
                    which there were occasioned</p>
                <p>By thirty-seven different diseases....3,449 Natural decay of age 566</p>

                <p>Being slain in war 4</p>
                <p>4,095</p>
                <p>This table shows the comparative numbers of deaths by each disease at different
                    ages, and from different diseases in the same interval of age; but not the rate
                    of mortality from each disease in each interval of age; for this purpose, the
                    annual average number of insured lives existing in the society in such interval
                    of age during that term of thirty-two years is necessary, but unfortunately
                    wanting. Lastly, as a supplement to Table A, a small table is given, showing for
                    the intervals of age between 7 and 10, 90 and 97, and in each interval of 10
                    years between 10 and 90, the numbers living and dying in each of those intervals
                    of age during each of the four years. Upon comparing the numbers living in the
                    same intervals of age at the end of the year 1828 given in Table A, with those
                    in this supplemental table, we infer that it was at the end of the year placed
                    at the head of the column in this table that the numbers stated in that column
                    were living in those intervals of age. But the only information given on the
                    subject, is the word “Living” placed at the head of the column of numbers.</p>
                <p>In the year 1832 was published a compilation in 4to, by Mr. Marshall, entitled,
                    <hi rend="italic">Mortality of the Metropolis,</hi> containing the London Bills
                    of Mortality to the year 1830 inclusive<pb break="no" facs="nls:193826099"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-6099-0530"/>; with various statistical details taken from the
                    enumeration and parish register abstracts of this country, with a few short
                    notices of a similar kind relating to Spain and Portugal, Prussia, the
                    Netherlands and Sweden, but without any distinction of ages, except for Sweden,
                    and even for that population, only the numbers of deaths in the single year
                    1820, under one year of age, between one and fifteen, and those above
                    fifteen.</p>
                <p>Dr. Forbes’s very valuable <hi rend="italic">Sketch of the Medical Topography of
                    the Hundred of Pennith, comprising the district of the Landsend in
                    Cσrnrvall,</hi> already quoted in this article, was published in the second and
                    fourth volumes of the “Transactions of the Provincial Medical and Surgical
                    Association,” in the years 1834 and 1836. It is divided into two parts; and it
                    is only the first chapter of the second part, which is contained in the volume
                    of the Transactions published in 1834, that we have occasion to notice here. The
                    progress of the population is first treated of, and the information on that
                    subject is taken from the population abstracts at the four decennial
                    enumerations of 1801-1831; but keeping the mining parishes separate from the
                    agricultural. There are twenty-five small tables; in the first seven, the
                    numbers of marriages, births, and deaths, are given, and compared with those of
                    all England, and with particular parts of it, without noticing the ages of the
                    deceased; but in the eighteen others the number of deaths in each decade of age
                    from birth to a hundred years, and those above a hundred are given. On these Dr.
                    Forbes makes the following observation: “Abstracts of all the registers in the
                    hundred were made by myself, with the utmost attention to accuracy.”</p>
                <p>The publication of bills of mortality in Paris commenced during the
                    administration of <hi rend="smallcaps">Colbert,</hi> an epoch rendered memorable
                    by so many useful establishments. That great minister proposed to the king to
                    issue an order, that a bill for that city should be printed and published at the
                    end of each month, containing in addition to what is usual elsewhere, the
                    numbers admitted into the hospitals; there were also added short remarks on the
                    character of the seasons, and the principal diseases which had prevailed; with
                    the prices and weights of different kinds of bread, and some other objects of
                    general consumption. The motive of this ordinance was thus expressed: “Estant
                    important au public, pour la santé et pour la subsistance des habitans, d’en
                    con-noistre l’estât en tout tems, et d’observer soigneusement les causes qui
                    augment ou diminue le peuple en chacqun des quartiers de Paris, il sera fait,
                    tous les seconds jours du mois, one feuille qui contiendra le nombre des
                    baptesmes, des mariages et des mortuaires du mois précédent et de chacune des
                    paroisses en particulier.”</p>
                <p>This ordinance was attended to for fifteen years, 1670— 1684, but after the death
                    of Colbert, which happened in 1683, it was neglected during twenty-four years,
                    1685-1708;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As were also
                    those for the three last months of the year 1684; and the bills for 1676 and
                    1677 are wanting; so that, altogether, there were twenty-seven years from the
                    first publication of the bills, in which their publication was either
                    interrupted or neglected, unless the two missing bills were lost, which is
                    probable.</p></note> the publication of the bills was resumed in 1709, and has
                    been continued ever since, improvements having also been introduced into them
                    from time to time.</p>
                <p>This information is taken from a “Mémoire sur la Popu-tion de la ville de Paris
                    depuis la fin du 17 <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> siècle,” in the second volume
                    of a great and important work printed by the French Government, but not for
                    sale, entitled, <hi rend="italic">Recherches Statistiques sur la ville de Paris
                    et le Département de la Seine; Recueil de Tableaux dressés et réunis dé après
                    les ordres de Monsieur le Comte de Chabrol, conseiller dé état, préfit du
                    département.</hi></p>
                <p>The first volume was published in 1821, in small octavo, and contains sixty-three
                    tables; it is stated in the introduction, that lithography was made use of by
                    the administration in the publication of the tables in that volume, to multiply
                    the applications, and to encourage the exercise of that new art; probably this
                    gave occasion to its being used as above mentioned in the large Swedish tables
                    published in 1829∙ Three other volumes of this work have been published in
                    quarto, with all the tables printed by types in the usual way; the use of tables
                    for digesting and presenting the information collected is continued throughout
                    the work, which, as is justly observed, admits of an'immense number of results
                    being brought together, excludes superfluous dissertations, and facilitates all
                    comparisons. Topography, population, institutions, agriculture, manufactures,
                    commerce, and finances; are all minutely detailed in so many separate chapters;
                    but we have only occasion in this article to attend to the population; and on
                    that subject shall notice principally those parts of the work, where the numbers
                    of annual births, and the numbers both of the people and of the annual deaths,
                    with the ages of the living and those at which the deaths took place, are
                    stated.</p>
                <p>An enumeration of the inhabitants of Paris was made in February 1817, and in the
                    first volume, where the results of that enumeration are given; there is also
                    given an extract from a report made to the minister of the interior, by the
                    Count de Chabrol, dated the 3d of July 1818, explaining the manner in which it
                    was effected. He states, that attempts had been made on several previous
                    occasions to ascertain the population of Paris by an effectual enumeration; but
                    that different circumstances had contributed to render the results very
                    inaccurate. He gives reasons for which he considers it indispensable to obtain,
                    not only for each house, but for each separate location, a distinct list with
                    the Christian and surname of each person of whatever age, the sex, (shown by the
                    Christian name), the state of celibacy, marriage or widowhood, and the
                    condition, profession, or occupation of each; he explains minutely the measures
                    that were taken to carry this into effect, and the checks used to ensure a great
                    degree of precision. To avoid including the same person twice in the
                    enumeration, the place of residence chosen for that of inscription was <hi
                    rend="italic">the habitation during the night,</hi> which rule was always
                    strictly adhered to; to prevent the effects of changes it was desirable to
                    complete the work as quickly as well might be; and in one month and ten days the
                    enumeration of 657,172 persons was made at their places of residence in the
                    manner stated above. This is called <hi rend="italic">nominative</hi>

                    enumerated so correctly. These were foreigners, or native French subjects then
                    resident in the capital, but without any fixed habitation, travellers, the

                    the ways in which the different estimates were made, are explained, and a table
                    (No. 7.) of their results is given; but we consider them to be so uncertain,
                    that we are not aware of any useful purpose they can be applied to, and
                    therefore take no farther notice of them here.</p>
                <p>It is also observed that the number of the living under five years of age, even
                    in the nominative census, was much less than it should have been in consequence
                    of the very great number of children which are sent to be nursed in the
                    neighbouring villages, both by their parents and by public establishments,
                    neither the mean number of them, nor the mean duration of their absence from
                    Paris, could be ascertained, and any estimates that could be made on the subject
                    were so uncertain that it would have been useless to state them.</p>
                <p>The nominative census was also deficient in numbers after fifty years of age, on
                    account of the number of aged poor who die in the civil hospitals. The
                    approximations to the ages in these appear to be entitled to more confidence

                <p>Before 1710 the numbers of foundling infants were, or at least can only now be
                    found, recorded, for the years 1670, 1680, 1690, and 1700; but the publication
                    of the bills of mortality having been resumed in 1709, the number of foundlings
                    was stated in them for 1710, and every following year. The sexes were not
                    distinguished either in the numbers of births, deaths, or foundlings, till the
                    year 1745; after which it was always preserved; it was only from the year 1795
                    that the numbers of still-born children were recorded separately, and we are not
                    informed whether they were previously included among the births or deaths, or
                    both or neither of them. 1806 was the first year in which the illegitimate
                    children were distinguished from the legitimate; they had previously been put
                    together without distinction. This information is taken from the table in the
                    second volume numbered 53, (and the notes that ac <pb break="no"

                    without reference to the months of the year which they happened in; the sexes
                    being distinguished both in the births and deaths.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">second</hi> shows the same things in greater detail; the

                    of the births and deaths took place at home, and how many in the hospitals;
                    also, of each of these two descriptions of births, how many of the children were
                    legitimate and how many illegitimate.</p>

                    arrondissements in which they were born; but in addition to this, it is shown
                    how many of them were acknowledged at their birth, and how many were not; also
                    how many were acknowledged by celebration of marriage, and how many after birth,

                </table>
                <p>Hitherto for the sake of perspicuity, we have taken no notice of the rural
                    arrondissements of Saint Denis and Sceaux; but we add them here, to show the way
                    in which the numbers for them are introduced in all the first six tables, after
                    the totals for the city of Paris are obtained; and by adding them to the totals
                    for the city, the grand or general total is also obtained for the whole of the
                    capital, or department of the Seine. The last four of the ten tables relate to
                    the city of Paris only.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sixth</hi> shows the deaths in each month and
                    arrondissement, the same as the first; but each column in the first table is so
                    divided in this, as to show how many of each sex died at home, also how many in
                    the civil, how many in the military hospitals, and how many in prisons. In this
                    and the first table of deaths, the dead bodies deposited at the Morgue within
                    the year, are added to the sum of the deaths both in the different months of the
                    year, and in the different arrondissements within the walls of Paris, to obtain
                    the total number of deaths in the city.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">seventh</hi> table we consider as being the most valuable
                    of the ten. It shows, for the city of Paris only, the numbers of deaths in the
                    first and second quarters of the first year of age, also in the last half,
                    consequently in the whole of that year; then in every following year of age
                    separately, to that often years completed; and after that in every interval of
                    five years of age to a hundred, and those above a hundred; always distinguishing
                    the sexes, and showing the numbers who, in each interval of age, died unmarried,
                    married, widowers or widows.</p>
                <p>Were it not for the salutary practice of sending children born in Paris into the
                    neighbouring villages to be nursed; as the numbers of births of both sexes are
                    given, and also the numbers of deaths of both sexes separately in minute
                    intervals of age under ten years; the law of mortality among them might be
                    determined, even independent of enumerations of the living. But under the actual
                    circumstances, that very desirable object cannot be attained.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">eighth</hi> shows the numbers of violent and accidental
                    deaths, voluntary and involuntary, in each of various ways, which took place in
                    the city of Paris in each month of the year, and in the whole year; the sexes
                    being distinguished in each of the numbers for the whole year, but not for each
                    month.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">ninth</hi> shows the number of suicides attempted during
                    the year, in the department of the Seine; the number of those attempted which
                    were effectuated, and the number of them which were prevented; with the means of
                    destruction employed, and the presumed motives of suicide. The sexes are also
                    distinguished, and the married from the unmarried.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">tenth</hi> shows the number of deaths from small-pox in
                    each month of the year, and in each arrondissement in the city of Paris, without
                    distinction of age; also the number of them that took place in each of the
                    intervals of age employed in the seventh table, without distinction of months or
                    arrondissements; the sexes being in all these cases distinguished. Then the
                    number of gratuitous vaccinations during the year, in each arrondissement, is
                    shown. The sexes of the vaccinated were distinguished for the years 1817 and
                    1818, but not afterwards. Each of the two tables here numbered 9 and 10, was,
                    for the years 1817 and 1818, divided into two; so that the number showing the
                    progress of the population in those two years, was twelve instead of ten.</p>
                <p>In addition to these, a table numbered 37, in the first volume, is too curious
                    and interesting to be passed unnoticed here. It was formed from extracts made by
                    <hi rend="italic">M Benoiston dè Châteauneuf</hi> from the statements of deaths
                    prepared in the mayoralties of the different arrondissements; which statements
                    were founded on the declarations made by the physicians and surgeons who
                    certified the deaths.</p>
                <p>The table shows, for each of the four years, 1816—1819, the number of deaths
                    produced in the city of Paris, by each of the following pulmonary diseases:
                    Asthmas, catarrhs, defluxions on the chest <hi rend="italic">(fluxions d</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> e</hi><hi rend="italic">poitrine),</hi> and
                    consumptions <hi rend="italic">(phthysies)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in the
                    spring, summer, autumn, and winter of each year, without distinction of age; but
                    also in each interval of ten years of age from birth to seventy years, between
                    seventy and ninety, and between ninety and a hundred; without distinction of
                    seasons. The total by each of these diseases in each of the four years is also
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826138" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6138-0533"/> stated, with
                    the total number of deaths in Paris from all causes during the same year; and
                    the proportion of the mortality from each of those pulmonary diseases to the
                    whole mortality; the sexes being distinguished throughout. No table of that
                    kind, nor of the deaths by other diseases than the small-pox, was inserted in
                    any of the other three volumes. Statements of the annual average progress of the
                    population in each of the arrondissements of Paris during the five years
                    1817-1821 are given in the third volume, tables 42—50; and for the next
                    following quinquennial period 1822-1826 in the fourth volume, tables 54-62.
                    Table 102 of the second volume shows the comparative riches of the different
                    arrondissements in the city of Paris; it was constructed from the register of
                    personal taxes imposed in the year 1820; that table with the others above
                    mentioned in the first three volumes, were the principal dataon which Μ.
                    Villermé founded his very valuable <hi rend="italic">Mémoire sur la Mortalité en

                <p>In the introduction to the fourth volume of the <hi rend="italic">Recherches
                    Statistiques</hi> it is stated, that a fifth would terminate the work; and a
                    short account is there given of its intended contents; but in May 1837, when
                    this article was printed, that volume had not appeared.</p>
                <p>Statements of the progress of population in Paris and in every department of
                    France, are regularly published in the <hi rend="italic">Annuaire</hi><hi

                    different departments, and of their arrondissements and chief towns, but without
                    any notice of the ages. The numbers of deaths in the city of Paris of each sex
                    by the small-pox at the different ages, have also been inserted in the same
                    work, for 1817 and every subsequent year; but not the numbers gratuitously
                    vaccinated.</p>
                <p>The ages at which the deaths happened are not given in any of the statements in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Annuaire,</hi> except those for the city of Paris.</p>
                <p>ín February 1835 was published at Troyes, the capital of the department of the
                    Aube in France, <hi rend="italic">Recueil des principaux travaux des Conseils de
                    Salubrité du département de l’Aube,</hi> containing the same kind of
                    information, given in the same manner, but rather more fully respecting the
                    progress of population in Troyes, as is given in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Recherches Statistiques</hi> for the city of Paris; except that there is no
                    mention made of still-born children, or of the deaths from small-pox, or of the
                    numbers gratuitously vaccinated.</p>
                <p>The statements of the deaths in all the intervals of age, are given not only for
                    each year, but for each month of each of the ten years 1821-1830; also in one
                    table, those in each month during the whole term.</p>
                <p>These documents were derived from the bills of mortality by Dr. Patin, president
                    of the council for the arrondissement of Troyes.</p>
                <p>The population of the place at the commencement of the term was 25,076, at the
                    end of it 23,749, of whom 10,626 were males, and 13,123 females. The ages of the
                    people do not appear to have been distinguished at either of the two
                    enumerations made at the commencement and at the end of the term; neither are
                    the total numbers of the two sexes who were living at its commencement given
                    separately. So that the law of mortality cannot be determined from the data
                    obtained.</p>
                <p>The three following tracts relating to the Netherlands, were all published at
                    Brussels in 8vo:</p>
                <p>1. In the year 1827 a Memoir on National Statistics, entitled, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Développement des trente et un</hi><hi rend="italic">Tableaux</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">publiés parla Commission de Statistique, et relatifs aux mouvemens

                    Smits, <hi rend="italic">Sécrétaire de la Commission,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The tables shew the numbers of persons on the first of' January 1815, and on the
                    thirty-first of December 1824, residing in the towns, and in the rural communes
                    separately, for each of the nineteen provinces in the kingdom; with the numbers
                    of them for the whole kingdom of the Netherlands taken together. They also show
                    what the number of the people with the same distinction of town and country
                    residence, was on the first of January in each of those ten years; with their
                    mean number during the first and second halves of that period, and during the
                    whole of the same period; but in these numbers of the people there is no
                    distinction made either of age or sex; the number at the end of 1814 is stated
                    (p. 2) to be <hi rend="italic">estimated,</hi> and that at the end of each year
                    after it, was found by adding the excess of the births above the deaths in the
                    same year, to the population at the end of the preceding; so that the numbers of
                    the people there stated, are not entitled to much confidence.</p>
                <p>The progress of the population is also shewn by statements of the numbers of
                    births, marriages, divorces, and deaths, and the differences between the numbers
                    of births and deaths during each of the ten years for the whole of the kingdom;
                    and for each province during the whole of the ten years, the inhabitants of
                    towns being distinguished from those of the country, and males from females, in

                    sexes in the numbers both of births and of deaths, and that of the annual births
                    as well as of the annual deaths, and of the difference between them to the whole
                    population, in the towns and the rural communes jointly and separately are
                    given, for the whole term of ten years, the two periods of five years each, and

                    6,013,478, stated by Μ. Smits, by 20,812; and that this estimate was founded on
                    two partial enumerations of the people made previously, one under the imperial
                    government, the other about the commencement of the then (in 1827) actual
                    government; and that from these, and the numbers of annual births, the estimate
                    was made in the manner proposed by Laplace.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Belgium was made in November and December of the year 1829, but owing to the
                    partial occupation of the provinces of Limburgand Luxemburg, the information
                    obtained respecting them, especially the latter, was incomplete. The whole
                    number of the people on the 1st of January 1830 was found to be 4,064,209, of
                    whom 998,118 were resident in towns, and 3,066,091 in the rural <hi

                <p>The authors state (p. 13) that in the tables of enumeration<pb break="no"

                    were carefully specified; but although we consider this to be of much more
                    importance than any other part of the inquiry, the information they have given
                    on this subject is far from being satisfactory. In every other place of any
                    considerable magnitude where this important and laborious operation has been
                    performed; in Sweden, Spain, Carlisle, Paris, Great Britain, Glasgow, and

                    of persons found to be in each interval of age at the time of the enumeration
                    has been published; and in some cases, as in those of Carlisle, Paris, and
                    Glasgow, the manner of proceeding and the checks employed to ensure a
                    considerable degree of accuracy have been explained. But in the case of Belgium,
                    all information of this kind has been withheld, and the authors have only given
                    us (p. 16) a table shewing the <hi rend="italic">relative</hi> numbers of the
                    people in the different intervals of age. For every million of them it shews for
                    each sex separately, and for each of forty-seven ages from birth to one hundred
                    years inclusive; how many were above that age, and also how many of these were
                    in a state of celibacy, marriage, or widowhood.</p>
                <p>Although the professed object of the authors was to treat of the mortality at the
                    different ages of human life, they have given their readers no information
                    whatever as to the ages at which the deaths took place; nothing in the form of
                    bills of mortality, nor any abstracts from them; they merely state that the data
                    from which they formed the table of mortality they have given (p. 36), were
                    carefully collected during three years from the civil registers of the
                    kingdom.</p>

                    It is divided into three parts; the first contains all that is known of the
                    population of Geneva, and the successive enumerations of its inhabitants from
                    the sixteenth century to the present time, with some details respecting the
                    extent of the place, its habitations, its climate, and the industry of its
                    inhabitants. The second exhibits the progress of the population from the
                    commencement of the registers in Geneva, in December 1549, to the restoration of
                    the republic at the end of December 1833, a period of 164 years, especially the
                    meritorious but hitherto unpublished labours of Drs. Cramer and Joly; the
                    progress of the population is given year by year, viz. for the deaths from 1549,
                    for the marriages and births from 1693; and some theoretical inferences are
                    drawn respecting the different elements of this population, the continual
                    increase of its longevity and decrease of its fecundity. The third part presents
                    the detailed results of the progress of population in Geneva during the twenty
                    years 1814-1833, from the restoration to the end of the latter year. The
                    necessary length of this memoir prevented the whole of it being published in the
                    second part of the seventh volume of those above mentioned; he therefore gave in
                    that place the third part of it only, but not even that without omitting an
                    explanation of the steps he took in making, himself, extracts from the
                    registers, to render them available for useful purposes. This third part being
                    the result of his own labour, and containing new facts and discussions relative
                    to the progress of the population during that term of twenty years,
                    1814-1833.</p>
                <p>The above is nearly a literal translation of the short preface to that part;
                    although read to the society in November 1834, it was not published till the end
                    of the year 1836; and the whole of the memoir, including what was omitted in the
                    first publication of the third part was inserted in the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>M. Mallet shews, that at a remote period the legislature of Geneva considered an
                    exact knowledge of the population of the city a matter of importance, and he has
                    given it at nine different periods of enumeration; the first in the year 1589,
                    when it was 13,000, the last in 1834, when it was 27,177, of whom 12,573 were
                    males and 14,604 females; at the same time the population of the suburbs was
                    9052. In these enumerations the administration took no account of the numbers of
                    locations or of families, nor of the proportions of the people in the states of
                    celibacy, marriage or widowhood; neither do they appear to have taken any
                    account of the ages of the people at any of the enumerations, which is much to
                    be regretted, as that information would have greatly enhanced the value both of
                    the enumerations and of the extracts from the registers of births, deaths and
                    marriages; it would have enabled us to determine the law of mortality in Geneva,
                    which has not yet been done, although repeatedly attempted and thought to have
                    been effected satisfactorily.</p>
                <p>The deaths are certified by a visiting surgeon, who gives an account of them
                    every week to the hospital where the civil registers are kept; and it is from
                    his statements that the general mortuary registers are formed. The births,
                    marriages and deaths that take place in the suburbs are entered in the registers
                    with those of the city till 1791 for the marriages and births, and till 1805 for
                    the deaths. Since 1799 for the marriages, and since 1806 for the births and
                    deaths, those only for the population of Geneva within the walls are stated. The
                    population of the suburbs has seldom been ascertained or stated with that of the
                    city. In the registers of births and deaths the sexes are always distinguished;
                    the abortive and still-born are stated separately; but before the year 1814, at
                    which period Μ. Mallet took up the bills twenty years afterwards, as in too many
                    other bills of mortality, they were also added to the number of deaths, properly
                    so called, which took place among the living, and were therefore likely to be
                    included among them by incautious or unskilful persons in calculating the rate
                    of mortality.</p>
                <p>The mortuary registers of Geneva, as Μ. Mallet remarks, have been the object of a
                    great and laborious work, which the celebrated economist Μ. D’Ivernois has
                    lately discovered by chance.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The author of this article happened accidentally to
                    contribute to this. In his letter of the 20th March 1834, to Sir Francis
                    D’Ivernois, he requested information respecting the extracts from the mortuary
                    registers of Geneva made by the late Dr. Cramer, which Μ. Duvillard, in his work
                    on small-pox and vaccination, stated were communicated to him by Dr. Butini;
                    also respecting the labours and publications of Dr. Odier, and others there
                    mentioned, p. 105. In answer, Μ. D’Ivernois was so obliging as to favour him
                    with three letters dated respectively the 2d and 16th of April, and the 17th of
                    May of that year, with satisfactory information as to where the publications of
                    Dr. Odier on the subject are to be found. In the first is the following passage:
                    “Quant aux ouvrages, ou plutôt aux notes du Dr. Cramer ce n’étaient que des
                    notes manuscrites qu’il laissa à sa mort à son ami le Dr. Butini lequel les
                    communiqua dans le temps à Μ. Duvillard·” In the second; “J’en profite aussi
                    pour vous remercie d’une découverte bien <hi rend="italic">précieuse</hi> que
                    vous m’avez fait faire en me demandant les ouvrages du Dr. Cramer, son petit

                    qui est sûrement sans parallèle nulle part, rien moins que près de 200 tables de
                    mortalité tenues année par année, et avec une exactitude remarquable pour Génève
                    ville depuis l’origine denos registers jusqu’ en 1768.” The third was
                    accompanied by a printed half-sheet, in 8vo, being <hi rend="italic">Proposition

                    him in a note supporting it, from which the following is extracted: “Le travail
                    de Μ. Cramer a été attribué à Μ. Odier par divers auteurs, MM. Prévost, Serre,
                    D’Ivernois, Lombard. Pour rendre à chacun ce qui lui est dû, je dois dire qu’il
                    est démontré à mes yeux, que le relevé mortuaire de 1560 à 1760, appartient en
                    propre a Μ. Cramer. Le beau manuscrit qui le renferme est tout entier de la main
                    de Μ. Cramer, comme je m’en suis assuré en le comparant à la signature du
                    docteur, dans la registre de la faculté de médécine de Génève. A l’epoque où
                    s’arrête les tables de recapitulation de Μ. Cramer en 1760, Μ. Odier n’avoit
                    encore que 12 ans.”</p></note> This work, the fruit of immense researches in the
                    old registers, for a period reaching so far back as the <pb corresp="pbn7535"

                    1560, when their representation of the progress of the population became
                    regular, to the year 1760, contains no less than 115,777 deaths classed
                    according to the ages at which they happened, was performed by Dr. Jean-Antoine
                    Cramer. Periodical recapitulations and general tables give the results to the
                    year 1760; Dr. Cramer continued the bills of mortality from that year till his
                    death in 1775, and left then a continuation of them to the year 1770 inclusive.
                    It was only from the year 1560 that the ages of the deceased were stated in the
                    registers, and they were omitted during the twelve years 1568-1579, as were also
                    those of 1648 individuals who died of the plague in 1615 and 1616.</p>
                <p>Dr. Abraliam Joly continued the inquiries of Dr. Cramer in the same manner during
                    forty-one years, 1771-1811, and died himself in 1812.</p>
                <p>Dr. Louis Odier published, in the <hi rend="italic">Journal de Geneve,</hi> for

                    labours, and that was the impression produced.</p>
                <p>But the most important work of Μ. Odier was a continuation of the labours of Μ.

                <p>Among many other useful and interesting tables, Μ. Mallet gives one which shews

                <p>We have here given a very imperfect account of this able memoir, which we
                    consider highly creditable to the author’s judgment and taste; almost all we

                    hardly do otherwise without doing worse. Those who take interest in the subject
                    will no doubt refer to the original, which, by being printed in the <hi

                    accessible. We had gotten together the materials for a more lengthened notice of
                    the labours of Μ. Odier, gathered from the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque
                    Britannique,</hi> but the opportune appearance of Μ. Mallet’s memoir induces us
                    rather to refer to it</p>
                <p>In Μ. Mallet’s account of his own inquiries into the state of the population and
                    mortality during the twenty years 1814-1833, we have the fullest information on
                    every point, in the same manner and to the same extent for Geneva, as it has
                    been given for Paris, in the <hi rend="italic">Recherches Statistiques;</hi> but
                    whilst these are generally confined to mere tabular statements of numbers and
                    their proportions, with as few observations on them as can well be avoided; Μ.
                    Mallet accompanies his tables with observations, reasonings, references to other
                    authors, and the results of calculations very clearly stated, that greatly
                    increase their value. As instances of the way in which he shows the uses of his
                    tables, and assists his readers in drawing inferences from them, which will
                    become much more interesting and instructive by being compared with those drawn
                    in the same way from other tables of a similar kind; we give the two following
                    statements: after a table showing the numbers of births of males and females
                    separately, in each of the twenty years, and for the whole term; also
                    distinguishing the legitimate from the illegitimate, he gives the following <hi

                <p>Μ. Mallet justly observes, that the proportion of boys to girls in the births at
                    Geneva, is high in comparison with other places, and higher there in the present
                    than in the last century, when Μ. Cramer estimated it to be 18: 17; whilst in
                    France since the restoration, it has been 17: 16. He also states, that “Μ.
                    Poisson a fait remarquer qu’il y a dans la proportion des sexes une différence
                    notable entre les enfans légitimes et les naturels: chez ceux-ci, les naissances
                    des filles se rapprochent plus de celles des garçons que chez ceux-la. Μ. le
                    Professor Prévost a même donné one explication, si non tout-à-fait
                    satisfaisante, du moins très-ingénieuse de ce phénomène. La plus grande
                    proportion des mâles dans les naissances légitimes n’est nulle part plus
                    frappante qu’ à Génève. En effet, on trouve:</p>

                <p>Μ. Mourgue, however, had stated the numbers, of births of both sexes separately,
                    with distinction of the legitimate from the illegitimate, in the first part of
                    his valuable memoir on the progress of population in Montpellier, published in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mem. de la Soe. Roy.</hi><hi rend="italic">de

                    and the whole of the memoir was read at a meeting of the French National
                    Institute as above mentioned in 1795; but he made no remark on the difference in
                    the proportion of the sexes between the legitimate and illegitimate births. Mr.
                    Milne in his <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Annuities,</hi> published in 1815,
                    (article 789) has stated the proportion or the sexes at birth for several places
                    at different times and under various circumstances; with distinction of the
                    legitimate from the illegitimate in Sweden and Finland, and in Montpellier; he
                    also there expressed his opinion, confirmed by subsequent observations, that the
                    difference depends principally upon the age of the parents; the younger the
                    parents, the nearer the proportion of the numbers of their male and female
                    children at birth approaching to equality. What the connexion is, between the
                    cause and effect, is a curious and interesting problem, which has not yet been
                    solved that we are aware of.</p>

                    they may be used, as, however defective these registers may be, there is no
                    reason to suppose they are more so for one sex than the other.</p>

                    separately, which took place in Berlin during the twelve years 1818-1829,
                    amounting to 36,895 males, and 32,467 females, of both sexes 69,362; these are
                    given in his table of mortality for Berlin at the end of the work, numbered II.
                    2d. A table given in the text, (p. 106), showing the number of deaths that took
                    place in Hamburg during the seven years 1819-1825, without distinction of sex,
                    in the first and second years of age separately, then those between 2 and 5 and
                    between 5 and 10; after that in every decade of age from 10 to 90, and those
                    above 90 years of age. But the numbers of the people in the different intervals
                    of age not being given in either of those cases, any tables of mortality
                    constructed from the numbers of deaths alone, at the different ages, can be of

                    kingdom, the number of marriages, the whole number of births, and the number of
                    illegitimate births separately, also the number of deaths; but without
                    distinction of age or sex. He also gives the number of inhabitants for two of
                    these years under 14 years of age, between 14 and 60, and above 60, which, how
                    ever, are included in the statistical view of Μ. Hoffman.</p>
                <p>One of the best bills of mortality we have seen, is prepared by the Board of
                    Health at Hamburg, and published under the name of a Table of Mortality,
                    covering all the four sides of a large folio sheet; and consist in fact of five
                    tables regularly numbered.</p>
                <p>I. The first shows the total number of interments and the daily average number,
                    also the total number that took place at each of fifteen different burying
                    places, during each month of the year separately, and during the whole year;
                    without distinction of age or sex.</p>
                <p>II. The second shows the same during each month for the abortive and still-born
                    separately; then the deaths properly so called, which took place amongst the
                    living, during each of the four quarters of the first year of age, in the second
                    year, between the ages of 2 and 5, and of 5 and 10 years, then in each decade of
                    age to 100, and those above 100; with the total for each month and for the whole
                    year, of each sex separately, and for both sexes without distinction. There is
                    also a column set apart for those whose ages were not known.</p>
                <p>III. The third table consists of two parts, both of which are abstracts from the
                    second; the first showing for each month the number of the abortive and
                    still-born, and also of the deaths under and above ten years of age. The second,
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826190" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6190-0537"/> besides the
                    number of abortive and still-born, shows the number of deaths in each of the
                    above-mentioned intervals of age. The sexes are distinguished throughout.</p>
                <p>IV. The fourth table, besides the abortive and still-born, shows the number of
                    deaths of each sex, and of both without distinction, that took place within the
                    year, both under and above ten years of age, by about eighty different causes,
                    besides those by suicide in various ways, and other violent deaths.</p>
                <p>V. The fifth table shows the number of children born in each month of the year,
                    and during the whole year, both alive and dead at birth, with distinction of the
                    sexes of those born alive, but not of the others; that, however, is given for
                    them both in the 2d and 3d tables; the'number of twin and triple births are also
                    stated in separate columns.</p>
                <p>The only fault we see in this bill of mortality, which, in in other respects, may
                    well serve as a pattern for others, is the most improper practice of including
                    the abortive and still-born children in the totals both of the births and the
                    deaths; they should always be stated, but kept separate, both from those born
                    alive, and from the deaths that took place among the living. The distinction of
                    the legitimate from the illegitimate births with that of their sexes, would also
                    be an improvement, if it could well be made; but we consider it to be much more
                    curious than useful. The author is only in possession of one of these Hamburgh
                    bills, which is for the year 1836. The totals were as follow:</p>

                <p>No attentive reader can fail to be struck with the difference (so ill understood)
                    in the proportion of the sexes among the three kinds of births; those born
                    alive, the stillborn, and the abortions. This bill is but for a single year, but
                    the same kind of difference prevails generally; and can hardly be contemplated
                    by a philosophical mind without exciting curiosity and the desire of further
                    information as to the difference between the sexes, first, in the difficulty of
                    fully entèring upon life, and afterwards in retaining it, more strongly marked,
                    as we approach nearer to the period of conception.</p>

                    Salvatore de Renzi, in which he shews why the population of the kingdom, and
                    consequently the rate of mortality among the people, could not be determined
                    previous to the year 1818. He gives four tables. The first shews for each of the
                    sixteen years 1818-1833, the number of the people, and the numbers of births and
                    deaths which took place among them, in each of the fifteen provinces of the
                    kingdom separately, without distinction of the sexes, and without including
                    Sicily, being able, he states, to assure his readers of their exactness and
                    precision during that period being incontestible.</p>
                <p>The number of inhabitants in 1818 was 4,990,380, and at the end of 1833 it was
                    5,883,273. In his second table, he gives for each of the provinces, and for the
                    whole of the kingdom, the proportions of the annual average numbers of births
                    and of deaths to the number of the people. The following are a few of them

                <p>A bill of mortality is published annually for the city of Naples, which contains
                    most of the information contained in other bills of that kind; but is defective
                    in one important point, the statement of the ages at which the deaths took
                    place, those of the inhabitants are not even mentioned, which indeed is too
                    common elsewhere. It states the number of the people at the end of the year it
                    reports upon, and also at the end of the preceding year. The sexes are always
                    distinguished in the enumerations of the people, as well as in the births and
                    deaths; the legitimate are also distinguished from the illegitimate births; the
                    number of twin births, with the sexes, are stated, and how many of them were
                    pairs of boys, how many of girls, also how many of the pairs were children of
                    different sexes; as was also done by Μ. Mallet and Μ. Hoffman, in their
                    statements for Geneva and the Prussian states respectively.</p>
                <p>The numbers of immigrants into and emigrants from the city, are stated,
                    distinguishing native Neapolitan subjects from those of foreign states; the
                    number of marriages contracted is given, but without any information as to the
                    ages or previous conditions of the contracting parties. The number of deaths at
                    home, and those in the hospitals and other public establishments are stated
                    separately. The proportions also are always stated: as of the births, deaths,
                    and marriages to the population, and of the annual births to the contemporaneous
                    annual marriages, but not minutely; they are expressed in vulgar fractions,
                    instead of decimals, haring always the same denominator, as 100 or 1000, which
                    is a great fault. No information is given as to the ages of the people, and the
                    deaths are only stated in the following intervals of age :—between birth and 1
                    year completed, between 1 and 11, between Hand 18, 18 and 26, 26 and 41, and
                    those above 41. The only bill for the city of Naples in the author’s possession
                    is for the year 1822; it was inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Giornale del
                    Regno dclle due Sieilie,</hi> of the 8th of February 1823. The population at the
                    end of 1822 was 344,716, of whom 163,059 were males, and 181,657 females; at the
                    end of 1821 the number of inhabitants was 341,143. The total number of births in
                    1822 was 14,233; of deaths, 12,195. The number of deaths in 1822 at ages above
                    100 years, was 17, and of the deceased 6 were males, and 11 females; the names,
                    residences, and ages of them all are stated; they were all citizens of Naples
                    but three, who came respectively from Procida, Salerno, and Venice, which last,
                    Rosa Romanzo, was the oldest of all, having attained<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193826203" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6203-0538"/> the age of 107; three other
                    ladies attained each to the age of 104.</p>
                <p>In the same Journal, for the 23d of April 1823, a bill of mortality for the city
                    of Palermo during the year 1822, compiled by Dr. Francesco Calcagni, is given.
                    The number of inhabitants at the end of 1821 is stated to have been 160,051, and
                    at the end of 1822, 161,735; but this last was derived from the first number,
                    only by adding to it the excess of the births above the deaths during the year
                    1822. No useful information is given as to the ages of the deceased, and this
                    bill is in other respects inferior to that for Naples; it differs from that, and
                    all others we have seen, in tracing persons born out of wedlock to their graves,
                    whatever age they may attain, and distinguishing the legitimate from the
                    illegitimate in the numbers of deaths as well as of births. In 1822 the number
                    of deaths of the legitimate was 4476, of whom 2294 were males, and 2182 females;
                    that of the bastards, as they are called, was 418, of whom 151 were males, and
                    267 females. Of the illegitimate children born in that particular year, 256 were
                    boys, and 307 girls. Out of the 4894 deaths, 16 of the deceased are stated to
                    have attained ages from 97 to 105 years; but no information is given as to the
                    distribution of those 16 persons into or among those last nine years of age.</p>
                <p>For these two Italian bills of mortality, the author is indebted to Mr. W. R.
                    Hamilton, who was so good as to send them to him from Naples, when they were
                    published; and he is happy to avail himself of this opportunity to acknowledge
                    his obligations to that gentleman, for the facilities he has afforded him of
                    procuring information from abroad on other occasions.</p>
                <p>Of all the statements derived from bills of mortality and enumerations of the
                    people, which we have mentioned, only those for Sweden and Finland, Dr.
                    Heysham’s for Carlisle, and Dr. Cleland’s for Glasgow, have been given in the
                    proper form, and with sufficient correctness to afford the information, which is
                    the most important object of them all, viz., that which is necessary for
                    determining the law of mortality.</p>
                <p>To effect this, it is only necessary to know the mean number of the living and of
                    the annual deaths, in sufficiently small intervals of age, throughout the extent
                    of life, for a period of time sufficient to allow of the accidental fluctuations
                    arising from more or less fruitful years, and other causes, compensating each
                    other: such periods, probably, should not be less than eight or ten years; but
                    the necessary length will depend upon the climate, the number of the people,
                    their general modes of life, and their political circumstances.</p>
                <p>These <hi rend="italic">data</hi> being obtained, it is not difficult to
                    determine the proportion of the annual deaths to the number of the living in
                    each year of age. Then, assuming any number of births, as 1000 or 10,000, it is
                    easy to show how many would die in each year of their age; and, consequently,
                    how many would survive that year; which numbers of survivors and of annual
                    deaths, when arranged in the order of the ages, constitute the desired table of
                    mortality, by which all the most important questions respecting the duration of
                    human life may be easily resolved.</p>
                <p>For want of understanding the principles upon which the proper construction of
                    such tables depends, most of the writers on this subject, many of them men of
                    great merit and industry, have taken much pains to little purpose, and after
                    excessive labour, have arrived at false conclusions. Hardly any of them appear
                    to have been aware of the necessity of obtaining the number of the living, as
                    well as of the annual deaths in each interval of age, or that that would greatly
                    enhance the value of Bills of Mortality, by extending their useful
                    applications.</p>
                <p>Dr. Price’s <hi rend="italic">Essays on the proper Method of constructing Tables
                    of Mortality,</hi> already mentioned in this article, was intended to show how
                    such tables might be constructed from registers of the <hi rend="italic">deaths
                    only</hi> at all ages; but the hypotheses he proceeded upon can hardly obtain in
                    any real case; and even if they did, his method would only determine the number
                    of the living in the place, at every age; therefore, if it could be put in
                    practice (which it never can), it would only supersede the necessity of actual
                    enumerations; and, with the numbers so obtained, we should have to proceed as
                    above.</p>
                <p>That <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi> of Dr. Price was an amplification of what Mr.
                    Simpson had previously advanced on the subject, with his accustomed accuracy,
                    and contains many just observations on the defects of the tables of mortality
                    that had previously been published; but so far as it contributed to induce a
                    belief that the determination of the number of the living in every interval of
                    age, by actual enumeration, was not necessary to the construction of accurate
                    tables, it must have done harm.</p>
                <p>What is here stated will be found demonstrated in the third chapter of Mr.
                    Milne’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Annuities.</hi></p>
                <p>It is desirable that a bill should be published for each year separately, to show
                    how the rates both of mortality and fecundity, vary with the circumstances of
                    the people in different years; and, from these yearly bills, nothing is more
                    easy than to derive others for longer periods.</p>
                <p>According to the form A, the births of both sexes in each year will be
                    distinguished, and the born alive from the stillborn; the number of marriages
                    will also be given.</p>
                <p>In this, and all other cases where those who undertake the formation of such
                    bills are either unable or unwilling to distinguish all the particulars
                    indicated, the reasons for the omissions should be inserted-in the spaces set
                    apart for the numbers omitted. The number of still-born children should always
                    be stated separately, and should never be included in the number either of the
                    births or deaths with those who had lived and breathed.</p>
                <p>The numbers of deaths of the two sexes in each interval of age, during any year,
                    may, as they are collected from the registers, be conveniently disposed
                    according to the form B; the intervals between five years of age and an hundred,
                    being each five years; and the number dying at each age above an hundred should
                    be particularly specified.</p>
                <p>But some persons, who would not take the trouble of forming bills of mortality in
                    which the ages are to be so minutely distinguished, might yet be willing to
                    furnish them with the requisite care, according to the form ♭, which might ⅞till
                    be very useful; and, indeed, from twenty to sixty years of age, intervals of ten
                    years each might do very well.</p>
                <p>The value of Bills of Mortality would be greatly enhanced, by inserting in them
                    the contemporaneous wages of labourers in agriculture, and of the workmen
                    employed in the more common kinds of trade and manufacture carried on among the
                    people they relate to; also the prices of the necessaries of life which persons
                    of these descriptions consume the most of; together with any thing uncommon in
                    the seasons or the crops, and every material change in the circumstances of the
                    people.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Enumerations.</hi></p>
                <p>The number of the people in the several intervals of age, which we have stated
                    above to be of so much importance, may be disposed in tables exactly similar to
                    B or ♭, recommended for the deaths; but it is not necessary that the duration of
                    life should be divided into the same intervals for the living as the dead. It is
                    always desirable that the intervals should, in both cases, be small; but yet not
                    so small, as, by the increase of labour, to occasion the numbers being
                    determined with less exactness, or to deter many from engaging in the work. Such
                    intervals should not, however, exceed ten years.</p>
                <p>When the bills are given for a certain period, if there be <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193826216" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6216-0539"/> but one enumeration of the
                    people, it should be made at the middle of the period; if two, at its
                    extremities; and if more than two, it is desirable that they should be made at
                    equal intervals of time throughout the period.</p>
                <p>We give no forms here of Bills of Mortality and Fecundity, designed to
                    distinguish legitimate from illegitimate children, or the mortality or fecundity
                    of each month of the year, nor the number of women delivered annually at the
                    different periods of life, nor the diseases the deaths were occasioned by.
                    Neither are the forms here recommended for enumerations of the people,
                    calculated to distinguish the numbers in the different states of childhood,
                    celibacy, marriage, or widowhood; nor the ranks, or professions, or occupations
                    of the people. All these things are curious, and of some use, although, if we
                    except the diseases which the deaths of each sex at the different ages were
                    occasioned by, they are of little value in comparison with the information the
                    forms here given are calculated to convey. And it is of so much importance that
                    that information should be given correctly, that we would willingly forego these
                    minor objects, to avoid dividing and fatiguing the attention of those who
                    undertake the more important part of the task, which is of itself sufficiently
                    laborious.</p>
                <p>And those who may be disposed to keep registers, and form bills and enumerations,
                    on a scale so much extended as to include all these particulars, or most of
                    them, and have also the requisite qualifications, will find no great difficulty
                    in preparing the most convenient forms of tables for the purpose. Several forms
                    of that description, with references toothers, will be found in Mr. Milne’s <hi

                </table>
                <p>The first, second, and fourth of the following tables are good examples of that
                    kind; but for insertion of the deaths of children, we prefer the intervals of
                    age between one and two, and between two and five, to those used in the Swedish
                    tables, viz. between one and three, and between three and five; because the
                    greatest mortality prevails at the earliest ages; and that from small-pox is
                    greatest in the first year of age, while the mortality from measles is greatest
                    in the second year. It is, therefore, desirable to have the means of comparing
                    the rates of mortality in the first and second year of age in registers kept
                    both before and after the prevalence of vaccination.</p>
                <p>Information on the diseases and mortality of children is highly desirable; and as
                    their ages at death can generally be stated correctly, if accurate registers
                    were kept of the numbers born alive, and of the numbers of annual deaths at all
                    ages, with the causes of them, the rate of mortality amongst children at every
                    age might thence be determined, and even that produced by each of the principal
                    diseases at each age. It will be seen by our account of the Parisian <hi
                    rend="italic">Recherches</hi><hi rend="italic">Statistiques,</hi> or by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Annuaire</hi><hi rend="italic">du Bureau des Longitudes,</hi> that
                    the numbers of deaths of children are given for Paris in much more minute
                    intervals of age than is usual in this country; and by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jaarboekje</hi> of Μ. R. Lobatto, published at the Hague, that for Amsterdam,
                    and also by the <hi rend="italic">Annuaire</hi><hi rend="italic">de l’</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Observatoire</hi><hi rend="italic">de Bruxelles,</hi> by Μ. A.
                    Quetelet, that for that city, they are given in intervals of age still more
                    minute than for Paris. This indeed is the case for more advanced ages, but we
                    consider it as being there of less importance.</p>
                <p>The expression we have adopted of the interval of age in which any lives were
                    prolonged, or in which any deaths took place, we consider as at once the most
                    simple and free from ambiguity; yet it has been stated to be ambiguous, an
                    opinion which we conceive can only be held by those who do not clearly
                    comprehend the exact import of the expression. We therefore trust we shall be
                    excused for giving an explanation here, of what we thought could have required
                    none.</p>
                <p>The age of every individual being the time that has elapsed since the moment of
                    birth, is at that moment nothing; we therefore express it by 0; and whatever
                    portion we assume for the unit of time, whether an hour, a day, week, month, or
                    year, the age at the expiration of that time from birth will be exactly one such
                    portion; and all individuals of a less age than that, may be properly stated to
                    be between the ages of 0 and 1. Except in infancy, one year is generally taken
                    for the unit of age; a man at the moment of the 25th anniversary of his birth,
                    is precisely 25 years of age, and until the 26th anniversary, he is between the
                    ages of 25 and 26, or, in other words, in his 26th year; although, it being
                    sufficient for common purposes, he is usually stated to be 25 years of age till
                    he attains 26. At the 30th anniversary of the moment of birth, he will be
                    precisely 30 years of age, but cannot continue of that or any other age during
                    any assignable portion of time, however small. So that at the moment a man is
                    enumerated amongst the living, or dies, the probability of his being precisely
                    of any one age that can be expressed by a whole number of years, is infinitely
                    small; and he may always with the greatest strictness and propriety be stated to
                    be between two such ages. Thus, in the case last mentioned, of a man who has
                    attained the 25th anniversary of his birth but not the 30th, he may be properly
                    stated to be between the ages of 25 and 30.</p>

                <p>Μ. Leyonmarck observes that “the mortality during the five years, 1806—1810, was
                    greater than it is stated in this table, owing to the lists of those who died in
                    the service during the war, not having been so accurately made out as they ought
                    to have been.</p>
                <p>In the table sent to the author, from which the above has been copied, the
                    average number of each sex in each interval of age was given in years and tenth
                    parts of <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> year; and that given here in each case is
                    the nearest whole number, whether greater or less; the difference is obviously
                    of no importance.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Law of Human Mortality is that which determines the
                    proportion of the number of persons who die in any assigned period of life, or
                    interval of age, out of a given number of persons who enter upon the same
                    interval; and, consequently, the proportion of them who survive that
                    interval.</p>
                <p>Tables showing how many out of a great number of children, as 10,000, or 100,000,
                    born alive, die in each year of their age; and, consequently, how many complete
                    each year; exhibit this law through the whole extent of life, and are called <hi
                    rend="italic">Tables of Mortality.</hi></p>
                <p>This section is divided into three parts. In the <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> we
                    deliver the history of this branch of knowledge, with as much brevity as appears
                    to be consistent with the chief object, which is that of conveying correct and
                    useful information.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">second part,</hi> we demonstrate the whole theory by
                    common arithmetic.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">third part,</hi> a new table of mortality is given,
                    constructed on the principles previously explained; some observations are made
                    on the comparative merits of the different tables that have been published;
                    which were purposely omitted in the historical part, when the tables they relate
                    to were mentioned, to avoid discouraging such readers as might not be previously
                    acquainted with the theory; and the faults are explained, which render most of
                    those tables really of no use, since others, more correct, have been
                    constructed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Part</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">History.</hi></p>
                <p>The first table of mortality was constructed by Dr. Halley, from the Mortuary
                    Registers of Breslau, for five years ending with 1691; and was inserted in his
                    paper on the subject in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi>
                    for the year 1693, with many judicious observations on the useful purposes to
                    which such tables may be applied.</p>
                <p>No further information of this kind was communicated to the public, until William
                    Kersseboom of the Hague published there three tracts on the subject (in 4to.)
                    The first, dated March 1, 1738, was entitled, <hi rend="italic">Eerste
                    Verhandeling tot cen Proeve om to weeten de probable menigte des volks in de
                    provintie van Hollandt en Westvrieslandt.</hi> The second, dated May 15, 1742,

                    rend="italic">de Proeve om to weeten de probable menigte des volks in de

                    third, dated August 31, 1742, <hi rend="italic">Derde Verhandeling aver de
                    probable meenigte des volks in de provintie van Hollandt</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >en</hi><hi rend="italic">Westvrieslandt.</hi></p>
                <p>A good account of the first of these tracts has been given by Mr. Eames, in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1738; and rather 'a meagre
                    one of the other two, by Mr. Van Rixtel, in the same <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions</hi> for 1743. It is therefore unnecessary to repeat here, any
                    thing contained in those accounts; but as they give no satisfactory information
                    concerning the construction of Mr. Kersseboom’s table of mortality (which he
                    called a <hi rend="italic">Table of Vitality),</hi> it will be pro per to supply
                    so material a defect in this place.</p>
                <p>In his first tract, the author informs us that he constructed his table from
                    registers of many thousand life-annuitants, in Holland and West Friesland, which
                    had been kept there from 125 to 130 years previous to the date of his
                    publication; and showed how many of the nominees, or lives the annuities
                    depended upon, were, at the time of their nomination, under one year old,
                    between one and two, between two and three, and so on for all ages.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826294" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6294-0545"/>
                <p>An exact account was also kept of the age at which each life of every class
                    failed; whence it clearly appeared, what degree of mortality prevailed at every
                    age above one year. But because very few children were nominated at or near
                    their birth, he could not, from these registers, determine the mortality under
                    one year of age. He therefore had recourse to mortuary registers and other
                    observations; from exact accounts of which he found, with sufficient certainty,
                    as he says, that out of 28,000 born alive, 5500 died under one year. He also
                    informs us, that, for this purpose, he made use of the observations of divers
                    learned men in England and elsewhere, especially Major John Graunt’s, upon the
                    number of the people and the rate of mortality; and upon taking an average of
                    the whole, he found it to differ but little from that just stated.</p>
                <p>And this appears to be the only ground for the assertion made by most writer * on
                    this subject (probably copying from each other without having seen the original
                    work), that Kersseboom’s Table of Mortality was constructed from observations
                    made upon annuitants in England as well as in Holland; also, that it was formed
                    partly from observations made upon the inhabitants of some Dutch villages.</p>
                <p>He first published his Table of Mortality in his second Tract, and in his third,
                    he gave abstracts of the registers from which it was constructed. These were
                    contained in twenty-nine tables, twenty-two of which were for the two sexes
                    separately; in the rest the sexes were not distinguished; and the ages at which
                    the lives failed were generally given to the exactness of half a year.</p>
                <p>The numbers of lives, whose current year of age at the time of their nomination
                    was given precisely in these tables, were,</p>

                </table>
                <p>And none of these nominees were above twelve years of age at the time of their
                    nomination.</p>
                <p>These, however, are only specimens of Μ. Kersseboom’s labours. He says there were
                    so many lives in the registers, that he had not the courage to undertake
                    extracting the necessary particulars for more than 50,000 of them; and in that,
                    he was greatly assisted by his friend Thomas von Schaak. Of all the lives, not
                    more than 1 of 120 was past 55 years of age at the time of nomination.</p>
                <p>Nicholas Struyck, in his <hi rend="italic">Aanhangsel op de</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    >Lyfrenten,</hi> published at Amsterdam in 1740, at the end of the quarto
                    volume, commencing with his <hi rend="italic">Inleid-ing tot de
                    Algemeene</hi><hi rend="italic">Geographie,</hi> gave, from registers kept at
                    Amsterdam for about thirty-five years, two tables of observations made upon the
                    duration of the lives of 794 males, and 876 female annuitants separately; and
                    two tables of mortality he had constructed from them for the two sexes; both
                    beginning with fjpe years of age. These two, taken together, differ but little
                    from that of Dr. Halley; they represent the mortality to be considerably greater
                    than Kersseboom’s: having been constructed from so few observations, they are
                    not entitled to much confidence, and appear to have been very little known or
                    attended to.</p>
                <p>This work of Struyck gave occasion to the publication, in the same year, of a
                    small tract in quarto, by Kersseboom, entitled, <hi rend="italic">Eenige
                    Anmerkingen op de Gissengen over den staαt van het Menschelyk Geslagt,</hi>
                    &amp;c. wherein he accused Struyck of plagiarism, with but too much appearance
                    of justice.</p>
                <p>Neither Kersseboom nor Struyck gave any information as to the manner in which
                    they formed their tables of mortality from the observations on which they were
                    grounded. Μ. Kersseboom informs us, that he submitted his table to Professor
                    S’Gravesande, some years previous to its publication, and obtained his
                    approbation of it for calculating the values of annuities on lives.</p>
                <p>In the year 1742, Mr. Thomas Simpson, in his <hi rend="italic">Doctrine of
                    Annuities,</hi> (see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Annuities)</hi> gave a
                    table of mortality for London, being the same that had previously been
                    constructed by Mr. Smart, at twenty-five and all the greater ages, but corrected
                    at all ages under twenty-five years, on account of the greater number of
                    strangers who settle in London under that age, which occasioned, till the
                    commencement of the present century, a constant excess of the burials above the
                    births. This correction Mr. Simpson made by comparing together the numbers of
                    christenings and burials; and observing, by means of Dr. Halley’s table, the
                    proportion between the mortality in London and Breslaw above twenty-five years
                    of age.</p>
                <p>In 1746, Μ. Deparcieux published (at Paris in 4to,) his <hi rend="italic">Essai
                    sur les Probabilités de la duree de la Vie Humaine,</hi> in which he gave six
                    new and valuable tables of mortality; one of them constructed from the lists of
                    the nominees in the French Tontines, principally those of the years 1689 and
                    1696, and the rest from the mortuary registers of different religious houses;
                    four of these showing the mortality that prevailed amongst the monks of
                    different orders, and the fifth, that which obtained amongst the nuns in
                    different convents of Paris. Those for the monks and nuns, with the exception of
                    the tables of Struyck, mentioned above, were the first ever constructed for the
                    two sexes separately.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi> of Μ. Deparcieux is written popularly, and with
                    great perspicuity; he has given the most satisfactory accounts both of the <hi
                    rend="italic">data</hi> his tables were constructed from, and the manner of
                    their construction.</p>
                <p>In his thirteenth table, he included with the five tables of mortality of his own
                    construction; that of Mr. Smart for London, as corrected by Mr. Simpson, Dr.
                    Halley’s, and Μ. Kersseboom’s, together with the expectation of life <hi
                    rend="italic">at,</hi> or its average duration <hi rend="italic">after</hi> each
                    age, both according to his own and Μ. Kersseboom’s table for annuitants, and for
                    every fifth year of age according to each of the other tables; the fractional
                    parts of a year being always expressed in months, and not in decimals.</p>
                <p>Dr. Halley first, and Struyck after him, had given the <hi rend="italic">probable
                    duration of life</hi> after several ages, according to their respective tables,
                    that is, the term at the expiration of which, the persons now living at any
                    proposed age, will be reduced by death to one-half their present number.</p>
                <p>But Deparcieux appears to have first given the <hi rend="italic">average duration
                    of life</hi> after any age, and showed how to calculate it correctly from tables
                    of mortality. On account of the scarcity and value of Μ. Deparcieux’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Tables of Mortality,</hi> Mr. Milne has reprinted them, with the
                    expectations of life just mentioned, in his <hi rend="italic">Treatise on
                    Annuities,</hi> with a short account of their construction; it is therefore
                    unnecessary to pursue the subject further here.</p>
                <p>In 1760 Μ. Deparcieux published (at Paris in 4to) his <hi rend="italic">Addition
                    a l’</hi><hi rend="italic">Essai sur les Probabilités de la durée de la Vie
                    Humaine,</hi> with five tables; three of them relating to life annuities
                    deferred on a peculiar plan, we consider to be of no interest or value at this
                    time: the two others are tables of mortality constructed from statements of the
                    numbers of deaths that took place at different ages, without knowing the numbers
                    of the living at the same periods of life. He obtained the data for the first of
                    them from a clergyman on the frontiers of Normandy and Perche, whose accuracy in
                    all he undertook, he could rely upon; and who gave him the names of the parishes
                    from the registers of which he had extracted the information; but strictly
                    enjoined him not to disclose his name in the event of his making use of <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193826307" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6307-0546"/> the documents. In
                    these the sexes were not distinguished.</p>
                <p>The other table of mortality Μ. Deparcieux constructed from statements sent to
                    him by Μ. Wargen tin of the numbers of deaths of males and females separately,
                    which took place in the different intervals of age in Sweden and Finland, during
                    the three years 1754, 1755 and 1756. Those two tables have the same faults as
                    others constructed from similarly defective data; and we consider them to be of
                    no value.</p>
                <p>Μ. Deparcieux states, (p. 28) that in 1744, he suggested to Μ. Aubert, the
                    commissary who at that time prepared the Bills of Mortality for Paris, the
                    expediency of distinguishing the sexes in the columns of births and deaths,
                    which had not been done previously, but was in consequence of this commenced
                    with the year 1745, and has been continued ever since, as we have already
                    observed in our account of the Parisian <hi rend="italic">Pecherches</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Statistiques.</hi></p>
                <p>Μ. de Buffon, at the end of the second volume of his <hi rend="italic">Histoire
                    Naturelle,</hi> published in 1749, inserted a table of mortality that had been
                    constructed by Μ. Dupre de Saint Maur, from the registers of twelve country
                    parishes in France, and three parishes of Paris; which Μ. de Buffon informs his
                    readers that he inserted in his work the more willingly, since these were the
                    only kind of documents, or combinations of them, from which the probabilities of
                    life among mankind in general, could be determined with any certainty. Yet this
                    was a very faulty table, and the numbers of annual deaths were so injudiciously
                    distributed, according to the ages, that it often represented the mortality in
                    one year of age to be three or four times as great, and in some cases, six times
                    as great, as in the next year. Some remarks of Μ. Kersseboom on this table may
                    be seen in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1753. Μ. de
                    Saint Cyran corrected some of its most obvious errors, and inserted both the
                    original and his corrected copy in his <hi rend="italic">Calcul</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Rentes</hi><hi rend="italic">Viagères.</hi> (Paris, 1779, in 4
                    to.)</p>
                <p>Mr. Simpson, in the <hi rend="italic">Supplement</hi> to his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Doctrine of Annuities,</hi> published in 1752, gave some further explanations
                    of the corrections he had made in Mr. Smart’s table of mortality for London; and
                    made some very judicious observations on the difficulties that attend the
                    construction of tables of mortality from the mortuary registers only, of large
                    towns.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Nouveaux</hi><hi rend="italic">Mem. de l’Acad, Ray. de
                    Perlin</hi> for the year 1760, there is a paper by the celebrated Euler,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Recherches générales sur la Mortalité, et la
                    Multiplication du Genre Humain,</hi> wherein the subject is treated
                    algebraically. He assumes that the population is not affected by migration, and
                    that the annual births and deaths are always as the contemporaneous population;
                    consequently, that the number of the people increases or decreases in
                    geometrical progression. Then he gives several theorems exhibiting the relations
                    that would obtain between the annual births and deaths and the population, and
                    determines the law of mortality upon these hypotheses, but does not shew how it
                    may be deduced from actual observations independent of hypotheses; neither does
                    he undertake the construction of any table of mortality, but, by way of example,
                    gives that of Μ. Kersseboom, with the changes of the numbers which become
                    necessary, in consequence of his altering the radix from 1400 annual births to
                    1000.</p>
                <p>Süssmilch took great pains in collecting the numbers of annual deaths in the
                    different intervals of age, which he published in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Göttliche Ordnung</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and four tables of mortality
                    formed from these <hi rend="italic">data</hi> are to be found in the same work;
                    that in the second volume (§ 461), which has many imperfections, was formed by
                    himself; the three others, being the 21st, 22d, and 23d, at the end of the third
                    volume, were constructed by his commentator Baumann, according to the more
                    correct method of Lambert.</p>
                <p>The first edition of Dr. Price’s <hi rend="italic">Observations on Rever</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sionary Payments,</hi> appeared in 1771, containing his
                    observations on the proper method of constructing tables of mortality from bills
                    which shew the numbers dying annually at all ages, and three new tables of
                    mortality constructed from the London, Norwich, and Northampton bills.</p>
                <p>The second edition of the same work was published in 1772, and contained, in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Supplement,</hi> much interesting and valuable information
                    which did not appear in the first, together with five new tables, intended to
                    exhibit the law of mortality that obtained, 1st, in the district of Vaud, in
                    Switzerland; 2d, in a country parish in Brandenburg; 3d, in the parish of Holy
                    Cross, near Shrewsbury; 4th, at Vienna; 5th, at Berlin. The first formed from
                    bills of mortality given in the <hi rend="italic">Mémoire</hi> of Μ. Muret; and
                    the 2d, 4th, and 5th, from those given by Süssmilch in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Göttliche Ordnung',</hi> the 3d was from the parish register only of Holy
                    Cross. But we consider none of those tables as now of any value, on account of
                    the defects in the <hi rend="italic">data</hi> from which they were
                    constructed.</p>
                <p>At the end of the first volume of the work of J. H. Lambert, entitled, <hi

                    >uni</hi><hi rend="italic">deren</hi><hi rend="italic">Amvendung,</hi> published
                    at Berlin in 1765, 8vo, he gave a chapter on the certainty of inferences*
                    deduced from observations and experiments; and the example with which he
                    concluded the illustration of his theory, was the deduction of the law of
                    mortality in London from the bills of mortality there; by means of a curve, of
                    which the absciss being proportional to the age, the corresponding ordinate was
                    proportional to the number of survivors of the same age.</p>
                <p>In the third volume of the same work, published in 1772, the ingenious author
                    treated the subject at much greater length: <hi rend="italic">x</hi> being the
                    age, and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> the corresponding ordinate to the curve of
                    mortality for London, proportional to the number of survivors of that age out of
                    a given number (10,000) born alive, he gave this equation to the curve,</p>
                <p>(e being the number of which unit is the hyperbolic logarithm), which determined
                    the numbers in the table of mortality very near the truth, until 96 years of
                    age, beyond which it was not intended to be used.</p>
                <p>Μ. Lambert also constructed a table by which he intended to exhibit the law of
                    mortality that prevails among mankind in general, from the 23d and 24th tables
                    in the second volume of Süssmilch’s <hi rend="italic">Göttliche Ordnung,</hi>
                    which gave the numbers of deaths, in the different intervals of age, in
                    seventeen country parishes in the mark of Brandenburgh, and from the London
                    bills for thirty years; supposing, with Süssmilch, <hi rend="italic">(Gott.
                    Ord.</hi> t. i. § 34), that the country people are double the number of those
                    residing in towns.</p>
                <p>By an extract of a letter from Μ. Lambert to Gaeta and Fontana, given in their
                    Italian translation of Demoivre’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Life Annuities,
                    (Discorso Pr</hi><hi rend="italic">eliminare,</hi> part iii.), it appears, that
                    all his attempts to find <hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >posteriori</hi> an equation which should determine the relation between the age
                    and the number of survivors in this last table, proved fruitless; the formulae
                    he arrived at having been either too long and intricate, or too incorrect. This
                    is the less to be regretted, since there is no doubt that Μ. Lambert’s table did
                    not represent the true law of mortality, as he made no allowance for the effect
                    of the increase of the people by procreation; and it is singular he did not see
                    that that law might be correctly determined from the numbers of the living, and
                    the annual deaths at all ages in Sweden and Finland, given in Μ. Wargentin’s
                    paper in the <hi rend="italic">Stockholm Transactions</hi> for 1766, which paper
                    he himself quotes.</p>
                <p>Lambert appears to have first demonstrated clearly the principal properties of
                    tables of mortality, in doing which he made use of the differential and integral
                    calculus; but <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826320" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6320-0547"/>
                    as he could not determine the equation to the curve of mortality, that resource
                    did not avail him much.</p>
                <p>Flourencourt treated this subject algebraically in the third chapter of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Political Arithmetic,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    previously treated by Euler and Lambert; but added nothing himself that was
                    original, except three new tables of mortality; one for males, another for
                    females, and a third for both sexes without distinction; deriving his data in
                    each case from the <hi rend="italic">Göttliche Ordnung</hi> of Süssmilch. He
                    also gave a new copy of the table of mortality Μ. Deparcieux had constructed
                    from the registers of the nominees in the French tontines; assuming 10,000 for
                    the radix, and inserting the numbers under three years of age, nearly according
                    to Μ. Kersseboom’s table; this, however, does not differ materially from the
                    original table of Deparcieux.</p>
                <p>The fourth edition of Dr. Price’s <hi rend="italic">Observations on Reversionary
                    Payments</hi> was published in the year 1783, and contained new tables of
                    mortality for Warrington and Chester, also for all Sweden and Finland, and for
                    Stockholm separately, in which the sexes were di stinguished. Those for the
                    whole kingdom were constructed from enumerations of the living, and registers of
                    the annual deaths, in each interval of age, during twenty-one years; those for
                    Stockholm during nine years. The tables for Sweden and Stockholm were the first
                    ever constructed from the data that are requisite to determine the law of
                    mortality among the bulk of the people, and were sufficiently accurate
                    representations of that law, for the times and places in which the observations
                    were made.</p>
                <p>In a paper of Μ. Henrich Nicander, inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions
                    of the Royal Academy of Sciences</hi> at Stockholm, for the first quarter of the
                    year 1801, he gave two tables of mortality for all Sweden and Finland, in which
                    the sexes were distinguished, but they were not properly constructed; and the
                    mean duration of life which he gave in them at each age, was very erroneous,
                    especially in early life. In that paper he asserted, without offering any
                    demonstration or proof, that, in what we have called the curve of mortality
                    above, if an ordinate be drawn through the centre of gravity of the portion of
                    the area cut off by the ordinate at any assigned age, on the side of the more
                    advanced ages, the part of the base, or of the axe of the abscisses, intercepted
                    between these two ordinates, will measure the mean duration of life after such
                    assigned age. And the mean duration of life after each age, which he has given,
                    was determined in this manner.</p>
                <p>Mr. Milne’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Annuities and Assurances</hi> was
                    published in the year 1815; and, in the third chapter of that work, the
                    construction and properties of tables of mortality are fully treated of.</p>
                <p>In the second volume of the same work, three new tables of mortality are given;
                    one constructed from very accurate observations made at Carlisle, by Dr.
                    Heysham, who preserved the bills of mortality of the two parishes, which include
                    that city and its environs, and supplied their déficiences with great care,
                    together with correct accounts of two enumerations of the inhabitants, in which
                    their ages were taken; and a table showing the diseases by which the deaths at
                    all ages were occasioned, is also given.</p>
                <p>The fourth and fifth tables in Mr. Milne’s work, exhibit the law of mortality
                    which prevailed in all Sweden and Finland, both with and without distinction of
                    the sexes, deduced from the registers kept and the enumerations made there,
                    during the twenty years ended with 1795; which term was subsequent to that
                    wherein the observations were made, from which Dr. Price’s tables were
                    constructed.</p>
                <p>The seventh table in the same work exhibits the law of mortality at Montpellier
                    for males and females separately, and was constructed from the bills of
                    mortality of that place for twenty-one years, ending with 1792.</p>
                <p>The second table at the end of this article, was published in the first edition
                    of it in 1822; the tables of mortality for the lives insured in the Equitable
                    Office, which were constructed by Mr. Babbage and Mr. Davies, were published in
                    1826; and we have given some account of them as well as of those formed by Mr
                    Finlaison, from observations on Government Annuities in this country, and
                    published in 1829, in the article <hi rend="italic">Annuities</hi> in this
                    work.</p>
                <p> MM. Quetelet and Edouard Smits, in their <hi rend="italic">Recherches
                    sur</hi><hi rend="italic">la Reproduction</hi><hi rend="italic">et la Mortalité
                    de VHomme,</hi> in 1832, gave a table of mortality for the towns and the rural
                    districts in Belgium separately, distinguishing males from females, and also for
                    the whole population, without distinguishing the sexes, or the inhabitants of
                    towns from those of the country.</p>
                <p>Mr. Morgan, in the above mentioned publication of the Equitable Assurance
                    Society, in 1834, gave a table of mortality for the lives insured in it, (marked
                    C, p. 28), derived from table A of that work; another (D) derived from table B,
                    is not worth a place there.</p>
                <p>The second of the tables at the end of Dr. Casper’s work on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Probabilities of Human Life,</hi> published in 1835, was intended to exhibit
                    the law of mortality in Berlin, with distinction of the sexes; it was
                    constructed from 69,362 deaths at different ages; 36,895 of males, and 32,467 of
                    females, which took place there during the twelve years 1818-1829∙ And Μ. Mallet
                    at the end of his valuable <hi rend="italic">Mémoire,</hi> published in 1836,
                    has given one for Geneva, in which the sexes are distinguished: it contains both
                    the mean and the probable duration of life after every age, and was formed from
                    the bills of mortality there for the eighteen years 1814-1833. For males,
                    females, and the two sexes without distinction, Μ. Mallet took so high a radix
                    as 100,000 births; the number of deaths were, of males 5219, females 5688, of
                    both sexes 10,907; and in the column of deaths, on the same line for any age, as
                    the survivors of that age, the author has put the number of deaths in the
                    registers in the next following year, instead of the decrement of life, or
                    excess of the number attaining that above the number attaining the next greater
                    age, which will probably puzzle many readers.</p>

                <p>which, then, would evidently be a table of mortality; and this mode of
                    constructing one, were it practicable, would be the simplest possible.</p>
                <p>2. But of 10,000 children taken indiscriminately at birth, it is manifest that
                    the number who complete or survive any year of age, will be just the same,
                    whether they be all born at the same time or not; and, therefore, this table
                    might as well have been constructed by noting the times of the births of 10,000
                    children taken indiscriminately, and registering the time or the age at which
                    each died; for then, after the whole were extinct, it would only be necessary to
                    collect the sum of those who died in each year of their age, and insert it in
                    the third column of the above table (1) against the proper age. The numbers in
                    the second column would then be obtained by beginningwith the 10,000 births, and
                    merely subtracting the number in the third from the number in the second column,
                    and placing the remainder in the next line below, in that second column,
                    throughout the table.</p>
                <p>3. It is evident that the number against any age in the second column of such a
                    table, is equal to the sum of those in the third column against that, and all
                    the greater ages; that is to say, that <hi rend="italic">the number who complete
                    any year of age is equal to the sum of those who die at all the greater
                    ages.</hi></p>
                <p>4. Now let us suppose the population of a place to have remained invariable for
                    one or two hundred years past, during which period 10,000 children have been
                    born alive, at 10,000 equal intervals of time in each year. Also that, there
                    having been no migration, and the law of mortality having been always the same,
                    both the number of the living and that of the annual deaths in each year of age,
                    have remained constant, the whole amount of the annual deaths at all ages, as
                    well as the number of annual births, having been 10,000.</p>
                <p>5. Then, if the law of mortality exhibited in the above table (1) be that which
                    obtains in the place just mentioned, that table will represent the stream of
                    life which flows through it, and fills the vacancies left by those who advance
                    in age, or are carried off by death, their successors incessantly following and
                    being followed in the same course.</p>
                <p>6. Thus: 10,000 children being born annually at so many equal intervals of time,
                    7096 will annually complete their fifth year, also at equal intervals; and of
                    these, 112 will die annually in the sixth year of their age.</p>
                <p>7. And it is manifest that <hi rend="italic">the number who annually complete any
                    year of their age in such a place, is equal to the sum of the annual deaths at
                    all the greater ages.</hi></p>
                <p>8. Let us next suppose, that the constant number of deaths which happen annually
                    in any one year of age, take place at equal intervals of age in that year. For
                    instance, that the four deaths which happen annually, in the ninetyfifth year of
                    age, always takes place at the ages of</p>

                    completing the 95th year.</p>
                <p>9. Then the number constantly living in any year of age may be determined as
                    follows:</p>
                <p>Let us take, for example, the ninety-fourth year, which 14 persons annually enter
                    upon, and 5 die in. Now, if no deaths happened in that year, it is obvious that
                    the 14 persons who annually enter upon it at so many equal intervals (4 and 6),
                    would be all constantly living at 14 equal intervals of age in that year; and if
                    that year of age were divided into five equal intervals, there would be</p>
                <p>14</p>
                <p>constancy living in each interval — persons; or, in a place 5 similarly
                    circumstanced, but five times more populous, 14 persons.</p>
                <p>But when five deaths take place at so many equal intervals in the ninety-fourth
                    year of age, (the fifth part of a year being 73 days,) the case is altered.

                <p>But the numerators of these fractions being in arithmetical progression, their
                    sum is equal to half the sum of the first and last terms multiplied by the
                    number of terms; or —Φ~ × 5; which sum being divided by the common denominator,
                    5, we have the number of the living in the 94th year of age=—⅛--; an

                <p>proportional between the numbers who annually enter upon, and annually survive
                    their 94th year, for the number constantly living in that year, it will only be
                    less by half a life than what has just been demonstrated to be the true number,
                    according to the hypotheses; and the difference would still have been but half a
                    life, although the radix of the table had been 10,000,000 instead of 10,000; the
                    number of the living would, in that case, according to these two methods, have
                    been 1200 and 1199½. And the number of the living in any one year of age, even
                    according to the above table, is generally several thousands, so that this
                    difference, which remains always the same, is quite immaterial.</p>
                <p>Besides, it is obvious that the above hypotheses can never coincide exactly with

                    equally to any other age than that of 93 years.</p>
                <p>13. Whence it follows, that in a place circumstanced as we have supposed, <hi
                    rend="italic">the number of persons constantly living at any assigned age and
                    upwards, is less than the sum of those who annually complete that and all the
                    greater ages, by half the number who annually complete that year of their
                    age.</hi></p>
                <p>14. From the supposition that the number of persons who die annually in any one
                    and the same year of age, expire at so many equal intervals of age in that year
                    (8), it follows, that for each of these lives which fails before the middle of
                    that year of age, there will be another which will fail just so much after it,
                    and, consequently, that the average quantity of existence during any year of
                    age, for the lives that fail in it, is just half a year.</p>
                <p>15. But in taking, for any one year of age, the sum of the numbers in the second
                    column of the table (1) at all the greater ages, each life is counted once for
                    every complete year it survives, after the age first mentioned; and if, to the
                    sum of these, we add half the number in the same second column against that
                    first mentioned age, this half number being the sum of the fractional parts of a
                    year, by which the whole of these lives survive the last year of age they
                    complete (14); the sum total thus obtained will evidently be the whole^duration
                    of life after the age first mentioned, enjoyed by all the lives that survive
                    that age in any one year.</p>
                <p>16. Therefore, if this last sum total be divided by the number who annually
                    survive that first mentioned age, the quotient will be <hi rend="italic">the
                    mean duration of life after that age</hi> which is also called <hi rend="italic"
                    >the expectation of life at the same age,</hi> being the portion of future
                    existence which an individual at that age may reasonably expect to enjoy.</p>
                <p>17. But, by No. 13, it appears, that the last mentioned sum total is also the
                    number constantly living in the place, at and above the age first mentioned
                    (15).</p>
                <p>18. Whence, and from No. 16, it follows, that if the number of the living in the
                    place at any age and upwards, be divided by the number who annually complete
                    that age, the quotient will be the mean duration of life after the same age.</p>
                <p>19∙ And, consequently, if the number constantly living at all ages, be divided by
                    the number of annual births, the quotient will be the mean duration of life from
                    birth, or the expectation of life of a child just born.</p>
                <p>20. Hence also it appears, that the number of years in the expectation of life at
                    any age, is the same as the number of living persons at that age and upwards,
                    out of which one dies annually.</p>
                <p>21. Thus, for example, the expectation of life at 40 years of age being 25∙495
                    years, the proportion of the living in the place aged 40 years and upwards who
                    die annually, is one of 25*495, or, which is the same, 1000 out of 25,495.</p>
                <p>22. The numbers represented by a table of mortality to die in any intervals of
                    age, are called <hi rend="italic">the decrements of life</hi> in those
                    intervals.</p>
                <p>23. And the interval between any age and the utmost extent of life, according to
                    any table of mortality, is called <hi rend="italic">the complement of life</hi>
                    at that age, according to the same table.</p>
                <p>24. If the decrements of life be supposed to be equal and uniform through its
                    whole extent, and the interval between birth and the utmost extremity of life be
                    divided into as many equal parts as there are annual births, then, one of the
                    individuals born will die at the expiration of each of these equal intervals of
                    age; and the numbers who survive the several intervals, from birth to the
                    extremity of life, will form an arithmetical progression.</p>
                <p>25. Whence it will be found (11), that the number of the living at any assigned
                    age and upwards, will be equal to the number who annually complete that age,
                    multiplied by half the number of years in the complement of life at the same
                    age-</p>
                <p>26. And if this last product be divided by the number who annually complete that
                    age, the quotient, that is, half <hi rend="italic">the complement of life, will
                    be the expectation of life at that age</hi> (18).</p>
                <p>27. The mean numbers of annual deaths at all ages, or, which in this case is the
                    same, the number of deaths in each year of age, that take place during any one
                    year, in a place circumstanced as we have supposed, being given, a table may be
                    constructed as follows, which will answer all the most interesting questions
                    that can be put respecting the population and mortality of the place.</p>
                <p>28. Let there be five columns, in the first of which insert the ages 0, 1, 2, 3,
                    4 96, 97, 98, 99, and against every age, insert in the fifth column, the given
                    number that died in the year between that and the next greater age; then begin
                    at the greatest age, and proceed towards the least, as follows :—</p>
                <p>L∕, To the number against any age in the fourth column, add that against the next
                    less age in the fifth, and insert the sum against that next less age in the
                    fourth (7).</p>
                <p>2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, To the sum of the numbers in the third and fourth
                    columns against any age, add half the number in the fifth column against the
                    next less age, and insert this last sum against that next less age in the third
                    column (11).</p>
                <p>3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, Divide the number against any age in the third column,
                    by the number against the same age in the fourth, the quotient will be the
                    expectation of life at that age, to be inserted in the second column (16).</p>

                <p>29∙ Hitherto we have supposed the state of the population to continue invariable
                    for 100 years at the least, on account of the facility with which tables of
                    mortality might be <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826359"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-6359-0550"/> formed from accurate mortuary registers in such
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>But whether the population be stationary, or increasing, or decreasing, and from
                    whatever causes these changes proceed, provided that they be produced gradually,
                    and not by sudden starts during the time of the observations, the law of
                    mortality may be determined from actual enumerations of the people, and the
                    bills of mortality. Thus,</p>
                <p>30. Let the number of persons in each year of their age, that are resident in a
                    place at any one time, be taken, and let an accurate register be kept of the
                    number that die annually in each year of their age, during a term of eight or
                    ten years at the least, whereof the first half may precede, and the second
                    follow the time of the enumeration.</p>
                <p>Then, if the number of the inhabitants of every age either increase or decrease
                    uniformly during that term, the mean number of annual deaths in each year of age
                    thus registered, will be the same as if the population of the place had
                    continued throughout that term what ,it was when the enumeration was made.</p>
                <p>31. But if, to the number of the living in any year of age, we add half the
                    number who annually die in the same year, the sum will be the number who
                    annually enter upon that year of their age ♯ 1.)</p>
                <p>And thus, from the enumerations and registers above mentioned, may be derived the
                    ratio of the number who annually enter upon any year of their age, to the number
                    who annually die in it.</p>
                <p>32. But all the observations which have been made with sufficient minuteness, on
                    the mortality during the first year from birth, concur in showing, that many
                    more deaths take place in the first few weeks from birth, than in equal periods
                    of time during the remainder of the first year; and that the nearer to birth,
                    the greater is the mortality among infants. So that the number of the living in
                    successive equal intervals in the first year of age, cannot be correctly assumed
                    to be in arithmetical progression.</p>
                <p>33. On this account it is desirable that the annual numbers, both of the children
                    born alive, and the deaths under one year of age, should be correctly
                    registered, as in Sweden.</p>
                <p>34. Then, as the number annually born alive, is to the number of annual deaths
                    under one year of age, according to the registers, so is the radix of the table
                    of mortality, to the number dying under one year of age according to that table,
                    which, being subtracted from the radix, the remainder is the number who complete
                    their first and enter on their second year. Whence the numbers, both of
                    survivors and annual deaths, at all the greater ages, may be determined in the
                    order of their succession by No. 31.</p>
                <p>35. If, instead of the number of the living in each year of age being taken only
                    once, according to No. 30, that operation be performed several times during the
                    term for which the mean number of annual deaths in each year of age is given
                    ;—then, the mean number of the living in each year of age throughout that term,
                    must be deduced from the given numbers; and, being substituted for the number at
                    the middle of the term according to No. 30, the law of mortality may be
                    determined with more certainty, than when the people are only numbered once.</p>
                <p>36. Both in enumerations of the people, and in bills of mortality, the numbers
                    are, however, almost always given only for intervals of age of several years
                    each. For the manner of interpolating the numbers in each particular year of
                    age, the reader is referred to Mr. Milne’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise on
                    Annuities and Assurances,</hi> arts. 180 and 181.</p>
                <p>37. Hitherto we have only considered the determination of the law of mortality
                    amongst the whole of the inhabitants of a place, of all ages, ranks, and
                    conditions; and until within the last eight years, no statements of facts
                    relating to particular classes of the people had been published, except those of
                    Μ. Deparcieux, in his valuable <hi rend="italic">Essai,</hi> sufficiently
                    numerous and correct to be available for the purpose. But the inquiries made by
                    order, and with the aid of government in this country, into the mortality
                    amongst various classes of nominees, on whose lives annuities depended,
                    published in Mr. Finlaison’s report to the Lords of the treasury in 1829, and
                    already noticed in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Annuities</hi> in this work;
                    with the publication in 1834, of the still more interesting, important, and
                    distinctly detailed observations on the mortality that has taken place among the
                    lives insured in the Equitable Assurance Society, form most valuable accessions
                    to our knowledge of the subject; we therefore proceed to show how the law of
                    mortality among those classes of persons may be deduced from these documents. We
                    shall have compassed that object, when we have determined out of a considerable
                    number of persons who entered upon each year of age, how many died in that year,
                    and, consequently, how many survived it; and the Equitable Assurance documents
                    are so disposed, as to afford great facility in effecting this. The following
                    table is extracted from them, with the addition of the column marked B.</p>

                <p>38. According to the common mode of expressing the ages, which is adopted both in
                    the government documents <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826372"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-6372-0551"/> and in those of the Assurance Society, the year
                    of age stated is always that which was last completed; but where-ever that is
                    the case, it should be distinctly stated, and kept steadily in view. We confine
                    ourselves in this table to the 31st year of age, and mark it 30+ to avoid
                    ambiguity; for the same reason ( + ) is put over the ages in column A, to show
                    that each number in it denotes the age last completed.</p>
                <p>39∙ Column B has been added for the sake of illustration; it shows at what
                    earlier ages the different lives entered the society, which afterwards completed
                    the 30th year of their age in it, and entered their 31st: thus, out of 40
                    insured in the 8th year of age during the period of the observations, only 5
                    entered their 31st while insured in the society, the rest having passed out of
                    it either by death or otherwise, at earlier ages, as the preceding columns of
                    the original table fully show; and of the 373 persons who were insured in their
                    22d year, 124 remained insured till they entered their 31.</p>
                <p>40. This table shows that of 4692 persons who entered on their 31st year of age
                    in the society, 265 went out of it alive in the same year of their age during
                    the observations, 51 were still living and insured at the termination of the
                    observations, and 762 came into the society in that year of their age; the
                    individuals of those three classes amount together to 1078 persons. But of the
                    265 who went out of the society alive during that year of age, it may reasonably
                    be assumed, that whatever number of them at the time of their exit exceeded 30½
                    years of age by any interval of time, as many would fall short of that middle
                    age by the same interval, when they went out; and, therefore, that the whole of
                    them on an average may properly be considered to have been exposed to the action
                    of the Law of Mortality during one half of that year of age; so that the
                    mortality among them must have been the same as it would have been among half
                    the number of exactly similar lives, in passing through the whole of that
                    year.</p>
                <p>In the same manner it appears, that of the 762 persons who were insured at
                    various periods of the 31st year of age, and of the 51 persons who remained
                    alive and insured in the society at various periods of that year of age when the
                    observations terminated; may, each of them on an average, be properly assumed to
                    have been exposed to the action of the law of mortality in the society during
                    one half of the 3lstyear of age; and we are therefore entitled to conclude that
                    the mortality among them was the same as it would have been among half the
                    number of exactly similar lives in passing through the whole of the 31st year of
                    age.</p>
                <p>But 4692, the total of the numbers in column C includes all those 1078 lives, the
                    same as if they had all entered upon their 31st year of age in the society, and
                    had all passed through it except those which were carried off by death. It is,
                    therefore, manifest, that 539, the half of their number, must be substracted
                    from 4692, and the remainder, 4153 must be taken as the number of persons
                    entering on the 31st year of their age, and continuing exposed to the law of
                    mortality in the society during the whole of that year, among whom thirty-two
                    deaths take place in the same year of age.</p>
                <p>This, when the principle is clearly understood, is certainly a very simple
                    operation and easily performed; and its application to every other age in the
                    original table of data is exactly the same as to the 31st year.</p>
                <p>41. In constructing the table of mortality, supposing that in proceeding from the
                    earliest age we have arrived at the completion of the 30th year, or the entrance
                    on the 31st, and have determined the number of survivors at that limit to be
                    4305; since</p>
                <p>4153: 32 :: 4305: 33∙1712, we find 33 to be the number of deaths which will take
                    place in the 31st year of age out of 4305 persons who enter on it; and,
                    consequently, that 4272 enter on their 32d year, according to the table we are
                    constructing; the method of completing it is obviously the same throughout, and
                    can be attended with no difficulty after the valuable documents requisite for
                    the purpose have been obtained.</p>
                <p>42. What has been shown here respecting the determination of the law of mortality
                    amongst insured lives, applies also, and with rather more facility to the
                    nominees on whose lives annuities depend. The life annuities sold by government
                    in this country not being redeemable, are always continued during the whole of
                    the lives they depend upon; therefore, with regard to them, column E in the
                    above table is left blank; and in the case of the old English Tontine, which
                    commenced in 1693 and ended in 1783 with the life of the last survivor, column D
                    will also be quite blank.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Part</hi> III.— <hi rend="italic">On the Law of Mortality as
                    deduced by the preceding methods from actual observations</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">and on the comparative merits of the different Tables
                    of Mortality that have been published.</hi></p>
                <p>43. When the uniformity of anatomical structure in different individuals of the
                    human species is considered, and the great power possessed by the human body, of
                    so adapting itself to the circumstances it is placed in, as to avoid injury from
                    changes in those circumstances, it appears natural to expect <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori,</hi> that, where the circumstances of the people are not greatly
                    different, the law of mortality will be nearly the same. And, from a comparison
                    of the best tables of mortality yet constructed, we are induced to believe that
                    this expectation will be realized, whenever a sufficient number of good
                    observations shall have been made, under circumstances sufficiently varied.</p>
                <p>44. We know of no observations that have hitherto been made and published, from
                    which the law of mortality may be correctly determined, except the
                    following:</p>
                <p>1. Those of Μ. Deparcieux in France.</p>
                <p>2. The Swedish.</p>
                <p>3. Dr. Heysham’s at Carlisle.</p>
                <p>4. Dr. Cleland’s at Glasgow.</p>
                <p>5. Mr. Finlaison’s on the nominees of life annuities granted by government in
                    this country.</p>
                <p>6. Mr. Morgan’s on the lives insured in the Equitable Assurance Society.</p>
                <p>Those of Deparcieux, Finlaison and Morgan, were made only on select classes of
                    the people; the Swedish are incomparably the most numerous and extensive; and
                    whilst Dr. Cleland’s exhibit the mortality in a large manufacturing town, Dr.
                    Heysham’s will, we believe, be found to be best authenticated, and most
                    correct.</p>
                <p>45. The climate of Sweden is so unfavourable to the products of agriculture, and
                    the number of the people is so great in proportion to the quantity of food
                    produced, that unfavourable seasons there, are generally followed by distressing
                    dearths, and the destructive epidemical diseases constantly attendant upon
                    famine, which raise the mortality, when they occur, much above what it would
                    otherwise be; and both in that way, and by weakening the constitutions of those
                    who survive them, they materially increase the average mortality deduced from
                    observations made during any considerable number of years. Of this the reader
                    will find ample proofs drawn from authentic sources, in the 10th, 12th, and 13th
                    chapters of Mr. Milne’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Annuities.</hi></p>
                <p>46. For these reasons, the mortality in Sweden deduced from many years’
                    observations, will be found to be higher than in the more temperate and fruitful
                    parts of Europe. And we shall probably make the nearest approach to the general
                    law of human mortality in the temperate climates, that can be made from the
                    Swedish observations, by selecting <hi rend="italic">a</hi> period in which no
                    remarkable epidemics prevailed. Such a period was that of five years, 1801-1805;
                    during <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826385" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6385-0552"/> which,
                    according to a statement of Μ. Nicander, in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions
                    of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockholm</hi> for the year 1809, the
                    population and mortality were as stated in Table I. at the end of this
                    article.</p>
                <p>47. From these <hi rend="italic">data,</hi> the second table at the end of this
                    article has been formed. The numbers in the columns for males and females
                    separately, having been determined according to Nos. 36 and 31-35; assuming
                    that, of 20,000 children born alive, 10,219 are males, and 9,781 females, in the
                    ratio of 275,599 to 263,812.</p>
                <p>The numbers against each age in the columns for the whole population without
                    distinction of sex, are arithmetical mean proportionals between the
                    corresponding numbers in the columns for males and females separately, against
                    the same age.</p>
                <p>48. From the table last mentioned, Table III. has been deduced by No. 16,
                    exhibiting the expectation of life <hi rend="italic">at</hi> every fifth year of
                    age; or its mean duration <hi rend="italic">after</hi> that age.</p>
                <p>49∙ Vaccination commenced throughout Sweden and Finland in 1804, during which
                    year, the number vaccinated was 38,255; and, in the year following, 42,839∙</p>
                <p>The number of deaths by small-pox there, during the year</p>
                <p>1801, was 6,458</p>
                <p>1802, — 2,679</p>
                <p>1803, — 8,610 1804, — 3,764 1805, <hi rend="underline">—</hi><hi rend="underline"
                    >1,887</hi></p>
                <p>Sum, <hi rend="underline">23,398</hi></p>
                <p>Annual average number, 4,680</p>
                <p>Whilst the annual average of the ten years ending with 1803, was 6962. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Vet. Ac. Handl.</hi> 1809, and Mr. Milne’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Treatise on Annuities,</hi> art. 698.)</p>
                <p>50. Therefore if we assume that, had vaccination not been practised in the years
                    1804 and 1805, the annual average number of deaths during the five years ending
                    with that last mentioned, would have been greater by 2,282 than it actually was,
                    and that these 2,282 additional deaths would have all taken place under five
                    years of age, both assumptions will be near the truth; and it will follow that
                    the annual mortality under five years of age, which actually was but one of
                    13∙534, would have been one of 12∙629, had vaccination not been introduced. Its
                    introduction cannot have affected the first three tables above five years of
                    age; and under that age, not quite so much as has just been stated.</p>
                <p>51. Of all ages, and both sexes, there actually died annually, during these five
                    years, one of 40 ’ 901; had vaccination not been practised at all, the annual
                    average mortality would not have been so great as one of 39*759∙</p>
                <p>52. Table IV. exhibits the mean duration of life after every fifth year of age,
                    according to twelve different tables of mortality; the first six, A, B, C, D, E,
                    F, having been constructed from the requisite <hi rend="italic">data</hi> (30
                    and 38,) the last six, Μ, N, O, P, Q, R, from mortuary registers only.</p>
                <p>53. The numbers in the first column A have been taken from table III. in Mr.
                    Milne’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Annuities,</hi> and those in B from table
                    E (p. 28) in the Equitable Assurance Society’s publication.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The author of this article in reading the
                    note on the 4th and 5th pages of Mr. Arthur Morgan’s introduction to the
                    valuable work above mentioned, when that gentleman was so good as to send it to
                    him on its first publication, had noted with a pencil in the margin, that the
                    practice there stated was not quite correct; but the circumstance had long
                    passed from his recollection, when he showed in No. 40 of the present article,
                    how the law of Mortality in the Society might be determined from the large and
                    valuable table marked A; therefore, by the words “age on admission,” at the head
                    of the extreme left hand column over the age in the same horizontal line with
                    the number of lives admitted in the first division of the large column with that
                    age at its bead, he was naturally led to conclude that that was, as it ought to
                    be, the number of lives which really were insured during the observations, when
                    that was the age they had last completed. But by the note referred to, it
                    appears not to be so; on the contrary, none of the lives insured during any year
                    commencing with the first of January, are entered in these statements as having
                    come into the Society until the first day of January next following the day of
                    their actual admission. and then each is stated to be one year older than it was
                    when insured; although whatever deaths may happen amongst them before the first
                    of January next following the commencement of the insurances, are entered in the
                    statements as having taken place amongst the lives previously insured. The
                    manuscript being wanted immediately, was in the hands of the printer, 400 miles
                    from the author, before these circumstances were called to his recollection, by
                    his accidently seeing his original note on the subject; he is therefore anxious
                    to give this explanation. The principle of the method of determining the law of
                    mortality in such cases, remains just the same. But it now appears that the
                    number stated in Table A to have been admitted at any age, should have been
                    stated to be so at the next younger age; and any calculator who may choose to
                    employ himself on the subject, had better make that correction before proceeding
                    farther. The probable error arising from the fault will not be great; but it is
                    incumbent upon us to state the right method of proceeding.</p></note></p>
                <p>54. Deparcieux’s table C constructed from great numbers of accurate observations
                    on the nominees in the French Tontines, resident principally in Paris and its
                    environs, represents the duration of life too small after 60 or 65 years of age.
                    (See Mr. Milne’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Annuities,</hi> articles 867 and
                    868.)</p>
                <p>55. Column D has been taken from the 45th table in Dr. Price’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observations,</hi> E from the 5th in Mr. Milne’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annuities,</hi> and F from the 3d table in this article. All these tables
                    represent the duration of life in Sweden and Finland, after 45 or 50 years of
                    age, to be less than according to the others; and it might reasonably be
                    expected, <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> that the excessive cold in Sweden
                    would be unfavourable to the prolongation of life in old age.</p>
                <p>56. Of the less correct columns, Μ has been deduced from the 7th table in Mr.
                    Milne’s <hi rend="italic">Annuities,</hi> and N from the 42d in Dr. Price’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Observations</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but, as the Montpellier
                    and Chester tables, just referred to, give the expectations of life only for
                    males and females separately, the numbers in columns Μ and N against each age,
                    are arithmetical mean proportionals between the expectations for males and
                    females against the same ages in those tables; which, though not quite correct,
                    is fully sufficient for our present purpose.</p>
                <p>57. The number in column O against each age has been derived from that given by
                    Μ. Mallet in his table of mortality as the mean duration of life in Geneva from
                    and after that age, by subtracting one half (0∙5) from each of them; which will
                    be found to be a necessary correction.</p>
                <p>58. Column P has been derived from Lambert’s table for mankind in general,
                    already mentioned in the historical part of this article, in which he gives a
                    column headed <hi rend="italic">mean age.</hi> Thus, against the age of 20 in
                    that column, stands 54∙3, by which he means that persons who survive 20 years of
                    age, do, on an average, attain the age of 54 ’ 3 years; so that their
                    expectation of life at 20, will be 34∙3. But his numbers in that column are all
                    too great by ½, or 0∙5, as he has himself demonstrated; the last, therefore,
                    should be 33 ’ 8; and</p>

                <p>59∙ The reason assigned by Lambert for voluntarily admitting this error at each
                    age, as well as the corresponding one in the number of the living at and above
                    the same age, into his table, was, that he did not consider the data in his
                    possession enabled him to determine the duration of life within half a year of
                    the truth.</p>
                <p>60. In both these errors Μ. Lambert has been followed by J. C. Baumann, in
                    constructing the 21st, 22d, and 23d tables inserted at the end of the third
                    volume of Süssmilch’s <hi rend="italic">Göttliche Ordnung</hi> which were
                    intended to represent respectively, the law of mortality among the country
                    people in the churmark of Brandenburg, amongst the whole population of the
                    churmark, and amongst the inhabitants of London.</p>
                <p>61. The numbers in column Q were calculated by Deparcieux from Dr. Halley’s
                    table; and those in column R have been extracted from the 18th table in Dr.
                    Price’s <hi rend="italic">Observations.</hi></p>
                <p>62. Upon comparing the numbers in the first six of these columns, which are more
                    correct, with those in the last six, which are less so; it will be found, that
                    at the early periods of life, its future mean duration according to the tables
                    formed from mortuary registers alone, is less than according to those formed
                    from the requisite data; also that the difference is greater the younger the
                    lives are, and diminishes while the age increases, so as at 60 or 65 years of
                    age to be little or nothing, and to continue small, and variable both in kind
                    and magnitude, through the rest of life.</p>
                <p>63. This appears to have arisen from the number of the people having varied but
                    little during the first 35 or 40 years of the century that ended at or about the
                    middle of the term in which the observations were made; and having increased
                    considerably by procreation, during the remainder of that century; such increase
                    having been slow at first, but gradually accelerated afterwards.</p>
                <p>64. Table V. is calculated to illustrate this part of the subject. The columns A
                    and B represent the law of mortality among the whole population of Sweden and
                    Finland without distinction of sex, having been merely copied from Table II.</p>
                <p>Column C shews the proportion of 10,000 annual deaths in Sweden and Finland that
                    took place in each year of age, on an average of five years ending with 1805.
                    And the number in column D against any age, being the sum of of those in column
                    C against that and all the greater ages, would be the number who annually attain
                    to that age, if the number of the people of every age had remained stationary
                    from the year 1700 till 1806 (7).</p>
                <p>65. The table of mortality formed by the columns C and D therefore, is that which
                    Dupre de Saint Maur, Süssmilch, Lambert, Baumann, Florencourt, Muret and others,
                    for want of the mortuary registers of a whole country, endeavoured to form by
                    combining the registers of different town and country parishes.</p>
                <p>Those tables also have the same faults, which have been formed in a similar way
                    for particular towns or other comparatively small districts, from the bills of
                    mortality alone, where the population had been increasing during the century
                    preceding the commencement of the observations or statements in the bills of
                    mortality which each table was formed from, and also during the period of the
                    observations.</p>
                <p>66. But it has been ascertained by repeated enumerations of the people in Sweden
                    and Finland, that the hypothesis of their number having remained stationary for
                    the last 100 years or more, is far from the truth. And by i comparing columns A
                    and B with C and D, it will be seen I in what manner, and to what degree, the
                    falsity of the hypothesis in this case, has vitiated the table derived from
                    it.</p>
                <p>67. To facilitate this comparison, columns E and F have been added. Taking the
                    age of five years for an example;</p>
                <p>! the numbers against that age in columns C and D show, that, according to the
                    hypothesis, out of 5988 children who annually enter upon their 6th year, 144 die
                    in it; while it appears by columns A and B, that out of 7096 children who enter
                    upon that year of their age, only 112 die in it: and 112: 7096 :: 144: 9123, so
                    that 9123, inserted against the age of five years in column E, is the number of
                    children annually entering upon their 6th year, out of whom 144 <hi
                    rend="italic">really</hi> die in the same year of their age; and the mortality
                    as represented by the hypothetical table in this case, is to the true mortality,
                    as 9123 to 5988, or as 3 to 2 nearly.</p>
                <p>Then the number in column F against any age, is always the excess of that in E
                    above that in column D against the same age.</p>
                <p>68. Columns B and C both containing 10,000 deaths, it will be seen that in column
                    C, they are greatly accumulated at the early ages, in comparison with those in
                    column B; and that in old age, the deaths in column C are much less numerous
                    than in B; which are necessary consequences of the people increasing by
                    procreation; the numbers of the people in a progressive population, in
                    comparison with a stationary one, being greater in early life, and less in old
                    age. And, while the law of mortality remains the same, the numbers of deaths at
                    the different ages, must necessarily be distributed in a similar manner.</p>
                <p>69∙ This enables us to see clearly how the principal differences have arisen
                    between the correct and incorrect tables of mortality AB and CD; whilst the
                    number of annual deaths at all ages (10,000) is the same in both, the
                    proportions of that number are necessarily in column C of the increasing
                    population greater, and the deaths are more densely distributed at the early
                    ages, and less so at the advanced ones than in column B of the population which
                    has consisted of the same number of persons of every age, and has produced the
                    same number of annual births and of annual deaths at every age for 100 years
                    past. The increasing population is necessarily attended with a corresponding
                    increase of the annual births and of young persons; while the elderly persons
                    are only those left by the law of mortality out of the corresponding small
                    numbers that were born annually, 50, 60, 70, or 100 years back. And as columns A
                    and B represent the true law of mortality that prevails among the people,
                    columns C and D cannot do so, although constructed from observations on the same
                    people; for in an increasing population it is not true that the sum of the
                    deaths happening annually above a given age will be the same as the number of
                    persons annually arriving at or completing that age; it always falls short of
                    it, and the more so as the given age is younger, there being deficiencies at all
                    ages above that.</p>
                <p>Columns E and F show what the errors of the hypothetical table are at the
                    different ages, and they are of a similar kind in all tables similarly
                    constructed from records of the number of deaths at the different periods of
                    life in an increasing population; and such are probably 99 out of 100 of those
                    hitherto published; many of them for people increasing their numbers much faster
                    than the Swedes have done, and the errors of such tables must be greater than
                    those of the table CD.</p>
                <p>70. Table VI., which needs no further explanation than is placed at the head of
                    it, will also illustrate the difference between tables of mortality formed from
                    the requisite data, and those constructed from mortuary registers only.</p>
                <p>It is better fitted for this purpose than Table IV., with which, however, it will
                    be found to correspond very well. But the 4th table has other uses which this
                    has not.</p>
                <p>71. From what has already been advanced, it would appear probable, that the
                    number of annual births in Sweden and Finland had been nearly stationary, and
                    rather decreasing than increasing, upon an average, from about 1700 till
                    1735.</p>
                <p>The numbers both of the annual births and deaths, from the year 1749 till 1803,
                    will be found in Milne’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise</hi><pb break="no"

                    Annuities,</hi> art. 698: these kind of returns to government were not made
                    before 1749, neither have we any satisfactory account of the population before
                    that period.</p>
                <p>72. But the statements in our 7th table corroborate the inferences just drawn
                    from the 5th and 6th, as they shew that during the 43 years ended with 1800, the
                    total population increased, while the proportion above 90 years of age
                    diminished through the whole term, and increased very little during the next 10
                    years.</p>
                <p>The numbers in that table include both sexes, and the long continued diminution
                    of them past 90, cannot be explained by supposing the males to have fallen in
                    battle; for the females were reduced in the same proportion, their number
                    throughout, having been to that of the males above 90 years of age, as nine to
                    five nearly.</p>
                <p>From the 7th table, therefore, it appears probable, that the annual births in the
                    years</p>
                <p>1698, 1705, 1710, and 1715, were respectively proportional to the numbers 907,
                    637, 837, and 786.</p>
                <p>The last number, 786, has been calculated upon the supposition that the
                    proportion of the population in Sweden and Finland to those in Sweden alone, was
                    the same in 1810 as in 1805.</p>
                <p>73. It should also be observed here, that the disastrous career of Charles the
                    Twelfth commenced with the eighteenth century, and terminated in 1718, when the
                    country was in such a state of exhaustion as it could not have recovered from
                    for many years; whence there appears reason to believe, that the annual births
                    during the succeeding fifteen or twenty years, did not increase fast.</p>
                <p>Cantzlaer informs us, that between the 10th of August 1710, and the month of
                    February 1711, near 30,000 persons were carried off by the plague in Stockholm
                    alone. <hi rend="italic">(Mem.</hi><hi rend="italic">du Royaume de Suède,</hi>
                    t. i. p. 29∙)</p>
                <p>74. It will be seen that the numbers in col. F of Table V., in proceeding back
                    from four years of age to birth, continually decrease, contrary to what
                    generally obtains; and as we ascribe the general increase of these numbers, when
                    taken in the retrograde order of the ages, to the annually increasing number of
                    births, so will this anomalous appearance be found to arise partly from the
                    average number of annual births having actually <hi rend="italic">decreased</hi>

                <p>But it appears to have arisen principally from the practice of vaccination during
                    the years 1804 and 1805, by which the mortality among children, or the numbers
                    in col. C, in a few of the first years from birth, were reduced below what they
                    otherwise would have been (50) while those in col. D remained nearly the same
                    (64); consequently, the numbers in col. E were reduced in nearly the same ratio
                    as those in C (67), and the reduction in col. F. was in each case nearly the
                    same as in E (61).</p>
                <p>75. The numbers relating to Sweden and Finland in the 7th table, have been
                    derived from the Stockholm <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> for the years
                    1766, 1801, 1809, and 1813.</p>
                <p>Those relating to Spain and the Spanish possessions in Europe and Africa,
                    including the Canary Islands, from the <hi rend="italic">Censo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de la Poblacion de Espana</hi><hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">el ano</hi> de 1797, mentioned in the first section of this
                    article. These last have been included in this Table, to show the difference in
                    the proportion of aged persons between Spain and Sweden, and still more between
                    the Canary Islands and both.</p>
                <p>76. If the population of Spain had remained invariable from 1697 to 1797, the law
                    of mortality there, might have been easily derived from the statements above
                    mentioned of the enumeration in 1797; but in the actual state of things, that
                    cannot be determined without comparing these with exact accounts of the numbers
                    that died annually in each interval of age. And, as was observed in the first
                    section of this article, the author has obtained satisfactory information that
                    no such returns from the parish registers throughout Spain, as are there
                    mentioned, ever were published, nor is it probable they were ever made.</p>
                <p>77. When what we have advanced respecting the 5th and 6th tables is clearly
                    understood, it will not be difficult to account for the greater part of the
                    difference between the more and less correct columns in Table IV.</p>
                <p>Most of the observations which the German tables were constructed from, were made
                    between the years 1720 and 1750; and those who died then between 60 and 100
                    years of age, must have been born between 1620 and 1690; in which period nearly
                    the whole of the thirty years’ war, ended in 1648, was included, during which,
                    and for several years after, it is probable that the annual births increased
                    little or nothing, if they did not decrease.</p>
                <p>78. Amongst the less correct columns of Table IV., those for Montpellier,
                    Chester, and Geneva, agree much better than the rest with the more correct ones,
                    which has probably arisen in each case, partly from the mortality in these three
                    places having really been less throughout life than in most large towns; and
                    partly from the annual births in them, having increased less than in the other
                    places, during the fifty or sixty years preceding the period in which the
                    observations the tables were constructed from were made.</p>
                <p>79∙ The Northampton table was constructed by Dr. Price, from the bills of
                    mortality (from the year 1735 to 1780) of the single parish of All Saints,
                    containing a little more than half the inhabitants of the town; and as the
                    deaths exceeded the births in number, the Doctor applied a correction to the
                    table under twenty years of age, which, if it had answered the intended purpose
                    under that age, as we are satisfied it did not, could have no effect on any of
                    the numbers above the same age; and almost all of the useful applications of
                    such tables, are to ages above twenty.</p>
                <p>80. The table so formed could only be correct, provided that the numbers, both of
                    the living and the annual deaths at every age above twenty years, had continued
                    invariable during the 146 years that intervened between 1634 and 1780; provided
                    also, that no migration from or to the town took place, except at twenty years
                    of age, and that the annual increase the population received by migration at
                    that age, was just equal to the excess of the annual deaths above the annual
                    births.</p>
                <p>81. But we consider it to be much more probable, that during these 146 years,
                    Northampton partook of the prosperity and adversity that prevailed in the rest
                    of the kingdom; and, consequently, that its population was generally
                    progressive, though sometimes stationary, and sometimes retrograde.</p>
                <p>82. We have not room here to support this opinion by numerical statements and
                    calculations, but from the population abstracts, and an enumeration of the
                    inhabitants of Northampton, given in Dr. Price’s <hi rend="italic">Observations
                    on Reversionary Payments,</hi> (vol. ii. p. 94,) it wall be found, that both the
                    annual births, and annual settlers in that town, have been increasing ever since
                    about the year 1715 or 1720; also, that although the burials exceeded the
                    baptisms till the year 1802, the supply by migration was much greater than that
                    excess; and, consequently, that the numbers of the living have been accumulated
                    more at the early ages, and less at the advanced ones, than they would have been
                    had the population remained stationary.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826424" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6424-0555"/>
                <p>83. Thus it appears, that the faults in the Northampton table are of the same
                    kind as those of the others constructed from mortuary registers only. And the
                    civil war in the time of Charles the First, with the unsettled state of the
                    kingdom for some years before and after it, would probably have prevented or
                    greatly retarded, the increase of the annual births, during the time in which
                    those persons were born, who died past sixty years of age between the years 1734
                    and 1781, and may account for the table after that age being near the truth;
                    while the comparatively rapid increase of the people during the sixty years
                    ending with 1780, appears to explain the great excess of mortality in that table
                    at the early periods of life.</p>
                <p>84. As it was only from the Carlisle and ^ Northampton tables of mortality, that
                    tables of the values of annuities on single andjointliveshad been calculated,
                    sufficiently copious to admit of the values of interests dependent upon the
                    continuance or the failure of human life being accurately derived from them.
                    When the first edition of this article was published in the year 1820, the
                    author gave the following comparison between the mortality represented by each
                    of these tables to take place at the different periods of life, with that which
                    had been observed to obtain among the members of the Equitable Assurance
                    Society.</p>
                <p>85. From an address delivered at a general court of that Society, by Mr. Morgan
                    the actuary, on the 24th of April 1800, it appears, that according to the result
                    of an annual experience of thirty years, the decrements of life (22) among the
                    members of the society, were to those in the Northampton table,</p>
                <p>Between the ages of 10 and 20 as 1 to 2.</p>
                <p>20 — 30 — 1 —2.</p>
                <p>30 — 40 ’ — 3 — 5.</p>
                <p>40 — 50 _ 3 — 5.</p>
                <p>50 — 60 —5 — 7.</p>
                <p>60 — 80 — 4 — 5.</p>
                <p>The same information may also be found in two notes in Dr. Price’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Observations on Reversionary Payments,</hi> (vol. i. p. 183, and
                    vol. ii. p. 443.)</p>
                <p>86. From the preceding statement, the Carlisle table of mortality, (No. II. in

                <p>87. This table shows that the law of mortality exhibited in the Carlisle table is
                    almost exactly the same as that which has prevailed among the members of the
                    Equitable Assurance Society. And although the members of such a society, when
                    they first enter, are select lives, they are not, even then, so much better than
                    the common average, as many persons suppose; for the more precarious a life is,
                    the stronger is the inducement for parties interested in its continuance, to get
                    it insured, so that bad risks are frequently offered to such companies. And many
                    proposals for insurance are accepted by the directors, that are not thought very
                    eligible at the time, in cases where they are not aware of any specific
                    objection to the life proposed.</p>
                <p>88. Besides, it is to be considered, that of the number in a society at any one
                    time, but a small proportion can have been recently admitted, and in a few years
                    from the time of admission, the members will generally have come down to the
                    common average of persons of the same ages.</p>
                <p>89. It ought also to be observed, that most of the tables of mortality that have
                    been published, have been constructed from observations made upon the whole
                    population of very large towns, such as London, Paris, Vienna, and Stockholm; in
                    each of which there are particular quarters inhabited only by the very lowest of
                    the people, who, unfortunately, are also very numerous, badly clothed and fed,
                    therefore exposed to serious injury from the inclemencies of the weather;
                    extremely ignorant and vicious, indulging in the abuse of spirituous liquors,
                    and inattentive to cleanliness both in their persons and habitations, which
                    lastare crowded, badly ventilated, and surrounded with mud and the putrid
                    remains of animals and vegetables. These are the nests of contagious diseases,
                    in which they are generated and kept alive, where they at all times occasion
                    greatmortality, though not so much within the last forty-five or fifty-five
                    years as previously, and from which, when circumstances favour them, they spread
                    amongst the rest of the people.</p>
                <p>90. It is, therefore, obvious, that in such places, the average mortality at
                    every age, must be considerably greater than that which prevails only among the
                    middling and higher classes of society, even in such towns.</p>
                <p>91. But the lives upon which leases, annuities, reversions, and assurances
                    depend, are very seldom exposed to the influence of the causes of mortality
                    mentioned in number 89∙ Whence it follows, that a table of mortality on which
                    those causes have had no great influence, is best adapted to the valuation of
                    such interests.</p>
                <p>And these kind of valuations are the most important purposes to which tables of
                    mortality can be applied.</p>
                <p>92. The number of years in <hi rend="italic">the mean duration of life from
                    birth</hi> according to a table of mortality properly constructed from the
                    necessary data, will, when the population has remained stationary for a century
                    or more, be the same as the number of persons in the whole population, out of
                    which one dies annually (20). When the population has been increasing, the mean
                    duration of life, according to the table, will be less than the number out of
                    which one dies annually in that population; but the difference will be small,
                    except under particular circumstances, as appears by the following
                    statement.</p>

                <p>93. The above mentioned table of mortality for Glasgow, which the author has had
                    by him several years, he expects to publish soon.</p>
                <p>The high number in the column of differences for females in that place, arises
                    from the small mortality amongst them, which was occasioned principally by the
                    great influx of healthy females between the ages of 15 and 30, at which period
                    of life the rate of mortality amongst them was small; its <hi rend="italic"
                    >minimum</hi> for them being in their 18th year.</p>
                <p>Between the ages of 10 and 15 the numbers of the two sexes were just about equal,
                    whilst between the ages of 15 and 30 the females were more numerous than the
                    males in the ratio of 3 to 2; and this accounts for the great number of females
                    (42∙32), out of which one died annually there, which necessarily raises the
                    number out of which one died annually in the whole population of both sexes, and
                    therefore the number in the column of differences (in the line numbered 10) for
                    the whole population of both sexes in Glasgow.</p>
                <p>94. Similar causes probably produced similar effects, although in a much less
                    degree in Stockholm.</p>
                <p>95. When tables of mortality are constructed from the numbers of deaths only in
                    the different intervals of age, without comparing them with the numbers of
                    living persons in the same intervals; such as that formed by columns C and D of
                    Table V. at the end of this article, and the population is increasing. The
                    number ofyears in the mean duration of life from birth, according to that table,
                    will fall short of the number of the people, out of which one dies annually,by a
                    much greater number than in the case we have just been considering, of the table
                    of mortality having been properly constructed from the necessary data: as the
                    following statement willshow.</p>

                <p>96. In both of the above statements, where the sexes are not mentioned, the table
                    is for both without distinction.</p>
                <p>97∙ In places where the increase of the population was slow, the numbers set
                    against them in the column of differences are smaller than where the population
                    increased more rapidly.</p>
                <p>98. In thetablesof mortality for Belgium and Montpellier, the sexes were
                    distinguished, but not in the given number of the whole population, as well as
                    the whole number of deaths in each of those places, and for that reason the
                    sexes could not be distinguished for those two places in this last table.</p>
                <p>99- When what we have shewn here is clearly understood, and the proportion of the
                    people dying annually is known, it will not be difficult to judge whether a
                    table of mortality for that people has been constructed properly from the
                    necessary data; or, what is much more common, and more easily effected, merely
                    by summation of the deaths at all ages. For in the case of the correct table of
                    mortality, the difference obtained in the manner stated above, will probably not
                    exceed 2; nor in the case of the incorrect table, will it be likely to be less
                    than 7, upon the supposition of the population having increased generally for a
                    considerable number of years preceding the termination of the observations; if
                    for a whole century, so much the better.</p>

                <p>100. The probable life at birth, or the age to which half the number born attain,
                    will also be a good criterion for enabling us to judge, by comparison, whether a
                    table of mortality has been correctly constructed from the necessary data or
                    not; provided that, in the places the compared tables have been constructed
                    from, the children have been similarly circumstanced, or nearly so.</p>

                <p>In Belgium vaccination was practised during the whole period of the observations,

                <p>101. From all that has now been stated, we are entitled to conclude, that the
                    Belgian table of mortality has been constructed either from the registers of
                    burials alone, or only from the statements of the numbers living in the
                    different intervals of age at the time of the enumeration; most probably from
                    the burials alone. Μ. Quetelet appears now to be aware that such tables are very

                <p>102. Reasoning as in Nos. 68 and 69, it will be seen that when the number of the
                    people has been decreasing for a series of years, the deaths will be more
                    densely distributed among the advanced ages, and more rarely in the early
                    periods of life, than if the number of the people at every age, and the law of
                    mortality had remained always the same. Consequently, in the table of mortality
                    constructed from such data, merely by taking the successive sums, in retrograde
                    order, from extreme old age to birth; those successive sums, which are the
                    numbers of the living at the different ages in the table so constructed, will be
                    greater at advanced ages and less in early life than if the population had
                    remained stationary, as stated above. So that the errors of the incorrect table
                    would, in this case, be of the opposite kind to those of the common tables,
                    constructed in á similar way from the deaths only, in an increasing population.
                    From the general increase of arts, manufactures, commerce, and civilization,
                    ever since tables of mortality were first formed, the population has been
                    increasing more or less rapidly in almost every place, for which a table of
                    mortality has been constructed. But in Amsterdam we have an instance of the
                    population having continued to decrease for half a century or more. We here
                    present a view of it since the year 1622.</p>

                    Kersseboom took much pains in endeavouring to make just estimates of the
                    population from the annual births and deaths; and taking it to be 35 times the
                    number of annual births, he estimated the population of Amsterdam in 1742 at
                    241,000 persons.</p>
                <p>Three only of the six numbers stated above, viz. those for the years 1622, 1826,
                    and 1830, were determined by actual enumerations at the times stated. Although
                    Μ. Smits, the secretary of the Statistical Commission, relative to the
                    population of the Netherlands, is not mentioned in the above table, we are
                    greatly indebted to him. In his <hi rend="italic">Statistique Nationale</hi> he
                    gave a table, (No. 10, p. 82), shewing the number of deaths that took place in
                    Amsterdam in each year of the 18th century. Μ. Lobatto has given them in the
                    place above referred to for each of the ten years 1816-1825; and Μ. Quetelet, in
                    the part of his work referred to above, has given them for each of the 17 years,
                    1816-1832, and states that in the year 1777 the mortality was 1 in 27; the
                    number of deaths in that year was 8939, whence the population inserted in the
                    table is derived. Μ. Lobatto states, on the authority of Professor Van Swinden
                    and of Μ. Nieuwenhuys, that from 1774 to 1813 there died annually 1 of 26; the
                    deaths in 27 years, 1774- 1800, were 233,510, the annual average number,
                    therefore, was 8648∙5, and multiplying this by 26, we obtain 224,862, the mean
                    number of the people during these 27 years, which is stated in the above table
                    to have been the population in 1787, the middle year of the 27.</p>
                <p>104. The enumeration in 1622 was made in levying a capitation tax, which was
                    exacted with great strictness, even in every receptacle for paupers, the master
                    or owner of it was obliged to pay the tax for each inmate. This enumeration
                    appears not to have been known of, either by Kersseboom or by Struyck at the
                    time of his first publication on the subject; but an original paper, with many
                    particulars which he gives, was afterwards communicated to him. Struyck, after
                    taking great pains with the subject, stated his opinion, that in 1753, Amsterdam
                    did not contain 200,000 inhabitants.</p>

                <p>106. This low mortality of one in 29∙22 was obtained by Μ. Lobatto stopping at
                    the year 1825, which he himself states was on account of the mortality having
                    been high in the two following years, 1826 and 1827. He obtained the annual
                    mortality of 1 in 29, by dividing the number of the people in 1826, the year
                    after the end of the term, by the annual average number of deaths during the
                    term. During the 12 years 1821-32, of which 1826 was the middle one, the annual
                    average number of deaths was 7,336∙18, and there died annually, on an average,
                    one of 27’369; the <hi rend="italic">dif</hi><hi rend="italic">ference</hi> in
