                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">MODENA</label>, an independent sovereign state in the north
                    of Italy, the chief of which bears the title of his Royal Highness the Duke of
                    Modena, Reggio, Mirandola, Massa, and Carrara, and is descended from a branch of
                    the Austrian family. This sovereign is descended from the house of Este, one of
                    the most ancient families in Europe. A member of that house, then settled in
                    Lombardy, became Marquis of Modena, in 960; and his successor, in 1097, obtained
                    the sole power over Milan and Genoa, under the name of Azzo II. He was the
                    founder of that family, one branch of which having settled in Bavaria, and
                    afterwards becoming possessed of Brunswick, in Germany, gave origin to that race
                    of monarchs of which five in succession have filled the throne of Great Britain.
                    During the civil wars which ragedin Italy in the course of the thirteenth
                    century, when so many small republics were formed, the territories of Ferrara,
                    Modena, and Reggio, chose the then Marquis of Este, Obizzo III. who had attained
                    great respect as a warrior, for their supreme lord. One of his successors, Borso
                    d’Este, was, in 1452, raised to the dignity of Duke of Modena and Reggio by the
                    Emperor Frederick 111., Alfonzo II. having no legitimate male issue, obtained
                    from the Emperor Rudolph II. permission to nominate as successor a son of his
                    uncle by a doubtful or left-handed marriage, who had gained the sovereignty
                    under the name of Caesar d Este, and from whom are descended the present
                    reigning race. These have since gained from the popes some additional territory,
                    and also a portion from the emperors originally granted as feudal tenures, but
                    successively affirmed as permanent sovereignty. The last acquisition was’
                    Carrara, gained by the marriage of the duke with the heiress of the duchies of
                    Massa and Carrara in 1741. The issue of this marriage was only a daughter, who
                    married the Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, the brother of Joseph II. and of
                    Leopold II. whose son succeeded to the dominions.</p>
                <p>In 1796, the French expelled the duke, and his territory was formed into a
                    province of the ephemeral Cisalpine republic; and, by the peace of Campo Formio,
                    the duke was to receive an indemnification in Suabia. It then became a part of
                    Bonaparte’s kingdom of Italy; but after his fall, it was, by the congress of
                    Vienna in 1814, restored to the ancient family which had before possessed
                    it.</p>
                <p>This state extends in north latitude from 43. 56. 10. to 44. 57. 30. and in east
                    longitude from 10. 20. 25. to 11. 17. 2. It is bounded on the north by the
                    Austrian kingdom of Lombardy and by Guastalla, on the east by the papal
                    dominions, on the south-east by Tuscany, on the south by Lucca, on the
                    south-west by Tuscany, and on the west by Parma. It extends over 2140 square
                    miles, and contains at present 395,000 inhabitants, being one of the most
                    densely-peopled districts in Europe. The Apennine Mountains form a part of the
                    southern division of the territory, and the rest is generally a level plain,
                    very gradually declining towards the north, and watered by several small streams
                    which finally unite in the river Secchia, and empty themselves into the Po.
                    There are numerous canals, formed chiefly for the purpose of irrigation. The
                    soil is generally fertile. The system of cultivation so nearly resembles that
                    already fully described in this work under the head of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Lombardy,</hi> that the reader is referred to that article. We have only to
                    remark here, that the olive trees are much more numerous than in Lombardy, and
                    that the oil expressed from their fruit is much esteemed, and forms an article
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the export trade.</p>
                <p>The chief product is silk, some of which is organized before being exported, but
                    most of it is sent to foreign markets in the raw state: a small portion only of
                    it is manufactured into finished goods within the territory. The other fabrics
                    are of hemp and flax, and only for domestic consumption. The country is divided
                    into six ecclesiastical dioceses, each with a bishop, and in the capital an
                    archbishop; and the whole of the inhabitants adhere to the Roman Catholic
                    church, with the exception of about 1200 Jews, who reside chiefly in and around
                    the capital. It contains ten cities, sixty-three market-towns, forty-nine
                    communes, and 463 villages. The larger cities and their population are, Modena
                    with 27,000 inhabitants, Reggio with 18,000, Massa with 7000, and Carrara with
                    4000; the others, though they were once walled, are now inconsiderable. The
                    annual revenue of the whole state amounts to about L.150,000, the chief part
                    being derived from patrimonial estates; and besides that, the duke enjoys the
                    valuable property of the ancient house of Obizzi, near to Treviso in Austrian
                    Lombardy, which is said to produce him annually L.20,000. The expenditure of the
                    state is nearly equal to the annual income; and the whole debt does not quite
                    amount to the revenue of half a year. The duke maintains an armed force, which,
                    including 100 cavalry and his guards, amounts to about 1800 men.</p>
                <p>The capital city, of the same name, is in north latitude 44. 34. and in east
                    longitude 11. 7. 25. It is situated on the banks of a canal, by which it is
                    connected with the rivers Secchia and Panaro, and is surrounded with walls <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193823291" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3291-0314"/> and defended by
                    bastions; but it is not deemed capable of much defence, more especially as the
                    citadel is very weak. It is a well-built city, with a broad street, the Corso,
                    running from one gate to the opposite one. The houses are handsome, and mostly
                    furnished with piazzas on the ground floor. The most distinguished building is
                    the ducal palace. It is surrounded with a garden, which is used as a place of
                    recreation for the inhabitants. It is built of marble, contains a library of
                    80,000 volumes, and many antiquities; but the collection of paintings, which was
                    formerly the chief attraction, has been transferred by sale to Dresden. The
                    cathedral, the theatre, the opera-house, and the barracks, are the other most
                    remarkable edifices in the city. There are within the city no less than fifty
                    churches, of which twenty-six formerly belonged to religious houses. Of late the
                    duke has restored the Jesuits, and the order is more flourishing here than in
                    any of the other cities of Italy. There is a university with seven professors, a
                    gymnasium, a scientific society, an academy for nobles, and a veterinary
                    college. But there is little trade of any kind, and the inhabitants chiefly
                    depend on the expenditure of the court for their subsistence.</p>
