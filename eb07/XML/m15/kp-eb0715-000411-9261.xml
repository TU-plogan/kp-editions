                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">MICHEL ANGELO BUONAROTTI</label>, the greatest master of the
                    arts of design who has appeared since the days of Phidias, was born in the
                    castle of Caprese, in Tuscany, on the 6th of March 1474. His father, Ludovicodi
                    Leonardo Buonarotti Simone, was a descendant of the noble and illustrious family
                    of the counts of Canossa, and allied to the imperial blood. This circumstance
                    had nearly occasioned the world the loss of the great artist; for when the
                    strong bias of his mind became apparent, which occurred at a very early age, his
                    father and uncles discouraged his pursuits, and treated him with harshness,
                    conceiving that their family would be de <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819274"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-9274-0005"/>graded should a scion of their race adopt the
                    profession of artist. But objection, prejudice, and even persecution, proved
                    useless when opposed to devoted attachment and irresistible genius. Michel
                    Angelo received the rudime*nts of his education at Florence, the nursing-mother
                    of the arts, and here he enjoyed ample facilities of gratifying his taste for
                    drawing. Ludovicofinding it hopeless to attempt to frustrate the intentions of
                    nature, yielded at last to the advice of friends, and the wishes of his son, who
                    was accordingly placed under Domenico Ghirlandaio, a distinguished professor of
                    the arts of painting and design. The youth was articled to serve three years;
                    but, contrary to custom, instead of paying, he received a premium, an
                    indubitable proof of his great merits, even at the age of fourteen. The original
                    document by which he was engaged bears date April 1488. His earliest effort in
                    oils showed that he was born to grapple with difficulties from which other men
                    shrink, whilst his success proved that he was also destined to overcome them.
                    The subject was St Antony beaten by devils. In this little picture, besides the
                    figure of the saint, there were crowded wild and grotesque forms and monsters,
                    to which he was so intent upon giving an aspect of reality, that he painted no
                    part without referring to some natural object. But painting did not engross the
                    whole of his time and attention. The great patron of the arts at this period was
                    Lorenzo de’ Medici, who, for the purpose of elevating sculpture to a level with
                    painting, opened a garden in Florence, which he amply supplied with antique
                    statues, bas-reliefs, busts, and the like. Thither the youth of the city
                    repaired to study the classic creations of antiquity; and it is scarcely
                    necessary to say that it became the favourite haunt of Michel Angelo.</p>
                <p>From copying the drawings and paintings of others, his attention was turned to
                    the modelling of figures in clay, in imitation of the monuments of ancient art;
                    and the transition from this, the initiatory step in sculpture, to the
                    mouldingofthe marble into symmetrical forms, was natural, and speedily withdrew
                    his mind from every other study. The vigilant and practised eye of Lorenzo soon
                    discovered the genius of the youthful sculptor in the execution of a mask
                    representing a laughing faun. His father was sent for, and requested to resign
                    Michel to the care of the family; and this being complied with, apartments were
                    allotted to him in the ducal palace. Here he received every indulgence and
                    attention, being treated with parental affection, and allowed to pursue the bent
                    of his genius, not only without interruption, but cheered and encouraged by the
                    cordial approbation of his munificent patron. Amongst the works which he
                    executed under these favourable auspices, was a bas-relief representing the
                    battle of the Centaurs; on viewing which at a future period of bis life, he
                    lamented that he had not confined himself to a branch of art therein he had so
                    soon attained such excellence. This is the strongest evidence which could be
                    produced of the rare merits of the sculpture; for artists almost uniformly speak
                    disparagingly of their early efforts.</p>
                <p>On the death of Lorenzo, which happened about two years after he had entered his
                    service, Michel Angelo, with a heavy heart, returned ’ to the paternal mansion.
                    Nothing belonging to Lorenzo was inherited by his son Piero, except the
                    territorial possessions of the family; and although the young artist continued
                    to pursue his studies with unabated zeal, little patronage or encouragement was
                    to be expected or obtained from a frivolous debauchee. The pusillanimity of this
                    person soon distracted the councils of Florence; and Michel, to escape the storm
                    which he saw impending over that city, retired to Bologna, but returned in about
                    a year afterwards, when tranquillity had been restored. About this period there
                    prevailed a sort of mania for the antique. Whilst the discoveries of antiquity
                    created a new era in art and literature, the importance of which can never be
                    too highly estimated, many ignorant individuals, smitten with the enthusiasm of
                    the time, betrayed their want of judgment by the indiscriminate manner in which
                    they lavished their praise on these remains; and Michel Angelo resolved to take
                    advantage of the popular excitement. , He executed a Sleeping Cupid; and having
                    stained the marble in such a way as to give it the appearance of a genuine
                    antique, it was transmitted to a proper person in Rome, who, after burying it in
                    his vineyard, dug it up, and then reported the discovery. The pardonable trick
                    completely" succeeded for a time, and the statue was bought by a cardinal for a
                    considerable sum; but of this Michel Angelo received only a small portion. Such
                    deceptions, however, seldom remain long concealed; the officious zeal of
                    friends, or the vanity of authorship, usually brings about the exposure of a
                    successful imposition. After the mask was laid aside, and the real artist became
                    known, he received a flattering invitation to visit Rome. Thither he accordingly
                    repaired, and whilst there he executed a statue of Bacchus, another of a Cupid,
                    and a group of the Virgin with a dead Christ reclining on her knees, together
                    with a cartoon representing St Francis receiving the <hi rend="italic"
                    >stigmata.</hi></p>
                <p>The celebrated gonfaloniere, Pietro Soderini, well known as a patron of genius,
                    having been elected to guard the peace and protect the liberties of Florence,
                    Michel Angelo returned to that cify. With the sanction of the new chief
                    magistrate, he was allowed to appropriate to his use a huge block of marble,
                    which had for many years lain neglected in Florence; and out of this he executed
                    a gigantic statue of David, which gave great satisfaction. He also cast a figure
                    in bronze, of the size of nature, and a group of David and Goliath; but, that
                    his hand might not “lose its cunning” in the sister art, he painted a Holy
                    Family. This picture is preserved in the Florence gallery; and it is the only
                    painting in oil by Michel Angelo now remaining, the authenticity of which is not
                    disputed. Having been commissioned to ornament the hall of the ducal palace with
                    a cartoon, he chose for the subject an event connected with the war between the
                    Florentines and Pisans. The work represents the Florentine soldiers, who,
                    alarmed by an unexpected assault whilst bathing in the Arno, are getting out of
                    the water with the utmost expedition, and preparing for action; and, although
                    only outlined in charcoal, chalk, and the like, it was considered as the most
                    extraordinary production which had appeared since the revival of the arts in
                    Italy. In the mean time Julius II. having been raised to the pontifical throne,
                    Michel Angelo was invited to the Vatican, whither he repaired without finishing
                    the cartoon; but being disgusted with Rome, he returned to Florence, and
                    completed the design. The painting of the picture itself, however, was never
                    begun. Political events, and a second invitation from Julius II. again attracted
                    him to the Eternal City, and he was employed by his holiness to construct a
                    magnificent mausoleum, which, although immediately’ commenced, was interrupted
                    during its progress, first on account of a misunderstanding between the artist
                    and the pope, and afterwards from other causes. The artist repaired to Bologna,
                    and political events having brought the pope to this city, a reconciliation took
                    place. In a few days Julius II. ordered a colossal statue of himself to be
                    executed in bronze, which Michel Angelo finished in sixteen months, and returned
                    to Rome at the end of June 1508. He was, however, disappointed in his hopes of
                    being allowed to proceed with his great architectural undertaking; for the pope
                    had changed his mind, it is alleged through the jealousy of Bramante, and the
                    artist was requested to decorate with pictures the ceiling and walls of the
                    Sistine Chapel. But his primary disappointment was forgotten in his subsequent
                    triumph. This stupendous work of genius excited the highest admiration, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193819287" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9287-0006"/> which
                    contemporary opinion and the judgment of after ages have confirmed; yet, from
                    its commencement till its conclusion, only eighteen or twenty months
                    elapsed.</p>
                <p>After the death of Julius II. in 1513, the papal throne was filled by Leo X.,
                    whose magnificent reign forms an era in the intellectual history of modern
                    times. Yet, strange as the fact may appear, the life of Michel Angelo during his
                    pontificate is nearly an entire blank. He was employed ^extracting marble from a
                    quarry which was wrought with difficulty, and in constructing a road over
                    intricate swamps and through mountainous ridges, for the purpose of conveying it
                    to the sea. Leo X. died in 1521, and under his successor Adrian VI., Michel
                    Angelo employed himself upon the monument of Julius. The reign of Adrian was
                    short, and on his death Clement VII. was raised to the papal throne. The
                    confusion with which the civil affairs of Rome were soon overwhelmed, drove the
                    artist to Florence, where he continued his architectural and other works for the
                    chapel and library of S. Lorenzo, and executed a statue of Christ. His talents
                    as an engineer were likewise put in requisition for the defence of the city.
                    Before commencing the works, he visited Ferrara, then the best fortified town in
                    Italy, and was received with the utmost courtesy by the Duke Alphonso, who
                    showed him every part of the works, and ∙at the same time requested a specimen
                    of the artist’s abilities either in sculpture or in painting. A picture of
                    Jupiter and Lêda was the result; but this great production is generally supposed
                    to have been lost. Michel Angelo was enabled to complete the fortifications of
                    Florence before the siege of the city commenced; and, as in the case of
                    Syracuse, the genius of one individual for a considerable time proved more than
                    a match for thousands of armed men and the mightiest engines of war. By
                    treachery the city passed into the hands of the enemy; but the great artist,
                    although he had shown the dexterity of Archimedes in frustrating the designs of
                    the besiegers, did not share the fate of the great geometrician. The finishing
                    of two monuments for the Medici family was the price of his liberty.</p>
                <p>Tranquillity being restored to Italy, Buonarotti returned to Rome; and although
                    frequently interrupted, both by Clement VII. and by his successor Paul III., he
                    at last completed the monument to Julius II. It consists of seven statues,
                    amongst which is the celebrated one of Moses, a production evincing, in a higher
                    degree than any of his other sculptures, that character of majesty and sublimity
                    which more or less pervades them all. His next work was the painting of the Last
                    Judgment in the Sistine Chapel, which was finished in 1541; and so great was the
                    admiration excited by this mighty effort of genius, that many persons came from
                    distant parts of Italy to see it. He subsequently painted the martyrdom of St
                    Peter and the conversion of St Paul, which cost him great fatigue, as age was
                    beginning to impair his physical energies. But that his intellectual powers
                    still retained their pristine vigour, the church of St Peter’s, the most
                    splendid monument of his genius and success as an architect, affords ample
                    evidence. This fabric was begun by Julius II. in 1506, and, being successively
                    intrusted to Bramante and Antonio de San Gallo, by this transference from hand
                    to hand it was in danger of becoming a huge incongruity. On the death of the
                    last-named architect in 1546, Michel Angelo was appointed architect; and,
                    notwithstanding the jarring and complexity of the original designs, he succeeded
                    in simplifying and harmonizing the whole. The work proceeded for a time with
                    considerable rapidity. But he was occasionally withdrawn from it to other
                    things, such as the building of bridges, the superintendence of which might have
                    been safely intrusted to some inferior person. During the latter years of his
                    life the papal chair was filled by several pontiffs, some of whom forwarded, and
                    others retarded, his great undertaking, employing him in the construction of
                    chapels and other buildings. Nor did he live to witness the completion of this
                    splendid edifice, the greatest and most magnificent Christian temple on earth.
                    He was carried off by a slow fever on the 17th of February 1563. His obsequies
                    were celebrated as became the memory of so unrivalled a genius. Michel Angelo
                    was of the middle stature, bony in his make, and rather spare, but broad over
                    the shoulders. His complexion was good; his forehead was square, and somewhat
                    projecting; his eyes were of a hazel colour, but rather small; and the general
                    effect of his countenance was impaired by a blow which he had received in
                    youth.</p>
                <p>The character of Michel Angelo as an artist has already been delineated in this
                    work by a masterly hand (see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Arts, Fine).</hi>
                    Grandeur of conception is the quality which distinguishes his works from those
                    of all other artists who have appeared in modern times. Whether he excelled most
                    in painting, in sculpture, or in architecture, it would not be easy to
                    determine. He has left the noblest specimens of human genius in each department
                    of art. He is the Milton of artists. Things beyom½ the visible diurnal sphere
                    were within the range of his imagination; and when he stoops to earth, he
                    invests nature with an ideal grandeur and majesty. His boys are men, his men are
                    a race of giants; his demons are the evil spirits of Dante and Milton made
                    visible: and his angels are the offspring of the sky. The Sistine Chapel is
                    allowed to be the most finished work of art in the world; and its perfection is
                    owing chiefly to Michel Angelo’s divine paintings. The whole wall behind the
                    altar is covered by his picture of the Last Judgment; the vaulted ceiling
                    represents the creation of the world, and around it are prophets and sibyls. In
                    the sublime painting of the Last Judgment, terrible power is the predominating
                    feature. The good and the bad, angels and devils, crowd the scene, and Christ is
                    represented in the act of judging, or rather of condemning. His complete
                    knowledge of anatomy, which he constantly studied, enabled him to represent in
                    the most perfect manner the human figure in every possible attitude, and to
                    express pain and despair through all their gradations. His other pictures
                    exhibit the same daring sublimity of conception and power of execution. The
                    church of St Peter’s at Rome μs the most splendid triumph of his architectural
                    talents. His style in architecture is distinguished by grandeur and boldness;
                    and, in his ornaments, the untamed character of his imagination is frequently
                    apparent, in his preference of the uncommon to the simple and elegant. In
                    sculpture, his statue of Moses is universally acknowledged to be the noblest
                    monument of his genius, displaying, more than any other of his numerous works in
                    this department of art, all the great qualities of his mind. Michel Angelo was
                    like wise an author, and excelled both in verse and prose. His works have been
                    printed in several collections; but they have also been published separately.
