                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Religion,</hi> in its "original form, was simple and
                    intelligible. It was intended for the instruction and education of all ranks of
                    men, and of consequence its doctrines were on a level with vulgar capacities.
                    The Jewish dispensation was openly practised; nothing was performed in secret;
                    every article was plain, open, and accessible. The divine Author of the
                    Christian economy commanded his disciples to preach his doctrine in the most
                    public manner: “What ye have heard in secret,” says he, “preach openly; and what
                    I have taught you in private, teach ye publicly; and proclaim it on the
                    house-tops.” Such are the charms of truth, and such the character of that
                    religion which came down from heaven, that they, as it were, “delight, and lift
                    up their voice in the streets, and cry in the chief places of concourse.”</p>
                <p>But such is the depravity of the nature of man, that the noblest institutions
                    degenerate in his hands. Religion itself, originally pure, simple, and amiable,
                    under his management has often been transformed into pollution, perplexity, and
                    deformity. The ministers of religion, whose province it was to guard the sacred
                    deposit, and to secure it from foreign and spurious intermixtures, have
                    generally been the first innovators, and the first and most industrious agents
                    in corrupting its integrity and tarnishing its beauty. Avarice and ambition
                    prompted that class of men to deviate from the original plainness and simplicity
                    of religious institutions, and to introduce articles, rites, and usages, which
                    might furnish them with opportunities of gratifying these unhallowed and
                    insatiable passions. Hence distinctions unknown to pure and undefiled religion
                    were fabricated, and that heavenly institution, heretofore one, simple,
                    indivisible, was divided into two partitions; the one popular and public; the
                    other dark, secret, and mysterious. The latter of these we intend as the subject
                    of this article.</p>
                <p>The English word <hi rend="italic">mystery</hi> is derived from the Greek <hi
                    rend="italic">μυσ-</hi><hi rend="italic">τηζιον;</hi> and, in its modern
                    acceptation, imports something above human intelligence, something awfully
                    obscure and enigmatical; any thing artfully made difficult; the secret of any
                    business or profession. The word is often used by the founder of the Christian
                    religion, and more frequently by his apostles, especially St Paul. In these
                    cases, it generally signifies those doctrines of Christianity which the Jews,
                    prior to the advent of the Messiah, either did not or could not understand. The
                    Trinity in Unity and the Unity in Trinity, the incarnation of the Son of God,
                    the union of two natures in one and the same person, &amp;c. we generally call
                    <hi rend="italic">mysteries,</hi> because they are infinitely above human
                    comprehension. All these significations are out of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193827763" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7763-0658"/>the question at present. Our
                    intention in this article is to lay before our readers the fullest and fairest
                    account we have been able to collect, of those <hi rend="italic">αιroponra,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">secret rites,</hi> of the Pagan superstition, which were
                    carefully concealed from the knowledge of the vulgar, and which are universally
                    known under the denomination of <hi rend="italic">mysteries.</hi></p>
                <p>The word <hi rend="italic">μυστηpον</hi> is evidently deduced from <hi
                    rend="italic">μυστη%</hi>; but the origin of this last term is not altogether so
                    obvious. The etymologies of it exhibited by the learned are various; some of
                    them absurd and inconsistent, others foolish and futile. Instead of fatiguing
                    our readers with a detail of these, which would be equally unentertaining and
                    uninteresting, we shall only produce one, which to us appears to come nearest
                    the truth. The mysteries under consideration at present were certainly imported
                    into Greece from the East. In those regions, then, we ought of course to look
                    for the etymology of the word. <hi rend="italic">Mistor</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">mistier,</hi> in Hebrew,signifies “any place or thing hidden or
                    concealed.” As this word implies a kind of definition of the nature of the thing
                    intended, and as it is one of the excellencies of original languages to apply
                    vocables with this propriety, we find ourselves strongly inclined to assign the
                    word <hi rend="italic">mis-tur</hi> as the root of the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >μυστηξ, myster.</hi></p>
                <p>We have already observed, that the avarice and ambition of the Pagan priesthood
                    probably gave birth to the institution of the mysteries. To this observation we
                    may now add, that the ministers of that superstition might possibly imagine,
                    that some articles of their ritual were too profound to be comprehended by the
                    vulgar; others, ;too sacred to be communicated to a description of men whom the
                    institutions of civil society had placed in a situation not only subordinate,
                    but even contemptible. It was imagined, that things sacred and venerable would
                    have contracted a taint and pollution by an intercourse with sordid and
                    untutored souls. These appear to us the most probable motives for making that
                    odious and pernicious distinction between the popular religion and that
                    contained in the sacred and mysterious ritual.</p>
                <p>Bishop Warburton<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Divine
                    Legation of Moses Demonstrated.</p></note> is positive that the mysteries of the
                    Pagan religion were the invention of legislators and other great personages,
                    whom fortune or their own merit had placed at the head of those civil sociétés
                    which were formed in the earliest ages in different parts of the world. It is
                    with reluctance, and indeed with diffidence, that we presume to differ in our
                    sentiments from such respectable authority. Whatever hypothesis this prelate had
                    once adopted, so extensive was his reading, and so exuberant his intellectual
                    resources, that he found little difficulty in defending it by an appearance of
                    plausibility, if not of rational argumentation. The large quotations he has
                    adduced from Plato and Cicero do indeed prove that the sages and legislators of
                    antiquity sometimes availed themselves of the influence derived from the
                    doctrines of the mysteries, and from the authority they acquired by the opinion
                    of their having been initiated in them; but that those men were the inventors
                    and fabricators of them, is a position for which his quotations do not furnish
                    the most slender presumption. At the same time we think it not altogether
                    certain that the doctrine of a divine Providence, and a future state of rewards
                    and punishments, were revealed in the mysteries with all the clearness and
                    cogency which is pretended by his lordship.</p>
                <p>But, granting that the fabric was raised by the hands of sages and legislators,
                    we imagine it would be rather difficult to discover what emolument that
                    description of men could propose to derive from the enterprise. The institution
                    was evidently, and indeed confessedly, devised to conceal from the million those
                    very doctrines and maxims which, had they known and embraced them, would have
                    contributed most effectually to dispose them to submit to those wise regulations
                    which their governors and legislators wished most ardently to establish.
                    Experience has taught that nothing has a more commanding influence on the minds
                    of the vulgar than those very dogmas which, according to the bishop, were
                    communicated to the initiated. A conviction of the unity of the deity, of his
                    wisdom, power, goodness, omnipresence, &amp;c. the steady belief of the
                    immortality of the human soul, and of a future state of rewards and punishments,
                    have in all ages and in all countries proved the firmest supports of legal
                    authority. The very same doctrines, in the dawn of Christianity, contributed, of
                    all other methods, the most effectually to tame and civilize the savage
                    inhabitants of the northern regions of Europe.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Germans, Russians, and Scandinavians, who
                    were never thoroughly civilized till the gospel was preached among
                    them.</p></note> Supposing those principles to have been inculcated by the
                    mysteries, the most prudent plan legislators could have adopted would have been
                    to publish them to all mankind. They ought to have sent forth apostles to preach
                    them to the savages whom they had undertaken to civilize. According to the
                    learned prelate, they pursued the opposite course, and deprived themselves of
                    those very arms by which they might have encountered and overthrown all the
                    armies of savagism.</p>
                <p>Of all the legislators of antiquity, the Cretan alone was prudent enough to
                    foresee and adopt this rational plan. Diodorus the Sicilian informs us that the
                    mysteries of Eleusis, Samothracia, and other places, which were elsewhere buried
                    in profound darkness, were amongst the Cretans taught publicly, and communicated
                    to all the world. Minos, however, was a successful legislator, and his
                    intercourse with Jupiter Idaeus extended his influence and established his
                    authority. He was not under the necessity of calling in the mysteries to his
                    assistance: on the contrary, it is highly probable that the universal knowledge
                    of the doctrines of the mysteries among his countrymen contributed in a
                    considerable degree to facilitate his labour and ensure his success.</p>
                <p>The divine Author of the Christian economy, viewed in the light of a human
                    legislator, saw the propriety of this procedure. Nothing was concealed in his
                    institutions; nothing was veiled with mystery, or buried in darkness. The
                    success was answerable to the wisdom of the plan. The million flocked to the
                    evangelical standard; the gospel was preached to the poor, to the illiterate,
                    and the vulgar; and the meanest of mankind eagerly embraced its maxims. Wherever
                    it prevailed it produced civilization, morality, sobriety, loyalty, and every
                    other private and social virtue. Upon the supposition that the mysteries had
                    contained and inculcated the principles and practices which the prelate supposes
                    they did, the civilizers of mankind, legislators, magistrates, and princes,
                    ought to have combined to make them public for the sake of their own
                    tranquillity, and the more effectual support of their authority and
                    influence.</p>
                <p>Upon the whole, we are inclined to believe that the mysteries were the offspring
                    of Egyptian priestcraft. They were instituted with a view to aggrandize that
                    order of men, to extend their influence, and enlarge their revenues. To
                    accomplish these selfish projects, they applied every engine towards besotting
                    the multitude with superstition and enthusiasm. They taught them to believe that
                    themselves were the distinguished favourites of heaven; and that celestial
                    doctrines had been revealed to them, too holy to be communicated to the profane
                    rabble, and too sublime to be comprehended by vulgar capacities. It is, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193827776" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7776-0659"/> we confess,
                    exceedingly probable, that after the mysteries were instituted, and had acquired
                    an exalted reputation in the world, legislators, magistrates, judges, and
                    potentates, joined in the imposture, with the same views and from the same
                    principles. Princes and legislators, who found their advantage in overawing and
                    humbling the multitude, readily adopted a plan which they found so artfully
                    fabricated to answer these very purposes. They had interest enough with the
                    sacerdotal mystagogues,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The mystagogues were the ministers who acted the chief part in celebrating
                    the mysteries.</p></note> to induce them to allow them to participate in those
                    venerable rites which had already established the authority of that description
                    of men in whose hands they were deposited. The views of both parties were
                    exactly congenial. The respect, the admiration, and dependence on the million,
                    were the ultimate objects of their ambition respectively. Priests and princes
                    were actuated by the very same spirit. The combination was advantageous, and of
                    consequence harmonious. For these reasons we have taken the liberty of differing
                    from his lordship of Gloucester with respect to the persons who first instituted
                    the secret mysteries of the Pagan religion.</p>
                <p>Another writer of considerable reputation in the republic of letters is of
                    opinion that the mysteries were entirely commemorative; that they were
                    instituted with a view to preserve the remembrance of heroes and great men, who
                    had been deified in consideration of their martial exploits, useful inventions,
                    public virtues, and especially in consequence of the benefits by them conferred
                    on their contemporaries. According to him,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Principio hoc ego quidem controversia vacare, arbitror,
                    mysteria quae vocantur, ritus fuisse idcirco institutos ne memoria periret

                    conditores, aut alii praeclari homines, decus nomen, et famam, inter suos sibi
                    comparaverant. Neque baec cuiquam sententia mirabilis videri poterit. (Cud. <hi
                    rend="italic">Syst.</hi><hi rend="italic">Intellect,</hi> ed. Moshemii, p.
                    329.)</p></note> the mysteries of Mithras were established for this very
                    purpose. It would be no difficult matter to prove that the Persian deity of that
                    name was the sun, and that his name and insignia jointly ascertain the truth of
                    this assertion. The same writer extends this observation to the mysteries of the
                    Egyptians, Phoenicians, Greeks, Hetruscans, and, in a word, to all the
                    institutions of that species throughout the world. In opposition to this
                    singular opinion, it may be argued, we think with some show of reason, that the
                    method of preserving the memory of great and illustrious men generally adopted,
                    was the establishing festivals, celebrating games, offering sacrifices, singing
                    hymns, dances, &amp;c. We can recollect no secret mysteries instituted for that
                    purpose, at least in their original intention. If any usage of the commemorative
                    kind was admitted, it was superinduced at some period posterior to the primary
                    institution. At the same time, upon the supposition that the orgia of Bacchus
                    were the same with those of the Egyptian Osiris, and that the mysteries of Ceres
                    exhibited at Eleusis were copied from those of the Egyptian Isis, and allowing
                    that the former was the sun, and the latter the moon, it will be difficult to
                    find out the human persons whose exploits, adventures, inventions, &amp;c. were
                    intended to be immortalized by those institutions. Upon the whole, the mysteries
                    were performed in secret; they were intended to be communicated only to a few;
                    of course, had they been instituted with a view to immortalize the memory of
                    heroes and great men, the authors would have acted the most foolish and
                    inconsistent part imaginable. Instead of transmitting the fame of their heroes
                    with eclat to posterity, they would by this procedure have consigned it to
                    eternal oblivion.</p>
                <p>We must then recur to our first position. The mysteries were the offspring of
                    bigotry and priestcraft; they originated in Egypt, the native land of idolatry.
                    In that country the priesthood ruled predominant. The kings were engrafted into

                    All the orientals, but more especially the Egyptians, delighted in mysterious
                    and allegorical doctrines. Every maxim of morality, every tenet of theology,
                    every dogma of philosophy, was wrapt up in a veil of allegory and mysticism.
                    This propensity no doubt conspired with avarice and ambition to dispose them to
                    a dark and mysterious system of religion. Besides, the Egyptians were a gloomy
                    race of men;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Plutarch,
                    <hi rend="italic">de Iside et Osiride.</hi></p></note> they delighted in
                    darkness and solitude. Their sacred rites were generally celebrated with
                    melancholy airs, weeping, and lamentation. This gloomy and unsocial bias of mind
                    must have stimulated them to a congenial mode of worship. In Egypt, then, we are
                    to search for the origin of the mysteries. Both the nature of the institution
                    and the genius of the people confirm this position; and historians, both ancient
                    and modern, are agreed in admitting the certainty of the fact.</p>
                <p>The Osiris of Egypt, every body knows, was the original Bacchus, as the Isis of
                    the same country was the Ceres of the Greeks. The rites of Osiris were performed
                    with loud shrieks and lamentations when he was put into the coffin, and with the
                    most extravagant mirth when he was in a manner raised from the dead, or supposed
                    to be found again. Their hymns were, upon the whole, always composed in
                    melancholy, affecting strains, and consisted of lamentations for the loss of
                    Osiris, the mystic flight of Bacchus, the wanderings of Isis, and the sufferings
                    of the gods.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Macrob. <hi

                    dirges for the death of Adonis or Tammuz, who was the same with the Egyptian

                    celebrated of a very different complexion from that of the former. In this
                    season all Egypt was dissolved in the most extravagant mirth and jollity. During
                    the celebration of those festivals, the priests formed allegorical
                    representations of the sun and the earth.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Isis, among the Egyptians, sometimes signifies the moon, and

                    allegorized their motions, aspects, relations, sympathies, accesses, recesses,
                    &amp;c. into real adventures, peregrinations, sufferings, contests, battles,
                    victories, defeats, and so forth. These, in process of time, were held up to the
                    vulgar as real occurrences; and these in a few ages became the most essential
                    articles of the popular creed. From this source were derived the conquests of
                    Dionysius or Bacchus, so beautifully exhibited by Nonnus in his Dionysiacs; the
                    wanderings of Io, wonderfully <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827789"

                <p>Whether the Egyptians deified mortal men in the earliest ages, has been much
                    controverted. Jablonski<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    to prove the negative. Diodorus<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Lib. i.</p></note> assures us that they paid their monarchs
                    a kind of divine adoration, even in their lifetime. Plutarch tells us
                    plainly,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Osiride.</hi></p></note> that some were of opinion that Isis,
                    Osiris, Horus, Anubis, and Typhon, were once mortal persons, who were exalted
                    into demons after their death. The Sicilian, in his history of Isis and Osiris,
                    Pan, Hermes, &amp;c. plainly represents them as human personages; and informs
                    us, that the Egyptians imagined that after their decease they transmigrated into
                    particular stars. From these authorities, we are inclined to believe that the
                    Egyptians, as well as the other Pagans, did actually deify persons who had
                    distinguished themselves in their days of nature by prowess, wisdom, useful arts
                    and inventions. This was a constant practice among the Greeks, who probably
                    learned it from the people in question.</p>
                <p>The exploits of these heroes had been disguised by allegorical traditions and
                    hieroglyphical representations. They had been magnified beyond all dimensions,
                    in order to astonish and intimidate the vulgar. They had been interlarded with
                    the most extravagant fables, in order to gratify their propensity towards the
                    marvellous. All these secrets were developed in the mysteries. The
                    catechumens<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Catechumens
                    were pupils who were learning the elements of any science.</p></note> were
                    informed of every particular relating to the birth, the life, the exploits, the
                    adventures, the misfortunes, and decease of those heroic personages, and when,
                    and by what means, they had attained to the high rank of divinities. At the same
                    time we think it highly probable that those demigods were represented in their
                    state of exaltation and heavenly splendour. The magicians of Egypt were
                    abundantly qualified for exhibiting <hi rend="italic">angels in machines.</hi>
                    The souls of virtuous men who had not been eminent enough to merit the honour of
                    deification, were shown in all the perfection of Elysian felicity; and perhaps
                    the souls of tyrants, and of the children of Typhon,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Typhon was the evil genius, or devil, of the
                    Egyptians.</p></note> were shown in Tartarus, suffering all the extremes of
                    infernal punishment. From these exhibitions the mystagogues might naturally
                    enough take occasion to read their pupils suitable lectures on the happy
                    tendency of a virtuous conduct, and the dishonour and misery consequent upon a
                    contrary course. They might set before them immortal renown, deification, and
                    Elysium, on the one hand, and eternal infamy and misery on the other. This will
                    probably be deemed the chief advantage accruing from this institution.</p>
                <p>Besides the communications above mentioned, the catechumens were taught many
                    secrets of physiology, or the nature of the phenomena <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    the world. This Pharnutus<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    everywhere affirms, especially in his last book, towards the end. Plutarch, too,
                    informs us that many of the Greek philosophers were of opinion that most of the
                    Egyptian fables were allegorical details of physical operations. Eusebius
                    acquaints us,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Praeparatio</hi><hi rend="italic">Evangelii.</hi></p></note> that
                    the physiology, not only of the Greeks, but likewise of the barbarians, was
                    nothing else but a kind of science of nature, a concealed and dark theology,
                    involved in fable and fiction, whose hidden mysteries were so veiled over with
                    enigmas and allegories, that the ignorant million were as little capable of
                    comprehending what was said as what was suppressed in silence. This, says he, is
                    apparent from the poems of Orpheus, and the fable of the Phrygians and
                    Egyptians. Dionysius of Halicarnassus likewise observes,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Añtiquit.
                    Roman.</hi></p></note> that the fables of the Greeks detail the operations of
                    nature by allegories. Proclus<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">In Tιmxo.</hi></p></note> makes the same
                    observation concerning the people in question. The Egyptians, says he, taught
                    the latent operations of nature by fables.</p>
                <p>These physiological secrets were no doubt expounded to the initiated; and that
                    the Egyptian priests were deeply skilled in physiological science, can scarcely
                    be questioned, if we believe that Jannes and Jambres rivalled Moses with their
                    enchantments. The preceding detail comprehends all that was revealed to the
                    Epoptae in the original Egyptian mysteries. What articles might have been
                    introduced afterwards we cannot pretend to determine.</p>
                <p>Be that as it may, one thing is certain, namely, that the vulgar were excluded
                    from all those choice secrets, which were carefully reserved for the nobility
                    and sacerdotal tribes. To them it was given to know the mysteries of the kingdom
                    of darkness; but to those who were without, all was mystery and parable. While
                    the laity fed on husks, the clergy and the quality feasted on royal dainties.
                    The priests who had devised these allegories understood their original import,
                    and bequeathed it as an inestimable legacy to their children. Here then we have
                    the primary object of the mysteries, namely, to develope to the initiated the
                    original and rational import of those allegorical and mystical doctrines which
                    were tendered to the uninitiated, wrapt up in impenetrable allegory and
                    obscurity. To the former these were communicated and explained; the latter were
                    obliged to stand at an awful distance, and retire as the <hi rend="italic"

                    magicians, &amp;c.</p></note> were the greatest proficients in that science. The
                    original subjects of these institutions were, we imagine, the articles we have
                    specified above: but in process of time, according to the natural course of
                    things, numerous improvements were made, and many new rites, ceremonies, usages,
                    and even doctrines, were superinduced, which were utterly unknown to the
                    original hierophants.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    part, one of the distinguishing characters of a new institution; but succeeding
                    architects generally imagine that something is still wanting to complete the
                    beauty, the regularity, the uniformity, the magnificence, and perhaps the
                    conveniency, of the structure. Hence, at length, it comes to be so overloaded
                    with adventitious drapery, that its primary elegance and symmetry are altogether
                    defaced. This was the case with the earliest Egyptian mysteries. Their subject
                    was at first simple and easy to be comprehended; in time it became complex,
                    intricate, and unintelligible.</p>
                <p>In order to celebrate those mysteries with the greater secrecy, their temples
                    were so constructed as to favour the artifice of the priests. The fanes, in
                    which they used to execute their sacred functions, and to perform the rites and
                    ceremonies of their religion, were subterraneous apartments, constructed with
                    such wonderful skill and dexterity, that every thing that appeared in them
                    breathed an air of solemn secrecy. Their walls were covered with hieroglyphic
                    paintings and sculpture, and the altar was situated <pb break="no"

                    written by the Abbé Terrasson, entitled the Life of Sethos.</p></note> In those
                    subterraneous mansions, which the priests of that ingenious nation had planned
                    with the most consummate skill, the kings, princes, and great men of the state
                    encountered the dangers and hardships contrived to prove their prudence,
                    fortitude, patience, abstinence, &amp;c. These were appointed to try their
                    merit; and by these the hierophants were enabled to decide whether or not they
                    were duly qualified for receiving that benefit. Upon these occasions, we may
                    believe, abundance of those magical tricks were exhibited, for which the
                    magicians of Egypt were so much celebrated among the ancients. The strange and
                    astonishing sights, the alternate successions of light and darkness, the hideous
                    spectres exposed to view, the frightful howlings re-echoed by these infernal
                    domes, the scenes of Tartarus and Elysium, exhibited alternately and in quick
                    succession, must have made a deep and lasting impression on the mind of the
                    affrighted votary.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>From the scenes exhibited in celebrating the Egyptian mysteries, especially those
                    of Isis and Osiris, the Greeks seem to have copied their ideas of the infernal
                    regions, and the subterraneous mansions of departed souls. Many colonies of
                    Egyptians settled in Greece. From these the <hi rend="italic">αοιδοι,</hi><note

                    departed souls, lame and incoherent. Succeeding bards obtained more full and
                    more distinct information. Euripides and Aristophanes seem to have paved the way
                    for the prince of Roman poets. Plato<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Phaedo.</hi></p></note> and some of the
                    other philosophers have shown, by their descriptions or allusions, that the
                    whole apparatus of Tartarus and Elysium had become a hackneyed topic some
                    centuries before Virgil was born. This incomparable poet borrowed his ideas from
                    Homer, Aristophanes, Euripides, Plato, &amp;c. These, under his plastic hand, in
                    the sixth Aeneid, grew into a system beautiful, regular, uniform, and
                    consistent. The materials he has employed were created to his hand; he had only
                    to collect, polish, arrange, and connect them. The sentiments collected from the
                    Platonic philosophy, and the inimitable episode copied from the annals of Rome,

                <p>Egypt was, then, the native land of mysteries as well as of idolatry. Every god
                    and goddess respectively had their mysteries; but as those of Isis and Osiris
                    were the most celebrated, they of course became principal objects of pursuit as
                    well as of imitation to the neighbouring nations. These, as is generally
                    believed, were carried into Persia by Zoroastres, or Zerdusht, by whom they were
                    consecrated to Mithras. On these we shall make some observations in the sequel.
                    Orpheus imported them into Thrace; Cadmus brought them into Boeotia, where they
                    were sacred to Bacchus. Inachus established them at Argos in honour of Juno, the
                    same with Isis;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Isis was
                    the moon, and the original Juno was the same planet.</p></note> Cyniras in
                    Cyprus, where they were dedicated to Venus. In Phrygia they were sacred to
                    Cybele, the mother of the gods.</p>
                <p>Our learned readers, who will probably reflect that the Egyptians were in ancient
                    times inhospitable to strangers, will perhaps be surprised -that this fastidious
                    and jealous people were so ready to communicate the arcana of their religion to
                    foreigners. But they will please recollect, that a great part of Greece was
                    planted with colonies from Egypt, Phoenicia, Palestine, &amp;c. This we could
                    easily prove, did the bounds prescribed us admit such a digression. Orpheus, if
                    not an Egyptian, was at least of oriental extraction. Inachus, Cadmus, and
                    Melampus, are universally allowed to have been Egyptians. Erechtheus, in whose
                    reign the Eleusinian mysteries were established, was an Egyptian by birth, or at
                    least sprung from Egyptian ancestors. The Egyptians, then, in those early ages,
                    did not view the Greeks in the light of aliens, but as a people nearly related
                    either to themselves or the Phoenicians, who were their brethren. Upon this
                    connection we imagine it was that in later times most of the sages of Greece,
                    especially of Athens, found so hospitable a reception among that people. They
                    probably viewed them in the light of propagandi; apostles able and willing to
                    disseminate their idolatrous rites. This observation, which might be supported
                    by numberless authorities, did the nature of the present inquiry permit, will,
                    we think, go a great way towards obviating the objection.</p>
                <p>Although, as has been observed, every particular deity had his own peculiar
                    mysterious sacred rites, yet, of all others, those of Mithras, Bacchus,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bacchus was the Osiris of the
                    Egyptians, and Ceres was the Isis of the same people.</p></note> and Ceres, were
                    deemed the most august, and were most universally and most religiously
                    celebrated. To these, therefore, we shall in a’good measure confine ourselves
                    upon this occasion. If our readers shall become intimately acquainted with
                    these, they may readily dispense with the knowledge of the rest, which are,
                    indeed, no more than streams and emanations from these sources. We shall, then,
                    in the first place, present to our readers a brief sketch of the mysteries of
                    Mithras.</p>
                <p>Mithras, or, according to the Persian, <hi rend="italic">Mihr,</hi> was one of
                    the great gods of the Asiatics. His worship was for many ages confined to
                    Persia. Afterwards, however, it was propagated so far and wide that some have
                    imagined they had discovered vestiges of it even in Gaul. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mihr,</hi> according to Dr Hyde,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    might presume to differ from so respectable an authority, we should conjecture
                    that it is a cognate of the Hebrew word <hi rend="italic">muthir,</hi>
                    “excellentia,praestantia.” Thatthere was an analogy between the Hebrew and old
                    Persian, is generally admitted by the learned. Be that as it may, Mithras was

                    divinities of Persia. But the fact is, the solar planet was the visible emblem
                    of Oramaz, the good genius of the Persian tribes, and the same with the Osiris
                    of the Egyptians. From these people, some have imagined that Zoroastres,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Μ. Silohwette (Disser. v. p.
                    17) asserts that Zoroaster was initiated amongst the Egyptians.</p></note> or
                    Zerdusht, borrowed his mysteries of Mithras. To this opinion we cannot give our
                    assent, because the probationary trials to be undergone by the candidates among
                    the former were much more savage and sanguinary than among the latter. Both,
                    however, were instituted in honour of the same deity; and probably the scenes
                    exhibited and the information communicated in both were analogous, a
                    circumstance which perhaps gave birth to the opinion above mentioned.</p>
                <p>The grand festival of Mithras was celebrated six days, in the middle of the month
                    of Mihr.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The month Mihr
                    began September 30, and ended October 30.</p></note> Upon these days, it was
                    lawful for the kings of Persia to get drunk and dance. On this festival, we
                    imagine, the candidates for initiation, having duly proved their vocation, were
                    solemnly admitted to the participation of the mysteries.</p>

                    Sun, in a certain natural cave, which he formed into a temple, and fitted up in
                    a manner exactly mathematical. There Mithras was represented as presiding over
                    the lower world, with all the pomp of royal magnificence. In it, too, were seen
                    the symbols of Mithras and of the world, philosophically and mathematically
                    exhibited, to be contemplated and worshipped. This deity was sometimes
                    represented as mounted on a bull, which he is breaking, and which he kills with
                    a sword. On some bas-reliefs still existing, he appears as a young man with his
                    tiara turned upward, after the manner of the Persian kings. He is clothed with a
                    short tunic and breeches, after the Persian fashion. Sometimes he wears a small
                    cloak. By his sides are seen other human figures, with tiaras of the same
                    fashion on their heads, but without cloaks. One of these figures commonly holds
                    in the one hand a torch lifted up; in the other, one turned downward. Sometimes
                    over the cave are seen the chariots of the sun and moon, and divers
                    constellations, such as cancer, scorpio, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In one of these caves the ceremonies of initiation were performed; but before the
                    candidate could be admitted, he was forced to undergo a course of probationary
                    exercises, so numerous and so rigorous that very few had courage and fortitude
                    enough to go through them. He was obliged to live a life of virtue and
                    abstinence for the space of seven years previous to the period of his
                    initiation. Some months before it, he was obliged to submit to a long and
                    austere fast, which continued fifty days. He was to retire several days to a
                    deep and dark dungeon, where he was successively exposed to all the extremes of
                    heat and cold. Meantime he frequently underwent the bastinado, which the priests
                    applied without mercy. Some say this fustigation continued two whole days, and
                    was repeated no less than fifteen times. In the course of these probationary
                    exercises, the candidate was generally reduced to a skeleton; and we are told,
                    that there have been several instances of persons who have perished in the
                    attempt.</p>
                <p>Upon the eve of the initiation, the aspirant was obliged to brace on his
                    armour,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Jul.
                    Firmicus.</p></note> in order to encounter giants and savage monsters. In those
                    spacious subterraneous mansions a mock hunting was exhibited. The priests and
                    all the subordinate officers of the temple, transformed into lions, tigers,
                    leopards, boars, wolves, and other savage creatures, assailed him with loud
                    howlings, roaring, and yelling, and every instance of ferine fury. In those mock
                    combats, the hero was often in danger of being really worried, and always came
                    off with bruises and wounds. Lampridius informs us, that when the Emperor
                    Commodus was initiated, he actually carried the joke too far, and butchered one
                    of the priests, who attacked him in the figure of a wild beast. The Persians
                    worshipped Mithras or the Sun by a perpetual fire; hence the votary was obliged
                    to undergo a fiery trial; that is, to pass seven times through the sacred fire,
                    and each time to plunge himself into cold water. Some have made these
                    probationary penances amount to eighty; others have thought that they were in
                    all only eight. As we find no good authority for either of these numbers, we
                    think ourselves at liberty to hazard the following conjecture. The number <hi
                    rend="italic">seven</hi> was deemed sacred over all the East. The Mithriac
                    penances, we imagine, were either seven, or, if they exceeded it, were regulated
                    by seven repetitions of that number. The candidate having undergone all these
                    torturing trials with becoming patience and fortitude, was declared a proper
                    subject for initiation. But before his admission he was obliged to bind himself
                    by the most solemn oath, with horrible imprecations annexed, never to divulge
                    any single article of all that should be communicated to him in the course of
                    his initiation.</p>
                <p>What <hi rend="italic">ακοppnτα</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ineffable secrets</hi>
                    were imparted to the initiated, it is impossible at this distance of time to
                    discover with any tolerable degree of certainty. We may, however, rest assured,
                    that the most authentic tradition concerning the origin of the universe; the
                    nature, attributes, perfections, and operations of Oromasd; the baleful
                    influences of Ariman; and the benign effects of the government of Mithras, were
                    unfolded and inculcated. The secret phenomena of nature, as far as they had been
                    discovered by the Magi, were likewise exhibited; and the application of their
                    effects, to astonish and delude the vulgar, were taught both in theory and
                    practice. The exercise of public and private virtues was warmly recommended; and
                    vice represented in the most odious and frightful colours. Both these
                    injunctions were, we may suppose, enforced by a display of the pleasures of
                    Elysium and the pains of Tartarus, as has been observed above in describing the
                    mysteries of the Egyptians.</p>
                <p>Those initiations are mentioned by Lampridius in the life of Commodus, and
                    likewise by Justin<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    in the second century. The last of these two speaks of a kind of baptism, which
                    washed from the souls of the initiated all the stains which they had contracted
                    during the course of their lives prior to their initiation. He at the same time
                    mentions a particular mark which was imprinted upon them,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In allusion to this practice of imprinting a
                    sacred mark, probably on the forehead of the initiated, we find the injunction

                    resurrection; which particulars, however, he does not describe in detail. In
                    that offering, which was accompanied with a certain form of prayer, a vessel of
                    water was offered up with the bread. The same father elsewhere informs us, that
                    there was presented to the initiated a crown suspended on the point of a sword;
                    but that they were taught to say, <hi rend="italic">Mithras is my crown.</hi> By
                    this answer was intimated, that they looked upon the service of that deity as

                    type="authorial"><p>Tertull. <hi rend="italic">adv. Marc.</hi> p. 55. The
                    priests of Mithras were called the lions of Mithras, and his priestesses
                    lionesses, some say hyaenas. The other inferior ministers were called eagles,
                    hawks, ravens, &amp;c. and on their festivals they wore masks corresponding to
                    their titles, after the Egyptian manner, where the priests appeared at the
                    ceremonies with masks resembling the heads of Lions, apes, dogs, &amp;c. a
                    circumstance which furnishes a ptesumption that the mysteries of Mithras were of

                    courage in the service of the deity. They were now consecrated to the god, and
                    were supposed to be under his immediate protection; an idea which of course
                    animated them to the most daring and dangerous enterprises.</p>
                <p>The worship of Mithras was introduced into the Roman empire towards the end of
                    the republic, where it made very rapid progress. When Christianity began to make
                    a figure in the empire, the champions for Paganism thought of proposing to men
                    the worship of this Power of Benevolence, in order to counterbalance or
                    annihilate that worship which the Christians paid to Jesus Christ the true Sun
                    of Righteousness. But this mode was soon abolished, together with the other
                    rites of Paganism. The Persian grandees often affected names compounded with
                    Mithras; hence Mithridates, Mithrobarzanes, &amp;c.; hence, too, the precious
                    stone called <hi rend="italic">Mithridat,</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Solinus, cap. x.</p></note> which by the
                    reflection of the sun sparkled with a variety of colours. There is likewise a
                    certain pearl of many different colours, which they call <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mithras.</hi> It is found among the mountains near the Red Sea; and when
                    exposed to the sun, it sparkles with a variety of dyes. We find likewise a king
                    of Egypt of that name, who reigned at Heliopolis; who being commanded in a dream
                    to erect an obelisk to the solar deity, reared a most prodigious one in the
                    neighbourhood of that city.</p>
                <p>The votaries of Mithras pretended that he was sprung from a rock, and that
                    therefore the place where the mysterious ceremonies were communicated to the
                    initiated was always a cave. Many different reasons have been assigned for the
                    origin of this rock-born deity, most of which appear to us unsatisfactory. If
                    our readers will be obliging enough to accept of a simple and obvious
                    conjecture, they may take the following. A rock is the symbol of strength and
                    stability;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Our Saviour
                    probably alludes to this emblem, when he talks of building his church on a rock;
                    and adds, that the gates of hell should not prevail against it.</p></note> the
                    dominion of Mithras, in the opinion of his votaries, was as firm as a rock, and
                    as stable as the everlasting hills. If our readers should not admit the
                    probability of this conjecture, we would beg leave to refer them to the learned
                    Mr Bryant’s Analysis of Mythology, where they will find this point discussed
                    with deep research and wonderful ingenuity. Whatever may have been the origin of
                    this opinion with relation to the birth of Mithras, it is certain that some
                    reverence to rocks and caves was kept up a long time even after the
                    establishment of Christianity. Hence the prohibition given to some of the
                    proselytes to that religion, that they should no more presume to offer up their
                    prayers <hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">petras,</hi> at the

                    stones, which the vulgar call <hi rend="italic">leere</hi> stones, that is, we

                <p>We shall conclude our account of the mysteries of Mithras, by citing a passage
                    from Μ. Anquetil, to whom we are so much indebted for what knowledge we have of
                    the Persian theology, and in which the functions of that deity are briefly and
                    comprehensively delineated. “The peculiar functions of Mithras are to fight
                    continually against Ahriman and the impure army of evil genii, whose constant
                    employment is to scatter terror and desolation over the universe; to protect the
                    frame of nature from the de mons and their productions. For this purpose he is
                    furnished with a thousand ears and a thousand eyes, and traverses the space
                    between heaven and earth; his hands armed with a club or mace. Mithras gives to
                    the earth light and sun: he traces a course for the waters: he gives to men
                    corn, pastures, and children; to the world virtuous kings and warriors: he
                    maintains harmony upon earth, watches over the law,” &amp;c. As the history of
                    Mithras, and the nature of his mysteries, are not generally known, we imagined
                    it would be agreeable to many of our readers to have the most important articles
                    relating to that subject laid before them as it were in detail.</p>
                <p>We now proceed to the orgia or mysteries of Bacchus, which we shall introduce
                    with a brief history of that deity. The original Dionysius or Bacchus was the
                    Osiris of the Egyptians, which last was the Sun.<note anchored="true"

                    ><p>Lib. i.</p></note> has no manner of connection with the present
                    disquisition. The Greek name of that deity is plainly oriental, being compounded
                    of <hi rend="italic">di,</hi> “bright,” and <hi rend="italic">nasta</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">nasa,</hi> in the Aeolic dialect <hi rend="italic">nusa,</hi> “a
                    prince.” This name was imported from the East by Orpheus, Cadmus, or by whoever
                    else communicated the worship of Osiris to the Greeks. That the Dionysius of the
                    Greeks was the same with the Osiris of the Egyptians, is universally allowed.
                    Herodotus tells us expressly,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Lib. ii. cap. 144.</p></note> that <hi rend="italic"
                    >Osiris</hi> is <hi rend="italic">Dionysius</hi> in the Greek language:
                    Martianus Capellus, quoted above, expresses the very same idea.<note

                    Egypt,</hi> lib. ii. cap. i.</p></note> The original Osiris, then, was the sun;
                    but the Dionysius or Bacchus of the Greeks was the same with the Osiris of the
                    Egyptians; therefore the Bacchus or Dionysius of the Greeks was likewise the
                    same luminary.</p>
                <p>The name <hi rend="italic">Osiris</hi> has much embarrassed critics and
                    etymologists. The learned Jablonski,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Pantheon. Egypt.</hi></p></note> instead
                    of delineating the character, attributes, operations, adventures, exploits, and
                    peculiar department assigned this deity by his votaries, has spent much of his
                    pains on trying to investigate the etymology of his name. If it be granted,
                    which is highly probable, that the Hebrew and Egyptian tongues are cognate
                    dialects, we should imagine that it is actually the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chosher</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Oshir of</hi> the former language, which
                    imports “to make rich, to become rich.” Indeed the words <hi rend="italic"
                    >Osiris</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Isis</hi> were not the vulgar names of the
                    sun and moon amongst the Egyptians, but only epithets importing their qualities.
                    The name of the sun amongst that people was <hi rend="italic">Phre</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Phra,</hi> that of the moon <hi rend="italic">Ioh,</hi> whence the
                    Greek <hi rend="italic">Io.</hi> The term <hi rend="italic">Osiris</hi> was
                    applied both to the sun and to the river Nile, both which by their influence
                    contributed respectively to enrich and fertilize the land of Egypt.</p>
                <p>It was a general custom amongst the orientals to denominate their princes and
                    great men from their gods, demigods, and heroes. When the former were advanced
                    to divine honours, they were in process of time confounded with their
                    archetypes. The original divinities were forgotten, and these upstart deities
                    usurped their place and prerogatives. In the earliest periods of the Egyptian
                    monarchy, there appeared two illustrious personages, Osiris <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193827841" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7841-0664"/>and Isis. These were the
                    children of Kronus; and being brother and sister, they were joined in matrimony,
                    according to the custom of the Egyptians. As the brother and husband had assumed
                    the name of the <hi rend="italic">Sun,</hi> so the sister and consort took that
                    of <hi rend="italic">Isis,</hi> that is, “the woman,”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Horus Apollo, cap. iii. .</p></note> a name
                    which the Egyptians applied both to the moon and to the earth, in consequence of
                    the similarity of their nature, their mutual sympathy, and congenial fecundity.
                    Osiris having left his consort Isis regent of the kingdom, with Hermes as her
                    prime minister, and Hercules as general of her armies, quitted Egypt with a
                    numerous body of troops, attended by companies of fauns,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Men and women dressed in the habits of those

                    traversed all Asia as far as the Eastern Ocean. He then returned homeward
                    through Upper Asia, Thrace, Pontus, Asia Minor, Syria, and Palestine. Wherever
                    he marched he conferred numberless benefits on the savage inhabitants. He taught
                    the art of cultivating the ground, preserving the fruits of the earth, and
                    distinguishing the wholesome and nutritive from the unwholesome and poisonous.
                    He instructed them in the culture of the vine; and where vines could not be
                    produced, he communicated to them the method of producing a fermented liquor
                    from barley, very little inferior to wine itself. He built many cities in
                    different parts of the globe, planted numerous colonies,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Many have thought this expedition fabulous;
                    but the numberless monuments of Egyptian architecture, sculpture, and statuary,
                    that have been discovered in the East seem to confirm it.</p></note> and,
                    wherever he directed his course, instituted just and wholesome laws, and
                    established the rites and ceremonies of religion, and left priests and
                    catechists of his train to teach and inculcate the observance of them. In short,
                    he left everywhere lasting monuments of his progress, and at the same time of
                    his generosity and beneficence. Where he found the people docile and submissive,
                    he treated them with kindness and humanity; if any showed themselves obstinate,
                    he compelled them to submit to his institutions by force of arms.</p>
                <p>At the end of three years, he returned to Egypt, where his brother Typhon, a
                    wicked unnatural monster, had been forming a conspiracy against his life. This
                    traitorous design he soon afterwards accomplished in the following manner: He
                    invited Osiris, with some other persons whom he had gained over, to an
                    entertainment. When the repast was finished, he produced a beautiful coffer,
                    highly finished, and adorned with studs of gold, promising to bestow it on the
                    person whom it should fit best. Osiris was tempted to make the experiment. The
                    conspirators nailed down the cover upon him, and threw the coffer into the
                    river. This coffer, now become the coffin of Osiris, was, they inform us, wafted
                    by the winds and waves to the neighbourhood of Byblus, a city of Phoenicia,
                    where it was cast on shore, and left by the receding waves at the foot of a
                    tamarind tree.</p>
                <p>Isis, in the mean time, disconsolate and forlorn, attended by Anubis, was
                    ransacking every quarter in search of her beloved Osiris. At length being
                    informed by her faithful attendant and guardian, that his body was lodged
                    somewhere in the neighbourhood of Byblus, she repaired to that city. .There,
                    they say, she was introduced to the queen, and after a variety of
                    adventures<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For the

                    corpse of her husband, which, of course, she carried back with her to Egypt; but
                    the mischievous Typhon, ever on the watch, found her on the banks of the Nile,
                    and having robbed her of her charge, cut the body into fourteen parts, and
                    scattered them up and down. Now, once more, according to the fable, Isis set out
                    in quest of those parts, all of which, one only excepted, she discovered, and
                    interred in the place where she had found them; and hence the many tombs of
                    Osiris in that country. These tombs were denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >taposins</hi> by the natives. Many other fabulous adventures were ascribed to
                    those two personages, which it is not our province to enumerate at present. If
                    our readers should wish to be more minutely informed on this subject, they may
                    have recourse to the account given by Diodorus Siculus, or to the learned Mr
                    Bryant’s Analysis of Ancient Mythology, and Μ. Cour de Gebelin, where they will
                    find matter enough to gratify their curiosity.</p>
                <p>To commemorate those adventures, the mysteries of Isis and Osiris were
                    instituted; and from them both those of Bacchus and Ceres, amongst the Greeks,
                    were derived. Of the Egyptian solemnity we have an exact epitome in one of the
                    fathers of the church, to the following purpose: “Here follows,” says he, “an
                    epitome of the mysteries of Isis and Osiris. They deplore annually, with deep
                    lamentations and shaved heads, the catastrophe of Osiris, over a buried statue
                    of that monarch. They beat their breasts, mangle their arms, tear open the scars
                    of their former wounds; that by annual lamentations the catastrophe of his
                    miserable and fatal death may be revived in their minds. When they have
                    practised these things a certain number of days, then they pretend that they
                    have found the remains of his mangled body; and having found them, their sorrows
                    are lulled asleep, and they break out into immoderate joy.” What maxims of
                    morality, secrets of physiology, or phenomena of astronomy, were couched under
                    this allegorical process, it is not our business to investigate in this place.
                    We shall only observe, that, in all probability, Osiris and Isis were sovereigns
                    of Egypt at a very early period; that they had conferred many signal benefits on
                    their subjects, who, influenced by a sense of gratitude, paid them divine
                    honours after their decease; that in process of time they were confounded with
                    the sun and the moon; and that their adventures were at length magnified beyond
                    all credibility, interlarded with fables and allegories, and employed in the
                    mysteries as channels to convey a variety of instructions to the initiated.</p>
                <p>But be that as it may, it is certain that the very same mode of worship was
                    established at Byblus, and in after ages transferred to Tyre. The Mizraim and
                    Chanaanim were nearly connected by blood, and their religious ceremonies were
                    derived from the very same source. By what medium the worship of Osiris at
                    Abydus and Tyre was connected, we shall leave to others to explain; we shall
                    only observe, that amongst the Phoenicians this deity obtained the names <hi
                    rend="italic">Adonis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bacchus.</hi> The former is
                    rather an epithet than a name;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    or <hi rend="italic">Adonai,</hi> “my lord,” and imports the sovereignty of the
                    deity.</p></note> the latter is evidently an allusion to the weeping and

                    hero, which grandson became afterwards the Grecian Bacchus. It is, however, we

                    >Dinusi,</hi> that is, “the prince of light.” Cadmus had learned the name <hi
                    rend="italic">Bacchus</hi> from the Phoenicians.</p></note> who was a native of
                    the former country, and is thought to have spent some time in the latter before
                    he emigrated in quest of a settlement in Boeotia. It is said that Semele, the
                    daughter of Cadmus, and the mother of the Grecian Bacchus, was struck with
                    lightning at the very instant of his birth. The child was, in all probability,
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">Bacchus,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>We have omitted the immense farrago of fable relating to the
                    connection between Jupiter and Semele, as of little importance to our
                    readers.</p></note> from the sorrow and lamentation this melancholy accident had
                    occasioned in the family. Cadmus, in order to conceal the dishonour of his
                    daughter, might, we imagine, convey away his infant grandson to some of his
                    relations in Phoenicia or Egypt. There he was educated and instructed in all the
                    mysteries of Isis and Osiris, and at the same time initiated in all the magical
                    or juggling tricks of the Egyptian priests and hierophants. Thus accomplished,
                    when he arrived at manhood, he returned to Thebes with the traditional retinue
                    of the original deity of the same name, and claimed divine honours accordingly.
                    This claim, however, was not admitted without much opposition; Pentheus, another
                    grandson of Cadmus, was torn to pieces by the frantic Bacchanalians upon Mount
                    Cithaeron, because he attempted to interrupt them in celebrating the orgia. Some
                    have thought that Cadmus lost his kingdom for the same reason; but this, we
                    think, is by no means probable; we should rather imagine that the old prince was
                    privy to the whole process, and that it was originally planned by him, with a
                    view to attract the veneration of his new subjects, by making them believe that
                    there was a divinity in his family.</p>
                <p>But however that may be, the vain-glorious Greeks attributed all the actions of
                    the Egyptian hero to their new Bacchus; and, according to their laudable
                    practice, engaged him in numberless adventures in which his prototype had no
                    share. Most of those are futile and unentertaining.<note anchored="true"

                    collected all the fabulous adventures of Bacchus, and exhibited them in a

                    Dionysiacs we have a most judicious sketch, Gebelin, <hi rend="italic"

                    naturalized and adopted into some Grecian family, and so he became their own. To
                    him they ascribed all the adventures and exploits of the oriental archetype from
                    whom he was copied. Consequently in the orgia,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The orgia belonged to all the Mydones, but to
                    those of Bacchus in a peculiar manner.</p></note> every thing was collected that
                    had been imported from the East relating to Osiris; and to that farrago was
                    joined all that the Grecian rhapsodists had thought fit to invent, in order to
                    amuse the credulous multitude. This, however, was not the whole of the
                    misfortune. The adventures of Osiris were described by the Egyptian hierophants,
                    veiled with allegorical and hieroglyphical mysteries. These the persons who
                    imported them into Greece did not thoroughly comprehend, or, if they did, they
                    were not inclined to communicate them sound and unsophisticated. Besides, many
                    oriental terms were retained, the import of which was in process of time lost or
                    distorted. Hence the religious ceremonies of the Greeks became a medley of
                    inconsistencies. The mysteries of Bacchus, in particular, were deeply tinctured
                    with this meretricious colouring; the adventures of the Theban pretender were
                    grafted upon those of the Egyptian archetype, and out of this combination was
                    formed a tissue of adventures disgraceful to human nature, absurd, and
                    inconsistent. Indeed the younger or Theban Bacchus seems to hate been a monster
                    of debauchery; whereas the Egyptian is represented as a person of an opposite
                    character. Of course the mysteries of the former were attended with the most
                    shocking abominations.</p>
                <p>These mysteries, as has been observed above, were first celebrated at Thebes, the
                    capital of Boeotia, under the auspices of the family of Cadmus. From this
                    country they gradually found their way into Greece, and all the neighbouring
                    parts of Europe. They were celebrated once every three years,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hence these orgia were called
                    <hi rend="italic">Triteria.</hi></p></note> because at the end of three years
                    Osiris returned from his Indian expedition. As the Greeks had impudently
                    transferred the actions of the Egyptian hero to their upstart divinity, the same
                    period of time was observed for the celebration of those rites in Greece that
                    had been ordained for the same purpose in Egypt.</p>
                <p>When the day appointed for the celebration of the orgia<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to Clemens Alexandrinus, <hi
                    rend="italic">Cohort,</hi> page 12, Pott, the word <hi rend="italic">orgia</hi>
                    is derived from <hi rend="italic">orge,</hi> which signifies “anger,” and
                    originated from the resentment of Ceres against Jupiter, in consequence of a
                    most outrageous insult he had offered her with success. V'e should rather
                    imagine it derived from the Hebrew word <hi rend="italic">argoz,</hi> signifying
                    a “chest or coffer,” alluding to the casket which contained the secret symbols
                    of the god-The Egyptians or Phoenicians might write and pronounce argoz, <hi

                    all the initiated to equip themselves according to the ritual, and attend the
                    procession on the day appointed. The votaries were to dress themselves in coats
                    of deerskins, to loose the fillets of their hair, to cover their legs with the
                    same stuff as their coats, and to arm themselves with thyrsi, which were a kind
                    of spears wholly of wood entwined with leaves and twigs of the vine or ivy. It
                    is said that the Bacchanalians, especially the Thracians, used often to quarrel
                    and commit murder in their drunken revels, and that in order to prevent those
                    unlucky accidents, a law was enacted, that the votaries, instead of real spears,
                    should arm themselves with these sham weapons, which were comparatively
                    inoffensive. The statue of the deity, which was always covered with vine or ivy
                    leaves, was now taken down from its pedestal, and elevated on the shoulders of
                    the priests. The cavalcade then proceeded nearly in the following manner.</p>
                <p>First of all, hymns were chanted in honour of Bacchus, who was called the <hi

                    while at the same time he was deemed equally qualified for the exploits of war
                    and heroism. Horace, in some of his dithyrambic odes, has concisely pointed out
                    the subjects of those Bacchanalian songs. In the collection of hymns fabulously
                    attributed to Orpheus, we find several addressed to this deity,<note

                    the Mediator &amp;c.</p></note> each under a different title, derived from the
                    different appellations of the god. All these names are of oriental original, and
                    might easily be explained, did the bounds prescribed to us admit of etymological
                    disquisitions.</p>
                <p>The hymn being finished, the first division of the votaries<pb break="no"

                    of wine, with a bunch of the vine. Then followed the he-goat, an animal odious
                    to Bacchus, because he ravages the vines. The chanting the hymns, the
                    sacrificing the he-goat, and the revels, games, and diversions with which the
                    celebration of those rites was attended, gave birth to the dramatic poetry of
                    the Greeks; as the persons habited in the dress of fauns, sylvans, and

                    is an emblem of that purifying influence of the mysteries, by which the

                    commencing a holv course of life.</p></note> Such was the furniture of the
                    sacred coffer carried in the solemn Bacchanalian procession. The inventory given
                    by some of the fathers<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Clemens Alexandrinus.</p></note> of the church is somewhat different. They
                    mention the die, the ball, the top, the wheel, the apples, the looking-glass,
                    and the fleece. The articles first mentioned seem to have been of Egyptian
                    original; the last were certainly superinduced by the Greeks, in allusion to his
                    being murdered and torn in pieces when he was a child by the machinations of
                    Juno, who prevailed with the Titans to commit the horrid deed. These last seem
                    to have been memorials of his boyish playthings; for, says Maternus, “the
                    Cretans,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Errore</hi><hi rend="italic">Prof.

                    everything that the dying boy either said, or did, or suffered. They likewise,”
                    says he, “tore a live bull in pieces with their teeth, in order to commemorate
                    the dismembering of the boy.” For our part, we think, that if such a beastly
                    rite was practised, it was done in commemoration of the savage manner of life
                    which had prevailed among men prior to the more humane diet invented and
                    produced by Isis and Osiris. Be that as it may, we learn from Porphyry,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Abstinentia.</hi></p></note> that in the island of Chios they used
                    to sacrifice a man to Bacchus, and that they used to mangle and tear him limb
                    from limb. This was no doubt practised in commemoration of the catastrophe
                    mentioned above.</p>
                <p>The orgia of this Pagan god were originally simple enough; but this
                    unsophisticated mode was of no long continuance, for riches soon introduced
                    luxury, which quickly infected even the ceremonies of religion. On the day set
                    apart for this solemnity, men and women crowned with ivy, their hair
                    dishevelled, and their bodies almost naked, ran about the streets, roaring aloud

                    to believe that it comes from the oriental word <hi rend="italic">Heve,</hi>
                    which signifies a “serpent,” which among the Egyptians was sacred to the sun,
                    and was likewise the emblem of life and immortality. It then imported a prayer
                    to Bacchus for life, vigour, health, and every other blessing.</p></note><hi
                    rend="italic">Bacclιe.</hi> In this rout were to be seen people intoxicated at
                    once with wine and enthusiasm, dressed like Satyrs, Fauns, and Sileni, in such
                    scandalous postures and attitudes, with so little regard to modesty and even
                    common decency, that we are persuaded our readers will readily enough forgive
                    our omitting to describe them. Next followed a company mounted upon asses,
                    attended by Fauns, Bacchanals, Thyades, Mimallonides, Naiads, Tityri, &amp;c.
                    who made the adjacent places echo to their frantic shrieks and howlings. After
                    this tumultuous herd were carried the statues of Victory, and altars in form of
                    vine-sets, crowned with ivy, smoking with incense and other aromatics. Then
                    appeared several chariots loaded with thyrsi, arms, garlands, casks, pitchers,
                    and other vases, tripods, and vans. The chariots were followed by young virgins
                    of quality, who carried the baskets and little boxes, which in general contained
                    the mysterious articles above enumerated. These, from their office, were called

                    followed them, with the chorus of itophallophori habited like fauns,
                    counterfeiting drunk persons, singing, in honour of Bacchus, songs and catches
                    suited to the occasion. The procession was closed by a troop of Bacchanalians
                    crowned with ivy, interwoven with branches of yew and with serpents.<note

                    women whipped themselves, and tore their skin in a most barbarous manner. The
                    procession terminated on Mount Cithaeron, when it set out from Thebes; and in
                    other places, in some distant unfrequented desert, where the votaries practised
                    every species of debauchery with secrecy and impunity. Orpheus saw the
                    degeneracy of. those ceremonies, and in endeavouring to reform them he probably
                    lost his life. Pentheus suffered in the like attempt, being torn in pieces by
                    the Bacchanalians on Mount Cithaeron, among whom were his own mother and his
                    aunts. The Greeks, who were an airy jovial people, seem to have paid little
                    regard to the plaintive part of the orgia; or rather, we believe, they acted
                    with howling and frantic exclamations, often enhanced by a combination of
                    drunkenness, ecstacy, and enthusiastic fury.</p>
                <p>What secrets, religious, moral, political, or physical, were communicated to the
                    votaries, it is impossible to determine with any degree of certainty. One thing
                    we may admit, namely, that the doctrines discovered and inculcated in the orgia
                    were originally the very same which the apostles of the sect had imbibed in
                    Egypt and Phoenicia, and of which we have given a brief account near the
                    beginning of this article. It is, however, probable, that the spurious or Theban
                    Bacchus had superadded a great deal of his own invention, which, we may believe,
                    was not altogether so sound and so salutary as the original doctrine. However
                    that may be, the initiated were made to believe that they were to derive
                    wonderful advantages from the participation of those rites, both in this life

                    Bacchus, has given a most acute and ingenious explication of the names and
                    epithets of that deity. For our part, we have endeavoured to collect and exhibit
                    such as we judged most important, most entertaining, and most instructive, to
                    the less enlightened classes of our readers.</p>
                <p>We now proceed to the Eleusinian mysteries, which, amongst the ancient Greeks and
                    Romans, were treated with a superior degree of awe and veneration. These were
                    instituted in honour of Ceres, the goddess of corn, who, according to the most
                    authentic accounts, was the Isis of the Egyptians. The mysteries of Osiris and
                    Isis have been hinted at in the preceding part of this article. They were
                    originally instituted in honour of the^ sun and moon, and afterwards consecrated
                    to an Egyptian prince and princess, who, in consequence of their merits, had
                    been deified by that people. We know of no more exact and brilliant description
                    of the ceremonies of that goddess, in the most polished ages of the Egyptian
                    superstition, than what we meet with in the witty and florid Apuleius,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lib. ix.</p></note> to which
                    we must take the liberty to refer our more curious readers. Our business at
                    present shall be to try to investigate by what means, and upon what occasion,
                    those mysteries were introduced into Attica, and established at Eleusis. A
                    passage from Diodorus Siculus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Lib. ì.</p></note> which we shall here translate, will, we
                    think, throw no inconsiderable light on that abstruse part of the subject.</p>
                <p>“In like manner with him (Cecrops), says that judicious historian, they tell us,
                    that Erechtheus, a prince of Egyptian extraction, once reigned at Athens. Of
                    this fact they produce the following evidence. A scorching drought, during the
                    reign of this prince, prevailed over almost all the habitable world except
                    Egypt, which, in consequence of the humidity of its soil, was not affected by
                    that calamity. The fruits of the earth were burnt up, and at the same time
                    multitudes of people perished by famine. Erechtheus upon this occasion, as he
                    was connected with Egypt, imported a vast quantity of grain from that country to
                    Athens. The people, who had been relieved by his munificence, unanimously
                    elected him king. Being invested with the government, he taught his subjects the
                    mysteries of Ceres at Eleusis, and the mode of celebrating the sacred
                    ceremonies, having transferred from Egypt the ritual for that purpose. In those
                    times the goddess is said to have made her appearance at Athens three several
                    times; because, according to tradition, the fruits of the earth which bear her
                    name were then imported into Attica. On this account the seeds and fruits of the
                    earth were said to be the invention of that deity. Now the Athenians themselves
                    acknowledge, that, in the reign of Erechtheus, the fruits of the earth having
                    perished for want of rain, the arrival of Ceres in their country did actually
                    happen, and that along with her the blessing of corn was restored to the earth.
                    They tell us at the same time, that the Teletae and the mysteries of that
                    goddess’ were then received and instituted at Eleusis.”</p>
                <p>Here then we have the whole mystery of the arrival of Ceres in Attica, and the
                    institution of her mysteries at Eleusis, unveiled. The whole is evidently an
                    oriental allegory. The fruits of the earth had been destroyed by a long course
                    of drought. Egypt, by its peculiar situation, had been preserved from that
                    dreadful calamity. Erechtheus, in consequence of his relation to the Egyptians,
                    im ported from their country a quantity of grain, not only sufficient for the
                    consumption of his own subjects, but also a great overplus to export to other
                    parts of Greece, Sicily, Italy, and Spain. Triptolemus, another Egyptian, was
                    appointed by Erechtheus to export this superfluous store. That hero, according
                    to Pherecydes, was the son of Oceanus and Tellus, that is, of the sea and the
                    earth; because his parents were not known, and because he came to Eleusis by
                    sea. The ship in which he sailed, when he distributed his corn to the western
                    parts of the world, was decorated with the figure of a winged dragon; therefore,
                    in the allegorical style of his country, he was said to be wafted through the
                    air in a chariot drawn by dragons. Those creatures, every body knows, were held
                    sacred by the Egyptians.</p>
                <p>Wherever Triptolemus disposed of his corn, thither were extended the wanderings
                    of Ceres. In order to elucidate this point, we must observe, that along with the
                    grain imported from Egypt, Erechtheus, or Triptolemus, or both, transported into
                    Attica a cargo of priests and priestesses from the temples of Busiris, a city
                    which lay in the centre of the Delta,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Herod, lib. i.</p></note> where the goddess Isis had a
                    number of chapels erected for her worship. The presidents of these ceremonies,
                    like all other bigots, gladly laid hold on this opportunity of propagating their
                    religious Tites, and disseminating the worship of the deities of their •country.
                    That the Egyptian priests were zealous in propagating the dogmas of their
                    superstition, is abundantly evident from the extensive spreading of their rites
                    and ceremonies over almost all Asia and a considerable part of Europe. The Greek
                    and Roman idolatry is known to have originated from them; and numberless
                    monuments •of their impious worship are still extant in Persia,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Asiatic Researches, vols. i.
                    and ii.</p></note> India, Japan, Tartary, &amp;c. Our inference then is, that
                    the worship of Isis was introduced into every country where Triptolemus sold or
                    disposed of his commodities. Hence the wanderings of Ceres in search of her
                    daughter Proserpine, who is generally called <hi rend="italic">Coré.</hi> The
                    famine occasioned by ,the drought destroying the fruits of the ground imports
                    the loss of Proserpine. The restoration of the corn in various parts of the
                    earth, by fresh supplies from Egypt from time to time, imports the wanderings of
                    Ceres in quest of Proserpine. The whole process is an oriental allegory. The
                    disappearing of the fruits of the earth, of which Proserpine, or
                    Persephone,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Plutarch,

                    rend="italic">tzaphan</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tzephon,</hi> “abscondit,
                    recondidit.”</p></note> is the emblem, is the allegorical rape -of that goddess.
                    She was seized and carried off by Pluto, sovereign of the infernal regions. The
                    seed committed to the earth in that dry season appeared no more, and was
                    consequently said to dwell under ground with Pluto. It was then that Ceres, that
                    is, corn imported from Egypt, set out in quest of her daughter. Again, when the
                    earth recovered her pristine fertility, the Coré, or maid, was found by her
                    mother Ceres, that is, the earth; for Isis, among the Egyptians, frequently
                    signified the earth. The wanderings of Isis in search of Osiris furnished the
                    model for the peregrinations of Ceres.</p>
                <p>Ceres, the Roman name of the goddess of corn, was unknown to the modern Greeks.
                    They always denominated her <hi rend="italic">Damater,</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Damater is compounded of the Chaldaic
                    particle <hi rend="italic">da,</hi> “the,” and <hi rend="italic">mater,</hi>
                    “mother.” As Isis often signified the earth, the Greeks naturally adopted that
                    title; because, according to them, that element is the mother of all living. In
                    the very same manner they discarded the word <hi rend="italic">Juno,</hi> an
                    original title of the moon, and substituted <hi rend="italic">Hera,</hi> which
                    intimates “mistress or lady.”</p></note> which is rather an epithet than a
                    proper name. The Greeks, who always affected to pass for originals, suppressed,
                    we think, the Egyptian name on purpose to conceal the country of that deity. As
                    a proof of the probability of this conjecture, it may be observed, that <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193827893" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7893-0668"/>they metamorphosed
                    the wanderings of Isis in search of Osiris into the peregrinations of Ceres in
                    quest of Proserpine. The Romans, who were less ambitious of the character of
                    originality, retained one of her oriental names.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to some of the Latin etymologists,
                    <hi rend="italic">Ceres,</hi> or rather <hi rend="italic">Geres,</hi> is derived
                    from <hi rend="italic">gero,</hi> “to bear, to carry,” because the earth bears
                    all things, or because that element is the general fruit-bearer. But as this
                    term came to Italy immediately from the East, and not through the medium of
                    Greece, we would rather incline to adopt an oriental etymology. The Hebrew word
                    <hi rend="italic">cheres</hi> signifies <hi rend="italic">arare,</hi> “to plough
                    a name naturally applicable to the goddess of husbandry.</p></note> Ceres, says
                    Diodorus, appeared thrice in Attica during the reign of Erechtheus, which seems
                    to import that fleets loaded with corn had thrice arrived in that country from
                    Egypt during that period.</p>
                <p>Cecrops, the first king of Attica, had established the worship of the Saitic
                    Athena or Minerva in that region, and consecrated his capital to that deity.
                    Erechtheus, in his turn, introduced the worship of Isis, or Damater, who in all
                    appearance was the tutelar deity of Busiris, his native city. The subjects of
                    Cecrops were a colony of Sai tes, and readily embraced the worship of Minerva;
                    but the aborigines of that district being accustomed to a maritime, perhaps to a
                    piratical course of life, were more inclined to consecrate their city to Neptune
                    the god of the sea, and to constitute him their guardian and protector. Cecrops,
                    by a stratagem, secured the preference to Minerva, his favourite divinity.
                    Erechtheus, in order to give equal importance to his patroness, had the address
                    to institute the Eleusinian mysteries; and, to accomplish his design, laid hold
                    on the opportunity above mentioned.</p>
                <p>This appears to us to be the most probable account of the origin and institution
                    of the Eleusinian mysteries, for which the Sicilian historian has indeed
                    furnished the clue. We shall now proceed to detail some other circumstances
                    which attended the original institution of these far-famed ceremonies.</p>
                <p>The archpriestess who personated the newly imported deity was entertained by one
                    Celeus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Apollod. <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibl.</hi> lib. iii. cap. 13.</p></note> who was either viceroy of
                    that petty district of which Eleusis was the capital, or some considerable
                    personage in that city or its neighbourhood. Upon her immediate arrival,
                    according to the fabulous relations of the Greeks, a farce was acted not
                    altogether suitable to the character of a goddess whose mysteries were one day
                    to be deemed so sacred and austere. These coarse receptions and other
                    indecencies attending the first appearance of the goddess, that is, the Egyptian
                    dame who assumed her character, were copied from the like unhallowed modes of
                    behaviour practised on occasion of the solemn processions of her native country.
                    These scommata, or coarse jokes, had an allegorical signification in Egypt; and
                    amongst the most ancient Greeks the very same spirit was universally diffused by
                    the oriental colonists, who from time to time arrived and settled amongst them.
                    In process of time they abandoned the figurative and allegorical style, in
                    consequence of their acquaintance with philosophy and abstract reasoning. In the
                    ceremonies of religion, however, the same allegorical and typical
                    representations which had been imported from the East were retained; but the
                    Grecian hierophants in a short time lost every idea of their latent import, and
                    religious, moral, or physical interpretation. Accordingly, this shameful
                    rencounter between Ceres and Banbo,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Ibid, <hi rend="italic">ubi supra;</hi> Clem. Alexand. <hi
                    rend="italic">Cohort,</hi> p. 17; where the story is told with very little
                    reserve.</p></note> or Jambe, was retained in the mysteries, though we think it
                    was copied from Egypt, as was said above, where even that obscene action was
                    probably an allegorical representation of something very different from what
                    appeared to the Greeks.</p>
                <p>At the same time that Ceres arrived in Attica, Bacchus likewise made his
                    appearance in that country. He was entertained by one Icarus; whom, as a reward
                    for his hospitality, he instructed in the art of cultivating the vine, and the
                    method of manufacturing wine. Thus it appears that both agriculture and the art
                    of managing the vintage were introduced into Athens much about the same time.
                    Ceres was no other than a priestess of Isis; Bacchus was no doubt a priest of
                    Osiris. The arrival of those two personages from Egypt, with a number of
                    inferior priests in their train, produced a memorable revolution in Athens, both
                    with respect to life, manners, and religion. The sacred rites of Isis,
                    afterwards so famous under the name of the Eleusinian mysteries, date their
                    institution from this period.</p>
                <p>When this company of propagandists arrived at Eleusis, they were entertained by
                    some of the most respectable persons who then inhabited that district. Their
                    names, according to Clemens Alexandrinus, were Banbo, Dysau-lis, Triptolemus,
                    Eumolpus, and Eubulus. From Eumolpus were descended a race of priests called
                    Eumolpidae, who figured at Athens many ages after. Triptolemus was an ox herd,
                    Eumolpus a shepherd, and Eubulus a swine herd. These,were the first apostles of
                    the Eleusinian mysteries. They were instructed by the Egyptian missionaries; and
                    they, in their turn, instructed their successors. Erechtheus, or, as some say,
                    Pandion, countenanced the seminary, and built a small temple for its
                    accommodation in Eleusis, a city of Attica, a few miles west from Athens, and
                    originally one of the twelve districts into which that territory was divided.
                    Here, then, we have arrived at the scene of those renowned mysteries, which for
                    the space of near two thousand years were the pride of Athens and the wonder of
                    the world.</p>
                <p>The mysteries were divided into the greater and lesser. The latter were
                    celebrated at Agrae, a small town on the river Ilyssus; the former were
                    celebrated in the month which the Athenians called Boedromion,<note

                    lesser mysteries, according to the fabulous legends of the Greeks, were
                    instituted in favour of the celebrated Hercules. That hero being commanded by
                    Eurystheus to bring up Cerberus from the infernal regions, was desirous of being
                    initiated in the Eleusinian mysteries before he engaged in that perilous
                    undertaking. He addressed himself to Eumolpus the hierophant for that purpose.
                    There was a law amongst the Eleusinians prohibiting the initiation of
                    foreigners. The priest not daring to refuse the benefit to Hercules, who was
                    both a friend and benefactor to the Athenians, advised the hero to get himself
                    adopted by a native of the place, and so to elude the force of the law. He was
                    accordingly adopted by one Pyolius, and so was initiated in the lesser
                    mysteries, which were instituted for the first time upon that occasion. But this
                    account has all the air of a fable. The lesser mysteries were instituted by way
                    of preparation for the greater.</p>
                <p>The person who was to be initiated in the lesser mysteries, as well as in the
                    greater, was obliged to practise the virtue of chastity a considerable time
                    before his admission. Besides, he was to bind himself by the most solemn vows
                    not to divulge any part of the mysteries. At the same time, he was, according to
                    the original institution, to be a person of unblemished moral character. These
                    were preliminaries <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827906"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-7906-0669"/>indispensably necessary in order to his admission.
                    A bull was sacrificed to Jupiter, and the hide of that animal, called by a
                    peculiar name (Δ/ο; Kωθ∕ov), was carefully preserved and carried to Eleusis,
                    where it was spread under the feet of the initiated. The candidate was then
                    purified by bathing in the river Ilyssus, by aspersions with salt water or salt,
                    with laurel, barley, and passing through the fire; all which rites were attended
                    with incantations and other usages equally insignificant and ridiculous. Last of
                    all, a young sow was sacrificed to Ceres; and this animal, according to the
                    ritual, behoved to be pregnant. Before it was killed it was to be washed in
                    Cantharus, one of the three harbours which formed the Piraeus.</p>
                <p>All these ceremonies being duly performed, the candidate was carried into the
                    hall appointed for the purpose of initiation. There he was taught the first
                    elements of those arcana which were afterwards to be more fully and more clearly
                    revealed in the more august mysteries of Eleusis. The pupils at Agrae were
                    called <hi rend="italic">Mystae,</hi> which may intimate probationers; whereas
                    those of Eleusis were denominated <hi rend="italic">Epoptae,</hi> importing that
                    they saw as they were seen.</p>
                <p>The lesser mysteries were divided into several stages, and candidates were
                    admitted to them according to their quality and capacity respectively. Those who
                    were initiated in the lowest were obliged to wait five years before they were
                    admitted to the greater. Those who had partaken of the second kind underwent a
                    noviciate of three years; those who had been admitted to the third, one of two
                    years; and those who had gone through the fourth were admitted to the greater at
                    the end of one year; which was the shortest period of probation a candidate for
                    that honour could legally undergo. Such was the process generally observed in
                    administering the lesser mysteries.</p>
                <p>With respect to the greater mysteries, it is probable that originally none but
                    the natives of Attica were admitted to partake of them. In process of time,
                    however, the pale was extended so far and wide as to comprehend all who spoke
                    the Greek language. All foreigners were debarred from those sacred rites. They
                    tell us, however, that Hercules, Bacchus, Castor and Pollux, Aesculapius, and
                    Hippocrates, were initiated in an extraordinary manner, from a regard to their
                    high character and heroic exploits. All barbarians, too, were excluded; yet
                    Anacharsis the Scythian was indulged that privilege, in consequence of his
                    reputation for science and philosophy. All persons guilty of manslaughter,
                    though even accidentally or involuntarily, all magicians, enchanters, in a word,
                    all impious and profane persons, were expressly prohibited from sharing the
                    benefit of this Pagan sacrament. At last, however, the gate became wider, and
                    crowds of people, of all nations, kindreds, and languages, provided their
                    character was fair and irreproachable, rushed in by it. In process of time the
                    Athenians initiated even their infants; but this, we imagine, must have been a
                    kind of lustration or purification, from which it was supposed that they derived
                    a kind of moral ablution from vice, and were thought to be under the peculiar
                    protection of the goddess.</p>
                <p>The celebration of the mysteries began on the fifteenth day of the month
                    Boedromion, and, according to most ancient authors, lasted nine days. Meursius
                    has enumerated the transactions of each day, which are much too numerous to fall
                    within the compass of this article; we must therefore refer our curious reader
                    to the author just mentioned. Some days before the commencement of the festival,
                    the praecones, or public criers, invited all the initiated, and all the
                    pretenders to that honour, to attend the festival, with clean hands and a pure
                    heart, and with the knowledge of the Greek language.</p>
                <p>On the evening of the fifteenth day of the month called Boedromion the
                    initiations commenced. Our readers will observe, that all the most sacred and
                    solemn rites of the Pagan superstition were performed during the night; they
                    were indeed generally works of darkness. On this day there was a solemn
                    cavalcade of Athenian matrons from Athens to Eleusis, in carriages drawn by
                    oxen. In this procession the ladies used to rally one another in pretty loose
                    terms, in imitation, we suppose, of the 1siac procession described by Herodotus,
                    which has been mentioned above. The most remarkable object in this procession
                    was the <hi rend="italic">Mundus Cereris,</hi> contained in a small coffer or
                    basket. This was carried by a select company of Athenian matrons, who, from
                    their office, were styled <hi rend="italic">Camphorae.</hi> In this coffer were
                    lodged the comb of Ceres, her mirror, a serpentine figure, some wheat and
                    barley, the pudenda of the two sexes, and perhaps some other articles which we
                    have not been able to discover. The procession ended at the temple, where this
                    sacred charge was deposited with the greatest solemnity.</p>
                <p>We have upon record no description of the temple of Eleusis. Pausanias intended
                    to have described it, but says that he was diverted from his design by a
                    dream.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lib.
                    ix∙</p></note> Strabo informs us, that the mystic sanctuary was as large as a
                    theatre, and that it was built by Ietinus.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="smallcaps">Eleusis.</hi></p></note> In the
                    porch, or outer part of this temple, the candidates were crowned with garlands
                    of flowers, which they call <hi rend="italic">himera,</hi> or “the desirable.”
                    They were at the same time dressed in new garments, which they continued to wear
                    till they were quite worn out. They then washed their hands in a laver filled
                    with holy water; a ceremony which intimated the purity of their hearts and
                    hands. Before the doors were locked, one of the officers of the temple
                    proclaimed with a loud, voice a stern mandate, enjoining all the uninitiated to
                    keep at a distance from the temple, and denouncing the most terrible menaces if
                    any should dare to disturb or pry into the holy mysteries. Ñor were these
                    menaces without effect; for if any person was found to have crowded into the
                    sanctuary, even through ignorance, he was put to death without mercy. Every
                    precaution having been taken to secure secrecy, the initiatory ceremonies now
                    began. But before we describe these, we must lay before our readers a brief
                    account of the ministers and retainers of these secrets of Paganism.</p>
                <p>The chief minister of these far-famed mysteries was the hierophant. He was styled
                    <hi rend="italic">king,</hi> and enjoyed that dignity during life, and was
                    always by birth an Athenian. He presided in the solemnity, as is evident from
                    his title. This personage, as we learn from Eusebius, represented the demiurgus,
                    or creator of the world. “Now, in the mysteries of Eleusis,” says that father,
                    “the hierophant is dressed out in the figure of the demiurgus.” What this
                    demiurgus was, we learn from the same writer. As this whole institution was
                    copied from the Egyptians, we may rest assured that the figure of the Eleusinian
                    demiurgus was borrowed from the same quarter. “As for the symbols of the
                    Egyptians,” says he, quoting from Porphyry,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Pr&lt;∑ραrαliο Εvangelii.</hi></p></note>
                    “they are of the following complexion. The demiurgus, whom the Egyptians call
                    <hi rend="italic">Kneph,</hi> is figured as a man of an azure colour, shaded
                    with black, holding in his right hand a sceptre, and in his left a girdle, and
                    having on his head a royal wing or feather wreathed round.” Such, we imagine,
                    was the equipment of the Eleusinian hierophant. This person was likewise styled
                    <hi rend="italic">prophet.</hi> He was to be of the family of the Eumolpidae;
                    was obliged to make a vow of perpetual chastity<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193827919" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7919-0670"/>; and even his voice, hair,
                    and attitude, were adjusted to the ritual.</p>
                <p>The next minister was the daduchus, or torch-bearer, who, according to the father
                    above quoted, was attired like the sun. This minister resembled the sun, because
                    that luminary was deemed the visible type of the supreme demiurgus, and his
                    vicegerent in governing and arranging the affairs of this lower world.</p>
                <p>The third was the person who officiated at the altar. He was habited like the
                    moon. His office was to implore the favour of the gods for all the initiated. We
                    should rather imagine, that the person at the altar, as he resembled the moon,
                    was intended to represent the goddess herself: for the Egyptian Isis, who was
                    the archetype of Ceres, was sometimes the moon and sometimes the earth.</p>
                <p>The sacred herald was another principal actor in this solemn exhibition. His
                    province was to recite every thing that, according to the ritual, was to be
                    communicated to the novices; and he probably represented Thyoth or Thoth, that
                    is, Hermes or Mercury, the interpreter of the gods.</p>
                <p>Besides these, there were five epimeletae or curators, of whom the king was one,
                    who jointly directed the whole ceremonial. Lastly, There were ten priests to
                    offer the sacrifices. There were no doubt many officers of inferior note
                    employed upon these occasions; but these were only insignificant appendages,
                    whose departments have not been transmitted to posterity.</p>
                <p>After this detail of the ministers of this solemn service, we return to the <hi
                    rend="italic">mystae,</hi> or candidates for initiation. Some of the fathers of
                    the church<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Justin,
                    Eusebius, Clemens Alexandrinus.</p></note> mention a hymn composed by the
                    celebrated Orpheus, which was sung by the mystagogue or king upon that occasion.
                    This hymn appears to us one of those spurious compositions which abounded in the
                    first ages of Christianity, and which the pious apologists often adopted without
                    sufficient examination. That some sacred hymn was chanted upon that occasion, we
                    think highly probable; but that the one in question was either composed by
                    Orpheus, or used at the opening of these ceremonies, to us appears somewhat
                    problematical.</p>
                <p>Before the ceremony opened, a book was produced, which contained every thing
                    relating to the Teletae. This was read over in the ears of the mystae, who were
                    ordered to write out a copy of it for themselves. This book was kept at Eleusis,
                    in a sacred repository, formed by two stones exactly fitted to each other, and
                    of a very large size. This repository was called <hi rend="italic">petroma.</hi>
                    At the annual celebration of the greater mysteries, these stones were taken
                    asunder, and the book taken out, which, after being read to the mystae, was
                    replaced in the same casement.</p>
                <p>The initiations began with a representation of the wanderings of Ceres, and her
                    bitter and loud lamentations for the loss of her beloved daughter. Upon this
                    occasion, no doubt, a figure of that deity was displayed to the mystae, while
                    loud lamentations echoed from every corner of the sanctuary. One of the company
                    having kindled a firebrand at the altar, and sprung to a certain place in the
                    temple, waving the torch with the utmost fury, a second snatched it from him,
                    roaring and waving it in the same frantic manner, and a third, fourth, &amp;c.
                    in the most rapid succession. This was done to imitate Ceres, who was said to
                    have perlustrated the globe of the earth with a flaming pine in her hand, which
                    she had lighted at Mount Aetna.</p>
                <p>When the pageant of the goddess was supposed to arrive at Eleusis, a solemn pause
                    ensued, and a few trifling questions were put to the mystae. What these
                    questions were, is evident from the answers. “I have fasted; I have drunk the
                    liquor; I have taken the contents out of the coffer, and, having performed the
                    ceremony, have put them into the hamper; I have taken them out of the hamper,
                    and put them again into the coffer.” The meaning of these answers, we
                    conjecture, was this: “I have fasted, as Ceres fasted whilst in search of her
                    daughter; I have drunk off the wort, as she drank when given her by Banbo; I
                    have performed what Ceres taught her first disciples to perform, when she
                    committed to them the sacred hamper and coffer.” After these interrogatories,
                    and the suitable responses, the <hi rend="italic">Mundus Cereris</hi> was
                    displayed before the eyes of the mystae, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mystagogus</hi><hi rend="italic">or</hi> hierophant, or perhaps the sacred
                    herald by his command, read a lecture on the allegorical import of those sacred
                    symbols. This was heard with the most profound attention, and a solemn silence
                    prevailed throughout the fane. Such was the first act of this religious farce,
                    which perhaps consisted originally of nothing more.</p>
                <p>After the exposition of the <hi rend="italic">Mundus Cereris,</hi> and the irn-
                    <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> port of her wanderings, many traditions were
                    communicated to the mystae concerning the origin of the universe and <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> the nature of things. The doctrines delivered in the'
                    greater mysteries, says Clemens Alexandrinus, “relate to the nature of the
                    universe. Here all instruction ends. Things are seen as they are; and nature,
                    and the things of nature, are given to be comprehended.” To the same purpose
                    Cicero: “Which points being explained and reduced to the standard of reason, the
                    nature of things, rather than that of the gods, is discovered.” The father of
                    the universe, or the supreme demiurgus, was represented as forming the chaotic
                    mass into the four elements, and producing animals, vegetables, and all kinds of
                    organized beings, out of those materials. They say that they were informed of
                    the secrets of the anomalies of the moon, and the eclipses of the sun and moon;
                    and, according to Virgil,</p>
                <p>Unde hominum genus, et pecudes, unde imber et ignes.</p>
                <p>What system of cosmogony those hierophants adopted, is evident from the passage
                    above quoted from Eusebius; and, from the account immediately preceding, it was
                    that of the most ancient Egyptians, and of the orientals in general. This
                    cosmogony is beautifully and energetically exhibited in Plato’s Timaeus, and in
                    the genuine spirit of poetry by Ovid in the beginning of his Metamorphoses.</p>
                <p>The next scene exhibited upon the stage, on this solemn occasion, consisted of
                    the exploits and adventures of the gods, demigods, and heroes, who had from time
                    to time been advanced to divine honours. These were displayed as passing before
                    the mystae in pageants fabricated for that important purpose. This was the
                    original mode amongst the Egyptians, and was no doubt followed by their
                    Eleusinian pupils. These adventures were probably demonstrated to have been
                    allegorical, symbolical, hieroglyphical; at least they were exhibited in such a
                    favourable point of view, as to dispel those absurdities and inconsistencies
                    with which they were sophisticated by the poets and by the vulgar.</p>
                <p>With respect to the origin of those factitious deities, it was discovered that
                    they had been originally men who had been exalted to the rank of divinity in
                    consequence of their heroic exploits, their useful inventions, or their
                    beneficent actions. This is so clear from the two passages quoted from Cicero by
                    Bishop Warburton,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Divine
                    Legaticn of Moses.</p></note> that the fact cannot be contradicted. But that
                    prelate has not informed us so precisely, whether the mystagogues represented
                    them as nothing more than dead men in their present state, or as beings who were
                    actually existing in a deified state, and executing the functions assigned them
                    in the rubric of Paganism. Another query naturally occurs; that is, to what
                    purpose did the mystagogucs apply this communication<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193827932" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7932-0671"/>? That the hierophants did
                    actually represent those deified mortals in the latter predicament, is obvious
                    from another passage quoted from Cicero by the same prelate. “What think you,”
                    says the illustrious Roman, “of those who assert that valiant, or famous, or
                    powerful men, have obtained divine honours after death; and that these are the
                    very gods now become the objects of our worship, our prayers, and adoration?
                    Euhemerus tells us when these gods died, and where they lie buried. I forbear to
                    speak of the sacred and august rites of Eleusis. I pass by Samothrace and the
                    mysteries of Lemnos, whose hidden rites are celebrated in darkness, and amidst
                    the thick shades of groves and forests.” If, then, those deified mortals were
                    become the objects of worship and prayers, there can be no doubt of the belief
                    of their deified existence. The allusion to the Eleusinian and other Pagan
                    mysteries, towards the close of the quotation, places the question beyond the
                    reach of controversy. But though, according to this account, “there were gods
                    many and lords many,” yet it is evident, frotn the passage quoted from Eusebius
                    in the preceding part of this article, that the unity of the Supreme Being was
                    maintained, exhibited, and inculcated. This was the original doctrine of the
                    hierophants of Egypt. It was maintained by Thales, and all the retainers of the
                    Ionian school. It was the doctrine of Pythagoras, who probably gleaned it up in
                    the country just mentioned, in connection with many other dogmas which he had
                    the assurance to claim as his own.</p>
                <p>But however the unity, and perhaps some of the most obvious attributes, of the
                    Supreme Author of nature, might be illustrated and inculcated, the tribute of
                    homage and veneration due to the subordinate divinities was by no means
                    neglected. The initiated were taught to look to the <hi rend="italic">dii
                    majorum</hi><hi rend="italic">gentium</hi> with a superior degree of awe and
                    veneration, as beings endowed with an ineffable measure of power, wisdom,
                    purity, goodness, &amp;c. These were, if we may use the expression, the prime
                    favourites of the Monarch of the universe, who were admitted into his immediate
                    presence, and who received his behests from his own mouth, and communicated them
                    to his subordinate officers, prefects, lieutenants, and others. These they were
                    exhorted to adore; to them they were to offer sacrifices, prayers, and every
                    other act of devotion, both on account of the excellency of their nature and the
                    high rank they bore at the court of heaven. They were instructed to look up to
                    hero-gods and demigods, as being exalted to the high rank of governors of
                    different parts of nature, as the immediate guardians and protectors of the
                    human race; in short, as gods near at hand, as prompters to a virtuous course,
                    and assistants in it; as ready upon all occasions to confer blessings upon the
                    virtuous and deserving. Such were the doctrines taught in the Teletae with
                    respect to the nature of the Pagan divinities, and the worship and devotion
                    enjoined to be offered them by the mysteries.</p>
                <p>As the two principal ends proposed by these initiations were the exercise of
                    heroic virtues in men, and the practice of sincere and uniform piety by the
                    candidates for immortal happiness, the hierophants had adopted a plan of
                    .operations excellently accommodated to both these purposes. The virtuous
                    conduct and heroic exploits of the great men and demigods of early antiquity
                    were magnified by the most pompous eulogiums, enforced with suitable
                    exhortations to animate the votaries to imitate so noble and alluring an
                    example. But this was not all; the heroes and demigods themselves were displayed
                    in pageants or vehicles of celestial light. Their honours, offices, habitations,
                    attendants, and other appendages, in the capacity of demons, were exhibited with
                    all the pomp and splen dour that the sacerdotal college were able to devise. The
                    sudden glare of mimic light, the melting music stealing upon the ear, the
                    artificial thunders reverberated from the roof and walls of the temple, the
                    appearance of fire and ethereal radiance, the vehicles of flame, the effigies of
                    heroes and demons, adorned with crowns of laurel, emitting rays from every
                    sprig, the fragrant odours and aromatic gales which breathed from every quarter,
                    all dexterously counterfeited by sacerdotal mechanism, must have filled the
                    imagination of the astonished votaries with pictures at once tremendous and
                    transporting. Add to this, that every thing was transacted in the dead of night,
                    amidst a dismal gloom, whence the most bright effulgence instantaneously burst
                    upon the sight. By this arrangement, the aspirants to initiation were
                    wonderfully animated to the practice of virtue while they lived, and inspired
                    with the hope of a blessed immortality when they died. At the same time, their
                    awe and veneration for the gods of their country were wonderfully enhanced by
                    reflecting on the appearances above described. Accordingly Strabo very
                    judiciously observes, “that the mystical secrecy of the sacred rites preserves
                    the majesty of the Deity, imitating its nature, which escapes our apprehension.
                    For these reasons, in celebrating the Teletae, the demons were introduced in
                    their deified or glorified state.</p>
                <p>Butas all the candidates for initiation might not aspire to the rank of heroes
                    and demigods, a more easy and a more attainable mode of conduct, in order to
                    arrive at the palace of happiness, behoved to be opened. Private virtues were
                    inculcated, and these too were to meet a condign reward. But, unhappily, this
                    present life is too often a chequered scene, where virtue is depressed and
                    trodden under foot, and vice lifts up its head and rides triumphant. It is a
                    dictate of common sense, that virtue should sooner or later emerge, and vice
                    sink into contempt and misery. Here, then, the conductors of the mysteries
                    properly and naturally adopted the doctrine of a future state of rewards and
                    punishments. The dogma of the immortality of the human soul was elucidated, and
                    carefully and pathetically inculcated. This doctrine was likewise imported from
                    Egypt; for Herodotus<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Lib. ii.</p></note> informs us, “that the Egyptians were the first people
                    who maintained the immortality of the human soul.” The Egyptian immortality,
                    however, according to him, was only the metempsychosis or transmigration of
                    souls. This was not the system of the ancient Egyptians, nor indeed of the
                    Teletae. In these, a metempsychosis was admitted; but that was carried forward
                    to a very distant period, to wit, to the grand Egyptian period of 36,000
                    years.</p>
                <p>As the mystagogues well knew that the human mind is more powerfully affected by
                    objects presented to the eyes than by the most engaging instructions conveyed by
                    the ear, they made the emblems of Elysium and Tartarus pass in review before the
                    eyes of their novices. There the Elysian scenes, so nobly described by the Roman
                    poet, appeared in mimic splendour; and, on the other hand, the gloom of
                    Tartarus, Charon’s boat, the dog of hell, the furies with tresses of snakes, the
                    tribunal of Minos and Rhadamanthus, &amp;c. were displayed in all their terrific
                    state. Tantalus, Ixion, Sisyphus, the daughters of Danaus, and others, were
                    represented in pageants before their eyes. These exhibitions were accompanied
                    with most horrible cries and bowlings, thunders, lightning, and other objects of
                    terror, which we shall mention in their proper place.</p>
                <p>No contrivance could be better accommodated to animate the pupils to the practice
                    of virtue on the one hand, or to deter them from indulging vicious passions on
                    the other. It resembled opening heaven and hell to a hardened<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193827945" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7945-0672"/> sinner. The practices
                    inculcated in celebrating the mysteries are too numerous to be detailed in this
                    imperfect sketch. The worship of the gods was strictly enjoined, as has been
                    shown above. The three laws, generally ascribed to Triptolemus, were inculcated:
                    1. To honour their parents; 2. To honour the gods with the first fruits of the
                    earth; 3. Not to treat brute animals with cruelty. These laws were imported from
                    Egypt, and were communicated to the Eleusinians by the original missionaries.
                    Cieero makes the civilization of mankind one of the most beneficial effects of
                    the Eleusinian institutions: “Nullum mihi, cum multo eximia divinaque videntur
                    Athenae tuae peperisse; tum nihil melius illis mysteriis, quibus ex agresti
                    immanique vita, exculti ad humanitatem, et mitigati sumus; initiaque, ut
                    appellantur, ita revera principia vitae cognovimus; neque solum cum laetitia
                    vivendi rationem accepimus, sed etiam cum spe meliore moriendi.” Hence it is
                    evident that the precepts of humanity and morality were warmly recommended in
                    these institutions. The virtue of humanity was extended, one may say, even to
                    the brute creation, as appears from the last of Triptolemus’s laws above quoted.
                    Some articles were enjoined in the Teletae which may appear to us of less
                    importance, which, however, in the symbolical style of the Egyptians were
                    abundantly significant. The initiated were “commanded to abstain from the flesh
                    of certain birds and fishes; from beans, from pomegranates and apples, which
                    were deemed equally polluting. It was taught, that to touch the plant of
                    asparagus was as dangerous as the most deadly poison. Now, says Porphyry,
                    whoever is versed in the history of the visions, knows for what reason they were
                    commanded to abstain from the flesh of birds.”</p>
                <p>The initiated then bound themselves by dreadful oaths to observe most
                    conscientiously, and to practise, every precept tendered to them in the course
                    of the Teletae; and at the same time never to divulge one article of all that
                    had been heard or seen by them upon that occasion. In this they were so
                    exceedingly jealous, that Aeschylus the tragedian was in danger of capital
                    punishment for having only alluded to one of the Eleusinian arcana in a tragedy
                    of his; and one of the articles of indictment against Diagoras the Melian was,
                    his having spoken disrespectfully of the mysteries, and dissuaded people from
                    partaking of them. It must, then, be allowed, that the institution of the
                    mysteries was of infinite advantage to the Pagan world. They were indeed a kind
                    of saeraments, by which the initiated bound themselves by a solemn vow to
                    practise piety towards the gods, justice and humanity towards their fellow men,
                    and gentleness and tenderness towards the inoffensive part of the brute
                    creation. The Pagans themselves were so thoroughly convinced of this fact, that,
                    in their disputes with the apologists for Christianity, they often appealed to
                    the Teletae, and contrasted their maxims with the most sublime doctrines of that
                    heavenly institution.</p>
                <p>In order to impress these maxims the more deeply upon the minds of the novices,
                    and to fix their attention more stedfastly upon the lectures which were
                    delivered them by the mystagogue or the sacred herald, a mechanical operation
                    was played off at proper intervals during the course of the celebration.
                    “Towards the end of the celebration,” says Stobaeus, “the whole scene is
                    terrible; all is trembling, shuddering, sweat, and astonishment. Many horrible
                    spectres are seen, and strange cries and howlings uttered. Light succeeds
                    darkness; and again the blackest darkness the most glaring light. Now appear
                    open plains, flowery meads, and waving groves, where are seen dances and
                    choruses; and various holy phantasies enehant the sight. Melodious notes are
                    heard from far, with all the sublime symphony of the sacred hymns. The pupil now
                    is completely perfect, is initiated, becomes free, released, and walks about
                    with a crown on his head, and is admitted to bear a part in the sacred rites.”
                    Aristides <hi rend="italic">(de Myst. Eleus.')</hi> calls Eleusis “a kind of
                    temple of the whole earth, and of all that man beholds done in the most dreadful
                    and the most exhilarating manner. In what other place have the records of fable
                    sung of things more marvellous? or in what region upon earth have the objects
                    presented to the eye borne a more exact resemblance to the sounds which strike
                    the ear? What object of sight have the numberless generations of men and women
                    beheld, comparable to those exhibited in the ineffable mysteries ?” To the same
                    purpose, Pletho, in the oracles of Zoroaster, informs us, “that frightful and
                    shocking apparitions, in a variety of forms, used to be displayed to the mystae
                    in the course of their initiation and a little after, he adds, “that thunder and
                    lightning and fire, and every thing terrible which might be held symbolical of
                    the divine presence, were introduced.” Claudian, in his poem <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Rapta</hi><hi rend="italic">Proserpina,</hi> gives an
                    elegant, though brief, description of this phenomenon, which throws some light
                    upon the passages above quoted.</p>
                <p>Jam mihi cernuntur trepidis delubra moveri Sedibus et claram dispergere culmina
                    lucem, Adventum testata Deae <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> jam magnus ab imis
                    Auditur fremitus terris, templumque remugit Cecropidum.</p>
                <p>The sight of those appearances was called the <hi rend="italic">autopsia.</hi> or
                    “the real presence ;” hence those rites were sometimes called <hi rend="italic"
                    >epoptica.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">epoptae</hi> were actually initiated, and
                    were admitted into the <hi rend="italic">sanctum sanctorum,</hi> and bore a part
                    in the ceremonial; whereas the <hi rend="italic">mystae,</hi> who had only been
                    initiated in the lesser mysteries at Agrae, were obliged to take their station
                    in the porch of the temple. The candidates for initiation bathed themselves in
                    holy water, and put on new clothes, all of linen, which they continued to wear
                    till they were quite torn, and then they were consecrated to Ceres and
                    Proserpine. From the ceremony of bathing, they were denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">hydram</hi><hi rend="italic">ς</hi> and this again was a kind of
                    baptismal ablution. Whether the phrases of <hi rend="italic">washing away sin,
                    putting on the Lord Jesus Christ, putting off the old man with his deeds,
                    putting on a robe of righteousness, being buried in baptism,</hi> the words <hi
                    rend="italic">mystery, perfect, perfection,</hi> which occur so frequently in
                    the New Testament, especially in the writings of the apostle Paul, are borrowed
                    from the Pagan mysteries, or from usages current amongst the Jews, we leave to
                    our more learned readers to determine.</p>
                <p>The epoptae having sustained all those fiery trials, heard and seen every thing
                    requisite, taken upon them the vows and engagements above narrated, and, in a
                    word, having shown themselves good soldiers of Ceres and Proserpine, were now
                    declared perfect men. They might, like Cebes’s virtuous man, travel wherever
                    they chose; those wild beasts (the human passions) which tyrannise over the rest
                    of mankind, and often destroy them, had no longer dominion over them. They were
                    now not only perfect, but regenerated men. They were now crowned with laurel, as
                    was said above, and dismissed with two barbarous words, Koyξ cμ,~αξ, <hi

                    not comprehend the import. They had been introduced by the first Egyptian
                    missionaries, and retained in the sacra after their signification was lost. This
                    was a common practice amongst the Greeks. In the administration of their
                    religious ceremonies, they retained many names of persons, places, things,
                    customs, &amp;c. which had been introduced by the Phoenicians and Egyptians,
                    from whom they borrowed their system of idolatry. These terms constituted the
                    language of the gods, so often mentioned by the prince of poets. To us the words
                    in question appear to be Syriac, and to signify, <hi rend="italic">Be vigilant,

                <p>Numerous and important were the advantages supposed to redound to the initiated,
                    from their being admitted to partake of the mysteries, both in this life and
                    that which is to come. First, they were highly honoured, and even revered by
                    their contemporaries; indeed, they were looked up to as a kind of sacred
                    persons, and were, in reality, consecrated to Ceres and Proserpine. Secondly,
                    they were obliged by their oath to practise every virtue, religious, moral,
                    political, public, and private. Thirdly, they imagined, that sound advice and
                    happy measures of conduct were suggested to the initiated by the Eleusinian
                    goddesses. Accordingly, says Pericles, the celebrated Athenian statesman, “I am
                    convinced, that the deities of Eleusis inspired me with this sentiment, and that
                    this stratagem was suggested by the principle of the mystic rites.” There is a
                    beautiful passage in Aristophanes’s comedy of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ranae</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Act.
                    i.</p></note> to the very same purpose, of which we shall subjoin the following
                    periphrasis. It is sung by the chorus of the initiated :—</p>
                <p>Let us to flow’ry mead repair, With deathless roses blooming, Whose balmy sweets
                    impregn the air, Both hills and dales perfuming.</p>
                <p>Since fate benign our choir has join’d, We’ll trip in mystic measure;</p>
                <p>In sweetest harmony combin’d We’ll quaff full draughts of pleasure.</p>
                <p>For us alone the pow’r of day</p>
                <p>A milder light dispenses;</p>
                <p>And sheds benign a mellow’d ray</p>
                <p>To cheer our ravish’d senses: For we beheld the mystic show, And brav’d Eleusis’
                    dangers, We do and know the deeds we owe To neighbours, friends, and
                    strangers.</p>
                <p>Euripides, in his <hi rend="italic">Bacchae,</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Act i. near the beginning, and in many other
                    places.</p></note> introduces the chorus extolling the happiness of those who
                    had been acquainted with God, by participating in the holy mysteries, and whose
                    minds had been enlightened by the mystical rites. They boast, that “they had led
                    a holy and unblemished life, from the time that they had been initiated in the
                    sacred rites of Jupiter Idaeus, and from the time that they had relinquished
                    celebrating the nocturnal rites of Bacchus, and the banquets of raw flesh torn
                    off living animals.” To this sanctity of life they had no doubt engaged
                    themselves, when they were initiated in the mysteries of that god. The
                    Eleusinian epoptae derived the same advantages from their sacramental
                    engagements. Fourthly, the initiated were imagined to be the peculiar wards of
                    the Eleusinian goddesses. These deities were supposed to watch over them, and
                    often to avert impending danger, and to rescue them when beset with troubles.
                    Our readers will not imagine that the initiated reaped much benefit from the
                    protection of their Eleusinian tutelary deities; but it was sufficient that they
                    believed the fact, and actually depended upon their interposition. Fifthly, the
                    happy influences of the Teletae were supposed to administer consolation to the
                    epoptae in the hour of dissolution; for, says Isocrates, “Ceres bestowed upon
                    the Athenians two gifts of the greatest importance; the fruits of the earth,
                    which were the cause of our no longer leading a savage course of life; and the
                    Teletae, for they who partake of these entertain more pleasant hopes both at the
                    end of life, and eternity afterwards.” Another author tells us,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Aristides, <hi rend="italic"
                    >de My»t. Eleut.</hi></p></note> “that the initiated were not only often rescued
                    from many hardships in their lifetime, but at death entertained hopes that they
                    should be raised to a more happy condition.” Sixthly, after death, in the
                    Elysian fields they were to enjoy superior degrees of felicity, and were to
                    bask, in eternal sunshine, to quaff nectar, and feast upon ambrosia, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The priests were not altogether disinterested in this salutary process. They made
                    their disciples believe that the souls of the uninitiated, when they arrived in
                    the infernal regions, should roll in mire and dirt, and with very great
                    difficulty arrive at their destined mansion. Hence Plato introduces
                    Socrates<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Plato <hi
                    rend="italic">in Phado.</hi></p></note> observing, “that the sages who
                    introduced the Teletae had positively affirmed, that whatever soul should arrive
                    in the infernal mansions <hi rend="italic">unhousell’d</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">unanneal’d,</hi> should lie there immersed in mire and filth.”
                    “And as to a future state,” says Aristides, “the initiated shall not roll in
                    mire and grope in darkness; a fate which awaits the unholy and uninitiated.” It
                    is not hard to conceive with what a commanding influence such doctrines as these
                    must have operated on the generality of mankind.</p>
                <p>When the Athenians advised Diogenes to get himself initiated, and enforced their
                    arguments with the above considerations, “It will be pretty enough,” replied the
                    philosopher, “to see Agesilaus and Epaminondas wallowing in the mire, while the
                    most contemptible rascals who have been initiated are strutting in the islands
                    of bliss.”</p>
                <p>When Antisthenes was to be initiated in the Orphic mysteries, and the priest was
                    boasting of the many astonishing benefits which the initiated should enjoy in a
                    future state,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Diogenes
                    Laertius.</p></note> “Why, forsooth,” says Antisthenes, “’ tis wonder your
                    reverence don’t even hang yourself in order to come at them the sooner.”</p>
                <p>When such benefits were expected to be derived from the mysteries, no wonder if
                    all the world crowded to the Eleusinian standard. After the Macedonian
                    conquests, the hierophants abated much of their original strictness. By the age
                    of Cicero, Eleusis was a temple whither all nations resorted to partake of the
                    benefits of that institution. We find that almost all the great men of Rome were
                    initiated. The hierophants, however, would not admit Nero, on account of the
                    profligacy of his character. Few others were refused that honour; even the
                    children of the Athenians were admitted. But this, we think, was rather a
                    lustration or consecration, than an initiation. Perhaps it paved the way for the
                    more august ceremony, as the Christian baptism does among us for the other
                    sacrament.</p>
                <p>That this institution gradually degenerated, can hardly be questioned; but how
                    much, and in what points, we have not been able to investigate. The fathers of
                    the church, from whom that charge is chiefly to be collected, are not always to
                    be trusted, especially when they set themselves to arraign the institutions of
                    Paganism. There were indeed several ancient authors, such as Melanthius,
                    Menander, Sotades, &amp;c. who wrote purposely on the subject in question; but
                    their works are long since irrecoverably lost. For this reason, modern writers,
                    who have professedly handled it, have not always been successful in their
                    researches. The two who have laboured most indefatigably, and perhaps most
                    successfully, in this field, are Meursius and Warburton. The former, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Liber</hi><hi rend="italic">Singularis,</hi> has collected every
                    thing that can be gleaned from antiquity relating to the ceremonial of these
                    institutions, without, however, pointing out their original, or elucidating the
                    end and import of their establishment. The latter has drawn them into the vortex
                    of a system which has, in many instances, led him to ascribe to them a higher
                    degree of merit than we think they deserve. These instances we would willingly
                    have noticed in our progress, had the limits prescribed us, in treating the
                    subject, admitted such a discussion.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827971" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7971-0674"/>
                <p>If Diodorus the Sicilian may be believed, these mysteries, which were celebrated
                    with such wonderful secrecy at Eleusis, were communicated to all mankind amongst
                    the Cretans. This, however, we think, is rather problematical. We imagine that
                    that excellent historian has confounded the mysteries of Cybele with those of
                    the Eleusinian Ceres. These two deities were undoubtedly one and the same, that
                    is, the moon or the earth. Hence it is probable that there was a striking
                    resemblance between the sacred mysteries of the Cretans and Eleusinians.</p>
                <p>This institution continued in high reputation to the age of St Jerome, as appears
                    from the following passage: “Hierophantae quoque Atheniensium legant usque hodie
                    cicutae sorbitione castrari.” The Emperor Valentinianus intended to have
                    suppressed them; but Zozimus<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Advert. Jovin.</hi></p></note> informs us
                    that he was diverted from his design by the proconsul of Greece. At length
                    Theodosius the elder, by an imperial edict, prohibited the celebration of these
                    as well as of all the other sacra of Paganism. These mysteries, instituted in
                    the reign of Erechtheus, maintained their ground to the period just mentioned,
                    that is, nearly 2000 years, during which space the celebration of them never had
                    been interrupted but once. When Alexander the Great massacred the Thebans and
                    razed their city, the Athenians were so much affected with this melancholy event
                    that they neglected the celebration of that festival.</p>
                <p>There were almost numberless other mysterious institutions among the ancient
                    Pagans, of which these sketched above were the most celebrated. The Samothracian
                    mysteries, instituted in honour of the Cabiri, were likewise of considerable
                    celebrity, and were supposed to confer much the same blessings with the
                    Eleusinian, but were not of equal celebrity. The Cabiri were Phoenician and
                    likewise Egyptian deities.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Sanchoniathon and Herodotus.</p></note> The learned Bochart has explained
                    their origin, number, names, and some part of their worship. The Orphic
                    mysteries were likewise famous among the Thracians. Orpheus learned them in
                    Egypt, and they were nearly the same with the sacrt Bacchanalia of the Greeks.
                    There were likewise the mys teries of Jupiter Idaeus in great request among the
                    Cretans, those of the Magna Mater or Cybele, celebrated ir Phrygia. To enumerate
                    and detail all these would requiro a complete volume. We hope our readers will
                    be fully satisfied with the specimen exhibited above. We are convinced many
                    things have been omitted which might have been inserted, but we have collected
                    the most curious and the most important. (o. o. o. o.)</p>
