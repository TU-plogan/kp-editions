                    money. Some contend that it comes from monere, (quia nota inscripta de calore
                    admonet) because the stamp impressed on coined money indicates its weight and
                    fineness (Bouteroue, Recherches sur les Monnayes de France,p. 1.); and others,
                    that it originates in the circumstance of silver being first coined at Rome in

                    accept either voluntarily or by compulsion, as an equivalent for their labour,
                    and for whatever else they have to dispose of.</p>

                <p>A country in which the division of labour was unknown, and where ever}·
                    individual or family directly produced the commodities necessary for his or
                    their consumption, would have no exchanges, and consequently no money. But,
                    after the division of labour has been established, the introduction of money
                    becomes necessary, or, at least, highly advantageous. A very small part only of
                    a man’s wants is then directly supplied by his own labour. The greater part is
                    indirectly supplied by exchanging that part of the produce of his labour which
                    exceeds his own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men’s labour
                    as he has occasion for, and they are willing to part with. Every man thus lives
                    by exchanging, or becomes in some measure a merchant, and the society itself
                    grows to be what is properly a commercial society.</p>
                <p>“But when the division of labour first began to take place, this power of
                    exchanging must frequently have been very much clogged and embarrassed in its
                    operations. One man we shall suppose, has more of a certain commodity than he
                    himself has occasion for, while another has less. The former, consequently,
                    would be glad to dispose of, and the latter to purchase, a part of this
                    superfluity. But, if this latter should chance to have nothing that the former
                    stands in need of, no exchange can be made between them. The butcher has more
                    meat in his shop than he himself can consume, and the brewer and the baker would
                    each be willing to purchase a part of it; but they have nothing to offer in
                    exchange except the different productions of their respective trades, and the
                    butcher is already provided with all the bread and beer which he has immediate
                    occasion for. No exchange can, in this case, be made between them. He cannot be
                    their merchant, nor they his customers; and they are all of them thus mutually
                    less serviceable to one another. To avoid the inconveniency of such situations,
                    every prudent man, in every period of society, after the establishment of the
                    division of labour, must naturally have endeavoured to manage his affairs in
                    such a manner as to have at all times by him, besides the peculiar produce of
                    his own industry, a certain quantity of some one commodity or another, such as
                    he imagined few people would be likely to refuse in exchange for the produce of
                    their industry.” <hi rend="italic">(Wealth of Nations,</hi> vol. i. p. 43.

                <p>An infinite variety of commodities have been used as money in different countries
                    and states of society. Those nations who chiefly subsist by the chace, such as
                    the ancient Russians, and the greater part of the Indians who now occupy the
                    uncultivated portion of America, use the skins of wild animals as money. <note

                    society cattle are most commonly used for that purpose. Homer tells us, that the

                    also been used as such by the ancient Germans; for their laws uniformly fix the
                    amount of the penalties to be paid for particular offences in cattle. (Storch,
                    <hi rend="italic">in loco citato?)</hi> In remoter ages corn was very generally
                    used, in agricultural countries, as money; and even now, it is by no means
                    uncommon to stipulate for corn rents and wages. Other commodities have been used
                    in different countries. Salt is said to be the common money of Abyssinia <hi
                    rend="italic">(Wealth of Nations,</hi> i. p. 45.); a species of shells, called

                    are used in smaller payments throughout Hindustan, and form the only money of

                    représenter celle des plus menues denrées, on est encore obligé de lui
                    substituer quelque autre matière plus commune. C’est cette circonstance qui a
                    fait adopter aux Indiens l’usage des cauris en guise des petite monnaie. Cet
                    usage pourrait paraitre étrange dans les pays aussi riches et d’une civilisation
                    aussi ancienne que le Bengale et l’Indoustan: mais le cuivre y est si rare, et

                <p>But these commodities are universally deficient in some of the principal
                    requisites which every commodity used as money ought to possess. Products must
                    frequently be brought to market worth only half an ox, or half a skin; but as an
                    ox could not be divided, and as the division of a skin would most probably
                    deprive it of the greater part of its value, it would be impossible to exchange
                    them for such money. Divisibility is not, however, the only indispensable
                    requisite in a commodity used as a medium of exchange. It is necessary that it
                    should admit of being kept for an indefinite period without deteriorating; that
                    it should, by possessing great value in small bulk, be easily transported; and
                    that one piece of money, of a certain denomination, should always be precisely
                    equivalent to every other piece of money of the same denomination. But none of
                    the commodities above named as having been used as money possesses these
                    properties. Though cattle had been sufficiently <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193824201" xml:id="kp-eb0715-4201-0384"/> divisable, they could
                    neither be preserved, nor transported from one place to another, without a great
                    deal of trouble and expence; while, owing to the difference in their qualities,
                    one ox might be worth two or three oxen of an inferior species. It is plain,
                    therefore, that they could not serve as money except in a very rude state of
                    society, when the arts were almost unknown, and when the rearing of cattle
                    formed the principal employment. Corn was sufficiently divisible; but its bulk
                    was far too great in proportion to its value to admit of its easy
                    transportation, and it also was of very different and not. easily appreciated
                    qualities. Salt, sugar, shells, and fish, are all liable to insuperable
                    objections. The values of equal quantities of all of them differ very greatly;
                    some of them cannot be divided, and others cannot be preserved or transported
                    without great loss.</p>
                <p>But the commodities in question were deficient in a still more important
                    particular. Their value was not sufficiently <hi rend="italic">invariable</hi>
                    to permit of their being advantageously used as money. They were not durable
                    commodities, nor was it possible to adjust their supply so as to avoid sudden
                    fluctuations of price. The occasional abundance and scarcity of pasture has a
                    powerful influence on the price of cattle, which is still more seriously
                    affected by the prevalence of epidemical diseases, and other contingencies. The
                    fluctuations in the price of corn, arising from the variations of the seasons,
                    are too striking and obvious to require to be pointed out. And in the islands
                    where cowries are picked up, a strong gale from a particular point of the
                    compass has frequently, in a few hours, sunk their value considerably. It was
                    impossible, therefore, that such commodities could ever be either generally or
                    permanently used as money in civilized societies. No person would willingly
                    exchange the produce of his industry for a commodity which might, in a few
                    weeks, or even days, lose a third, or a half, of its value.</p>
                <p>The desire of uniting the different qualities of invariability of value,
                    divisibility, durability, facility of transportation, and perfect sameness,
                    doubtless formed the irresistible reasons which have induced mankind, in every
                    civilized society, to employ gold and silver as money. The value of these metals
                    is certainly not invariable, but it changes only by <hi rend="italic">slow</hi>
                    degrees; they are divisible into any number of parts, and have the singular
                    property of being easily reunited, by means of fusion, without loss; they do not
                    deteriorate by being kept; and, from their firm and compact texture, they are
                    very difficult to wear; their cost of production, especially of gold, is so
                    considerable, that they possess great value in small bulk, and can, of course,
                    be transported with comparative facility; and an ounce of pure gold and silver,
                    taken from the mines in one quarter of the world, is precisely identical with an
                    ounce of pure gold or silver dug from the mines in any other quarter. No wonder,
                    therefore, when almost all the qualities necessary to constitute money are
                    possessed in so eminent a degree by the precious metals, that they have been
                    used as such, in civilized societies, from a very remote era. They became <hi
                    rend="italic">universal</hi> money, as Μ. Turgot has observed, “not in
                    consequence of any arbitrary agreement among men, or of the intervention of any
                    law, but by the nature and force of things.”</p>
                <p>A considerable period must, however, have elapsed after the introduction of the
                    precious metals into commerce, before they were generally used as money. But, by
                    degrees, the various qualities, which so peculiarly fit them for this purpose,
                    would become obvious; and every individual, in consulting his own advantage,
                    would endeavour to exchange a part, at least, of the produce of his industry for
                    commodities which could be easily concealed or carried about, which did not
                    deteriorate by being kept, and of which he could give a portion equal in value
                    to the value of any other commodity he might afterwards wish to obtain. When
                    first brought to market, gold and silver, like copper, iron, or any other metal,
                    were in an unfashioned state, in bars or ingots. A sheep, an ox, a bushel of
                    wheat, &amp;c. was then bartered for a piece of gold or silver, exactly as it
                    would have been bartered for iron, copper, cloth, or any other commodity. The
                    parties first agreed upon the <hi rend="italic">quality</hi> of the metal to be
                    given for the goods, and the <hi rend="italic">quantity,</hi> which the
                    possessor of the metal had bound himself to pay, was next ascertained by weight.
                    Nor is this a mere conjectural statement, advanced in a later age to explain
                    appearances, and resting on probability only. Aristotle <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Polit,</hi> lib. i. cap. 9∙) and Pliny <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Nat.</hi> lib.
                    33, cap. 3.) tells us, that such was, in fact, the original method by which the
                    precious metals were exchanged in Greece and Italy; and the sacred writings
                    present us with a striking and remarkable example of the prevalence of the same
                    primitive practice in the East. We are there told that Abraham <hi rend="italic"
                    >weighed</hi> four hundred shekels of silver, and gave them in exchange for a
                    piece of ground he had purchased from the sons of Heth, <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Genesis,</hi> chap, xxiii. ver. 16.) It is also mentioned, that this silver
                    was <hi rend="italic">“current money with the merchant?</hi> an expression which
                    evidently refers to its quality only. For, had it been coined, or marked with a
                    stamp, indicating its weight and fineness, it would have been unnecessary to
                    have weighed it. These ancient practices still subsist in various countries. In
                    many parts of China, gold and silver do not circulate as coin under the
                    authority of a public stamp, but their value is always ascertained by weight.
                    When exchanged, they are cut into pieces, supposed to be nearly proportioned to
                    the value of the commodity they are to be given for; and the pieces are then
                    weighed to ascertain their precise value. This practice is also prevalent in
                    Abyssinia and Tonquin.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Before the art of metallurgy was well understood, the baser metals were
                    frequently used as money. Iron was the pimitive money of the Lacedemonians, and
                    copper of the Romans. But both iron and copper deteriorate by being kept; and,
                    besides this defect, the rapid improvement of the arts, and the consequent
                    reduction of their price, speedily rendered their bulk in proportion to their
                    value too great to permit of their continuing to be used as money. Copper,
                    however, is still advantageously used in the form of tokens, convertible into
                    silver in very small payments. In Great Britain, copper pence and halfpence are
                    at present rated at about seventy-two per cent, above their real value; but as
                    the issue of them is exclusively in the hands of government, and as they are
                    legal tender to the extent of one shilling only, in any one payment, this
                    over-valuation has not, for reasons which we shall afterwards explain, had any
                    bad effect.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>The trouble and inconvenience attending the weighing of the quantity of metal in
                    every exchange of gold and silver for commodities must have been early
                    experienced. But the greatest obstacle to the use of unfashioned metals as
                    money, would undoubtedly be found in the difficulty of determining their
                    quality, or the degree of their purity, with sufficient facility and accuracy.
                    The operation of <hi rend="italic">assaying,</hi> is one of great nicety and
                    delicacy; and, notwithstanding all the assistance derived from modern art, it is
                    still no easy matter to ascertain the precise degree of purity of a particular
                    piece of metal. In early ages, such an operation must have been performed in a
                    very clumsy and bungling manner. It is most probable, indeed, that whén the
                    precious metals were first used as money, their quality was appreciated only by
                    their weight and colour. A very short experience<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193824214" xml:id="kp-eb0715-4214-0385"/> would, however, be
                    sufficient to show the extreme inexactness of conclusions derived from such
                    loose and unsatisfactory criteria; and the devising of some method by which the
                    fineness of the metal might be easily and correctly ascertained, would very soon
                    be felt as indispensable to the général use of gold and silver as money. Such a
                    method was not long in presenting itself. It was early discovered, that, to
                    ascertain the purity of the metal, and also to avoid the trouble and expense of
                    weighing it, no more was necessary than to mark each piece with a <hi
                    rend="italic">stamp,</hi> declaring its weight and fineness. Such seem to have
                    been the various steps which led the ancients to the introduction of <hi
                    rend="italic">coined</hi> money (Goguet, <hi rend="italic">De</hi> Z <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Origine</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Loix,</hi> &amp;c. tom. i. p. 269,); an invention of the very greatest utility,
                    and which has, perhaps, contributed more than any other, to facilitate commerce,
                    and to accelerate the progress of civilization and the arts.</p>
                <p>“Without some article of known exchangeable value, such as coin, readily received
                    as an equivalent for other things, the interchange of commodities must have been
                    very limited, and consequently the divisions of labour very imperfectly
                    established. Now, money obviates these evils, and by a twofold operation,
                    augments production. In the first place, it saves all that time and labour
                    which, while the intercourse between man and man is carried on by barter, must
                    frequently intervene before a person can be supplied with the quantity of the
                    commodity which he wants. In the second place, and in consequence of its saving
                    the time and labour which must otherwise be spent in effecting exchanges, it
                    multiplies the transactions of mercantile industry, and thus allows the
                    divisions of employment to be more thoroughly established. By the first
                    operation, it disengages a very considerable portion of labour from an
                    unproductive occupation, and enables it to receive a more useful direction. By
                    the second operation, it increases in a very high degree the productive powers
                    of the labour already usefully employed. It assists every man in availing
                    himself of the skill and dexterity which he may have acquired in any particular
                    calling, and promotes cultivation in a manner suitable to the climate and soil
                    of different districts, and of different countries. And by both these
                    operations, coined money increases to an extent, not easy to be calculated, the
                    wealth of civilized communities.” (Torrens <hi rend="italic">on the Production
                    of Wealth,</hi> p. 305.)</p>
                <p>But, whatever may be the advantages attending the use of coined money, and they
                    are great and obvious, it is necessary to observe, that its introduction does
                    not affect the nature of exchanges. Equivalents are still given for equivalents.
                    The exchange of a quarter of corn for an ounce of pure unfashioned gold bullion,
                    is undeniably as much a real barter, as if it had been exchanged for an ox, or a
                    barrel of beer. But supposing the metal to have been formed into a coin, that
                    is, marked with a stamp indicating its weight and fineness, it is plain that
                    circumstance could have made no change in the terms of the barter. The coinage
                    saves the trouble of weighing and assaying the bullion, but it does nothing
                    more. <hi rend="italic">A coin is merely a piece of metal of a known weight and
                    fineness</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the commodities exchanged for it are
                    always held to be of equal value. And yet these obvious considerations have been
                    very generally Overlooked. Coined money, instead of being viewed in the same
                    light as other commodities, has been looked upon as something quite mysterious.
                    It was said to be both a <hi rend="italic">sign</hi> and a <hi rend="italic"
                    >measure</hi> of value. In truth, however, it is neither the one nor the other.
                    A sovereign is not a sign, ’ it is the thing signified. A promissory note,
                    payable at some stated period, may not improperly be considered as the sign of
                    the specie to be paid for it; but that specie is itself a commodity possessed of
                    real exchangeable worth. It is equally incorrect to call money a measure of
                    value. Gold and sil ver do not measure the value of commodities, more than the
                    latter measure the value of gold and silver. Every thing possessed of value may
                    either measure, or be measured by, every thing else possessed of value. When
                    one’ commodity is exchanged for another, each measures the value of the other.
                    If the quartern loaf were sold for a shilling, it would be quite as correct to
                    say, that a quartern loaf measured the value of a shilling, as that a shilling
                    measured the value of a quartern loaf.</p>
                <p>The quality of serving as a measure of value is, therefore, equally inherent in
                    every commodity. But the slow' degrees by which the precious metals change their
                    value, renders them peculiarly well fitted for forming a standard, by which to
                    compare the values of other and more variable commodities. To this standard
                    reference is almost always made in estimating the value of the products of every
                    civilized country. We do not say, that one man is worth a thousand acres of
                    land, and that another is worth a thousand sheep; but we ascertain for how much
                    gold or silver the land and the sheep would exchange, and then say, that their
                    proprietors are worth so much money. In this, however, there is certainly
                    nothing mysterious. We merely compare the value of one commodity with the value
                    of another; and as coin or money has been found to be the most convenient
                    standard of comparison, the value of all other commodities is usually estimated
                    in it.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, from this statement, that the terms of the exchange of one
                    commodity, or set of commodities, for another, may be adjusted, with reference
                    to money, without any money being actually in the possession of either of the
                    parties making the exchange. If a horse, for example, had commonly sold for ten
                    pieces of silver, an ox for five pieces, and a sheep for one piece, it would
                    mark their relative values to each other, and the animals might be exchanged on
                    this footing without the intervention of money. The frequent recurrence of
                    transactions of this kind seems to have given rise to the notion of an abstract
                    or ideal standard of value. Thus, instead of saying that a horse is worth ten
                    pieces of silver, an ox five pieces, and a sheep one piece, it has been
                    contended that it might equally have been said that they were respectively worth
                    ten points or units, five points or units, and one point or unit; and that, as
                    the proportional values of commodities might be as clearly expressed in these
                    arbitrary terms as in money, or any commodity possessed of real value, the use
                    of the latter, as a standard, might be advantageously dispensed with, and a set
                    of abstract terms adopted in its stead. This, however, is completely mistaking
                    the nature and object of a standard. A standard is not intended to mark the
                    known relations between different commodities, but to enable us easily to
                    discover those which are unknown. Now, although the series of arbitrary terms
                    may serve extremely well for the first of these purposes, it is utterly
                    impossible that they can ever serve for the second. This, however, is
                    exclusively the object of a standard; and it is quite plain that nothing can be
                    used as such which is not possessed of the same properties as the things with
                    which it is to be compared. To measure length, a standard must have length; to
                    measure value, it must have value. The value of commodities is ascertained by
                    separately comparing their cost with the cost of money, and we express their
                    relation to each other by simply stating the result of our inquiries; that is,
                    by mentioning the number of livres, of pounds, or of fractions of a pound, they
                    are respectively worth. And, when any new commodity is offered for sale, or when
                    any change is made in the cost of an old one, we ascertain their relation to the
                    rest, by merely comparing them with a livre or a pound. It is plainly
                    impossible, however, that we could have done this, had the terms livre, or
                    pound, been purely arbitrary, and referable to no really valuable article. We
                    might as well try to estimate distances by an imaginary inch, or an imaginary
                    foot, as to estimate prices or values by an imaginary shilling, or an imaginary
                    sovereign. When we say <pb break="no" facs="nls:193824227"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-4227-0386"/> that an ox is worth five pounds, and a sheep only
                    one, we really mean no more than that, when an ox and a sheep are compared
                    together, that is, when the one serves as a standard by which to estimate the
                    value of the other, one ox is found to be worth five sheep. But, suppose that we
                    wish to ascertain what is the relative value of some other commodity; of a pound
                    of tea, for example; to oxen or sheep, of what use would it be to be told that
                    one ox was worth five sheep, or that, when the value of an ox was represented by
                    the imaginary term “five pounds,” the value of a sheep was represented by the
                    imaginary term “one pound?” It is not the relation between oxen and sheep, but
                    the relation between these animals and tea, that we are desirous of learning.
                    And, although this relation may be learned by comparing the cost of producing
                    oxen and sheep with the cost of producing tea, or by ascertaining for how much
                    of some other commodity an ox, a sheep, and a pound of tea, will respectively
                    exchange, it is obvious it could never be learned by comparing them with a set
                    of arbitrary terms or symbols! It would not, in truth, be more absurd to attempt
                    to ascertain it by comparing them with the hieroglyphics on an Egyptian
                    sarcophagus. Nothing that will not exchange for something else, can ever be a
                    standard, or measure of value. Commodities are always compared with commodities
                    and not wich abstract terms. Men go to market with real values, and not with the
                    signs of values in their pockets. And it is to something possessed of real
                    worth, to the gold contained in a sovereign and not in the word sovereign, that
                    they always have referred, and must continue to refer, in estimating value.<note

                    Montesquieu has often been referred to in proof of the existence of an ideal
                    standard :—“Les noirs de la cote d’Afrique ont un signe des valeurs sans
                    monnoie; c’est un signe purement idéal fondé sur le degré d’estime qu’ils
                    mettent dans leur esprit à chaque marchandise, à proportion du besoin qu’ils en
                    ont; one certaine denrée, ou marchandise, vaut trois macutes; one autre, six
                    macutes; one autre, dix macutes; c’est comme s’ils disoient simplement trois,
                    six, dix. Le prix se forme parla comparaison qu’ilsfont de toutes les
                    marchandises entre elles: pour lors, il n’y a point de monnoie particulière,
                    mais chaque portion de marchandise est monnoie de l’autre·" (Esprit des Loix,
                    livre xxii. cap. 8.)</p><p>But, instead of giving any support to the notion of
                    an abstract standard, this passage might be confidently referred to in proof of
                    its nonexistence. Had Montesquieu said that the blacks determined the values, or
                    prices, of commodities, by comparing them with the arbitrary term macute, the
                    statement, though false, would have been at least in point. But he says no such
                    thing. On the contrary, he states distinctly, that the relative values of
                    commodities (marchandises) are ascertained by comparing them with each other
                    (entre elles), and that it is merely the result of the comparison that is
                    expressed in arbitrary terms.</p><p>So much for the weight to be attached to
                    this statement, supposing it to be well-founded. The truth is, however, that the
                    term macule is not really arbitrary, and employed only to mark an ascertained
                    proportion, but that it has a reference to, and is, in fact, the name of an
                    intrinsically valuable commodity, “On a bien dit,” says l’Abbé Morellet, “que ce

                    p. 121.)</p><p>The following extract from Park’s Travels gives an example of a
                    similar kind: “In the early intercourse of the Mandingoes with the Europeans,
                    the article that attracted most notice was iron. Its utility in forming the
                    instruments of war and husbandry made it preferable to all others; and iron soon
                    became the measure (standard) by which the value of all other commodities was
                    ascertained. Thus a certain quantity of goods, of whatever denomination,
                    appearing to be equal to a bar of iron, constituted, in the trader’s
                    phraseology, a bar of that particular merchandise. Twenty leaves of tobacco, for
                    instance, were considered as a bar of tobacco; and a gallon of spirits (or

                    being reckoned equal in value to a bar of another commodity. As, however, it
                    must unavoidably happen, that, according to the plenty or scarcity of goods at
                    market, in proportion to the demand, the relative value would be subject to
                    continual fluctuation, greater precision has been found necessary; and, at this
                    time, the current value of a single bar of any kind is fixed by the whites at
                    two shillings sterling. Thus, a slave, whose price is L15, is said to be worth

                <p>In common mercantile language, the giving of money for a commodity is termed <hi
                    rend="italic">buying,</hi> and the giving of a commodity for money, <hi
                    rend="italic">selling. Price,</hi> unless when the contrary is particularly
                    mentioned, always means the value of a commodity rated in money.</p>
                <p>FIaving thus endeavoured to explain the circumstances which led to the
                    introduction of money, and to shew wl at it really is, and what it is not, we
                    shall now proceed to investigate the laws by which its value is regulated. It is
                    chiefly from the prevalence of erroneous opinions on this subject, that the
                    theory of money has been so much misunderstood.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Circumstances which
                    Regulate the Exchangeable Value of Money.</hi></p>
                <p>This branch of our subject naturally divides itself into two parts: 1 st, an
                    inquiry into the principles which regulate the exchangeable value of money when
                    the power to supply is not monopolised; and, 2d, an inquiry how far these
                    principles are liable to be affected by the operation of mono-po!y.</p>
                <p>I. There does not now seem to be much room for difference of opinion respecting
                    the circumstances that regulate the value of the precious metals, and their
                    distribution throughout the various countries of the globe. Bullion is a
                    commodity, on the production of which competition operates without restraint. It
                    is not subjected to any species of monopoly, and its value in exchange must,
                    therefore, be entirely regulated by the cost of its production, that is, by the
                    quantity of labour required to bring a given quantity of it to market.</p>
                <p>If, in every stage of society, it required precisely the same quantity of labour
                    to produce a given quantity of bullion, its value would be <hi rend="italic"
                    >invariable</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and it would constitute a standard by
                    which the variations in the exchangeable value of all other commodities could be
                    <hi rend="italic">correctly</hi> ascertained. But this is not the case either
                    with bullion or any thing else. And its value fluctuates in the same way as that
                    of other commodities, not only according to the greater or less productiveness
                    of the mines from which it is extracted, but also according to the comparative
                    skill of the miners, and the improvements of machinery.</p>
                <p>Μ. Say has, in his work on <hi rend="italic">Political Economy,</hi> a chapter
                    “De la valeur que la qualité d’être monnoie ajouté à one marchandise.” But a
                    little reflection will convince us, that Μ. Say is mistaken, and that the
                    circumstance of the precious metals being used as money cannot affect their
                    value. Μ. Say reasons on the common hypothesis, that an increase of demand is
                    always productive of an increase of value, an assumption totally at variance
                    with principle and fact. Value depends upon the cost of production; and it is
                    obvious that the cost of producing a commodity may be diminished, whilst the
                    demand for it is increasing. This is so plain a proposition, as hardly to
                    require to be substantiated by argument.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193824240" xml:id="kp-eb0715-4240-0387"/>
                <p>And a reference to the case of cotton goods, the price of which has,
                    notwithstanding the vast increase of demand, been constantly on the decline
                    during the last half century, is enough to convince the most sceptical of the
                    extreme erroneousness of Μ. Say’s conclusion. But, with regard to the particular
                    case of the precious metals, it is clear the capital devoted to the production
                    of gold and silver must yield the common and ordinary rate of profit; for, if it
                    yielded more than that rate, there would be an influx of capital to the mining
                    business; and, if it yielded less, it would be withdrawn, and vested in some
                    more lucrative employment. And hence, though the demand for gold and silver
                    should, from the adoption of some other commodity as an instrument of exchange,
                    gradually become less, the value of the precious metals would not, on that
                    account, be reduced. A smaller supply would, indeed, be annually brought to
                    market, and a portion of the capital formerly engaged in the mining, refining,
                    and preparing of the metals, would be disengaged; but as the whole stock thus
                    employed yielded only the average rate of profit, the portion which is not
                    withdrawn must continue to do so; or, which is the same thing, gold and silver
                    must still continue to sell for the same price. It is no doubt true, that where
                    mines are, as they almost always are, of different degrees of productiveness,
                    any great falling off in the demand for bullion might, by rendering it
                    unnecessary to work the inferior mines, enable the proprietors of the richer
                    mines to continue their work, and to obtain the ordinary rate of profit on their
                    capitals, by selling bullion at a reduced price. In this case the value of
                    bullion would be really diminished; but it would be diminished, not because
                    there was a falling off in the demand, but because there was a <hi rend="italic"
                    >greater facility of production.</hi> On the other hand, an increased demand for
                    bullion, whether it arose from the general suppression of paper money, or from a
                    greater consumption of gold and silver in the arts, or from any other cause,
                    would not, unless it were necessary, in order to procure the increased supply,
                    to have recourse to less productive mines, be accompanied by any rise of price.
                    If the mines from which the additional supplies were drawn were less productive
                    than those already wrought, more labour would be necessary to procure the same
                    quantity of bullion, and, of course, its price would rise. But, if no such
                    increase of labour was required, its price would remain stationary, though a
                    thousand times the quantity formerly required should be demanded.</p>
                <p>After gold and silver have been brought to market, their conversion into coin or
                    manufactured articles, depends entirely on a comparison of the profits that may
                    be derived from each operation. No bullion would be taken to the mint if it
                    would yield a greater profit by sending it to a silversmith; and no silversmith
                    would work up bullion into plate, if he could turn it to greater account by
                    converting it into coin. The value of bullion and coin must, therefore, in
                    countries where the expenses of coinage are defrayed by the state, nearly
                    correspond. When there is any unusual demand for bullion in the arts, coin is
                    melted down; and when, on the contrary, there is any unusual demand for coin,
                    plate is sent to the mint, and the equilibrium of value maintained by its
                    fusion.</p>
                <p>It appears, therefore, that whilst competition operates without restraint on the
                    production of gold and silver, they are, like all other things, produced under
                    similar circumstances, valuable only in proportion to the cost of their
                    production; that is, in proportion to the quantity of labour necessarily
                    expended in bringing them to market. And hence, while they constitute the
                    currency of the commercial world, the price of commodities, or their value
                    compared with gold or silver, will vary, not only according to the variations in
                    the exchangeable value of the commodities themselves, but also according to the
                    variations in the value of the gold or silver with which they are compared.</p>
                <p>II. But if competition were not allowed to operate on the production of the
                    precious metals, if they could be monopolised and limited in their quantity,
                    their exchangeable value would no longer be regulated by the same principles.
                    If, after the limitation, they still continued to be used as money, and if, in
                    consequence of the improvement of society, manufactured commodities and valuable
                    products should be very much multiplied, the exchanges which this <hi
                    rend="italic">limited</hi> amount of money would have to perform would be
                    proportionably increased; and, of course, a proportionably smaller sum would be
                    appropriated to each particular transaction; or, which is the same thing, money
                    prices would be diminished. Whenever the supply of money is <hi rend="italic"
                    >fixed,</hi> the amount of it, given in exchange for commodities, must <hi
                    rend="italic">vary inversely as the demand, and can be affected by nothing
                    else.</hi> If double the usual supply of commodities be brought to market in a
                    country with a limited currency, their money price will be reduced a half; and
                    if only half the usual supply be brought to market, it will be doubled; and
                    this, whether the cost of their production be increased or diminished. Produce
                    is not then exchanged for money, on the ground that it is a commodity capable of
                    being advantageously used in the arts, or that an equal quantity of labour has
                    been expended on its production; but because it is the universal equivalent used
                    by the society, and that, as such, it will be willingly received for the produce
                    belonging to others. The remark of Anacharsis, the Scythian, that gold and
                    silver coins seemed to be of no use but to assist in numeration and arithmetic,
                    (Hume’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on Money),</hi> would, if confined to a strictly
                    <hi rend="italic">limited currency,</hi> be as just as it is ingenious.
                    Sovereigns, livres, dollars, &amp;c., would then really constitute mere tickets
                    or counters, for computing the value of property, and transferring it from one
                    individual to another. And as small tickets or counters, would serve for this
                    purpose quite as well as large ones, it is unquestionably true, that a debased
                    currency may, by first reducing, and then limiting its quantity, be made to
                    circulate at the value it would bear if the power to supply it were
                    unrestricted, and if it were possessed of the legal weight and fineness; and, by
                    still further limiting its quantity, it might be made to pass at any higher
                    value.</p>
                <p>Thus it appears, that whatever may be the <hi rend="italic">material</hi> of the
                    money of any country, whether it consist of gold, silver, copper, iron, leather,
                    salt, cowries, or paper, and however destitute it may be of all <hi
                    rend="italic">intrinsic</hi> value, it is yet possible, by <hi rend="italic"
                    >sufficiently limiting its quantity,</hi> to raise its value in exchange to any
                    conceivable extent.</p>
                <p>Suppose the money of Great Britain consists of50,000,000 or 60,000,000 of one
                    pound notes, and that we are prevented from increasing or diminishing this sum,
                    either by issuing additional notes or coins, or by withdrawing the notes already
                    in circulation; it is obvious that the quantity of commodities for which such
                    notes would exchange, would increase or diminish precisely according to the
                    increase or diminution of the commodities brought to market. If we suppose that
                    ten times the amount of products that were offered for sale when the limitation
                    of the currency took place, are offered for sale ten or twenty years afterwards,
                    and that the rapidity of circulation has continued the same, prices will have
                    fallen to <hi rend="italic">one-tenth</hi> of their former amount; or, which is
                    the same thing, the exchangeable value of the paper money will have increased in
                    a tenfold proportion; and, on the other hand, if the products brought to market
                    had diminished in the same proportion, the exchangeable value of the paper money
                    will have been equally reduced.</p>
                <p>The principles we have now stated are of the utmost importance to a right
                    understanding of the real nature of money. Previously to the publication of Mr.
                    Ricardo’s <hi rend="italic">Principles of Political Economy,</hi> every writer
                    of authority maintained, that the value of money depended entirely on the
                    relation between its amount and the demand. But this is <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193824253" xml:id="kp-eb0715-4253-0388"/> true only of a gold or
                    silver currency when its quantity is <hi rend="italic">limited,</hi> and of a
                    currency formed of materials having little intrinsic worth, as paper, when its
                    quantity is <hi rend="italic">limited,</hi> and it is not made convertible, at
                    the pleasure of the holder, into some more valuable commodity, the production of
                    which is under no restraint. It is obvious, indeed, without any reasoning on the
                    subject, that the value of a currency that costs little or nothing, can only
                    depend on the proportion which its amount bears to the commodities brought to
                    market, or to the business it has to perform. And wherever a currency of this
                    kind, or a limited gold currency, is in circulation, the common opinion, that
                    the prices of commodities arc regulated exclusively by the proportion between
                    the quantity of them brought to market, and the supply of money, and that any
                    considerable increase or diminution of either will proportionally affect prices,
                    is quite correct. It is altogether different, however, with a currency
                    consisting of gold or silver, or of any other commodity possessed of
                    considerable value, and the supply of which may be increased to an unlimited
                    extent by the operation of unrestricted competition.</p>
                <p>The fluctuations in the supply of, and demand for, such money, have no permanent
                    effect on its exchangeable value; this depends exclusively on the comparative
                    <hi rend="italic">cost of its production. If a</hi> sovereign commonly exchanges
                    for a couple of bushels of wheat, or a hat, it is because the same labour is
                    required for its production as for that of either of these commodities; while,
                    if with a limited and inconvertible paper money, they exchange for a one pound
                    note, it would be because such was the proportion which, as <hi rend="italic">a
                    part of the mass of commodities offered for sale, they bore to the supply of
                    paper or money in the market.</hi> This proportion would, it is evident, be not
                    only immediately, but permanently, affected by an increase or diminution either
                    of paper or commodities. But the relation which commodities bear to a freely
                    supplied metallic currency, could not be permanently changed, except by a change
                    in the cost of producing the commodities or the metals.</p>
                <p>Our readers must not conceive from what is now stated, that we mean to contend
                    that the value of gold or silver is never affected by variations of supply and
                    demand. Such an opinion would be altogether erroneous. At the same time it must
                    be admitted, that their value is much less affected by such variations, than
                    that of almost any other commodity. Their great durability precludes the
                    possibility of any sudden diminution of their quantity, while the immense
                    surface over which they are spread, and the various purposes to which they are
                    applied, prevent any unusual productiveness of the mines from speedily lowering
                    their value. An extraordinary event, such as the discovery of America, or the
                    establishment of an intercourse between a country where bullion bore a high
                    value, and one where its value, from the greater facility of its production, was
                    comparatively low, would, by causing a sudden exportation and importation, raise
                    its value in the one country, and sink it in the other. But such events must
                    necessarily be of very rare occurrence. And although the different
                    productiveness of the mines, to which, in the progress of society, recourse must
                    be had, and the successive improvements in the art of mining and working metals,
                    must render the value of gold and silver very different at distant periods, it
                    is abundantly uniform to secure us against all risk of sudden and injurious
                    fluctuations.</p>
                <p>Such are the circumstances which regulate the value of money; first, when the
                    power to supply it is not subjected to any species of monoply; and, second, when
                    it is monopolised and limited. In the former case, its value depends, like that
                    of all other commodities, on the cost of its production; while, in the latter
                    case, its value is totally unaffected by that circumstance, and depends entirely
                    on the extent to which it has been issued, compared with the demand.</p>
                <p>The conclusions deducible from the fundamental principle we have thus endeavoured
                    to establish, are of the utmost importance. A metallic currency, on the coinage
                    of which a high seignorage or duty was charged, and a paper currency not
                    convertible into the precious metals, were occasionally seen to circulate at the
                    same value with a metallic currency of full weight, and which had been coined at
                    the expence of the state. But no rational or consistent explanation of these
                    apparently anomalous results could be given until the effects produced by
                    limiting the supply of money had been accurately appreciated. Now, however, that
                    this has been done, all these difficulties have disappeared. The theory of money
                    has been perfected, and we are enabled to shew what, under any given
                    circumstances, would be the effect of imposing a seignorage, or of issuing an
                    inconvertible paper currency.</p>

                <p>The government of almost every country has retained the power of coining
                    exclusively in its own hands. In antiquity this privilege was reserved merely to
                    prevent the confusion that must attend the circulation of coins of different
                    denominations were individuals permitted to issue them at pleasure, and to give
                    the public greater security, that the stamp should truly indicate the weight and
                    fineness of the metal.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    1692.</p></note> But in more modern times it has been used not only as a means
                    of affording a better guarantee to the public, but also of increasing the
                    revenues of the state. As to the expediency of this, however, much difference of
                    opinion has existed. It has been contended that the state ought in no
                    circumstances to charge any duty on coined money; and that the expences of the
                    mint should always be defrayed by the public. In this opinion we cannot concur;
                    and it appears to us that the reasoning of Dr. Smith, in favour of a moderate
                    seignorage, is quite unanswerable. No good reason has yet been given why those
                    who want coins should not have to pay the expences of manufacturing them.
                    Coinage, by saving the trouble and expence attending the weighing and assaying
                    of bullion, indisputably adds to the value of the precious metals. It renders
                    them fitter to perform the functions of a circulating medium. A sovereign is of
                    greater value than a piece of pure unfashioned gold bullion of the same weight;
                    and for this plain reason, that while it is equally well adapted with the
                    bullion for being used in the arts, it is better adapted for being used as
                    money, or in the exchange of commodities. Why <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi>
                    then should government be prevented from charging <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    seignorage, or duty on coins, equal to the expences of the coinage, or, which is
                    the same thing, to the value which ic adds to the bullion? Those who contend
                    that the state ought to defray the expence of the coinage, might, with equal
                    cogency of reasoning, contend that it ought to defray the expence of
                    manufacturing gold and silver tea-pots, vases, &amp;c. In both cases the value
                    of the raw material, or bullion, is increased by the cost of workmanship. And it
                    is only fair and reasonable, that those who carry bullion to the mint as well as
                    those who carry it to the jewellers, should have to pay the expences necessarily
                    attending its conversion into coin.</p>
                <p>But there are other reasons why a seignorage, to this extent at least, ought to
                    be exacted. Wherever the expences <pb break="no" facs="nls:193824266"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-4266-0389"/> of coinage are defrayed by the state, an ounce of
                    coined gold or silver, and an ounce of gold or silver bullion, must be very
                    nearly of the same value. And, hence, whenever it becomes profitable to export
                    the precious metals, coins, in the manufacture of which a considerable expence
                    has been incurred, are sent abroad indifferently with bullion. It has indeed
                    been attempted, by prohibiting the exportation of coins, to prevent the loss
                    that may thus be occasioned; but these efforts have proved singularly
                    ineffectual, and have, indeed, been abandoned in this and most other countries.
                    Admitting, however, that it were possible, which most certainly it is not, to
                    prevent, or at least, materially limit, the-clandestine exportation of coins, it
                    is conceded on all hands to be quite nugatory to attempt to prevent their
                    conversion into bullion. In this there is almost no risk. And the security with
                    which their fusion can be effected, and the trifling expences attending it, will
                    always enable them to be melted down and sent abroad whenever there is any
                    unusual foreign demand for the precious metals. This exportation would, however,
                    be either prevented or materially diminished by the imposition of a seignorage
                    or duty, equal to the expence of the coinage. The coins being, by this means,
                    rendered more valuable than bullion, would be kept at home in preference: and
                    if, as Dr. Smith has observed, it became necessary on any emergency to export
                    coins, they would, most likely, be reimported. Abroad they would be only worth
                    so much bullion, while at home they would be worth this much, and the expence of
                    coinage besides. There would, therefore, be an obvious inducement to bring them
                    back, and the supply of currency would be maintained at its proper level,
                    without its being necessary for the mint to issue fresh coins.</p>
                <p>Besides relieving the country from the useless expences attending the coinage of
                    the money exported to other countries as an article of commerce, the imposition
                    of a moderate seignorage would either totally prevent, or at least lessen that
                    fusion of the heavier coins, which always takes place whenever a currency
                    becomes degraded or deficient in weight Previously to the great recoinage in
                    1773, the quantity of bullion contained in the greater number of the gold coins
                    in circulation was reduced nearly two per cent, below the mint standard; and, of
                    course, the price of gold bullion, estimated in this degraded currency, rose two
                    per cent, or from £3, 17s. and 10½d., its mint price, to £4. This, however, was
                    too minute a difference to be taken into account in the ordinary business of
                    buying and selling. And the possessors of coins fresh from the mint, or of full
                    weight, not obtaining more produce in exchange for them than for the lighter
                    coins, sent the former to the melting pot and then sold them as bullion. But it
                    is easy to see that this fusion would have been effectually prevented had the
                    coins been loaded with a seignorage of two per cent. The heavy coins could not
                    then have been melted without losing the value given them by the seignorage; and
                    this being equal to the excess of the market price of bullion above the mint
                    price, nothing would have been gained by the melters. Had the seignorage been
                    less than the average degradation of the coin, or two per cent.; had it, for
                    example, been only one per cent, all those coins whose value was not more than
                    one per cent, degraded below their mint standard, might have been melted; but if
                    the seignorage had exceeded two per cent, no coins whatever could have been
                    melted until the degradation had increased to the same or a greater extent.</p>
                <p>This reasoning proceeds throughout on the supposition that the coins on which the
                    seignorage is charged are not issued in excess. If they were, the above
                    mentioned consequences would not follow. Their too great multiplication might
                    sink them even below their value as bullion, and occasion their immediate fusion
                    or exportation. So long, however, as the state only coins the bullion brought to
                    the mint by individuals, there is no risk of this happening. No one, we may
                    depend upon it, will ever carry bullion to that establishment, and pay the
                    expences of its coinage, unless the coins be thereby rendered so much more
                    valuable than the unfashioned metal.</p>
                <p>Should the government choose to buy bullion, and coin money on its own account,
                    it might, by a little attention, easily avoid all over-issue. Suppose the
                    seignorage were two per cent., then any given weight of coins of the mint
                    standard ought, provided the currency be not redundant, to purchase two per
                    cent, more than the same weight of bullion. So long, therefore, as this
                    proportion is preserved between coined money and bullion, it shews that the
                    proper supply of currency has been issued. If the value of the coins decline
                    below this limit, too many of them must have got into circulation; and, if, on
                    the contrary, their value increase, the supply is too limited, and an additional
                    quantity may be advantageously issued.</p>
                <p>It is easily seen, from the principles already established, that it is not
                    necessary that the charge for seignorage should be limited to the mere expences
                    of coinage. It may, without injury to any individual, be carried considerably
                    farther. Provided the amount of the coins on which a seignorage is imposed, be
                    limited to the amount that previously circulated in the country, its imposition,
                    to whatever height it might be carried, would not affect their exchangeable
                    value. The state having the exclusive privilege of coining, no additional supply
                    of money could be brought to market. And supposing the business of the society
                    to continue the same; that is, supposing the same quantity of commodities are
                    brought to market, and exchanged for the same amount of coins of the same
                    denomination, it is clear prices could not be in any way affected. Invariability
                    of value is the great desideratum in money; and provided this be maintained, as
                    it always may be, by properly limiting the quantity in circulation, it is of no
                    consequence whether the weight of the coins be increased or diminished. A hat
                    that had previously to the imposition of the seignorage sold for a sovereign
                    would still fetch one. The sovereign, it is true, has been diminished in size;
                    but as its value is increased in proportion to this diminution, and as small
                    coins are equally well adapted to serve every purpose of a circulating medium as
                    those that are larger, the society would not suffer any inconvenience from that
                    circumstance. It is certain, indeed, that if the monopoly were not rigorously
                    enforced, or if individuals were permitted to issue supplies of money from
                    private mints, free from the charge of seignorage, the increase of quantity
                    would speedily sink the value of the whole coins in circulation to a level with
                    the cost of those produced on the lowest terms; so that the coins on which a
                    high seignorage had been charged, would not be more valuable than those exempted
                    from that charge. But, wherever the supply of money is limited, and competition
                    excluded, this principle ceases to operate, and its value is then dependent upon
                    the proportion which the total quantity in circulation bears to the total
                    demand. This principle is farther elucidated in a very able article on
                    seignorage, by Mr. Tooke, printed <hi rend="italic">in the Appendix (p.</hi>
                    180) <hi rend="italic">To the Lords' Report of</hi> 1819∙</p>
                <p>It must not, however, be concealed, that if it were attempted to charge a very
                    high seignorage, it would be extremely difficult to limit the supply of coins.
                    The inducement to counterfeit money would, under such circumstances, be very
                    greatly increased, while the chances of detection would be very much diminished.
                    It would not then be necessary, in order to derive a profit from counterfeit
                    coins, that they should be manufactured of a baser metal. The saving of a heavy
                    charge on account of seignorage might of itself afford a sufficient profit; and
                    this could be derived, though the metal contained in the forged coins were of
                    the standard purity. But, though it might, for this reason, and most probably
                    would, be quite impossible to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193824279"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-4279-0390"/> limit the supply of currency, and consequently to
                    sustain its value, were an exorbitant seignorage charged, the same difficulty
                    would not stand in the way of a moderate one. The nefarious business of
                    counterfeiting could not be carried on did it not yield a sufficient premium to
                    the forgers to indemnify them for the risks and odium to which they are exposed.
                    A seignorage less than this would be no encouragement to the issue of
                    counterfeit coins. And though it might be difficult to form any very precise
                    estimate of what this premium might be, it is pretty certain it would not be
                    under from four to five per cent.</p>
                <p>It appears from an account inserted in the appendix to the Report drawn up by the
                    Lords in 1819, that new gold coins, of the value of £74,501,586, had been issued
                    by the mint between the lst January 1760, and the 13th April 1819· To this sum
                    we have to add nearly fifty millions since issued, making in all an issue of
                    about one hundred and twenty-four or one hundred and twenty-five millions of
                    gold coins since the accession of George III. But the seignorage was remitted in
                    the reign of Charles II.; and it appears from the accounts published by Mr.
                    Ruding and others that £28,172,149 of new gold coins were issued in the period
                    between the accession of James II. (1685) and the demise of George II.; so that,
                    in all, upwards of one hundred and fifty-two millions of gold coins have been
                    coined at the expence of the state, and issued since the remission of the
                    seignorage. We shall be considerably within the mark, if we estimate the average
                    annual expence attending this coinage at L.l 2,000,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lord Liverpool states, that the entire
                    expences of the mint, from 1777 to 1803, amounted to L∙488,441, which gives an
                    average expenditure of L.18,786 a-year. (Liverpool οη Coins, p. 1Õ6.)</p></note>
                    and, on this supposition, it will be found that the expence of the coinage of
                    gold only has amounted, during the one hundred and fifty-two years which have
                    elapsed since the accession of James II., to £1,824,000. But, if a low
                    seignorage of no more than three or four per cent, had been charged on the gold
                    coins, it would have produced four and a half or six millions; a sum which might
                    have been collected without injury to any individual, and which, besides
                    defraying the entire expences of the coinage, would have left a considerable
                    surplus revenue.</p>
                <p>In his evidence before the Lords’ Committee in 1819, Mr. Mushet stated, that,
                    with the improved machinery now in use in the mint, gold coin could be
                    manufactured for about 10s. per cent. <hi rend="italic">(Minutes of
                    Evidence,</hi> p. 207.) And the expence of the manufacture of the silver coin
                    may, we believe, be taken at about three times as much, or one and a half per
                    cent. In France the coinage of gold costs 0∙29 per cent., and silver l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 50 per cent.; in Russia the gold costs 0∙85, and the
                    silver 2 ’ 95 per cent. (Storch, tom. vi. p. 74.)</p>
                <p>The precise period when a seignorage began to be charged upon English silver
                    coins has not been ascertained. It must, however, have been very early. Mr.
                    Ruding mentions, that in a mint account of the 6th Henry III., one of the
                    earliest he had met with, the profit on £3,898, 0s. 4d. of silver coined at
                    Canterbury, is stated to be £97, 9s∙, being exactly 6d. a-pound, of which the
                    king had £60, 18s. 3½d., and the bishop the residue. <hi rend="italic">(Annals
                    of the British Coinage,</hi> vol. i. p. 179, 4to. ed.) In the 28th Edward I. the
                    seignorage amounted to Is. 2½d. per pound, 5½d. being allowed to the master of
                    the mint, to indemnify him for the expences of coinage, and 9d. to the crown as
                    its profit. Henry VI. increased the master’s allowance to 10d. and ls. 2d., and
                    the king’s to ls. and2s. In the reign of Edward IV. the seignorage varied from
                    4s. 6d. to Is. 6d. It was reduced to Is. in the reign of Henry VII.; but was
                    prodigiously augmented in the reigns of his successors, Henry VIII. and Edward
                    VI., whose wildand arbitrary measures produced, as will be afterwards shewn, the
                    greatest derangement of the currency. During the lengthened reign of Elizabeth,
                    the seignorage varied from Is. 6d. to 2s. per pound; at which sum it continued,
                    with very little variation, until the 18th of Charles II. (1666), when it was
                    totally remitted.</p>
                <p>From this period down to 1817, no seignorage was charged on the silver coin; but
                    a new system was then adopted. Silver having been underrated in relation to gold
                    in the mint proportion of the two metals fixed in 1718, heavy silver coins were
                    withdrawn from circulation, and gold only being used in all the larger payments,
                    it became, in effect, what silver had formerly been, the standard of the
                    currency. The act 56th Geo. HL, regulating the present silver coinage, was
                    framed not to interfere with this arrangement, but so as to render silver
                    entirely subsidiary to gold. For this purpose it is made legal tender only to
                    the extent of 40s.; and 66s. instead of 62s∙ are coined out of a pound of troy,
                    the 4s. being retained as a seignorage, which, therefore, amounts to 6½⅜ per
                    cent. The power to issue silver is vested exclusively in the hands of
                    government; who have it, therefore, in their power to avoid throwing too much of
                    it into circulation, and consequently to prevent its fusion, until the market
                    price of silver shall have risen to above 5s. 6d. an ounce.</p>
                <p>This arrangement was censured in the debates on the question of returning to cash
                    payments in 1819- It was contended that the overvaluation of silver with respect
                    to gold would render it the interest of every debtor to discharge his debts with
                    silver, and that the gold coins would in consequence be driven from circulation,
                    and exported to other countries. The result has shewn that this opinion was
                    altogether erroneous. Debtors cannot discharge their debts by silver payments,
                    for it is only legal tender to the extent of 40s.; and no creditor can be
                    compelled, or would be disposed to take it in payment of a larger debt, except
                    at its real value.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Those

                <p>In the 18th of Edward HL, the period when we begin to have authentic accounts of
                    the gold coinage, a pound troy of gold bullion was coined into florins, of the
                    value of L.15: Of this sum only L.l 3, 16s∙ 6d. were given to the person who
                    brought the bullion to be coined, L.l, 3s. 6d. being retained as seignorage, of
                    which 3s. 6d. went to the Master, and L.l, to the King: But it appears, from the
                    mint indentures, that the seignorage on the coinage of nobles for the same year
                    amounted to only 8s. 4d. And, from this remote period to the accession of the
                    Stuarts, with the exception of the coins issued in the 4th and 5th Edward IV.
                    and the 34th, 36th, and 37th Henry VIIL, the total charge of coining a pound
                    weight of gold bullion seldom exceeded 7s. or 8s. money of the time. In the 2d
                    James I., a pound weight of gold bullion was coined into L.40, 10s; a seignorage
                    of L.l, 10s. being deducted, 6s. 5d. of which went to the Master, and L.l, 3s.
                    7d. to the Crown. The seignorage on gold was remitted at the same time (18th
                    Charles II.) with the seignorage on silver, and has not since been revived.<note

                    necessities and caprices. It was, indeed, hardly possible that it should have
                    been otherwise. Our ancestors were totally ignorant of the prin <pb break="no"

                    to which the imposition of a seignorage can alone be rendered advantageous. They
                    considered it as a tax which might be increased and diminished at pleasure. And,
                    far from taking any steps to limit the quantity of coin in circulation, so as to
                    maintain its value, they frequently granted, to corporate bodies, and even to

                    considered as a most unjust and oppressive tax, and that its abolition should
                    have been regarded as a very advantageous measure.</p>
                <p>Besides the revenue arising from the seignorage, our kings formerly derived a
                    small revenue from the <hi rend="italic">remedy</hi> or <hi rend="italic"

                    every particular, of weight and purity, with a given standard, a small allowance
                    is always made to the master of the mint, whose coins are held to be properly
                    executed, provided their imperfections, whether on the one side or the other, do
                    not exceed this allowance, or remedy. Its amount has varied very little since
                    the reign of Edward HL; having, during this long period, generally been
                    one-eighth part of a <hi rend="italic">carat,</hi> or 30 grains of pure gold per
                    pound of gold bullion, and two penny weight of pure silver per pound of standard
                    silver bullion. By the law of 1816, the remedy for gold coins is fixed at 12
                    grains per lb. in the weight, and one-sixteenth part of a carat in the fineness.
                    The remedy for silver is the same as before.</p>
                <p>It does not appear that our princes derived any considerable advantage from the
                    <hi rend="italic">remedy</hi> previously to the reign of Elizabeth. But she, by
                    reducing the master’s allowance for the expence of coinage from Is. 2d. to 8d.
                    obliged him to come as near as possible to the <hi rend="italic">lowest</hi>
                    limit allowed by the remedy. Had the coins been delivered to those who brought
                    bullion to the mint by <hi rend="italic">τveight,</hi> the queen, it is plain,
                    would have gained nothing by this device; but, in the latter part of her reign,
                    and the first seventeen years of that of her successor, James I., they were
                    delivered by <hi rend="italic">tale,</hi> so that the crown saved, in this way,
                    whatever additional sum it might otherwise have been necessary to pay the master
                    for the expences of coinage. In the great recoinage in the reign of William
                    III., the profit arising from the remedy amounted to only 8s. on every hundred
                    pounds weight of bullion; and the coinage is now conducted with so much
                    precision, and the coins issued so near to their just weight, that no revenue is
                    derived from this source.</p>
                <p>The continental princes have, we believe, without any exception, charged a
                    seignorage on the coinage of money. In France, this duty was levied at a very
                    early period. By an ordonnance of Pepin, dated in 755, a pound of silver bullion
                    is ordered to be coined into twenty-two pieces, of which the master of the mint
                    was to retain <hi rend="italic">one,</hi> and the remaining twenty-one were to
                    be delivered to the merchant bringing the bullion to the mint. (Le Blanc, p.
                    87.) There are no means of ascertaining the amount of the seignorage taken by
                    the successors of Pepin, until the reign of Saint Louis (1226—1270), who coined
                    the <hi rend="italic">marc</hi> of silver into 58 sols, while he only delivered
                    54 sols, 7 deniers, to the merchant; at this period, therefore, the seignorage
                    amounted to a sixteenth part of the marc, or to 6f <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi>
                    per cent. It was subsequently increased or diminished without regard to any
                    fixed principle. In the great recoinage in 1726, it amounted, on the gold coin,
                    to 7 <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅝ per cent., and to 5 ® per cent, on silver.
                    In 1729, the mint price, both of gold and silver, were augmented, and the
                    seignorage on the former reduced to 5∣⅜ per cent., and on the latter to 4⅜ per
                    cent. A farther reduction took place in 1755 and 1771, when the seignorage on
                    gold was fixed at l <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> L percent., and on silver at
                    l½ξ <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> per cent. At this moment, the seignorage in
                    France hardly covers the expence of coinage, being only about ⅜ per cent, on
                    gold, and 1∣ per cent, on silver.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    consisting of the Precious Metals.</hi></p>
                <p>The imposition of a moderate seignorage has, however, but a very inconsiderable
                    effect in reducing the expence of a metallic currency. This, which is much
                    greater than is generally imagined, does not consist in the coinage, which is
                    comparatively trifling, but in the great amount of gold and silver required for
                    the purpose. If, for example, the currency of Great Britain consisted wholly of
                    gold, it would amount to at least fifty millions of sovereigns; and if the
                    customary rate of profit were six per cent., it would cost <hi rend="italic"
                    >three</hi> millions a-year: For had this fifty millions not been employed as
                    money, it would have been vested in branches of industry in which, besides
                    affording employment to thousands of individuals, it would have yielded six per
                    cent, or three millions a-year, of nett profit to its possessors. But this is
                    not the only loss. The fifty millions would not merely be withheld from the
                    great work of production, and the country deprived of the revenue derived from
                    its employment, but it would be perpetually diminished. The wear and tear of the
                    coins is by no means inconsiderable; and supposing the expences of the coinage
                    were defrayed by a moderate seignorage, the deficiency in the weight of the old
                    worn coins must, on their being called in to be recoined, be made up by the
                    public. There is, besides, a constant loss from shipwrecks, fire, and other
                    accidents. When due allowance is made for these causes of waste, it would not,
                    perhaps, be too much to suppose, that a country , which had fifty millions of
                    gold coins in circulation, would have annually to import the hundredth part of
                    this sum, or half a million of coins to maintain its currencv at its proper
                    level.</p>
                <p>Thus it appears, that w ere the customary rate of profit in Great Britain six per
                    cent., it would cost 3½ millions a-year to maintain fifty millions of gold coins
                    in circulation. It is indeed true, that a reduction of the rate of profit would
                    proportionally reduce the amount of this expence, though as the reduced expence
                    would still bear the same proportion to the total income of the country that the
                    higher expence did, the real cost of the currency would not be at all
                    diminished. The case of France furnishes a still more striking example of the
                    heavy charges attending the general use of a metallic currency. The amount of
                    the gold and silver currency of that kingdom has been estimated by Necker at
                    2,200 millions of francs, and by Peuchet at 1,850 millions. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Statistique Elémentaire</hi><hi rend="italic">de la France, ρ. 473.)</hi> Now,
                    supposing the lowest estimate to be the most correct, and taking the rate of
                    profit at six per cent., this currency must cost France an hundred and eleven
                    millions of francs a-year, exclusive of the wear and tear and loss of the coins,
                    which being taken, as before, at the hundredth part of the entire mass, will
                    make the whole annual expence amount to the sum of an hundred and twenty-two
                    millions of francs, or to nearly <hi rend="italic">five millions</hi> sterling.
                    This heavy expence certainly forms a very material deduction from the advantages
                    resulting from the use of a currency consisting entirely of the precious metals,
                    and has doubtless been the chief <pb break="no" facs="nls:193824305"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-4305-0392"/> cause why all civilized and highly commercial
                    countries have endeavoured to fabricate a portion of their money of less
                    valuable materials. It has not, however, been the only cause. It is obvious,
                    that were there nothing but coins in circulation, the conveyance of large sums
                    from place to place to discharge accounts, would be a very laborious process;
                    and that even small sums could not be conveyed without considerable difficulty.
                    Of the substitutes calculated alike to save expence and to lessen the cost of
                    carriage, paper is in every respect the most eligible, and has been by far the
                    most generally adopted. By using it instead of gold, we substitute the cheapest
                    in the place of the most expensive currency; and enable the society to exchange
                    all the coins which the use of paper renders superfluous, for raw materials, or
                    manufactured goods, by the use of which both its wealth and enjoyments are
                    increased. It is also transferred with the utmost facility. Hence since the
                    introduction of bills of exchange, most great commercial transactions have been
                    adjusted by means of paper only; and has also been used to a very great extent
                    in carrying on the ordinary business of society.</p>

                <p>In the earliest periods, subsequent to the invention of writing and paper, the
                    pecuniary engagements of individuals would be committed to the latter. This
                    gives security to the creditor, that he shall be able to claim the full amount
                    of his debts, and to the debtor, that he shall not be liable to any overcharge;
                    and avoids the differences which are sure to arise where the terms of contracts
                    are not distinctly specified. But a very short time only would elapse before
                    individuals, having written obligations from others, would begin to transfer
                    them to their debtors; and after the advantages derivable from employing them in
                    this way had been ascertained, it was an obvious source of emolument for persons
                    in whose wealth and discretion the public had confidence to issue their
                    obligations to pay certain sums, in such a form as might fit them for performing
                    the functions of a circulating medium in the ordinary transactions of life. No
                    one would refuse to accept as money the promissory note or obligation of an
                    individual of large fortune, and of whose solvency no doubt could be
                    entertained. But as full value must have been originally given for the
                    promissory note, it is clear that whilst its continuance in circulation could be
                    no loss to the public, it would be a very great source of profit to the
                    issuer.</p>
                <p>Suppose, for example, that a merchant issues a promissory note for L.l 0,000, he
                    must, previously to putting it in circulation, either have received an
                    equivalent sum of money, or of some sort of produce possessed of real value, or,
                    which is by far the most common case, he must have advanced it to an individual
                    who has given him security for its repayment with interest. In point of fact,
                    therefore, the issuer has exchanged his <hi rend="italic">promise to pay</hi>
                    L.l 0,000 for the profits to be derived from the employment of a real capital of
                    that amount; and as long as the promissory note, the intrinsic worth of which
                    cannot well exceed a sixpence, remains in circulation, he will, supposing
                    profits to be five per cent., receive from it a revenue of Lu500 a-year. It is
                    on this principle that the business of banking is conducted. A banker could make
                    no profit were he obliged to keep dead stock or bullion in his coffers, equal to
                    the amount of his notes in circulation. But if he be in good credit, a fourth or
                    a fifth part of this sum will perhaps be sufficient; and his profits, after the
                    expenses of the establishment, and of the manufacture of his notes, are
                    deducted, will be measured by the <hi rend="italic">excess</hi> of the profit
                    derived from his notes in circulation, over that which he might have realised by
                    employing the stock kept in his coffers to meet the demands of the public. “A
                    bank would never be established, if it obtained no other profits but those
                    derived from the employment of its own capital: its real advantage commences
                    only when it employs the capital of others.” <hi rend="italic">(Proposals for an
                    Economical and Secure Currency,</hi> p. 87.)</p>
                <p>As no means have been devised to limit the supply of the promissory notes issued
                    by private individuals, their value, it is plain, could not be maintained were
                    the issuers to fall into discredit, or relieved from their promise to pay them.
                    But it is otherwise with the promissory notes issued" by the state, or by a
                    company acting under its control. The quantity of such notes may be effectually
                    limited; and we have seen that, when this is the case, intrinsic worth is not
                    necessary to a currency, and that, by properly regulating the supply of paper
                    declared to be legal tender, its value may be sustained on a par with gold, or
                    any other commodity. It was by acting on this principle of limitation, that the
                    value of the paper of the bank of England was maintained in the interval between
                    the passing of the restriction act in 1797, and the commencement of bullion
                    payments in 1820. No rational explanation of this circumstance, so much at
                    variance with all the old theories of paper money, can be deduced from any other
                    principle. The fact of their being depreciated never creates any indisposition
                    on the part of the public to apply for accommodation to a bank whose notes are
                    legal tender. The presenter of a bill for discount is indifferent whether the
                    notes given in exchange for it are pavable in specie or not. His object, in
                    resorting to the bank, is to exchange his promissory note for money; that is,
                    for paper that will be received in payment of his debts, or of whatever he may
                    wish to purchase. It is, therefore, of no consequence to him, whether the
                    issuers of paper, have, by issuing in excess depressed its value relatively to
                    gold, or whether they have so restricted their issues as to sustain its value on
                    a level with the value of that metal. These circumstances, it is true, affect
                    the interests of all those classes whose incomes do not vary with the variations
                    in the value of money; but, in as much as the prices of goods rise and fall with
                    the increase or diminution of paper, merchants, who are the principal demanders
                    of discounts, are comparatively but little affected by its fluctuations. The
                    presenter of a bill for L.500 or L.l 000 to a bank, has received it. if it have
                    arisen out of a real commercial transaction, in lieu of a certain quantity of
                    goods, which, at the then value of money, were worth L.500 or L.1000; and it is
                    this sum which, by presenting the bill to the bank, he wishes to obtain. If the
                    value of money had been different, the price of the goods, and consequently the
                    sum for which the bill was drawn, would also have been different. It is to this
                    market value of money at the time that attention is exclusively paid in
                    commercial transactions. When, in 1809, 1810, 1811, 1812, 1813, and 1814, Bank
                    of England paper was depressed from excess from ten to twenty-five per cent,
                    below the value of bullion, the circumstance of an act of Parliament having
                    declared, that it should be paid in cash at the restoration of peace, had as
                    little effect in raising its value, as its depreciation had in diminishing the
                    applicants for discounts. The truth is, that individuals never resort to a bank
                    for paper money, unless they have immediate occasion for it. As soon as it has
                    been obtained, they throw it upon the market, for whatever it will bring; and as
                    they purchased it on the same terms, (for it is seldom that the value of money
                    is materially affected in the short interval between the time when a bill is
                    discounted and becomes due,) they generally get as much for it, and perhaps
                    more, than it cost. We shall immediately explain what constitutes the natural
                    limit to the applications for discounts; but we have said enough to show, that
                    it has nothing to do with the convertibility of notes into cash.</p>
                <p>Those who have recourse to a bank to obtain discounts <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193824318" xml:id="kp-eb0715-4318-0393"/> of accommodation bills,
                    consider like the presenters of real bills, only the present value of money.
                    Accommodation bills are never discounted, excepting in the view of immediately
                    employing the money, either in the purchase of commodities, or of labour, or in
                    the payment of debts; and, whether one pound notes be of the value of 1 Os. or
                    20s. is obviously of no consequence; in as much as the amount of the bill
                    presented for discount is regulated accordingly.</p>
                <p>The circumstance that country bank notes cease to circulate as soon as any
                    suspicion is entertained of the solvency of their issuers, is nowise
                    inconsistent with this principle. Country bank notes are exchangeable, at the
                    pleasure of the holder, for Bank of England notes; but from the restriction in
                    1797 down to 1820, the latter not being exchangeable for any thing else,
                    constituted the real standard of value. Hence when a country bank lost credit,
                    the circulation of its notes was stopped, from its being believed that it would
                    be impossible to obtain Bank of England paper in their stead; or, in other
                    words, that they would not exchange for that description of paper which
                    constituted the real medium of exchange. But, it is impossible to imagine, that
                    this paper should itself be affected by a want of credit. Every one knew that it
                    had no intrinsic worth; and as already shown, its value was regulated, (and
                    must, whenever it is not rendered exchangeable for a given quantity of some
                    other commodity, continue to be exclusively regulated,) by the amount in
                    circulation compared with the demand.</p>
                <p>It appears, therefore, that if there were perfect security, that the power of
                    issuing paper money would not be abused; that is, if there were perfect security
                    for its being issued in such quantities, as to preserve its value relatively to
                    the mass of circulating commodities nearly equal, the precious metals might be
                    entirely dispensed with, not only as a circulating medium, but also as a
                    standard to which to refer the value of paper.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, however, no such security can be given. This is a point,
                    respecting which there can be no difference of opinion. We have it in our power
                    to appeal to a widely extended and uniform course of experience; to the history
                    of Great Britain, and of every other country in Europe, and to that of the
                    United States; to show that no man, or set of men, have ever been invested with
                    the power of making unrestricted issues of paper money without abusing it; or,
                    which is the same thing, without issuing it in inordinate quantities. If the
                    power to supply the state with paper money be vested in a private banking
                    company, then to suppose that they should, by limiting their issues, endeavour
                    constantly to sustain the value of paper, would be to suppose that they should
                    be attentive only to the public interest, and neglect their own private
                    interest. The re-enactment of the restriction act, would not have the least
                    effect on the value of paper, provided its quantity were not at the same time
                    increased. But who can doubt that, in such circumstances, it would be increased?
                    Such a measure would enable the Bank of England to exchange bits of engraved
                    paper, not worth perhaps five shillings a quire, for as many, or the value of as
                    many hundreds of thousands of pounds. And is it to be supposed, that the
                    directors and proprietors of the bank should not avail themselves of such an
                    opportunity to amass wealth and riches? If government enable a private gentleman
                    to exchange a bit of paper for an estate, will he be deterred from doing so by
                    any considerations about its effect in sinking the value of the currency? In Loo
                    Choo we might perhaps meet with such an individual, but if we expect to find him
                    in Europe, we shall most likely be disappointed. Here we are much too eager in
                    the pursuit of fortune to be at all influenced by such scruples. It is
                    essential, therefore, that the issuers of paper money should be placed under
                    some check or control; and the comparatively steady value of the precious
                    metals, at once suggests that none can be so effectual as to lay them under the
                    obligation of exchanging their notes, at the pleasure of the holder, for a <hi
                    rend="italic">given and unvarying quantity</hi> of gold or silver.</p>
                <p>It has, however, been contended, that there is a material difference between
                    paper issued by government in payment of its debts, and that issued by a private
                    banking company in discount of good bills. In regard to the former, it is
                    admitted on all hands that it may be issued in excess; but in regard to the
                    latter, it has been strenuously urged, that “notes issued only in proportion to
                    the demand, in exchange for good and convertible securities, payable at specific
                    periods, cannot occasion any excess in the circulation, or any depreciation.” As
                    all the arguments advanced by those who contended that the paper of Great
                    Britain was not depreciated between 1797 and 1819, involve this principle, it
                    may be worth while to examine it a little minutely.</p>
                <p>In the first place, it may be observed, that the demand for discounts does <hi
                    rend="italic">not</hi> depend on the nature of the security required for their
                    repayment, but on the rate of interest for which they may be obtained, compared
                    with the ordinary rate of profit made by their employment. If an individual can
                    borrow £10,000, £100,000, or any greater sum, at 4, 5, or 6 per cent., and if he
                    can realise 7, 8, or 10 per cent, by its employment, it is evidently for his
                    interest, and it would be for the interest of every other person similarly
                    situated, to borrow to an unlimited extent. But a banking company, relieved of
                    all obligation to pay its notes in ca*h, and not, of course, obliged to keep any
                    unproductive stock or bullion in its coffers, would be able to issue its notes
                    at the lowest possible rate of interest; and the demand for its paper would
                    therefore be proportionally great.</p>
                <p>“The interest of money,” says Mr. Ricardo, “is not regulated by the rate at which
                    the bank will lend, whether it be 5, 4, or 3 per cent., but by the rate of
                    profit which can be made by the employment of capital, and which is totally
                    independent of the quantity or of the value of money. Whether the bank lent one
                    million, ten millions, or a hundred millions, they would not permanently alter
                    the market rate of interest; they would alter only the value of the money which
                    they thus issued. In one case, ten or twenty times more money might be required
                    to carry on the same business than what might be required in the other. The
                    applications to the bank for money, then, depend on the comparison between the
                    rate of profit that may be made by the employment of it, and the rate at which
                    they are willing to lend it. If they charge less than the market rate of
                    interest, there is no amount of money which they might not lend; if they charge
                    more than that rate, none but prodigals and spendthrifts would be found to
                    borrow of them. We accordingly find that when the market rate of interest
                    exceeds the rate of five per cent., at which the bank uniformly lends, the
                    discount office is besieged with applicants for money; and, on the contrary,
                    when the market rate is even temporarily under five per cent., the clerks of
                    that office have no employment.” <hi rend="italic">(Principles of Political
                    Economy,</hi> p. 511.)</p>
                <p>From 1809 to 1815 inclusive, the period in which the value of our paper currency
                    relatively to gold was lowest, the market rate of interest considerablv exceeded
                    the rate' (five per cent.) at which the Bank of England and most or the country
                    banks invariably lent. Although, therefore, the amount of paper currency had, in
                    that interval, been very much increased, the applicants for fresh discounts
                    continued as numerous as ever. And there seems no reason to doubt, had the
                    directors not been apprehensive that, ultimately, they might have to pay their
                    notes in specie, that the amount in circulation would have been very much
                    increased; at least, such would certainly have been the case, had they acted to
                    the full extent of their avowed opinion, that it was impossible to issue too
                    much paper, or to reduce its value, by engrossing into the circulation such
                    quantities as were issued in discount of good bills. The wants of commerce are
                    altogether insatiable. Inconvertible paper money, provided <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193824331" xml:id="kp-eb0715-4331-0394"/> the rate of interest at
                    which bills are discounted be less than the market rate, can never be too
                    abundant. As long as this is the case, million after million may be thrown upon
                    the market. The value of the currency may be so reduced as to require a one
                    pound note to purchase a quartern loaf; but the circumstance of its value being
                    diminished in proportion to the increase of its quantity, would render the
                    demand for additional supplies as great as ever.</p>
                <p>Were the Bank of England to discover a process whereby sovereigns could be
                    manufactured with the same facility as notes, it could not be disputed that it
                    would be in her power to depreciate the value of gold, by making large issues of
                    what bad been produced at so very little cost. Now, in what respect would this
                    fictitious case differ from the actual situation of the Bank, were the
                    restriction act renewed and. made perpetual? The Bank would then be able,
                    without check or control, to exchange her paper for landed property,
                    manufactured goods, government securities, &amp;c. But we have seen, that the
                    value of this paper, like the value of gold, in the hypothetical case, depends
                    entirely on the proportion which the supply bears to the demand; and, as the
                    demand is not affected by an increase of quantity, for that increase, by
                    diminishing its value, renders the larger quantity of as little efficacy as the
                    smaller quantity, it is abundantly clear, that if the Bank lent at a
                    sufficiently low rate of interest, there could be no limit to her issues.</p>
                <p>On the whole, therefore, it is plain, whether the power of issuing paper be
                    vested in the hands of a private banking company, or of government, that it must
                    be placed under some efficient control, such as the obligation to pay in gold or
                    silver. It is easy to discover the manner in which a check of this kind limits
                    the issue of paper, and sustains its value. Whenever the Bank has issued so much
                    paper as to sink its value relatively to bullion, its notes begin to return upon
                    it, to have them exchanged for a higher value; and the Bank is, in consequence,
                    obliged, to prevent the exhaustion of its coffers, to contract its issues, and
                    raise its paper to a level with gold. An extremely small profit, or an extremely
                    small depreciation of paper, as compared with gold or silver, is sufficient to
                    make the holders of bank paper send it to be exchanged for those metals; and
                    hence the value of bank notes convertible at pleasure into a <hi rend="italic"
                    >given and unvarying quantity</hi> of gold or silver, can never differ
                    considerably from its value. The issues of the Bank of England were for more
                    than a century previously to 1797, limited in the manner now explained, and
                    during that whole period they were hardly ever depreciated ½ per cent·, and
                    never more than two per cent., and that but for a few days only.</p>
                <p>But though it be thus necessary, in order to avoid all sudden and injurious
                    fluctuations in the value of paper, that it should be made exchangeable at the
                    pleasure of the holder for gold or silver, and it is not essential to this end
                    that it should be made exchangeable for gold or silver coins. Previously to the
                    resumption of specie payments by the Bank of England in 1821, she was obliged to
                    give bars of assayed bullion in exchange for her notes, according to a plan
                    suggested by the late Mr. Ricardo; and there can be no doubt that this
                    obligation would have sustained the value of paper quite as effectually as it is
                    sustained by the obligation to pay in coin of the legal weight and purity, at
                    the same time that it would have saved the greater part of the heavy expense
                    occasioned by the use of metallic money. But, how important soever, these were
                    not the only considerations that had to be attended to. The discovery of means
                    for the prevention, or at least diminution, of the forgery to which the
                    substitution of notes in the place of guineas had given rise, was indispensably
                    necessary to the maintenance of Mr. Ricardo’s plan; and notwithstanding all the
                    efforts that have been made, this desideratum has not yet been supplied. Forgery
                    in the larger description of notes, or in those for £5 and upwards, may with du¢
                    precaution be prevented from becoming injuriously prevalent. But low notes, or
                    those of the value of £1 or £2, having to circulate amongst the labouring
                    classes, and in immense numbers, present facilities for the issue of spurious
                    paper, which it has been found impossible materially to diminish. Hence, in
                    1821, the plan of paying in bars of bullion was abandoned, and the‘Bank of
                    England recommended paying in specie.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    be adopted as the Standard of the Currency, or whether it should consist of
                    both.</hi></p>
                <p>As the value of gold and silver, or the cost of their production, is perpetually
                    varying, not only relatively to other commodities, but also relatively to each
                    other, it is impossible arbitrarily to fix their comparative value. Gold may
                    now, or at any given period, be to silver as 14 or 15 is to 1; but w ere
                    sovereigns and shillings coined in that proportion, the discovery of a gold or
                    silver mine of more than the ordinary degree of productiveness, or the discovery
                    of any abridged process, by which labour might be saved in the production of one
                    of the metals, would derange this proportion. As soon, however, as the mint
                    proportion between the different metals ceases to be the same with that which
                    they bear to each other in the market, then it becomes Aie obvious interest of
                    every debtor to pay his debts in the metal whose mint valuation is highest.</p>
                <p>In 1718, in pursuance of the advice of Sir Isaac Newton, the value of the guinea
                    was reduced from twenty-one shillings and sixpence to twenty-one shillings; the
                    value of fine gold to fine silver was consequently rated, in our mint, at 1 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">5</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> t</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">⅞</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> 8</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript smallcaps"> b</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">⅞</hi> to 1, and both
                    metals were declared to be legal tender in that proportion. But, notwithstanding
                    this reduction, the guinea was still rated at a higher value, compared with
                    silver, than it ought to have been. This higher value was estimated, by Lord
                    Liverpool, to have been, at the time, equal to fourpence on the guinea, or to
                    l⅜f per cent.; and as the value of silver compared with gold, continued to
                    increase during the greater part of last century, it afterwards became
                    considerably greater. The over-valuation of gold, by making it for the interest
                    of every one to pay his debts in it rather than in silver, made gold be used in
                    all considerable payments, and was the cause that, during the long period from
                    1718 down to the late recoinage, no silver coins of the legal weight and
                    fineness would remain in circulation. The silver currency consisted entirely of
                    light, worn coins; and when, in 1797, the further coinage of silver was
                    forbidden, the silver currency was very much debased. But, as it existed only in
                    a <hi rend="italic">limited quantity,</hi> it did not, according to the
                    principle already explained, sink in its current value. Though debased, it was
                    still the interest of debtors to pay in gold, If, indeed, the quantity of
                    debased silver had been very great, or if the mint had issued such debased
                    pieces, it might have been the interest of debtors to pay in such debased money.
                    But its quantity being limited, it sustained its value; and gold was practically
                    the real standard of the currency.</p>
                <p>The act of 1774, declaring that silver should not be legal tender for any debt
                    exceeding £25, <hi rend="italic">unless by weight according to the mint
                    standard·,</hi> had not, as has been supposed, any effect in causing the general
                    employment of gold as money, in preference to silver. For, to use the words of
                    Mr. Ricardo, “this law did not prevent any debtor from paying any debt, however
                    large its amount, in silver currency fresh <pb break="no" facs="nls:193824344"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-4344-0395"/> from the mint. That the debtor did not pay in
                    this metal was not a matter of chance, nor a matter of compulsion, but wholly
                    the effect of choice. It did not suit him to take silver to the mint, but it did
                    suit him to take gold hither. It is probable that if the quantity of this
                    debased silver in circulation had been enormously great, and also a legal
                    tender, that a guinea would have been, as in the reign of William III., worth
                    thirty shillings; but it would have been the debased shilling that had fallen in
                    value, and not the guinea that had risen.” <hi rend="italic">(Principles of
                    Political Economy,</hi> p. 520).</p>
                <p>In France a different valuation of the precious metalshad a different effect. The
                    louis d’or, which, previously to the recoinage of 1785, was rated in the mint
                    valuation at 24 livres, was really worth 25 livres 10 sols. Those, therefore,
                    who chose to discharge the obligations they had contracted, by payments of gold
                    rather than of silver, plainly lost 1 Iiv. 10 sols on every sum of 24 livres. In
                    consequence very few such payments were made, gold was nearly banished from
                    circulation, and the currency of France became almost exclusively silver. (Say,
                    tom. i. p. 393.) In 1785, a sixteenth part was deducted from the weight of the
                    louis d’or, and since that period the value of the precious metals, as fixed in
                    the French mint, has more nearly corresponded with the proportion which they
                    bear to each other in the market. Indeed, it was stated, in evidence before the
                    Committee of the House of Commons in 1819 <hi rend="italic">{Report,</hi> p.
                    192), that the difference between the mint and market proportions of gold and
                    silver at Paris in 1817 and 1818, had not exceeded from one-tenth to one-fourth
                    per cent. There is, however, no reason to presume that this coincidence, which
                    must have been in a great degree accidental, can be maintained under any
                    arbitrary system. To ensure the indifferent use of gold and silver coins in
                    countries where they are both legal tender, their mint values would require to
                    be every now and then adjusted, so as to correspond with their real values. But
                    as this would obviously be productive of much trouble and inconvenience, the
                    preferable plan undoubtedly is to make only one metal legal tender, and to allow
                    the worth of the other to be adjusted by the competition of the sellers and
                    buyers.</p>
                <p>The absurdity of employing two metals as legal tender, or as a standard of value,
                    was unanswerably demonstrated by Mr. Locke and Mr. Hams, and has been noticed by
                    every subsequent writer; but so slow is the progress of improvement, that it was
                    not till the year 1816 that it was enacted that gold only should be legal tender
                    for all sums exceeding 40s.</p>
                <p>Whether, however, gold should have been adopted as the standard of exchangeable
                    value, in preference to silver, is a question not so easy of solution, and on
                    which there is a great diversity of opinion. Mr. Locke, Mr. Harris, and Mr.
                    Ricardo, are of opinion that silver is better fitted than gold for a standard;
                    whilst Dr. Smith, although he has not explicitly expressed himself, appears to
                    think that gold ought to be adopted in preference. This opinion has been very
                    ably supported by Lord Liverpool, in his valuable work <hi rend="italic">On the
                    Coins of the Realm</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and his reasonings having
                    received the approbation of parliament, and gold having been made legal tender,
                    all attempts to alter this arrangement ought to be opposed.</p>
                <p>Whether gold or silver be adopted as the standard of the currency, does not
                    affect its total cost or value; for, the quantity of metal employed as money, or
                    the quantity of metal for which paper is the substitute, is always inversely as
                    the value or cost of such metal. When gold is the standard, fourteen or fifteen
                    times less of it than of silver is required; or, which is the same thing, if the
                    denomination of a pound be given to any <hi rend="italic">specific weight</hi>
                    of gold or silver, fifteen times more of such silver pounds will be required to
                    serve as currency, fifteen to one being about the proportion which gold bears in
                    value to silver. Hence the expence of a gold or silver currency is identical.
                    Gold being too valuable in proportion to its bulk, to be coined into pieces of
                    the value of a shilling or a sixpence, the subsidiary currency necessary in
                    small payments, should be overvalued, and issued only in limited quantities, as
                    is the case with the present silver coinage.</p>
                <p>Were a seignorage charged on the gold coins, paper, it is obvious, might be
                    depreciated to the full extent of that seignorage, before it would be the
                    interest of the holders to demand coin for the purpose of exportation, and
                    consequently before the check of specie payments could begin to operate. But,
                    even with such a seignorage, the risk of paper being depreciated, might be
                    obviated, by making it obligatory on the Bank to pay their notes, either in
                    bullion, at the mint price of L.3, 17s. 10½d. an ounce, or coin, at the pleasure
                    of the holder. A regulation of this kind could not be justly considered as
                    imposing any hardship on the Bank; for it is plain, that no bullion would be
                    demanded from her, except when, by the issue of too much paper, its value had
                    been sunk below the standard.</p>

                    shillings. All the English silver coins have been coined out of silver of 11 oz.

                <p>The purity of gold is not estimated either in Great Britain, or in most other
                    European countries, by the weights commonly in use, but by an Abyssinian weight,
                    called a <hi rend="italic">carati</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Africa. In India it is used as a weight for diamonds, &amp;c. (Bruce’s Travels,
                    vol. v. p. 66)</p></note> . The carats are subdivided into four parts, called
                    grains, and these again into quarters; so that a <hi rend="italic">carat
                    grain,</hi> with respect to the common divisions of a pound troy, is equivalent
                    to 2½ penny-weights. Gold of the highest degree of fineness, or pure, is said to
                    be 24 carats fine. When gold coins were first made at the English mint, the
                    standard of the gold put in them was of 23 carats 3½ grains fine, and ½ grain of
                    alloy; and so it continued without any variation to the 18th Henry VIII., when a
                    new standard of gold of 22 carats fine, and two carats alloy was introduced. The
                    first of these was called the old standard; the second the new standard, or
                    crown gold, because crowns, or pieces of the value of five shillings, were first
                    coined of this new standard. Henry VIII. made his gold coins of both these
                    standards under different denominations; and this practice was continued by his
                    successors until theyear1633. From that period to the present, gold coins have
                    been invariably made of the new standard, or crown gold; although some of the
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193824357" xml:id="kp-eb0715-4357-0396"/> coins made of
                    the old standard previously to 1633 continued to circulate till 1732, when they
                    were forbidden to be any longer current. (Liverpool <hi rend="italic">on
                    Coms,</hi> p. 27.)</p>
                <p>The standard of our present gold coins is, therefore, eleven parts of fine gold,
                    and one part of alloy. The pound troy of such gold is divided into 46<hi
                    rend="subscript">89</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">129</hi> sovereigns, each of which
                    ought, consequently, when fresh from the mint, to weigh ξgτ¾¾ of twelve ounces,
                    or five dwts. 3⅞J⅜ grains of standard gold, or four dwts. 17<hi

                    gold.</p>
                <p>The alloy in coins is reckoned of no value. It is allowed, in order to save the
                    trouble and expence that would be incurred in refining the metals, so as to
                    bring them to the highest degree of purity; and because, when its quantity is
                    small, it has a tendency to render the coins harder, and less liable to be worn
                    or rubbed. If the quantity of alloy were considerable, it would lessen the
                    splendour and the ductility of the metals, and would add too much to the weight
                    of the coins.</p>
                <p>Having thus ascertained what the standard of money really is, we shall now
                    proceed to examine the effects produced by variations in the standard. This is,
                    both in a practical and historical point of view, a very important inquiry.</p>
                <p>To make any direct alteration in the terms of the contracts entered into between
                    individuals, would be too barefaced and tyrannical an interference with the
                    rights of property, to be tolerated. Those, therefore, who endeavour to enrich
                    one part of society, at the expence of another, find it necessary to act with
                    great caution and reserve, and to substitute artifice for open and avowed
                    injustice. Instead of directly altering the stipulations in contracts, they have
                    ingeniously bethought themselves of altering the standard, by which these
                    stipulations were adjusted. They have not said, in so many words, that ten or
                    twenty per cent, should be added to or deducted from the mutual debts and
                    obligations of society, but they have, nevertheless, effected this by making a
                    proportional change in the value of the currency. Men, in their bargains do not,
                    as has been already seen, stipulate for signs or measures of value, but for real
                    equivalents. Money is not merely the standard by a comparison with which the
                    value of commodities is ascertained; but it is also the equivalent, by the
                    delivery of a fixed amount of which the stipulations in most contracts and
                    engagements may be discharged. It is plain, therefore, that no variation can
                    take place in its value, without affecting all these stipulations. Every
                    addition to the value of money makes a corresponding addition to the debts of
                    the state, and of every individual; and every diminution of its value makes a
                    corresponding diminution of those debts. Suppose that, owing to an increase in
                    the difficulty of producing gold and silver, or in the quantity of bullion
                    contained in coins of the same denomination, the value of money is raised twenty
                    per cent., it is plain that this will add twenty per cent, to the various sums
                    which one part of society owes to another. Though the nominal rent of the
                    farmer, for example, continue stationary, his real rent is increased. He
                    continues to pay the same number of pounds or livres as formerly; but these have
                    become more valuable, and require to obtain them the sacrifice of a fifth part
                    more corn, labour, or other things the value of which has remained stationary.
                    On the other hand, had the value of money fallen twenty per cent., the
                    advantage, it is plain, would have been all on the side of the farmer, who would
                    have been entitled to a discharge from his landlord, when he had paid him only
                    four-fifths of the rent really bargained for.</p>
                <p>But, notwithstanding it is thus obviously necessary, in order to prevent a
                    pernicious subversion of private fortunes, and the falsifying of all precedent
                    contracts, that the standard of money, when once fixed, should be maintained
                    inviolate, there is nothing that has been so frequently changed. We do not here
                    allude to variations affecting the value of the bullion of which the standard is
                    composed, and against which it is impossible to guard, but to variations in the
                    quantity of bullion contained in the same nominal sum of money. In almost every
                    country, debtors have been enriched at the expence of their creditors. The
                    necessities, or the extravagance of governments, have forced them to borrow; and
                    to relieve themselves of their incumbrances, they have almost universally had
                    recourse to the disgraceful expedient of degrading the coin; that is, of <hi
                    rend="italic">cheating</hi> those who had lent them money, and of enabling every
                    other debtor in their dominions to do the same.</p>
                <p>The ignorance of the public in remote ages greatly facilitated this species of
                    fraud. Had the names of the coins been changed when the quantity of metal
                    contained in them was diminished, there would have been no room for
                    misapprehension. But, though the weight of the coins was undergoing perpetual,
                    and their þurity occasional reductions, their ancient denominations were almost
                    uniformly preserved: and those people who saw the same names still remaining
                    after the substance was diminished; who saw coins of a certain weight and
                    fineness circulate under the names of florins, livres, and pounds, and who saw
                    them continue to circulate as such, after both their weight and the degree of
                    their fineness had been lessened, began to think that they derived their value
                    more from the stamp affixed to them, by authority of government, than from the
                    quantity of the precious metals they contained. This was long a very prevalent
                    opinion. But the rise of prices which invariably followed every reduction of the
                    standard, and the derangement which was thereby occasioned in every pecuniary
                    transaction, undeceived the public, and taught them, though it may not yet have
                    taught their rulers, the expediency of preserving the standard of money
                    inviolate.</p>
                <p>Before proceeding to notice the changes made in the currency of this and other
                    countries, it may be proper to observe, that the standard is generally debased
                    in one or other of the undermentioned ways.</p>
                <p>First, by simply altering the denominations of the coins, without making any
                    alteration in their weight or purity. Thus, suppose sixpence, or as much silver
                    as there is in a sixpence, were called a shilling, then a shilling would be two
                    shillings, and twenty of these shillings, or ten of our present shillings, would
                    constitute a pound sterling. This would be a reduction of fifty per cent, in the
                    standard.</p>
                <p>Secondly, the standard may be reduced, by continuing to issue coins of the same
                    weight, but making them baser, or with less pure metal and more alloy.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, it may be reduced, by making the coins of the same degree of purity, but
                    of diminished weight, or with less pure metal; or it may be reduced partly by
                    one of these methods, and partly by another.</p>
                <p>The first of these methods of degrading the standard was recommended by Mr.
                    Lowndes in 1695, and if injustice is to be done, it is certainly, on the whole,
                    the least mischievous mode by which it can be perpetrated. It saves all the
                    trouble and expence of a recoinage; but as it renders the fraud too obvious, it
                    has been but seldom resorted to. In inquiries of this kind, however, it is
                    rarely necessary to investigate the manner in which the standard has been
                    degraded. And by its reduction or degradation, we uniformly mean, unless when
                    the contrary is distinctly expressed, a diminution of the quantity of pure metal
                    contained in coins of the same denomination without regard to the particular
                    mode in which such diminution may have been effected.</p>
                <p>In conformity with what has been observed in the first section of this article,
                    relative to the universality of the ancient practice of weighing the precious
                    metals in every exchange, it is found that the coins of most countries have the
                    same names as the weights commonly used in them. To <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193824370" xml:id="kp-eb0715-4370-0397"/> these weights the coins at
                    first exactly correspond. Thus the <hi rend="italic">talent</hi> was a weight
                    used in the earliest periods*by the Greeks, the <hi rend="italic">as</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">pondo</hi> by the Romans, the <hi rend="italic">livre</hi> by the
                    French, and the <hi rend="italic">pound</hi> by the English, Scotch, &amp;c.;
                    and the coins originally in use in Greece, in Italy, in France, and in England,
                    received the same denominations, and weighed precisely a talent, a pondo, a
                    livre, and a pound. The standard has not, however, been preserved inviolate,
                    either in ancient or in modern times. But the limits within which an article of
                    this kind must be confined, prevents us from tracing the various changes in the
                    money of this and other countries, with the minuteness which the importance of
                    the subject deserves, and obliges us to notice only those which were most
                    prominent.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>' It is
                    impossible in this place to enter into any discussion relative to the value of
                    Grecian money. It is, however, a subject of no little interest and curiosity. Μ.
                    Rome de l ’ Isle, in his Traité de Métrologie, published in 1789, has given an
                    account of the weight and fineness of an immense number of Attic drachmas and
                    tetradrachmas. But he does not seem to have been more fortunate than his
                    predecessors in deducing the value of the talent from the weight of the
                    drachmas. The errors and absurdities into which modern critics and commentators
                    have fallen, in estimating the value of the sums mentioned in ancient authors,
                    is indeed astonishing. They are ably pointed out in a short essay, De la Monnaie
                    des Peuples Anciens, in one of the supplemental volumes added by Gamier to his
                    translation of the Wealth of Nations.</p></note><hi rend="smallcaps">Roman
                    Money.</hi> —We learn from Pliny, that the first Roman coinage took place in the
                    reign of Servius Tullius, that is, according to the common chronology, about 550
                    years before Christ. The <hi rend="italic">as,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >pondo,</hi> of this early period, contained a Roman pound of copper, the metal
                    then exclusively used in the Roman coinage, and was divided into twelve parts or
                    <hi rend="italic">unciae.</hi> If we may rely on Pliny, this simple and natural
                    system was maintained until 250 years before our era, or until the first Punic
                    war, when the revenues of the state being insufficient, government attempted to
                    supply the deficiency, by reducing the weight of the as from twelve to two
                    ounces. But it is extremely improbable that a government, which had maintained
                    its standard inviolate for 300 years, should have commenced the work of
                    degradation, by at once reducing it to <hi rend="italic">a sixth part</hi> of
                    its former amount; and it is equally improbable that so sudden and excessive a
                    reduction should have been made in the value of the current money of the state,
                    and, consequently, in the debts due by individuals to each other, without
                    occasioning the most violent commotions. Nothing, however, is said in any
                    ancient writer, to entitle us to infer that such commotions actually took place;
                    and we, therefore, concur with those who think that the weight of the as had
                    been previously reduced, and that its diminution, which, it is most probable,
                    would be gradual and progressive, had merely been carried to the extent
                    mentioned by Pliny during the first Punic war. In the second Punic war, or 215
                    years before Christ, a further degradation took place, and the weight of the as
                    was reduced from two ounces to one ounce. And by the Papyrian law, supposed to
                    have passed when Papyrius Turdus was tribune of the people, or 175 years before
                    Christ, the weight of the as was reduced to half an ounce, or to ^ <hi

                <p>The denarius, the principal silver coin in use amongst the Romans, for a period
                    of600 years, was coined five years before the first Punic war, and was, as its
                    name imports, rated in the mint valuation at ten asses. Mr. Greaves, whose
                    dissertation on the denarius has been deservedly eulogised by Gibbon, <hi
                    rend="italic">(Decline and Fall,</hi> vol. iii. p. 89), shews that the denarius
                    weighed at first only <hi rend="italic">one-seventh</hi> part of a Roman

                    pondus denariorum esse septem.” (Ceis, lib. XV, cap. 17.)</p></note> which, if
                    Pliny’s account of the period when the weight of the as was first reduced be
                    correct, would give the value of silver to copper in the Roman mint as 840 to 1,
                    which Mr. Greaves very truly calls a “most unadvised proportion.” But if we
                    suppose, with Mr. Pinkerton, <hi rend="italic">(Essay on Medals,</hi> vol. i. p.
                    132, edit. 1789), that when the denarius was first issued, the as only weighed
                    three ounces, the proportion of silver to copper w ould be as 252 to 1, a
                    proportion which, when the as was soon afterwards reduced to two ounces, would
                    be as 168 to 1, or about a third more than in the British mint. When, in the
                    second Punic war, the as was reduced from two ounces to one, the denarius was
                    rated at sixteen asses.</p>
                <p>During his stay in Italy, Mr. Greaves weighed many of the consular denarii, that
                    is, as he explains himself, of the denarii that were struck after the second
                    Punic war, and previously to the government of the Caesars; and he found, by
                    frequent and exact trials, the best and most perfect of them that weighed 62
                    grains English troy weight. (Greaves’ <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> vol. i. p.
                    262). Now, as the English shilling (new coinage) contains very nearly 87½ grains
                    standard silver, this would give 8½d. for the value of the consular denarius. We
                    should, however, fall into the grossest mistakes, if we indiscriminately
                    converted the sums mentioned in the Latin authors by this or any other fixed
                    proportion. It is not enough to determine the real value of a coin, to know its
                    weight; the degree of its purity or the fineness of the metal of which it is
                    made, must also be known. But Mr. Greaves did not assay any of the denarii
                    weighed by him. And though it were true, as most probably it is, that, from the
                    first coinage of silver in the 485th year of the city to the reign of Augustus,
                    the weight of the denarius remained constant at ⅜th part of a Roman ounce, or
                    about 62 grains; and that, from the reign of Augustus to that of Vespasian, it
                    only declined in weight from ½th to ½th of an ounce;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Greaves, vol i. p. 331. Gibbon’s
                    Miscellaneous Works, vol. v. p 71.</p></note> still it is abundantly certain
                    that its real value had been reduced to a much greater extent. As to this fact
                    the authority of Pliny is decisive; for he expressly states, that Livius Drusns,
                    who was tribune of the people in the 662d year of the city, or 177 years after
                    the first coinage of silver, debased its purity, by alloying it with ½th part of
                    copper, (lib. xxxiij, cap. 3, previously quoted). And in a subsequent chapter
                    (the ninth) of the same book, he informs us that Antony the triumvir mixed iron
                    with the silver of the denarius; and that, to counteract these abuses, a law was
                    afterwards made providing for the assay of the denarii. Some idea of the extent
                    to which the purity of the coins had been debased, and of the disorder which had
                    in consequence been occasioned, may be formed from the circumstance, also
                    mentioned by Pliny, of statues being every where erected in honour of Marius
                    Gratidianus, by whom the law for the assay had been proposed. But this law was
                    not long respected; and many imperial denarii are now in existence, consisting
                    of mere plated copper. (Bazinghen, <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire des

                    Under Alexander Severus it was alloyed with <hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi
                    rend="subscript">5</hi>th part of silver. We learn from Dion Cassius,
                    contemporary with Severus, that the aureus was rated at twenty-five denarii, a
                    proportion which Mr. Pinkerton thinks was always maintained under the emperors.

                <p>The want of attention to this progressive degradation has led the translators of,
                    and commentators on, ancient writers, to the most extraordinary conclusions. The
                    sestertius, or money <hi rend="italic">unit</hi> of the Romans, was precisely
                    the <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> part of a denarius. “Nostri autem,” says
                    Vitruvius, (lib. iii. cap. 1,) “primo decem fecerunt antiquum numerum, et in
                    denario denos aereos asses constituerunt, et ea re compositio nummi ad hodiernum
                    diem denarii nomen retinet; etiamque quartam ejus partem, quod efficiebatur ex
                    duobus assibus et tertio semisse <hi rend="italic">sestertium</hi>
                    nominaverunt.” When, therefore, the denarius was worth 8½d∙, the sestertius must
                    have been worth 2½d. But the sestertius being thus plainly a multiple of, and
                    bearing a fixed and determined proportion to the denarius, and consequently to
                    the as, the aureus, and the other coins generally in use, it must have partaken
                    of all their fluctuations. When they were reduced, the sestertius must have been
                    likewise reduced; for if it had not been so reduced, or, if the quantity of
                    degraded denarii and aurei contained in a given sum of sestertii had been
                    increased in proportion to their degradation, nothing, it is obvious, would have
                    been gained by falsifying the standard. But as we know that on one occasion the
                    republic got rid of half of its debts, <hi rend="italic">respublica dimidium
                    lucrata</hi><hi rend="italic">est,</hi> by simply reducing the standard of the
                    as, it is certain that the value of the sestertius must have fallen in the same
                    proportion, just as in England we should reduce the pound sterling, our money
                    <hi rend="italic">unit,</hi> by reducing the shillings of which it is made
                    up.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Writers on andient
                    coins, with the exception of Mr. Pinkerton, agree in supposing the sestertius to
                    have been originally, and to have always continued to be, a silver coin. Mr.
                    Pinkerton has, however, denied this opinion, and, on the authority of the
                    following passage of Pliny, contends that the sestertius was at the time when
                    Pliny wrote, whatever it might have been before, a brass coin. “Summa gloria
                    aeris nunc in Marianum conversa, quod et Cordubense dicitur-Hoc a Liviano
                    cadmiam maxime sorbet, et orichalci bonitatem imitatur in <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >sestertiis, dupondiariisque,</hi> Cyprio suo <hi rend="smallcaps">assibus</hi>
                    contentis.” (Lib. xxxxiv. cap. 2.) That is, literally, “The greatest glory of
                    brass is now due to the Marian, also called that of Cordova. This, after the
                    Livian, absorbs the greatest quantity of lapis calaminaris, and imitates the
                    goodness of orichalcum (yellow brass) in our <hi rend="smallcaps">sestertii</hi>
                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">dupondiarii,</hi> the <hi rend="smallcaps">asses</hi>
                    being contented with the Cyprian (brass).” [Pliny had previously observed,-that
                    the Cyprian was the least valuable brass]. This passage is, we think, decisive
                    in favour of Mr. Pinkerton’s hypothesis. But, in the absence of positive
                    testimony, the small value of the sestertius might be relied on as a sufficient
                    proof that it could not be silver. When the denarius weighed 62 grains, the
                    sestertius must have weighed 15⅜, and been worth 2⅛d.; but a coin of so small a
                    size as to be scarcely equal to one-third part of one of our sixpences, would
                    have been extremely apt to be lost; and could not have been struck by the rude
                    methods used in the Roman mint with any thing approaching to even tolerable
                    precision. It is, therefore, much more reasonable to suppose that it was of
                    brass.</p></note></p>
                <p>But though it had not been possible to produce such clear and explicit evidence
                    of the continued degradation of the Roman money, the obvious absurdity of many
                    of the calculations which have been framed, on the supposition of its remaining
                    stationary at the rates fixed in the earlier ages of the commonwealth, would
                    have sufficiently established the fact of its degradation. Dr. Arbuthnot’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Tables of Ancient Coins,</hi> which, for nearly a century, have
                    been considered in England, and in the greater part of the Continent, as of the
                    highest authority, are constructed on the hypothesis that the denarii weighed by
                    Mr. Greaves were of equal purity with English standard silver, and that no
                    subsequent diminution had been made either in their weight or fineness. The
                    conclusions derived from such data are precisely such as we should arrive at,
                    if, in estimating the value of a French livre previously to the Revolution, we
                    took for granted that it weighed a pound of pure silver, as in the reign of
                    Charlemagne. Amongst many other things quite as extraordinary, we learn from
                    Arbuthnot, that Julius Caesar, when he set out for Spain, after his praetorship,
                    was £2,018,229 sterling worse than nothing; that Augustus received, in legacies
                    from his friends, £32,291,666; that the estate of Pallas, a freedman of Crassus,
                    was worth £2,421,875, and, which is still better, that he received £121,093 as a
                    reward for his virtues and frugality; that Aesop, the tragedian, had a dish
                    served up at his table which cost £4,843; that Vitellius spent £7,265,625 in
                    twelve months, in eating and drinking; and that Vespasian, at his accession to
                    the empire, declared that an annual revenue of £322,916,666 would be necessary
                    to keep the state machine in motion. It is astonishing that none of our scholars
                    or commentators seem ever to have been struck with the palpable extravagance of
                    such conclusions, which, to use the words of Garnier, “ont mis l’Histoire
                    Ancienne, sous le rapport des valeurs, au même degré de vraisemblance que les
                    contes de <hi rend="italic">Mille et un Nuits.”</hi> They have, webelieve,
                    without any exception, slavishly copied the errors of Arbuthnot; and to this
                    hour the computations in the books on Roman antiquities used in our schools and
                    universities are all borrowed from his work. It should be remembered, that from
                    the greater poverty of the mines of the old world, and the comparatively small
                    progress made by the ancients in the art of mining, the value of gold and silver
                    was much greater in ancient times than at present. But, without taking this
                    circumstance into account, the computations referred to are too obviously
                    erroneous to deserve the smallest attention. Vespasian, Ave believe, would have
                    been very well satisfied with a revenue of twenty millions; and there are good
                    grounds for supposing that the Roman revenue, when at the highest, never
                    amounted to so large a sum. (Gibbon, vol. i. p. 260.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">French Money</hi> —From about the year 800, in the reign of
                    Charlemagne, to the year 1103, in that of Philip I., the French <hi
                    rend="italic">livre,</hi> or money unit, contained exactly a pound weight or
                    twelve ounces (poids de marc) of pure silver. It was divided into twenty sols,
                    each of which, of course, weighed ^ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> θth part of a
                    pound. This ancient standard was first violated by Philip I., who diminished
                    considerably the quantity of pure silver contained in the sols. The example once
                    set, was so well followed up, that in 1180 the livre was reduced to less than a
                    <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> part of its original weight of pure silver. In
                    almost every succeeding reign there was a fresh diminution. “La monnoye,” says
                    Le Blanc, “qui est la plus précieuse et la plus importante des mesures, a changé
                    en France presque aussi souvent que nos habits ont changé de mode.” And to such
                    an extent had the process of degradation been carried, that, at the epoch of the
                    Revolution, the livre did not contain a <hi rend="italic">seventy-eighth</hi>
                    part of the silver contained in the livre of Charlemagne. It would then have
                    required 7,885 livres really to extinguish a debt of 100 livres contracted in
                    the ninth or tenth centuries; and an individual who, in that remote period, had
                    an annual income of 1,000 livres, was as rich, in respect to money, as those
                    who, at the Revolution, enjoyed a revenue of 78,850 livres. (Paucton, <hi

                <p>Those who wish for a detailed account of the various changes in the weight and
                    purity of the French coins, may besides the excellent work of Le Blanc, consult
                    the elaborate and very complete tables at page 905 of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Traité des Mesures</hi> of Paucton, and at page 197 of the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>It was not to be expected, that degradations originating in the necessities, the
                    ignorance, and the rapacity of a long series of arbitrary princes, should be
                    made according to any fixed principle. They were sometimes the result of an
                    increase in the denomination of the coins, but more frequently of a diminution
                    of the purity of the metal of which they were struck. A degradation of this kind
                    was not so easily detected; and, in order to render its discovery still mere
                    difficult, Philip of Valois, John, and some other kings, obliged the officers of
                    the mint to swear to conceal the fraud, and to endeavour to make the merchants
                    believe that the coins were of full value. (Le Blanc, p. 212.) Sometimes one
                    species of money was reduced, without any alteration being made in the others.
                    No sooner, however, had the people in their dealings manifested a preference, as
                    they uniformly did, for the money which had not been reduced, than its
                    circulation was forbidden, or its value brought down to die same level with the
                    rest. (Id. <hi rend="italic">Introduction,</hi> p. 20.) bi order to render the
                    subject more obscure, and the better to conceal their incessant frauds,
                    individuals were at one time compelled to reckon exclusively by livres and sols,
                    at other times by crowns or ecus; and not unfrequently they were obliged to
                    refer in computing to coins which were neither livres, sols, nor crowns, but
                    some multiple or fractional part thereof. The injurious effects of these
                    constant fluctuations in the value of money are forcibly depicted by the French
                    historians; and so insupportable did they become, that in the fourteenth and
                    fifteenth centuries, several cities and provinces were glad to purchase the
                    precarious and little respected privilege of having coins of a fixed standard,
                    by submitting to the imposition of heavy taxes (Le Blanc, p. 93.)</p>
                <p>In the duchy of Normandy, when it was governed by the English monarchs, there was
                    a tax upon hearths paid every three years, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >monetagium,</hi> in return for which the sovereign engaged <hi rend="italic"
                    >not to debase his coins.</hi> This tax was in troduced into England by our
                    early kings of the Norman race; but Henry I. in the first year of his reign, was
                    induced to abandon it, and it has not since been revived. (Liverpool <hi

                <p>According to the present regulations of the French mint, the coins contain <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅞ths of pure metal, and <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi><hi

                    exactly 5 grammes, or 77∙2205 English Troy grains. The gold piece of 20 francs
                    weighs 102 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 9β English grains. (Peuchet, <hi

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">English Money</hi> In England, at the epoch of the Nor man
                    conquest, the silver, or money pound, weighed exactly twelve ounces Tower
                    weight. It was divided into twenty shillings, and each shilling into twelve
                    pence, or sterlings. This system of coinage, which is in every respect the same
                    with that established in France by Charlemagne, had been introduced into England
                    previously to the invasion of William the Conqueror, and was continued, without
                    any alteration, till the year 1300, in the 28th Edward I. when it was for the
                    first time violated, and the value of the pound sterling degraded to the extent
                    of ∣-≡∙ per cent. But, the really pernicious effect of this degradation did not
                    consist so much in the trifling extent to which it was carried by Edward, as in
                    the example which it afforded to his less scrupulous successors, by whom the
                    standard was gradually debased, until, in 1601, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth,
                    62s. were coined out of <hi rend="italic">a. pound</hi> weight of silver. This
                    was a reduction of above <hi rend="italic">two-thirds</hi> in the standard; so
                    that all the stipulations in contracts, entered into in the reigns immediately
                    subsequent to the Conquest, might, in 1601, and since, be legally discharged by
                    the payment of less than a <hi rend="italic">third part</hi> of the sums really
                    bargained for. And yet the standard has been less degraded in England than in
                    any other country.</p>
                <p>The tables annexed to this article give an ample account of these degradations,
                    and also give the weight of the gold coins, and the proportional value of gold
                    to silver, estimated both by the mint regulations, and by the quantity of fine
                    gold and fine silver contained in the different coins.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scotch Money</hi> —In the same manner as the English had
                    derived their system of coinage from the French, the Scotch derived theirs from
                    the English. From 1296 to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193824409"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-4409-0400"/> 1355, the coins of both divisions of the island
                    were of the same size and purity. But, at the last mentioned period, it was
                    attempted to fill up the void occasioned by the remittance of the ransom of
                    David II. to England, by degrading the coins. Till then the money of Scotland
                    had been current in England, upon the same footing as the money of that country;
                    and the preservation of this equality is assigned by Edward III.as a reason for
                    his degrading the English coins. But this equilibrium was soon afterwards
                    destroyed. In the first year of Robert III. (1390), Scotch coin only passed for
                    half its nominal value in England; and, in 1393, Richard II. ordered that its
                    currency, as money, should entirely cease, and that its value should be made to
                    depend on the weight of the genuine metal contained in it. “To close this point
                    at once,” says Mr. Pinkerton, “the Scottish money, equal in value to the English
                    till 1355, sunk by degrees, reign after reign, owing to succeeding public
                    calamities, and the consequent impoverishment of the kingdom, till, in 1600, it
                    was only a <hi rend="italic">twelfth</hi> part of the value of English money of
                    the same denomination, and remained at that point till the union of the kingdoms
                    cancelled the Scottish coinage.”— <hi rend="italic">(Essay on Medals,</hi> vol.

                <p>The tables at the end of this article exhibit the successive degradations both of
                    the Scotch silver and gold coins.</p>
                <p>At the Union, in 1707, it was ordered that all the silver coins current in
                    Scotland, foreign as well as domestic, except English coins of full weight,
                    should be brought to the Bank of Scotland, to be taken to the mint to be
                    recoined. In compliance with this order, there were brought in,</p>
                <p>Of foreign silver money, (Sterling), £132,080 17 9 Milled Scottish coins, . . .

                <p>Total, £411,117 10 9</p>
                <p>Mr. Ruddiman conjectures, apparently with considerable probability, that the
                    value of the Scotch gold coins, and of the silver coins not brought in, amounted
                    to about as much more. Much suspicion was entertained of the measure of a
                    recoinage; and that large proportion of the people who were hostile to the
                    Union, and did not believe that it would be permanent, brought very little money
                    to the bank. A few only of the hoarded coins have been preserved, the far
                    greater part having either been melted by the goldsmiths, or exported to other
                    countries. (Preface to Anderson’s <hi rend="italic">Diplomata,</hi> p. 176.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Irish Money.</hi> —The gold and silver coins of Great
                    Britain and Ireland are now the same, and have been so for a considerable
                    period. The rate, however, at which these coins used to circulate in Ireland, or
                    their nominal value as money of account, was 8½ per cent, higher than in Great
                    Britain. This difference of valuation, though attended with considerable
                    inconvenience in adjusting the money transactions between the two countries,
                    subsisted from 1689 till 1825 when it was put an end to. For an account of the
                    various species of metallic money which have at different times been current in
                    Ireland, we must refer our readers to Mr. Simons’ <hi rend="italic">Essay on

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Money of Germany, Spain, &amp;c</hi> —A similar process of
                    degradation had been universally carried on. “In many parts of Germany, the
                    florin, which is still the integer, or money of account of those countries, was
                    originally a <hi rend="italic">gold</hi> coin, of the value of about 10s. of our
                    present money (old coinage.) It is now become a silver coin, of the value of
                    only 20d.; and its present value, therefore, is only equal to a sixth part of
                    what it was formerly. In Spain, the maravedi, which was in its origin a Moorish
                    coin, and is still the money of account of that kingdom, was in ancient times
                    most frequently made of gold. Le Blanc observes, that, in 1220, the maravedi
                    weighed 84 grains of gold, equal in value to about 14s. (old coinage) of our
                    present money. But this maravedi, though its value is not quite the same in all
                    the provinces of Spain, is now become a small copper coin, equal in general to
                    only ½b¾ of an English penny! In Portugal, the re, or reis, is become of no
                    greater value than <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> 3</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >⅜</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> 7</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi> of an
                    English penny; it is so small, that in estimating its value in other coins, it
                    is reckoned by hundreds and thousands. The itioeda, or moidore, is equal to 4800
                    reis; and this little coin has now, in fact, no existence but in name. Such has
                    been the fate of all these coins, and such is the present state of their
                    depreciation.” (Liverpool <hi rend="italic">on Coins,</hi> p∙ 111.)</p>

                <p>The principle of degradation has not, however, been uniformly acted upon. The
                    quantity of bullion contained in coins of the same denomination has sometimes,
                    though rarely, been increased, and creditors enriched at the expence of their
                    debtors. This method of swindling his subjects is said to have been first
                    practised by the profligate Heliogabalus. The Roman citizens being bound to pay
                    into the imperial treasury a certain number of pieces of gold, or <hi

                    increase his means of dissipation, without appearing to add to the weight of the

                    what he might not have obtained by a fair and open proceeding.<note

                    been frequently raised. During the early part of the reign of Philip le Bel, who
                    ascended the throne in 1285, the value of the coin had been reduced to such an
                    extent as to occasion the most violent complaints on the part of the clergy and
                    landholders, and generally of all that portion of the public whose incomes were
                    not increased proportionably to the reduction in the value of money. To appease
                    this discontent, and in compliance with an injunction of the pope, the king at
                    length consented to issue new coins, of the same denomination with those
                    previously current, but which contained about <hi rend="italic">three</hi> times
                    the quantity of silver. This, however, was merely shifting an oppressive burden
                    from the shoulders of one class to those of another, less able to bear it. The
                    degraded money having been in circulation for about sixteen years, by far the
                    largest pro <pb break="no" facs="nls:193824422" xml:id="kp-eb0715-4422-0401"/>
                    portion of the existing contracts must have been adjusted with reference to it.
                    No wonder, therefore, that debtors should have felt indignant at the shameful
                    act of injustice done them by this enhancement of the value of money, and have
                    refused to make good their engagements, otherwise than in money of the value of
                    that which had been current when they were entered into. The labouring class, to
                    whom every sudden change in the value of money is injurious, having joined the
                    debtors in their opposition, they broke out into open rebellion. « The people,”
                    says Le Blanc, “being reduced to despair, and having no longer any thing to care
                    for, lost the respect due to the edict of his Majesty; —they pillaged the house
                    of the master of the mint, who was believed to have been the chief adviser of
                    the measure, besieged the temple, in which the king lodged, and did all that an
                    infuriated populace is capable of doing.” <hi rend="italic">(Traité Historique

                    but it is not mentioned whether any abatement were made, by authority, from the
                    claims of the creditors, in the contracts entered into when the light money was
                    in circulation. It seems probable, however, from what is elsewhere mentioned by
                    Le Blanc (Introduction, p. 30,) that such was really the case.</p>
                <p>The history of the French coinage affords several instances similar to the very
                    remarkable one we have now brought under the notice of our readers; but, in
                    England, the new coinage in the last year of the reign of Edward VI. is the only
                    instance in which the value of money has been augmented by the direct
                    interference of government. Previously to the accession of Henry VIII., the
                    pound of standard silver bullion, containing 11 oz. 2 dwts. of pure silver, and
                    13 dwts. of alloy, was coined into thirty-seven shillings and sixpence. But
                    Henry not only increased the number of shillings coined out of a pound weight of
                    silver, but also debased its purity. The degradation was increased under his son
                    and successor, Edward VI., in the fifth year of whose reign, seventy-two
                    shillings were coined out of a pound weight of bullion; but as this bullion
                    contained only <hi rend="italic">three</hi> ounces of pure silver to <hi
                    rend="italic">nine</hi> ounces alloy, twenty of these shillings were only equal
                    to 4s. 7⅞d. of nur present money, including the seignorage. (Folkes’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Table of English Coins,</hi> p. 34.) It appears from the
                    proclamations issued at the time, and foom other authentic documents, that this
                    excessive reduction of the value of silver money had been productive of the
                    greatest confusion. A <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi> was set on the price of
                    corn and other necessaries; and letters were sent to the gentlemen of the
                    different counties, desiring them to punish those who refused to carry their
                    grain to market. But it was soon found to be quite impossible to remedy these
                    disorders otherwise than by withdrawing the base money from circulation. This
                    was accordingly resolved upon; and, in 1552, new coins were issued, the .silver
                    of which was of the old standard of purity, and which, though less valuable than
                    those in circulation, during the early part of the reign of Henry VIII., were
                    above <hi rend="italic">four</hi> times the value of a large proportion of the
                    coins of the same denomination that had been in circulation for some years
                    before.</p>
                <p>It is certain, however, that such a rise in the value of money could not have
                    taken place without occasioning the most violent commotions, had <hi
                    rend="italic">all</hi> the coins previously in circulation been debased. Equal
                    injustice, it must be remembered, is always done to the poorest, and not least
                    numerous class of society, by increasing the value of money, that is done to the
                    wealthier classes by depressing it. But, though government had been disposed to
                    sanction so enormous an invasion of the right of property, it is altogether
                    impossible that the country could have submitted to have had 400 or 450 per
                    cent, added to its taxes and other public burdens, by a legerdemain trick of
                    this kind, or that individuals would have consented to pay so much more than
                    they had originally bargained for. Instead of deserving praise for accomplishing
                    such a measure, Edward VI., who began the reformation of the coins, and
                    Elizabeth, by whom it was completed, would have justly forfeited the esteem of
                    their subjects, and lost all their popularity. The truth is, however, that
                    little or no change had been made, during all this period, in the value of the
                    <hi rend="italic">gold</hi> coins; and there is, besides, abundance of evidence
                    to show, that many of the old silver coins had remained in circulation. Now, as
                    there is no mention made of the issue of the new coins having been attended with
                    any inconvenience, it is nearly certain, as Mr. Harris has remarked, that,
                    during the period of the debasement of the standard, individuals had regulated
                    their contracts chiefly with reference to the gold or old silver coins; or,
                    which is the same thing, that “they had endeavoured, as well as they could, <hi
                    rend="italic">to keep by the standard, as it had been fixed in the preceding
                    times”</hi> (Harris <hi rend="italic">on Coins,</hi> part ii. p. 3.)</p>
                <p>We have been thus particular in examining this measure, because it has been much
                    referred to. It is plain, however, that it can give no support to the arguments
                    of those who appeal to it as affording a striking proof of the benefits which
                    they affirm must always result from restoring a debased or degraded currency to
                    its original purity or weight. Invariability of value is the great desideratum
                    in a currency. To elevate the standard after it has been for a considerable
                    period depressed, is really not a measure of justice, but the giving <hi
                    rend="italic">a new</hi><hi rend="italic">directiori</hi><hi rend="italic">to
                    injustice.</hi> It vitiates and falsifies the provisions in one set of
                    contracts, in order properly to adjust those in some other set.</p>
                <p>This, however, as already remarked, is the only instance in which the government
                    of England has ever interfered directly to enhance the value of money. In every
                    other case, where they have tampered with the standard, it has been to lower its
                    value, or, which comes to the same thing, to reduce their own debts and those of
                    their subjects.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary to enumerate in detail the various bad consequences that must
                    have resulted from these successive changes in the standard of value. But, it
                    deserves to be remarked, that an arbitraryreduction of the standard does not
                    afford any real relief to the governments by whom it is practised. Their <hi
                    rend="italic">debts</hi> are, it is true, reduced proportionally to the
                    reduction in the value of the currency, but their <hi rend="italic"
                    >revenues</hi> are, at the same time, reduced in the same proportion. A piece of
                    money that has been degraded will not exchange for the same quantity of
                    commodities that it previously did. To whatever extent the standard may be
                    reduced, prices are very soon raised to the same extent. If the degradation be
                    10 per cent., government, as well as every one else, will, henceforth, be
                    compelled to pay L.110 for commodities previously obtainable for L.100. Hence to
                    bring the same real value into the coffers of the treasury, it is necessary that
                    taxation should be increased whenever the standard is diminished; a measure
                    always odious, and sometimes impracticable.</p>
                <p>But a diminution of revenue is not the only bad effect which governments
                    experience from reducing the standard of the currency. A state which has
                    degraded its money, and cheated its creditors, is unable to borrow again on the
                    same favourable terms as if it had acted with good faith. We cannot expect to
                    enjoy the reputation of honesty, at the same time that we are openly pocketing
                    the booty earned by duplicity and fraud. Those who lend money to knaves always
                    stipulate for a proportionally high rate of interest. They must not only obtain
                    as much as may be obtained from the most secure investments, but they must also
                    obtain an <hi rend="italic">additional</hi> rate or premium, to cover the risk
                    they run in transacting with those who have given proofs of bad faith, and on
                    whose promises no reliance can be placed. A degradation of the standard of value
                    is, therefore, of all others, the most wretched resource of a bankrupt
                    government<pb break="no" facs="nls:193824435" xml:id="kp-eb0715-4435-0402"/>. It
                    will never, indeed, be resorted to, except by those who are alike unprincipled
                    and ignorant. “It occasions,” says Dr. Smith, “a general and most pernicious
                    subversion of the fortunes of private people; enriching, in most cases, the idle
                    and profuse debtor at the expence of the frugal and industrious creditor; and
                    transporting a great part of the national capital from the hands which were
                    likely to increase and improve it, to those which are likely to dissipate and
                    destroy it. When it becomes necessary for a state to declare itself bankrupt, in
                    the same manner as when it becomes necessary for an individual to do so, a fair,
                    open, and avowed bankruptcy, is always the measure which is both least
                    dishonourable to the debtor, and least hurtful to the creditor. The honour of a
                    state is surely very poorly provided for, when, in order to cover the disgrace
                    of a real bankruptcy, it has recourse to a juggling trick of this kind, <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ι</hi> so easily seen through, and at the same time so utterly
                    pernicious.”— <hi rend="italic">(Wealth of Nations,</hi> vol. iv. p. 42.)</p>
                <p>Some of the bad consequences resulting from a change in the value of money might,
                    indeed, be obviated, by enacting, that the stipulations in all preceding
                    contracts should be made good, not according to the present value of money, but
                    to its value at the time when they were entered into. This principle, which is
                    conformable to the just maxim of the civil law <hi rend="italic">(Valor

                    least, by the kings of France, during the middle ages. Ordonnances of Philip le
                    Bel, Philip of Valois, and Charles VI., issued subsequently to their having <hi
                    rend="italic">increased</hi> the value of money, or, as the French historians
                    term it, returned from the <hi rend="italic">foible</hi> to the <hi

                    all previous debts and contracts should be settled by reference to the previous
                    standard. But though the same reason existed, it does not appear that any such
                    ordonnances were ever issued when the value of money was degraded. It is
                    obvious, indeed, that no government could derive any advantage whatever from
                    reducing the value of money, were it to order, as it is in justice bound to do,
                    that all <hi rend="italic">existing</hi> contracts should be adjusted by the old
                    standard. Such a measure would reduce the revenue without reducing the
                    incumbrances of the state; whilst, by establishing a new standard of value, and
                    unsettling all the notions of the public, it would open a door for the grossest
                    abuses, and be productive of infinite confusion and disorder in the dealings of
                    individuals.</p>
                <p>The odium and positive disadvantage attending the degradation of metallic money,
                    appear to have at length induced most governments to abstain from it. But they
                    have only renounced one mode of playing at fast and loose with the property of
                    their subjects, to adopt another and a still more pernicious one. The injustice
                    which was formerly done by diminishing the quantity of bullion contained in the
                    coins of different countries, is now perpetrated with greater ease, and to a
                    still more ruinous extent, by the depreciation of their paper currency.<note

                <p>In the long period from 1601 to 1697, no change was made in the standard of money
                    in this country. A project for enfeebling the standard had indeed been
                    entertained, both in 1626 and 1695; but, in the former instance, it was quashed
                    by the celebrated speech addressed by Sir Robert Cotton to the Lords of the
                    Privy Council, and in the latter by the opposition of Mr. Montague, then
                    Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the House of Commons, and by the impression made
                    by the writings of Mr. Locke, by whom the injustice of the scheme was admirably
                    exposed, out of doors. It was reserved for Mr. Pitt to set aside a standard
                    which had been preserved inviolate for nearly two centuries. The Order in
                    Council of the 25th February 1797, and the acts of Parliament by which it was
                    followed up, effected a total change in our ancient monetary system; and,

                    Bank of England paper was secured, by its being exclusively issued in payment of
                    the interest of the public debt, and by its also being received as cash in all
                    payments into the exchequer; but no attempt was made to sustain the value of
                    this paper on a par with the value of gold or silver. Full power was given to
                    the directors of the Bank to raise or depress the value of money, as their
                    interest or caprice might suggest. They were enabled to exchange unlimited
                    quantities of scraps of engraved paper, of the intrinsic worth, perhaps, of 5s.
                    a quire, for as many, or the value of as many, hundreds of thousands of pounds.
                    And, in such circumstances, our only wonder is, not that paper money became
                    depreciated, but that its value was not more reduced, and that a still greater
                    quantity of bank-notes were not thrust into circulation.</p>
                <p>For the first three or four years after the restriction, the Directors, unaware,
                    perhaps, of the nature of the immense power placed in their hands, seem to have
                    regulated their issues nearly on the same principles that had regulated them,
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> while they were obliged to pay in coin. It
                    appears from i the <hi rend="italic">Tables of the Price of Bullion,</hi>
                    published by order of the House of Commons, that until 1801, bank-notes were on
                    a par with gold. In 1801 and 1802, however, they were at a discount of from 8½
                    to 7⅜ per cent.; but they again recovered their value; and from 1803 to 1809,
                    both inclusive, they were only at a discount of £2, 13s. 2d. per cent. But in
                    1809 and 1810, the Directorsappear to have totally lost sight of every principle
                    by which their issues had previously been governed. The average amount of
                    bank-notes in circulation, which had never exceeded 17½ millions, nor fallen
                    short of 16½ millions, in any one year, from 1802 to 1808, both inclusive, was
                    in 1809 raised to £18,927,833; and,in 1810, to £22,541,523. The issues of
                    country bank paper were increased in a still greater proportion; and, as there
                    was no corresponding increase in the business of the country, the discount on
                    bank-notes rose from £2, 13s. 2d., in 1809, to £13, 9s. 6d. per cent, in 1810.
                    The recommendation to return to cash payments, contained in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Report of the Bullion Committee,</hi> presented to the House of
                    Commons in 1810, appears to have given a slight check to the issues of the Bank.
                    All apprehensions from this quarter were, however, speedily dissipated; for in
                    May 1811, when guineas were notoriously bought at a premium, and banknotes were
                    at an open discount, as compared with gold bullion, of upwards of ten per cent.,
                    the House of Commons not only <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> refused to fix any
                    certain period for reverting to cash payments, but actually voted a resolution,
                    declaring that the promissory notes of the Bank of England had <hi rend="italic"
                    >hitherto been, and were then, held to be, in public estimation, equivalent to
                    the legal coin of the realm.</hi></p>
                <p>This memorable resolution; a resolution which took for granted that a part was
                    equal to a whole; that £90 and £100 were the same thing; relieved the Bank from
                    all urn easiness respecting the interference of Parliament, and tempted the
                    Directors to increase the amount of paper in circulation. The consequence was,
                    that in 1812, it was at an average discount of 20^; in 1813, of 23; and, in
                    1814, of 25 per cent. This was the <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi> of
                    depreciation. The importation of foreign corn, subsequent to the opening of the
                    Dutch ports in 1814, having occasioned a great decline of the price of the
                    principal article of agricultural produce, produced an unprecedented degree of
                    distress, first among the farmers, and latterly among the country <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> bankers. It <pb break="no" facs="nls:193824448"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-4448-0403"/> is estimated that, in 1814, 1815 and 1816, no
                    fewer than 240 private banking companies either became altogether bankrupt, or,
                    at least, stopped payment; and the reduction that was thus occasioned in the
                    quantity of bank-notes in circulation, raised their value so rapidly, that, in
                    October 1816, the discount was reduced to L.l, 8s. 7d. per cent. In 1817 and
                    1818, the average discount on bank paper, as compared with gold, did not exceed
                    L.2, 13s. 2d. per cent. In the early part of 1819, it rose to about six per
                    cent., but it very soondeclined; and in 1820andl821paperwasnearlyon a level with
                    gold. (See Table No. V.annexed to this article.)</p>
                <p>These fluctuations were exceedingly injurious. From 1809 to 1815, the creditors
                    of every antecedent contract, land-holders whose estates had been let on lease,
                    stock-holders, and annuitants of every description—all, in short, who could not
                    raise the nominal amount of their claims or of their incomes proportionally to
                    the fall in the real value of money, were to this extent losers. The injustice
                    that would have been done to the creditors of the state and of individuals, who
                    had made their loans in gold, or paper equivalent to gold, by raising the
                    denomination of the coin twenty-five per cent., however gross and palpable,
                    would not have been greater than was actually done them in 1814, by compelling
                    them to receive payment of their just debts in paper depreciated to that extent.
                    Circumstances which could neither be controlled by the Bank of England nor the
                    government, put an end, as has been seen, to this system. But we suffered much,
                    and perhaps are still suffering somewhat from the sacrifices imposed by the rise
                    in the value of money.</p>
                <p>And yet, strange to say, there is a considerable party amongst us who, are even
                    now, (1837) at the end of eighteen or twenty years, clamouring for a fresh
                    reduction of the standard. It is no doubt true, that after a currency has been
                    for a considerable perio.d depreciated, equal injustice is done by again raising
                    its value, as was done by first depressing it. There is good reason, however, to
                    doubt, whether the depreciation from 1809 to 1815 (for the depreciation of 2½
                    per cent, during the seven preceding years is too inconsiderable to be taken
                    into account) extended over a sufficiently lengthened period to have warranted
                    the legislature in departing from the old standard. But, without giving any
                    opinion on this point, which is confessedly one of considerable difficulty, it
                    is sufficient to remark, that the value of the currency was raised, <hi
                    rend="italic">independently altogether of the interference of government.</hi>
                    The destruction of country bank paper, occasioned by the renewed intercourse
                    with the continent, and the consequent introduction of cheap foreign com, raised
                    the value of paper, in October 1816, to within 1∣ per cent, of par. Now, as the
                    act 59 Geo. III. was not passed until 1819, and as the currency had not been
                    depreciated in the interim, we confess our inability to discover the grounds on
                    which <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is affirmed to have been the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cause</hi> of that rise in the value of money which took place <hi
                    rend="italic">three years before it was in existence.</hi> The proceedings in
                    1819 did not really add three per cent.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    raise it. Their great object was to shut the door against a <hi rend="italic"
                    >new</hi> depreciation, and to prevent paper, which had for three years been
                    nearly on a level with gold, being again degraded. By maintaining the <hi
                    rend="italic">old</hi> standard, or, which is the same thing, by maintaining the
                    currency at a value nearly corresponding to that to which it had attained in
                    1816, 1817, and 1818, Parliament certainly gave permanence to the injury which
                    the rise in the value of money had occasioned to the debtors in all the
                    contracts entered into between 1810 and 1815; but if, instead of maintaining
                    this old standard, they had raised the mint price of bullion to its market price
                    in 1814, they would have done an equal injury to the far more numerous body of
                    creditors, in <hi rend="italic">all the contracts entered into previously
                    to</hi> 1810, <hi rend="italic">and in the three years subsequent to autumn</hi>
                    1816.</p>
                <p>Under these circumstances, it was impossible to adopt any measure capable of
                    giving general satisfaction to those whose interests were so widely different;
                    and against which many plausible, and even forcible objections, might not have
                    been stated. We are firmly persuaded, however, that the legislature followed
                    that course which was, on the whole, the wisest, and most advantageous. It must
                    be remembered, that much of that inconvenience and distress, which always result
                    from every sudden rise in the value of money, had been got over in 1817 and
                    1818. The rents of such farms as had been let during the depreciation had been
                    very generally reduced, a vast number of annuity bonds had been cancelled, and
                    prices and wages had begun to accommodate themselves to the new scale of value.
                    Sir Robert Peel’s bill gave stability to arrangements which had been brought
                    about by the natural course of events; and, by fixing the standard at its former
                    limit, secured us, as long at least as we have good sense and honesty to
                    maintain it inviolate, against the risk of future derangement and
                    fluctuation.</p>
                <p>But, even if it could be shewn that the 59 Geo. III. was inexpedient at the time
                    when it was passed, that would add nothing to the plea of those who are now
                    contending for its repeal. All the objections which it was possible to make to
                    the degradation of the standard in 1819, must apply with a thousand times the
                    force to every scheme for degrading it in 1837; while, on the other hand, all
                    the arguments that could have been urged in favour of the measure at the former
                    period are now quite worthless. The restored standard has been maintained for
                    eighteen years: and ninety-nine out of every hundred of the existing contracts
                    have been entered into with reference to it. To tamper with it now would be the
                    extreme of madness. We should again witness the most pernicious subversion of
                    private fortunes. Debtors would be enriched at the expence of their creditors;
                    the ignorant and unwary would become the prey of the cunning and the crafty; and
                    capitalists would be eager to transfer their stock from a country where it was
                    impossible to lend it, except at the risk of getting it repaid in a depreciated
                    currency. “Whatever, therefore,” to avail ourselves of the just and forcible
                    expressions of Mr. Harris, “may be the fate of future times, and whatever the
                    exigency of affairs may require, it is to be hoped that that most awkward,
                    clandestine, and most direful method, of cancelling debts by debasing the
                    standard of money, will be the last that shall be thought of.”— <hi
