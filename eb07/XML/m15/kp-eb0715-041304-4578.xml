                <p><label type="entry">MONGE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Gaspar</hi></label>, the inventor
                    of descriptive geometry, and one of the founders of the Polytechnic School, was
                    born at Beaune in 1746. His father was a dealer in small wares, who had much
                    difficulty in supporting his family, consisting of three sons, all of whom were
                    inclined to the sciences; but having the good sense to appreciate the importance
                    of instruction, he employed every means in his power to procure this benefit to
                    his children. The subject of this notice, being the eldest, received the
                    rudiments of his education at the college of the Oratory in his native town,
                    where he was initiated in the elements of mathematics, and whence, having
                    completed the usual course, he was removed to a superior school at Lyons, where
                    his precocious talents quickly developed themselves. At the age of sixteen, he
                    was judged qualified to assist his new masters in teaching physics; and before
                    he had completed his nineteenth year, he had been admitted into the school which
                    had been founded at Mezieres for the instruction of engineers. But this
                    establishment was only opened to privileged scholars, twenty in number, of whom
                    one half left, and as many joined it, every year. In order to participate in its
                    advantages, it was essential to possess an elevated station in society; and the
                    humble fortune of Monge was therefore a title of exclusion. He was placed as a
                    pupil and modeller in the class, with the superintendence and direction of works
                    in fortification; and amidst these obscure labours, where dexterity was of more
                    importance than intelligence, the qualities of his mind remained unobserved. He
                    was considered merely as an expert modeller, and he longed to escape from a
                    reputation which was equally unworthy of his genius and offensive to his
                    self-love.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the commandant of the school selected him to make the practical
                    calculations of an operation of deployment, or defiling, which had been
                    prescribed as a task. But Monge, dissatisfied with the tentative means by which
                    the problem was usually resolved, and impressed with the importance of
                    signalizing the commencement of his career, imagined a more expeditious and not
                    less certain, though far more scientific method, for attaining the result
                    desired, by the instrumentality of geometry. His solution was contested, upon
                    the ground that he had not made allowance for the time required to exhaust the
                    series of calculations; but its merit was nevertheless recognised, and the
                    capacity of the pupil strongly exemplified. The latter was then nineteen.
                    Bossut, who professed mathematics at Mézières, now appointed Monge his
                    assistant; and he was attached, in the same capacity, to Abbe Nollet, professor
                    of natural philosophy, whom he soon afterwards succeeded in that chair. In this
                    situation he made a number of curious experiments on gas, molecular attraction,
                    and the effects of optics and electricity, as well as refined deductions on
                    meteorology, and on the important discovery of the production of water by the
                    combustion of inflammable air. Anticipated by Cavendish, without being aware of
                    it, he examined this phenomenon with scrupulous attention, and assigned the
                    share of caloric and light in its production. About the same time Monge extended
                    and generalised his first mathematical essays, and setting out from the
                    principle which refers to three rectangular coordinates the position of any
                    point whatever taken in space, he made it the foundation of a new and fruitful
                    doctrine, indispensable for all the arts of construction, and to which, when
                    completed by successive developments, he applied the name of Descriptive
                    Geometry. This collection of simple and uniform methods was, however, at
                    variance with the incoherent practices which had been sanctioned by time; the
                    attempt made by the inventor to introduce his innovations into the course of
                    instruction in the school encountered strenuous opposition; and more than twenty
                    years elapsed before he succeeded in obtaining the application of his geometry
                    to the tracings of carpentry.</p>
                <p>Monge generally passed his vacations at Paris, where he mingled in the society of
                    men who then held the first rank in the sciences. Being already a correspondent
                    of the Academy, to the honours of which he aspired, he found active patrons in
                    Lavoisier, Condorcet, La Rochefoucauld, and the President Bochart de Saron; and,
                    through the interest of D’Alembert, he was received into the Academy of Sciences
                    in 1780. The same year he was associated with Bossut, who had been appointed to
                    deliver the course of hydrodynamics established at the Louvre by Turgot. To
                    perform these double functions, he was obliged to be alternately at Paris and at
                    Mezieres; but the situation of examiner of the pupils of the naval school, to
                    which he was appointed after the death of Bezout in 1783, withdrew him from
                    Mézières, where he had laid the foundation of his fame, and initiated in the
                    sciences such men as Meusnier, Tinseau, Carnot, Coulomb, and others scarcely
                    inferior to them. For the benefit of the naval school he composed a treatise on
                    statics, in which he proceeded synthetically, in order to get rid of equations,
                    and rendered the principles more accessible by relaxing the rigour of
                    demonstration. His next appointment was that of professor of physics in the
                    Lyceum of Paris; an institution which had for its object to disguise instruction
                    under agreeable forms, and present it in an attractive shape to a number of
                    indolent amateurs. To interest such frivolous auditors he would have required
                    the peculiar talents of Fontenelle; but if he failed to impart that fascination
                    to science which formed the distinguishing attribute of the illustrious man just
                    named, he knew how to render his lessons attractive by piquant views and
                    ingenious illustrations, independently of the graces of language.</p>
                <p>Like many others, he was at first led away by the promises and hopes of the
                    revolution. Adopting those notions of political perfectibility, which then
                    filled all heads, he conceived that the barriers which arrested generous
                    emulation were for ever removed, and that talents would henceforth command that
                    distinction which of right belonged to them; but the terrible events that
                    followed in such rapid succession in some measure dissipated this illusion,
                    which he shared in common with so many others. Called to the ministry of marine
                    after the 10th of August 1792, he accepted the appointment, being determined, he
                    said, by the presence of the Prussians on the French soil; he was thus a member
                    of the government, which then formed the ministers into one body, under the
                    denomination of the Executive Council; and it was in this capacity that he
                    concurred with his colleagues in causing the judgment which condemned Louis XVI.
                    to death to be carried into execution. But he soon discovered that, amidst the
                    exasperation of faction, his place was not tenable, and accordingly<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193824591" xml:id="kp-eb0715-4591-0414"/>, in the month of
                    April 1793, he tendered his resignation, which was accepted. Some time
                    afterwards, the committee of public safety made an appeal to the savans to
                    assist in the defence of the French territory. Nine hundred thousand men were
                    ready to march to "the frontier to repulse the European crusade which menaced
                    the republic; but the existing manufactories were insufficient to produce the
                    tenth part of the <hi rend="italic">materiel</hi> requisite for so mighty
                    preparations. It was necessary to multiply manufactures, to describe and
                    simplify their processes, to direct the operations of the workshops, to
                    decompose innumerable metallic alloys for the wants of the artillery, to extract
                    copper, to prepare steel, and to draw from the resources of the country alone a
                    prodigious quantity of powder. The progress of the enemy required extraordinary
                    celerity. Monge applied himself wholly to these operations, and distinguished
                    himself by his indefatigable activity. He directed his attention to the
                    manufacture of arms, the founderies, the boring of cannon, and the powder-mills,
                    superintending and simplifying the various processes; he gave instructions for
                    the preparation of saltpetre, and composed, at intervals, his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Art</hi><hi rend="italic">de fabriquer</hi><hi rend="italic">les Canons,</hi>
                    which was soon followed by his <hi rend="italic">Avis aux Ouvriers en Fer, sur
                    la Fabrication de V Acier,</hi> containing an exposition of the means of
                    obtaining steel by combining iron with a little charcoal.</p>
                <p>Services so important having raised in public estimation men of science, against
                    whom the axe of proscription was soon whetted, they obtained, after the fall of
                    Robespierre, a tardy protection for public instruction. The Normal School was
                    created, and a pure light diffused on the exposition of scientific truths. At
                    length Monge published his <hi rend="italic">Géométrie</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Descriptive,</hi> which he had so long kept secret, and which unquestionably
                    forms his highest title of distinction. In explaining this collection of
                    ingenious methods, where the modifications of extension are developed and
                    combined by the aid of design, and where, from a sort of imitative language, are
                    deduced, by an exact description, the truths which result from the forms of
                    bodies and their respective positions, he dilated with pleasure on the
                    advantages which might be derived from his work for rectifying the judgment and
                    improving the dexterity of workmen, as well as for simplifying machines, and
                    adding to the comforts of society. Of all the applications <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> winch his geometry was susceptible, he has only treated of five, viz.
                    carpentry, cutting stones, deployment, linear and aerial perspective, and the
                    distribution of light and shadow. To him also France was, in a great measure,
                    indebted for the establishment of the Polytechnic School; for, although
                    Berthollet and Guyton-Morveau were associated with him in this undertaking, it
                    was he who arranged the system of studies ultimately adopted, and which remained
                    unaffected by the rapid mobility of the revolutionary creations. This was not
                    only a central school, where aspirants might imbibe the general principles that
                    connect all the branches of the public service, and establish a fraternal
                    communication and free transmission of ideas between different classes; it was
                    also open to all those whose scientific conceptions were calculated to improve
                    the useful arts, to economise labour, and to enlighten industry; and although
                    the system of instruction was perhaps too extensive and profound, there can be
                    no doubt that it proved of immense benefit to France. From these labours Mouge
                    was called to Italy, with the sculptor Moite, the painter Barthélemy, and
                    Berthollet, Thouin, and Labillardière, his colleagues in the Institute, to
                    collect those masterpieces of art, the cession of which had been stipulated by
                    the treaty of Tolentino. This mission lasted more than a year, and Monge, by his
                    experience in mechanical processes, ably seconded the zeal of his associates for
                    the conservation and removal of the conquered monuments.</p>
                <p>Having completed his labours in this department, he was charged, along with
                    General Berthier, to lay be·' fore the Directory the treaty of Campo Formio;
                    and, not long afterwards, he was sent to Rome, along with Daunou, there to
                    organize a republic; an undertaking which had scarcely been completed when
                    Bonaparte sailed for Egypt. Monge, having been ordered to join the expedition,
                    embarked at Civita-Vecchia, along with Desaix, and, in June 1798, overtook the
                    army at Malta. In Egypt his labours were incessant. He examined the pyramids;
                    visited the obelisk and walls of Heliopolis; explored the antiquities scattered
                    round Cairo and Alexandria; described the state of the Mekias, or wells
                    constructed in the isle of Raou-dah by the Kalif Almamoun, to measure the rise
                    of the Nile; superintended the geodesical and monumental description of Egypt;
                    and was at length appointed president of the Institute formed at Cairo upon the
                    model of that of France. In this last capacity his exertions were prodigious.
                    When the naval defeat of Aboukir had cut off all communication with Europe, the
                    savans assembled at Cairo had to provide for wants still more numerous than
                    those of France in the year 1793; as, independently of military resources, they
                    had in fact to create the utensils necessary for the usages of life and the
                    operations of the arts. The members of the Institute, however, divided these
                    labours amongst them, and the attempts of individuals were guided and
                    facilitated by the inquiries and researches of commissions formed out of the
                    same learned body. On this trying occasion Monge and Berthollet were equally
                    distinguished; and when a revolt broke out at Cairo, they proved that their
                    courage and presence of mind, in the midst of danger, were not surpassed by
                    their zeal for the advancement of science. In a journey to Suez, undertaken by
                    Napoleon, Monge recognised the traces of the canal which by the Nile established
                    a communication between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean; he visited the ruins
                    of Pelusium, and, at the opening of the valley through which it is believed that
                    the Hebrews proceeded towards Mount Sinai, he observed the fountain of Moses. He
                    also accompanied Bonaparte to Syria, and was seized with a dangerous illness at
                    Acre, where, in his tent, he had the affliction to receive the last sighs of his
                    pupil, General Caffarelli.</p>
                <p>On his return to Europe with Bonaparte, Monge became president of the Egyptian
                    Commission, and was again placed at the head of the Polytechnic School, where he
                    resumed his place amongst the professors, and often defended, against the
                    prejudices of Bonaparte, the generous youth, whom the despotic instinct of that
                    military chief had led him to dislike. On the formation of the senate, he was
                    appointed a member of that body, with an ample provision, and the title of Count
                    of Pelusium. The grief occasioned by the fall of Napoleon was augmented by the
                    dissolution of the Polytechnic School, and the banishment of the surviving
                    members of the Convention who had sent Louis XVI. to the scaffold; a measure
                    which inferred the expatriation of Μ. Eschasseriaux, one of his sons-in-law. The
                    erazure of his name from the roll of the Institute, in consequence of the
                    expurgations of 1816, gave the last blow to his sensibility. Repeated attacks of
                    apoplexy had already shaken his naturally robust frame, whilst the obliteration
                    of his ideas, and all the symptoms of a rapid decline, announced his approaching
                    dissolution. He died on the 28th of July 1818, in the seventy-second year of his
                    age.</p>
                <p>The separate publications of Monge are, 1. Traité Elémentaire de Statique, Paris,
                    1786, in 8vo,∙ 2. Description de l’Art de fabriquer les Canons, Paris, 1795, in
                    4to; 3. Leçons de Géométrie Descriptive, Paris, 1813, in 8vo; 4. Application de
                    l’Analyse à la Géométrie des Surfaces du Premier et du Deuxième Degré, Paris,
                    1809, in 4to. In this last work he presents the equations of lines, planes, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193824604" xml:id="kp-eb0715-4604-0415"/> and curves of the
                    second order, the theory of tangent planes, and the principal circumstances of
                    the generation of curved surfaces, expressed by equations of partial
                    differences, which he employs to integrate, in an elegant manner, a great number
                    of equations, by following step by step the details of descriptive geometry. As
                    early as the year 1772, he had shown the connection which exists between curves
                    of double curvature, and developed surfaces. Monge likewise inserted four
                    memoirs on pure analysis in the <hi rend="italic">Collection des Savants</hi><hi
