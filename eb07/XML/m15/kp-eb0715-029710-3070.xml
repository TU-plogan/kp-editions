                    muz, <hi rend="italic">iteravit),</hi> a part of the Jewish Talmud. The Mischna
                    contains the text, and the Gemara, which is the second part of the Talmud,
                    contains the commentaries; so that the Gemara is, as it were, a glossary on the
                    Mischna.</p>
                <p>The Mischna consists of various traditions of the Jews, and explanations of
                    several passages of Scripture. These traditions serve as an explication of the
                    written law, and supplement to it; they are said to have been dclivered to Moses
                    during the time of his abode on the Mount; and he is supposed to have afterwards
                    communicated them to Aaron, to Eleazar, and to his servant Joshua, by whom they
                    were transmitted to the seventy elders, and from them to the prophets, who
                    communicated them to the men of the great sanhedrim, from whom the wise men of
                    Jerusalem and Babylon received them. According to Prideaux’s account, they
                    passed from Jeremiah to Baruch, from him to Ezra, and from Ezra to the men of
                    the great synagogue, the last of whom was Simon the Just. The latter delivered
                    them to Antigonus of Socho, from whom they came down in regular succession to
                    Simeon, who took our Saviour in his arms; to Gamaliel, at whose feet Paul was
                    educated; and last of all to Rabbi Judah the Holy, who committed them to writing
                    in the Mischna. But Dr Prideaux, rejecting this Jewish fiction, observes, that
                    after the death of Simon the Just, about 299 years before Christ, arose the
                    Mischnical doctors, who, by their comments and conclusions, added to the number
                    of those traditions which had been received and allowed by Ezra and the men of
                    the great synagogue; so that towards the middle of the second century after
                    Christ, under the empire of Antoninus Pius, it was found necessary to commit
                    these traditions to writing; more especially as their country had considerably
                    suffered under Hadrian, and many of their schools had been dissolved, and their
                    learned men cut off, and thus the usual method of preserving their traditions
                    had failed. On this occasion Rabbi Judah, being rector of the school at
                    Tiberias, and president of the sanhedrim in that place, undertook the work, and
                    compiled it in six books, each consisting of several tracts, which altogether
                    make up the number of sixty-three. (Prideaux, <hi rend="italic">Connex.</hi>
                    vol. ii. p. 468, 9th edit.) This learned author computes that the Mischna was
                    composed about the 150th year of our Lord; but Dr Lightfoot says, that Rabbi
                    Judah compiled the Mischna about the year of Christ 190, in the latter end of
                    the reign of Commodus, or, as some compute, in the year of Christ 220. Dr
                    Lardner is of opinion that this work could not have been finished before the
                    year 190, or later. <hi rend="italic">(Collection of Jewish and Heathen
                    Testimonies,</hi> vol. i. p. 178.) Thus was formed the book called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mischna,</hi> which the Jews have generally received with the
                    greatest veneration. The original has been published with a Latin translation by
                    Surcnhusius, with notes of his own and others from the learned Maimollides, in
                    six vols. folio, Amsterdam, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823083"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-3083-0298"/>1698-1703. It is written in a much purer style,
                    and is not nearly so full of dreams and visions, as the Gemara.</p>
