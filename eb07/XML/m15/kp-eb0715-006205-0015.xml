                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">MIDWIFERY</label>, the art of assisting women in parturition.
                    In a more extended sense, it is understood to comprehend also the treatment of
                    the diseases of women and children. It is obvious that the obstetrical art must
                    have been almost coeval with mankind; but in Europe it continued in a very rude
                    state till the seventeenth century; and even after physic and surgery had become
                    distinct professions, it remained almost totally uncultivated.</p>
                <p>It is a curious fact, that in China the very reverse of this has taken place. In
                    that empire, both physic and surgery are still in a state of degradation; but
                    for some hundreds of years, the art of midwifery has, it is said, been practised
                    by a set of men destined to the purpose by order of government. These persons,
                    who hold in society the same rank which lithotomists formerly did in this
                    country, are called in whenever a woman has been above a specified number of
                    hours in labour, and employ a mechanical contrivance for completing the delivery
                    without injury to the infant. A proportional number of such individuals is
                    allotted to each district containing a certain population. It is said, that the
                    Chinese government was led to make this provision for alleviating the sufferings
                    of women in childbirth, in consequence of a representation, that annually many
                    women died undelivered; and that in the majority of cases the cause of
                    obstruction might have been removed by very simple mechanical expedients.</p>
                <p>Both Sir George Staunton and Mr Barrow were ignorant of this fact; and the latter
                    in particular expressly mentions that there are no men-midwives in China; but we
                    have learned the facts above stated from a gentleman who resided upwards of
                    twenty years as surgeon to the British factory at Canton, and who had both the
                    ability and the inclination to make himself acquainted, during the course of so
                    long a residence, with all the customs and prejudices of the natives relating to
                    the preservation of human life and health.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of the seventeenth century, the same causes which had so long
                    before led to the cultivation of midwifery in China produced the same effect in
                    Europe. The dangers to which women are sometimes exposed during labour excited
                    the compassion of the benevolent; and hence a considerable part of the first
                    hospital which was established for the reception of the indigent sick, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hotel</hi><hi rend="italic">Dieu</hi> of Paris, was appropriated
                    to lying-in women. The opportunities of practice which that hospital afforded,
                    directed the attention of medical men to the numerous accidents which happen
                    during labour, and to the various diseases which occur after delivery. Public
                    teaching followed, and soon afterwards began the custom of employing men in the
                    practice of midwifery. From this period the art rapidly improved; and it is now
                    in many parts of Europe, particularly in Great Britain, in as great a state of
                    perfection as physic or surgery. There can be no doubt that the improvement of
                    the art of midwifery chiefly arose from medical men directing their attention to
                    the subject; but the propriety of men being employed in such a profession has
                    been much questioned by many individuals of considerable respectability. It
                    appears, indeed, that this question may be brought within a very narrow compass.
                    It may be assumed as a fact established beyond the reach of controversy, that
                    sometimes dangers and difficulties occur during labour, which can be lessened or
                    removed by those only who have an intimate knowledge of the structure of the
                    human body and of the practice of physic. On such occasions, it must be
                    admitted, that medical men alone may be useful. But as such labours occur only
                    in the proportion of two or three in the hundred, the general practice might be
                    confided to midwives, if they could be taught to manage ordinary cases, and to
                    foresee and distinguish difficulties or dangers, so as to procure in sufficient
                    time additional assistance. It is on this point that the decision of the
                    question must depend, and there can be no doubt that women may be taught all
                    this. But there are many who allege, that, a little knowledge being a dangerous
                    thing, midwives acquire a self-sufficiency which renders them averse to calling
                    in superior assistance; and that, in consequence, they often occasion the most
                    deplorable accidents both to the mother and the child. In England this is the
                    popular opinion, and hence women are there almost entirely excluded from the
                    practice of midwifery. A similar prejudice against midwives has, it is believed,
                    begun in some parts of Scotland; but it is presumed this will gradually cease,
                    when it is considered that, in general, the Scotch midwives are regularly
                    instructed, and are at the same time both virtuous and industrious. If they
                    attend strictly to their duty, and invariably prefer the safety of their
                    patients to their own feelings or supposed interest, they will deservedly retain
                    the public confidence. But if in cases of difficulty or danger they trust to
                    their own exertions, or from interested motives decline the assistance of able
                    practitioners, and if they interfere in the treatment of the diseases of women
                    and children, they will in a few years be entirely excluded from practice. For
                    details connected with the practice of midwifery, we refer to the professional
                    works which treat of the subject, and which are too well known to require
                    specification.</p>
