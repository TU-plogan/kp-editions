                <p><label type="entry">MOTION</label> is now generally considered as incapable of
                    definition, being merely a simple ideaor notion received by the senses. The
                    ancients, however, thought differently. Some of them defined it to be a passage
                    out of one state into another, which conveys no idea to him who is ignorant of
                    the nature of motion. The Peripatetic definition has been mentioned elsewhere,
                    and shown to be wholly unintelligible, as well as the celebrated division, by
                    the same sect, of motion into four classes belonging to the three categories,
                    <hi rend="italic">quality, quantity,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">where</hi> (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Metaphysics).</hi> The Cartesians, too, amongst the
                    moderns, pretend to define motion by calling it a passage or removal of one part
                    of matter, out of the neighbourhood of those parts to which it is immediately
                    contiguous, into the neighbourhood of others. Borelli defines motion to be the
                    successive passage of a body from place to place. Others say that it is the
                    application of a body to different parts <hi rend="italic">of</hi> infinite and
                    immoveable space; and Mr Young, in his Essay on the Powers of Nature, has given
                    as a definition of motion, change of place.</p>
                <p>We have elsewhere offered our opinion of every possible attempt to define motion;
                    but as the author of the last-quoted definition has endeavoured to obviate such
                    objections as ours, candour requires that he be heard for himself. “It is said,”
                    he observes, “by some, that change implies motion, and therefore cannot be a
                    part of its definition, being the very thing defined. To this I answer, We are
                    speaking of the sensible idea of motion, as it appears <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193826671" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6671-0574"/> to our sight; now changes do
                    appear to our view, and to all our senses, which give us no idea of motion.
                    Changes in heat or cold; in colour, flavour, smell, sound, hardness, softness,
                    pain, pleasure; in these, and many other ideas, changes do not produce ideas
                    like that produced by a ball rolling or a stone falling. We may perhaps
                    ultimately trace them to motion, but to insensible motions; to motions which
                    arise only in reflection, and constitute no part of the actual idea of change.
                    We can therefore conceive of change without conceiving at the same time of
                    motion. Change is a generic idea, including many species; motion, as a sensible
                    idea, is a species of that genus. Change is therefore a necessary part of the
                    definition of motion; it marks the genus of the thing defined. Motion is a
                    change; but as there are many species of change, which of those species is
                    motion? The answer is, it is a change of place. This marks the species, and
                    distinguishes it from change of colour, of temperament, and figure.”</p>
                <p>This is the ablest defence of an attempt to define motion that we have ever seen;
                    and at first view the definition itself appears to be perfect. Aristotle, the
                    prince of definers, considers a definition<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Dr Reid’s account of Aristotle’s logic, in Lord Kames’
                    Sketches of Man.</p></note> as “a speech declaring what a thing is.” Every thing
                    essential to the thing defined, and nothing more, must be contained in the
                    definition. Now the essence of a thing consists of these two parts: first, what
                    is common to it with other things of the same kind; and secondly, what
                    distinguishes it from other things of the same kind. The first is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">genus</hi> of the thing; the second, its <hi rend="italic"
                    >specific difference.</hi> The definition, therefore, consists of these two
                    parts.</p>
                <p>In obedience to this rule, the definition under consideration seems to consist of
                    the genus, signified by the word <hi rend="italic">change,</hi> and of the
                    specific difference, denoted by the words <hi rend="italic">of place.</hi> But
                    does the speech <hi rend="italic">change of place</hi> really declare what
                    motion is? We cannot admit that it does? as, in our apprehension, a change of
                    place is the effect of motion, and not motion itself Suppose a lover of
                    dialectic undertaking to define the stroke by which he saw his neighbour wounded
                    with a bludgeon; what should we think of his art were he to call it a contusion
                    on the head? He might say that contusion is a general term, as contusions may be
                    produced on the arms, on the legs, and on various parts of the body; and as
                    there are many species of contusion, if he were asked which of those species was
                    the stroke to be defined, he might answer, “a contusion on the head.” Here would
                    be apparently the genus and specific difference; the former denoted by <hi
                    rend="italic">contusion,</hi> and the latter by the words <hi rend="italic">on
                    the head.</hi> But would this be a definition of a stroke? No, surely. A
                    contusion on the head may be the effect of a stroke, but it can no more be the
                    stroke itself, than a blow can be a bludgeon, or a flesh wound the point of a
                    sword. Equally evident it is, that a change of place cannot be motion; because
                    every body must have been actually moved before we can discern, or even
                    conceive, a change of its place.</p>
                <p>The act of changing the place would perhaps come nearer to a definition of
                    motion; but so far would it be from “a speech declaring what motion is,” that we
                    are confident a man who had never by any of his senses perceived a body in
                    actual motion, would acquire no ideas whatever from the words “act of changing
                    place.” He might have experienced changes in heat, cold, smell, and sound; but
                    he could not possibly combine the ideas of such changes with the signification
                    of the word <hi rend="italic">place,</hi> were he even capable of understanding
                    that word, which to us appears to be more than doubtful. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Metaphysics.</hi></p>
                <p>The distinctions of motion into different kinds have been no less various, and no
                    less insignificant, than the several definitions of it. The moderns who reject
                    the Peripatetic division of motion into four classes, yet consider it themselves
                    as either absolute or relative. Thus we are told, that absolute motion is the
                    change of absolute place, and that its celerity must be measured by the quantity
                    of absolute space which the moving body passes through in a given time. Relative
                    motion, on the other hand, is a mutation of the relative or vulgar place of the
                    moving body, and has its celerity estimated by the quantity of relative space
                    passed through.</p>
                <p>Now it is obvious, that this distinction conveys no ideas without a further
                    explanation of the terms by which it is expressed; but that explanation is
                    impossible to be given. Thus, before we can understand what absolute motion is,
                    we must understand what is meant by absolute place. But absolute place is a
                    contradiction; for all place is relative, and consists in the positions of
                    different bodies with regard to one another. Were a globe in the regions of
                    empty space to be put in motion by Almighty Power, and all the rest of the
                    corporeal world to be soon afterwards annihilated, the motion would undoubtedly
                    continue unchanged; and yet, according to this distinction, it would be at first
                    relative, and afterwards absolute. That the beginning of such a motion would be
                    perceptible, and the remainder of it imperceptible, is readily granted; but on
                    this account to consider it as of two kinds, is as absurd as to suppose the
                    motion of the minute hand of a clock to be affected by our looking at it.</p>
                <p>Leaving these unintelligible distinctions, therefore, we now come to consider a
                    question of a very abstruse nature, but much agitated amongst philosophers,
                    namely, What is the original source of motion in the creation? Is it natural to
                    matter, or are we to ascribe it to the immediate and continual agency of some
                    immaterial being? The former has been strenuously argued by the Cartesians, and
                    the latter by the Newtonians. The arguments of the former, founded upon the
                    chimerical hypothesis of vortices and the original construction of matter, were
                    evidently inconclusive; and the hypothesis of Sir Isaac Newton, who asserted
                    that it was naturally incapable of motion, appeared more probable. To account
                    for the quantity of motion in the universe, therefore, it became necessary to
                    have recourse either to the Deity, or to some subordinate spiritual agent; and
                    this became the more necessary, as the doctrine of an absolute vacuum in the
                    celestial spaces, that is, throughout the incomparably greatest part of the
                    creation, was one of the fundamental maxims of the system. As it was absolutely
                    denied that matter existed in these spaces, and as it was plain that the
                    celestial bodies affected one another at immense distances, the powers of
                    attraction and repulsion were naturally called in as the sources of motion by
                    their impulse upon inert and sluggish matter. And these being admitted, a
                    speculation ensued concerning their nature. Spiritual, it was confessed, they
                    were; but whether they were to be accounted the immediate action of the Divine
                    Spirit himself, or that of some subordinate and inferior spirit, was a matter of
                    no little dispute. Sir Isaac Newton, towards the latter part of his life, began
                    to relax somewhat of the rigidity of his former doctrine, and allowed that a
                    very subtile medium, which he called <hi rend="italic">ether,</hi> might be the
                    cause of attraction and repulsion, and thus of all the phenomena of nature.
                    Since his time the multitude of discoveries in electricity, the similarity of
                    that fluid to fire and light, with the vast influence it exerts on every part of
                    the creation with which we are acquainted, have rendered it extremely probable
                    that the ether mentioned by Sir Isaac is no other than the element of fire, “the
                    most subtile<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">* Siru,</hi> No. 153, &amp;c.</p></note> and elastic of all
                    bodies, which seems to pervade and expand itself throughout the whole
                    universe<pb break="no" facs="nls:193826684" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6684-0575"/>.
                    Electrical experiments show that this mighty agent is everywhere present, ready
                    to break forth into action, if not restrained and governed with the greatest
                    wisdom. Being always restless and in motion, it actuates and enlivens the whole
                    visible mass; is equally fitted to produce and to destroy; distinguishes the
                    various stages of nature, and keeps up the perpetual round of generations and
                    corruptions, pregnant with forms which it constantly sends forth and re-absorbs.
                    So quick in its motions, so subtile and penetrating in its nature, so extensive
                    in its effects, it seemeth no other than the vegetative soul or vital spirit of
                    the world.</p>
                <p>“The animal spirit in man is the instrument both of sense and motion. To suppose
                    sense in the corporeal world would be gross and unwarranted; but locomotive
                    faculties are evident in all its parts. The Pythagoreans, Platonists, and
                    Stoics, held the world to be an animal; though some of them have chosen to
                    consider it as a vegetable. However, the phenomena do plainly show, that there
                    is a spirit that moves, and a mind or providence that presides. This providence,
                    Plutarch saith, was thought to be in regard to the world what the soul is in
                    regard to man. The order and course of things, and the experiments we daily
                    make, show that there is a mind which governs and actuates this mundane system
                    as the proper and real agent and cause; and that the inferior instrumental cause
                    is pure ether, fire, or the substance of light, which is applied and determined
                    by an infinite mind in the macrocosm or universe, with unlimited power, and
                    according to stated rules, as it is in the microcosm with limited power and
                    skill by the human mind. We have no proof, either from experiment or reason, of
                    any other agent or efficient cause than the mind or spirit. When, therefore, we
                    speak of corporeal agents or corporeal causes, this is to be understood in a
                    different, subordinate, and improper sense; and such an agent we know light or
                    elementary fire to be.”</p>
                <p>That this elementary fire, absorbed and fixed in all bodies, may be the cause of
                    the universal principle of gravity, is made sufficiently evident by numberless
                    experiments. Homberg having calcined in the focus of a burning glass some
                    regulus of antimony, found that it had gained one tenth in weight, though the
                    regulus, during the whole time of the operation, sent up a thick smoke, and
                    thereby lost a considerable part of its own substance. It is vain to allege that
                    any heterogeneous matter floating in the air, or that the air itself, may have
                    been hurried into the mass by the action of the fire, and that by this
                    additional matter the weight was increased; for it is known experimentally, that
                    if a quantity of metal be even hermetically secured within a vessel of glass to
                    keep off the air and all foreign matter, and the vessel be placed for some time
                    in a strong fire, it will exhibit the same effect. “I have seen the operation
                    performed,” says Mr Jones,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Essay on the First Principles of Natural Philosophy.</p></note> “on two
                    ounces of pewter filings, hermetically scaled up in a Florence flask, which in
                    two hours gained fifty-five grains, that is, nearly a seventeenth. Had it
                    remained longer in the fire, it might probably have gained something more; as,
                    in one of Mr Boyle’s experiments, steel filings were found to have gained a
                    fourth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Of</hi> accounting for these effects
                    there are but two possible ways. 1. If the quantity of matter be the same, or,
                    in the case of calcination, be somewhat less, after being exposed to the action
                    of the fire, while the gravity of the whole is become greater; then does it
                    follow that gravity is not according to the quantity of matter, and of course is
                    not one of its properties. 2. If there be an increase of the mass, it can be
                    imputed to nothing but the matter of light or fire entangled in its passage
                    through the substance, and so fixed in its pores, or combined with its solid
                    parts, as to gravitate together with it. Yet it is certain, from the phenomenon
                    of light darting from the sun, that this elementary fire does not gravitate till
                    it is fixed in metal, or some other solid substance. Here then we have a fluid
                    which gravitates, if it gravitate at all, in some cases and not in others; so
                    that which way soever the experiment be interpreted, we are forced to conclude
                    that elementary or solar fire may be the cause of the law of gravitation.”</p>
                <p>That it is likewise in many cases the cause of repulsion, is known to every one
                    who has seen it fuse metals, and convert water and mercury into elastic vapour.
                    But there is a fact recorded by Mr Jones, which seems to evince that the same
                    fluid, which, as it issues from the sun, exhibits itself in the form of light
                    and heat, is in other circumstances converted into a very fine air, or cold
                    ether, which rushes very forcibly towards the body of that luminary. “As a
                    sequel to what has been observed,” says he, “concerning the impregnation of
                    solid substances with the particles of fire, give me leave to subjoin an
                    experiment of Μ. de Stair. He tells us, that upon heating red lead in a glass
                    whence the air was exhausted, by the rays of the sun collected in a burning
                    glass, the vessel in which the said red lead was contained burst in pieces with
                    a great noise. Now, as all explosions in general must be ascribed either to an
                    admission of the air into a rarefied space, or to what is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">generation</hi> of it, and as air was not admitted upon this
                    occasion, it must have been generated from the calx within the vessel; and
                    certainly was so, because Dr Hales has made it appear that this substance, like
                    crude tartar, and many others, will yield a considerable quantity of <hi
                    rend="italic">air</hi> in distillation. What went into the metal therefore as
                    <hi rend="italic">fire,</hi> came out of it again as <hi rend="italic">air;</hi>
                    which in a manner forces upon us conclusions of inestimable value in natural
                    philosophy, and such as may carry us very far into the most sublime part of
                    it.”</p>
                <p>One of the conclusions which the ingenious author thinks thus forced upon us is,
                    that the motions of the planets round the sun, as well as round their own axes,
                    are to be attributed to the continual agency of this fluid, under its two forms
                    of elementary fire and pure air. As fire and light, we know that it rushes with
                    inconceivable rapidity from the body of the sun, and penetrates every corporeal
                    substance, exerting itself sometimes with such force as nothing with which we
                    are acquainted is able to resist. If it be indeed a fact, that this elementary
                    fire, or principle of light and heat, afterwards cools, and becomes pure air,
                    there cannot be a doubt but that under such a form it will return with great
                    force, though surely in a somewhat different direction, towards the sun, forming
                    a vortex, in which the planets are included, and by which they must of course be
                    carried round the centre. Mr Jones does not suppose that the air into which the
                    principle of light and heat is converted, is of so gross a nature as our
                    atmosphere. He rather considers it as cool ether, just as he represents light to
                    be ether heated; but he maintains that this ether, in its aërial form, though
                    not fit for human respiration, is a better <hi rend="italic">pabulum</hi> of
                    fire than the air which we breathe.</p>
                <p>This theory seems exceedingly plausible; and the author supports it by many
                    experiments. He has not, indeed, convinced us that the solar light is converted
                    or convertible into pure air; but he has, by just reasoning from undoubted
                    facts, proved that the whole expanse of heaven, as far as comets wander, is
                    filled not only with light, which is indeed obvious to the senses, but also with
                    a fluid, which, whatever it may be called, supplies the place of the air in
                    feeding the fire of these ignited bodies.</p>
                <p>That the motion of the heavenly bodies should result from the perpetual agency of
                    such a medium, appears to us <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826697"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-6697-0576"/> a much more rational hypothesis than that which
                    makes them act upon each other at immense distances through empty space. But the
                    hypothesis is by no means so complete a solution of the phenomena as some of its
                    fond admirers pretend to think it. This fluid, whether called ether, heat,
                    light, or air, is still material; and the question returns upon him who imagines
                    that it is sufficient to account for gravitation, repulsion, magnetism,
                    cohesion, and the like, What moves the fluid itself, and makes the parts of
                    which it is composed cohere together? However widely it may be extended, it is
                    incapable of positive infinity, and therefore <hi rend="italic">may be</hi>
                    divided into parts separated from each other; so that it must be held together
                    by a foreign force, as well as a ball of lead or a piece of wax. As matter is
                    not essentially active, the motion of this ether, under both its forms, must
                    likewise be considered as an effect, for which we do not think that any
                    propelling power in the body of the sun can be admitted as a sufficient cause.
                    For how comes the sun to possess that power, and what makes the fluid return to
                    the sun? We have no notion of power in the proper sense of the word, but as
                    intelligence and volition; and, like the pious and excellent author of the Essay
                    on the First Principles of Natural Philosophy, we are certain that the sun was
                    never supposed to be intelligent.</p>
                <p>Bishop Berkeley, who admits of light or ether as the instrumental cause of all
                    corporeal motion, gets rid of this difficulty by supposing, with the ancients,
                    that this powerful agent is animated. “According to the Pythagoreans and
                    Platonists,” says his lordship,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    principle, animal spirit, or natural life, producing and forming within, as art
                    doth without; regulating, moderating, and reconciling the various motions,
                    qualities, and parts of the mundane system. By virtue of this life, the great
                    masses are held together in their ordinary courses, as well as the minutest
                    particles governed in their natural motions, according to the several laws of
                    attraction, gravity, electricity, magnetism, and the rest. It is this gives
                    instincts, teaches the spider her web, and the bee her honey. This it is that
                    directs the roots of plants to draw forth juices from the earth, and the leaves
                    and the cortical vessels to separate and attract such particles of air and
                    elementary fire as suit their respective natures.”</p>
                <p>This life or animal spirit seems to be the same thing which Cudworth calls
                    plastic nature, and which has been considered elsewhere. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Metaphysics.)</hi> We shall therefore dismiss it at present,
                    with just admitting the truth of the bishop’s position, “that if nature be
                    supposed the life of the world, animated by one soul, compacted into one frame,
                    and directed or governed in all its parts by one supreme and distinct
                    intelligence, this system cannot be accused of atheism, though perhaps it may of
                    mistake or impropriety.”</p>
                <p>A theory of motion somewhat similar to that of Berkeley, though in several
                    respects different from it, was not very long ago stated with great clearness,
                    and supported with much ingenuity, in an Essay on the Powers and Mechanism of
                    Nature, intended to improve, and more firmly establish, the grand superstructure
                    of the Newtonian system. Mr Young, the author of the essay, admits, with most
                    other philosophers of the present age, that body is composed of atoms which are
                    impenetrable to each other, and may be denominated solid. These atoms, however,
                    he does not consider as primary and simple elements, incapable of resolution
                    into principles; but thinks that they are formed by certain motions of the parts
                    of a substance immaterial and essentially active.</p>
                <p>As this notion is uncommon, and the offspring of a vigorous mind, we shall
                    consider it more attentively hereafter. It is mentioned at present as a
                    necessary introduction to the author’s theory of motion, of which he attributes
                    both the origin and the continuance to the agency of this elementary substance
                    pervading the most solid atoms of the densest bodies. Of every body and every
                    atom he holds the constituent principles to be essentially active; but those
                    principles act in such a manner as to counterbalance each other, so that the
                    atom or body considered as a whole is inert, unless in so far as it resists the
                    compression or separation of its parts. No body or atom can of itself begin to
                    move, or continue in motion for a single instant; but, being pervious to the
                    active substance, and coalescing with it, that substance, when it enters any
                    body, carries it along with it, till, meeting some other body in the way, either
                    the whole of the active substance lodged in the former body passes into the
                    obstacle, in which case the impelling body instantly ceases to move; or else
                    part of that substance passes into the obstacle, and part remains in the
                    impelling body; and in this case both bodies are moved with a velocity in
                    proportion to the quantity of matter which each contains, combined with the
                    quantity of active substance by which they are respectively penetrated.</p>
                <p>In order to pave the way for his proof of the existence of one uniform active
                    substance, he observes, that “change being an essentially constituent part of
                    motion, and change implying action, it follows that all motion implies action,
                    and depends on an active cause. Every motion,” he continues, “has a beginning, a
                    middle, and an end. The beginning is a change from rest to motion; the middle is
                    a continuance in motion; the end is a change from motion to rest.” He then
                    proceeds to show, that the beginning of motion is by an action begun; the
                    continuance of motion by an action continued; and the end of motion by a
                    cessation of action.</p>
                <p>“The first of these positions is admitted by every body. That the continuance of
                    motion is by an action continued, will be proved, if it shall be shown that the
                    continuance of a motion is nothing different from its beginning, in regard to
                    any point of time assumed in the continued motion. Now the beginning of motion,”
                    he says, “consists in the beginning of change of place. But if any given
                    portions of time and of space are assumed, a body beginning to move in the
                    commencement of that time, and in the first portion of the space assumed, then
                    and there begins that particular motion: And whether before the body began to
                    move in that space it was moving in other spaces and times, has no relation to
                    the motion in question; for this being in a space and time altogether distinct,
                    is a distinct motion from any which might have preceded it immediately, as much
                    as from a motion which preceded it a thousand years before. It is therefore a
                    new motion begun; and so it may be said of every assumable point in the
                    continued motion. The term <hi rend="italic">continued</hi> serves only to
                    connect any two distinct motions, the end of one with the beginning of the
                    other, but does not destroy their distinctness.”</p>
                <p>He then proceeds to combat, which he does very successfully, the arguments by
                    which the more rigid Newtonians endeavour to prove that a body in motion will
                    continue to be moved by its own <hi rend="italic">inertia,</hi> till stopped by
                    some opposite force. Having done this, he establishes the contrary conclusion by
                    the following syllogisms:</p>
                <p>“I. Whatever requires an active force to stop its motion, is disposed to
                    move;</p>
                <p>But every body in motion requires an active force to stop its motion; <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193826710" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6710-0577"/> Therefore every
                    body in motion is disposed to move.</p>
                <p>“II. Whatever is disposed to motion is possessed of action;</p>
                <p>But a body in motion is disposed to continue in motion; Therefore a body in
                    motion is possessed of action.</p>
                <p>Thus it appears that the middle part of any motion is action equally with the
                    beginning.</p>
                <p>“The last part of motion is its termination. It is admitted that all motion is
                    terminated by an action contrary to the direction of the motion. It is admitted,
                    too, that the moving body acts at the time its motion is destroyed. Thus the
                    beginning and the end of any uniform motion are confessed to be actions; but all
                    the intermediate continuation which connects the beginning with the end is
                    denied to be action. What can be more unaccountable than this denial? Is it not
                    more consonant to reason and analogy, to ascribe to the whole continued motion
                    one uninterrupted action? Such a conclusion true philosophy, we think, requires
                    us to make.</p>
                <p>“To move or act, is an attribute which cannot be conceived to exist without a
                    substance. The action of a body in motion is indeed the attribute of the body,
                    and the body relatively to its own motion is truly a substance, having the
                    attribute or quality of motion. But the body being a name signifying a
                    combination of certain ideas, which ideas are found to arise from action, that
                    action which is productive of those ideas the combination of which we denominate
                    body, is of the nature of an attribute as long as it is considered as
                    constituted of action. To this attribute we must necessarily assign its
                    substance. The actions which constitute body must be actions of something, or
                    there must be something which acts. Whence, then, is this active something, from
                    whose agency we get the idea of body, or whose actions constitute body? Is it
                    not sufficient that it is something active? A name might be surely given it, but
                    a name would not render the idea more clear. Its description may be found in
                    every sensation; it is colour to the eye, flavour to the palate, odour to the
                    nose, sound to the ear, and feeling to the touch; for all our sensations are but
                    so many ways in which this active something is manifested to us. A substratum of
                    solidity philosophers have imagined to exist, and have in vain sought to find.
                    Our active substance is the substratum so long sought for, and with so little
                    success. We give it a quality by which it may be perceived; it acts. One
                    modification of action produces matter, another generates motion. These
                    modifications of action are modes of the active substance, whose presence is
                    action. Matter and motion constitute the whole of nature. There is therefore
                    throughout nature an active substance, the constituent essence of matter, and
                    immediate natural agent in all effects.”</p>
                <p>By an argument which we do not think very conclusive, our author determines this
                    active substance to be unintelligent. “In our sensations individually, not
                    discovering,” says he, “the traces, not seeing the characters of intelligence,
                    but finding only action present and necessary, our inferences go no farther than
                    our observations warrant us to do; and we conclude in all these things an action
                    only, and that action unintelligent.” Having given our opinion of real agency
                    elsewhere (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Metaphysics),</hi> we shall not here stop to
                    examine this reasoning. We may, however, ask, whether all our sensations
                    individually be not excited for a certain end. If they be, according to our
                    author’s mode of arguing in another place, then the exciting agent should be an
                    intelligent being. By this we are far from meaning to deny the reality of a
                    secondary or instrumental cause of sensation which is destitute of intelligence.
                    We are strongly inclined to think that there is such a cause, though our
                    persuasion results not from this argument of our author’s. In our opinion, he
                    reasons better when he says, “that a subordinate agent constructed as the matter
                    of creation, invested with perpetual laws, and producing agreeably to those laws
                    all the forms of being, through the varieties of which inferior intelligences
                    can, by progressive steps, arrive ultimately at the Supreme Contriver, is more
                    agreeable to our ideas of dignity, and tends to impress us with more exalted
                    sentiments, than viewing the Deity directly in all the individual impressions we
                    receive, divided in the infinity of particular events, and unawful, by his
                    continual presence in operations to our view insignificant and mean.”</p>
                <p>This active substance, or secondary cause, our author concludes to be neither
                    matter nor mind. “Matter,” says he, “is a being, as a whole quiescent and
                    inactive, but constituted of active parts, which resist separation, or cohere,
                    giving what is usually denominated solidity to the mass. Mind is a substance
                    which thinks. A being which should answer to neither of these definitions, would
                    be neither matter nor mind, but an immaterial, and, if I may so say, an immental
                    substance.” Such is the active substance of Mr Young, which, considered as the
                    cause of motion, seems not to differ greatly from the <hi rend="italic">plastic
                    nature, hylarchical principle,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">vis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">genitrix,</hi> of others. The manner in which it operates is
                    indeed much more minutely detailed by our author than by any other philosopher,
                    ancient or modern, with whose writings we have any acquaintance.</p>
                <p>“Every thing,” he says, “must be in its own nature either disposed to rest or
                    motion; consequently the active substance must be considered as a being
                    naturally either quiescent or motive. But it cannot be naturally quiescent, for
                    then it could not be active, because activity, which is a tendency to motion,
                    cannot originate in a tendency to rest. Therefore the active substance is by
                    nature motive, that is, tending to motion. The active substance is not solid,
                    and does not resist penetration. It is, therefore, incapable of impelling or of
                    sustaining impulse. Whence it follows, that as it tends to move, and is
                    incapable of having its motion impeded by impulse, it must actually and
                    continually move; in other words, motion is essential to the active
                    substance.</p>
                <p>“In order that this substance may act, some other thing upon which it may produce
                    a change is necessary; for whatever suffers an action, receives some change. The
                    active substance, in acting on some other thing, must impart and unite itself
                    thereto; for its action is communicating its activity. But it cannot communicate
                    its activity without imparting its substance; because it is the substance alone
                    which possesses activity, and the quality cannot be separated from the
                    substance. Therefore the active substance acts by uniting itself with the
                    substance on which it acts. The union of this substance with bodies is not to be
                    conceived of as a junction of small parts intimately blended together and
                    attached at their surfaces; but as an entire diffusion and incorporation of one
                    substance with another in perfect coalescence. As bodies are not naturally
                    active, whenever they become so, as they always do in motion, it must be by the
                    accession of some part of the active substance. The active substance being
                    imparted to a body, penetrates the most solid or resisting parts, and does not
                    reside in the pores without, and at the surfaces of the solid parts. For the
                    activity is imparted to the body itself, and not to its pores, which are no
                    parts of the body; therefore, if the active substance remained within the pores,
                    the cause would not be present with its effect, but the cause would be in one
                    place and the effect in another, which is impossible.</p>
                <p>“Bodies, by their impulse on others, lose their activity in proportion to the
                    impulse. This is matter of observation. Bodies which suffer impulse acquire
                    activity in proportion to the impulse. This also is matter of observation. In
                    impulse, therefore, the active substance passes out of the impelling body into
                    the body impelled. For since bo <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826723"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-6723-0578"/> dies in motion are active, and activity consists
                    in the presence of the active substance, and by impulse bodies lose their
                    activity, therefore they lose their active substance, and the loss is
                    proportional to the impulse. Bodies impelled acquire activity; therefore acquire
                    active substance, and the acquisition is proportioned to the impulse. But the
                    active substance lost by the impelling body ought to be concluded to be that
                    found in the other; because there is no other receptacle than the impelled body
                    to which the substance parted from can be traced, nor any other source than the
                    active body whence that which is found can be derived. Therefore, in impulse,
                    the active substance ought to be concluded to pass from the impelling body to
                    the body impelled. The flowing of such a substance is a sufficient cause of the
                    communication of activity, and no other rational cause can be assigned.</p>
                <p>“The continued motion of a body depends not upon its inertia, but upon the
                    continuance of the active substance within the body. The motion of a body is
                    produced by the motion of the active substance in union with the body. It being
                    evident, that since the active substance itself does always move, whatever it is
                    united to will be moved along with it, if no obstacle prevent. In mere motion,
                    the body moved is the patient, and the active substance the agent. In impulse,
                    the body in motion may be considered as an agent, as it is made active by its
                    active substance. While the active substance is flowing out of the active body
                    into the obstacle or impelled body, the active body will press or impel the
                    obstacle. For while the active substance is yet within the body, although
                    flowing through it, it does not cease to impart to the body its own nature, nor
                    can the body cease to be active because not yet deprived of the active
                    substance. Therefore, during its passing out of the body, such portion of the
                    active substance as is yet within, is urging and disposing the body to move, in
                    like manner as if the active substance were continuing in the body; and the body
                    being thus urged to move, but impeded from moving, presses or impels the
                    obstacle.</p>
                <p>“We see here,” says our author, “an obvious explanation of impulse; it consists
                    in the flowing of the motive substance from a source into a receptacle ;” and he
                    thinks, that although the existence of such a substance had not been established
                    on any previous grounds, the communication of motion by impulse does alone
                    afford a sufficient proof of its reality.</p>
                <p>He employs the agency of the same substance to account for many other apparent
                    activities in bodies, such as those of fire, electricity, attraction, repulsion,
                    elasticity, &amp;c. All the apparent origins of corporeal activity serve, he
                    says, to impart the active substance to bodies; “and where activity is without
                    any manifest origin, the active substance is derived from an invisible
                    source.”</p>
                <p>Our limits will not permit us to attend him in his solution of all the apparent
                    activities in bodies; but the orbicular motions of the planets have been
                    accounted for in so many different ways by philosophers ancient and modern, and
                    each account has been so little satisfactory to him who can think, and wishes to
                    trace effects from adequate causes, that we consider it as our duty to furnish
                    our readers with the account of this phenomenon which is given by Mr Young.</p>
                <p>The question which has been so long agitated, “Whence is the origin of motion ?”
                    our author considers as implying an absurdity. “It supposes,” says he, “that
                    rest was the primitive state of matter, and that motion was produced by a
                    subsequent act. But this supposition must ever be rejected, as it is giving
                    precedency to the inferior, and inverting the order of nature.” The substance
                    which he holds to be the basis of matter is essentially active, and its action
                    is motion. This motion, however, in the ori-. ginal element, was power without
                    direction, agency without order, activity to no end. To this power it was
                    necessary that a law should be superadded; that its agency should be guided to
                    some regular purpose, and its motion conspire to the production of some uniform
                    effects. Our author shows, or endeavours to show, by a process of reasoning
                    which shall be examined elsewhere, that the primary atoms of matter are produced
                    by the circular motion of the parts of this substance round a centre; and that a
                    similar motion of a number of these atoms around another centre common to them
                    all, produces what in common language is called a <hi rend="italic">solid
                    body</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a cannon ball, for instance, the terrestrial
                    globe, and the body of the sun, &amp;c. In a word, he labours to prove, and with
                    no small success, that a principle of union is implied in the revolving or
                    circulating movements of the active substance.</p>
                <p>“But we may also assume,” he says, “<hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> that a
                    principle of union is a general law of nature; because we see in fact all the
                    component parts of the universe are united systems, which successively combine
                    into larger unions, and ultimately form one whole.” Let us then suppose the sun,
                    with all his planets, primary and secondary, to be already formed for the
                    purpose of making one system, and the orbits of all of them, as well as these
                    great bodies themselves, to be pervaded by the active substance, which
                    necessarily exists in a state of motion, and is the cause of the motion of every
                    thing corporeal. <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">If</hi> to this
                    motion a principle of union be added, the effect of such a principle would be a
                    determination of all the parts of the active substance, and of course all the
                    bodies to which it is united, towards a common centre, which would be at rest,
                    and void of any tendency in any direction. But this determination of all the
                    parts of the system towards a common centre tends to the destruction both of the
                    motion of the active substance and of the system; for should all the parts
                    continually approximate from a circumference towards a centre, the sun and
                    planets would at last meet, and form one solid and quiescent mass. But to
                    preserve existence, and consequently motion, is the first law of the active
                    substance, as of all being; and it cannot be doubted, that to preserve distinct
                    the several parts of the solar system, is the first law given to the substance
                    actuating that system. The union of the system is a subsequent law.</p>
                <p>“When the direct tendency of any Inferior law is obviated by a higher law, the
                    inferior law will operate indirectly in the manner the nearest to its direct
                    tendency that the superior law will permit. If a body in motion be obliquely
                    obstructed, it will move on in a direction oblique to its first motion. Now the
                    law of union, which pervades the solar system, being continually obstructed by
                    the law of self-preservation, the motion of the active substance, and of the
                    bodies to which it is united, can be no other than a revolving motion about the
                    common centre of approach, towards which all the parts have a determination. But
                    when this revolution has actually taken place, it gives birth to a new tendency,
                    which supersedes the operation of the law of self-preservation. It has been
                    shown, that the motion essential to the active substance required to be governed
                    by some law, to give being to an orderly state of things. Now, there are motions
                    simple and motions complex; the more simple is in all things first in order, and
                    out of the more simple the more complex arises in order posterior. The most
                    simple motion is rectilineal; therefore a rectilineal motion is to· be
                    considered as that which is the original and natural state of things, and
                    consequently that to which all things tend. It will follow from hence, that when
                    any portion of active substance in which the law of union operates, has in the
                    manner above explained been compelled to assume a revolving motion, that is, a
                    motion in some curve, a tendency to a rectili</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826736" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6736-0579"/>
                <p>neal motion will continually exist in every part of the revolving portion, and in
                    every point of the curve which it describes during its revolution. And this
                    rectilineal tendency will be a tendency to recede from the centre in every point
                    of the revolving orbit, and to proceed in a tangent to the orbit at each point.
                    These two tendencies, if not originally equal, must necessarily in all cases
                    arrive at an equality. For the tendency towards the centre, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">centripetal</hi> tendency, that is, the law of union, operating
                    first, if we suppose the motion approaches the centre, the tendency to recede
                    from it, called the <hi rend="italic">centrifugal</hi> tendency, will have its
                    proportion to the centripetal continually increased as thecrbit of revolution
                    grows less, so as ultimately to equal the centripetal tendency, and restrain the
                    motion from its central course, at which point it will no longer seek the
                    centre, but revolve round it.”</p>
                <p>As our author holds that every atom of matter is formed by the motion of parts of
                    the active substance, and every body formed by the motion of atoms; so he
                    maintains, not only that the sun, moon, earth, planets, and stars, are
                    penetrated by the same substance, but that each is the centre of a vortex of
                    that substance, and that of these vortices some are included within others. “The
                    subtile revolving fluid, the centre of whose vortex the earth occupies, not only
                    surrounds, but pervades the earth, and other vortices their earths, to their
                    centres; and the earth and planets are by its revolutions carried around on
                    their own axes. The earth is an active mass, and all its component masses are
                    severally as well as collectively inactive; but the earth and all its parts have
                    various collective and separate movements, imparted from the fluid which
                    surrounds, pervades, and constitutes it. Being immersed together with its proper
                    surrounding sphere or vortex in the larger sphere or vortex of the sun, it is
                    carried thereby in a larger orbit about the sun, at the same time that by the
                    revolution of its proper sphere it rotates on its own axis.”</p>
                <p>Such is the most complete view which our limits will permit us to give of Mr
                    Young’s theory of motion. To the philosopher who considers experiment as the
                    only test of truth, and who in all his inquiries employs his hands more than his
                    head, we are fully aware that it will appear in no better light than as “the
                    baseless fabric of a vision.” Even to the intellectual philosopher who is not
                    frightened at the word metaphysics, we are afraid that such an active substance
                    as∙the author contends for, will appear as inadequate to the production of the
                    phenomena of gravitation and repulsion as the material ether of Mr Jones and his
                    followers. A being void of intelligence, whether it be material or immaterial,
                    quiescent or motive, cannot be the subject of law, in the proper sense of the
                    word. The laws of which Mr Young speaks as necessary to regulate the motions of
                    the active substance, must be mere forces, applied by some extrinsic and
                    superior power. And since motion, as it is essential to the active substance, is
                    power without direction, agency without order, activity to no end; since it is
                    of such a nature, that from its unguided agitations there could result neither
                    connection, order, nor harmony; it follows that those extrinsic forces must be
                    perpetually applied, because what is essential to any substance can never be
                    destroyed or changed as long as the substance itself remains.</p>
                <p>Forces producing order out of confusion can be applied only by a being possessed
                    of intelligence; and if the immediate and perpetual agency of an intelligent
                    being be necessary to regulate the motions of the active substance, that
                    substance itself may be thought superfluous, and its very existence may be
                    denied. <hi rend="italic">Entia non sunt</hi><hi rend="italic">multiplicanda
                    absque</hi><hi rend="italic">necessitate,</hi> is a rule of philosophizing which
                    every man of science acknowledges to be just. And it will hardly be denied that
                    the immediate and perpetual agency of an intelligent being upon Mr Jones’s
                    ethereal fluid, or even upon the matter of solid bodies themselves, would be
                    capable of producing every kind of motion, without the instrumentality of a
                    substance which is neither mind nor matter.</p>
                <p>Such, we conceive, are the objections which our metaphysical readers may make to
                    this theory. Part of their force, however, will perhaps be removed by the
                    ingenious manner in which our author analyzes matter into an immaterial
                    principle. But so much of it remains that the writer of this article is inclined
                    to believe that no mechanical account can be given of the motions of the
                    heavenly bodies, the growth of plants, and various other phenomena which arc
                    usually solved by attraction and repulsion. In the present age, philosophers in
                    general are strangely averse to admitting on any occasion the agency of mind;
                    yet as every effect must have a cause, it is surely not irrational to attribute
                    such effects as mechanism cannot produce to the operation either of.intelligence
                    or instinct. To suppose the Deity the immediate agent in the great motions of
                    the universe, has been deemed impious; and it must be confessed that very
                    impious conclusions have been deduced from that principle. But there is surely
                    no impiety in supposing, with the excellent Bishop of Cloyne, that the fluid
                    which is known to pervade the solar system, and to operate with resistless
                    force, may be animated by a powerful mind, which acts instinctively for ends of
                    which itself knows nothing. For the existence of such a mind, no other evidence,
                    indeed, can be brought than what is afforded by a very ancient and very general
                    tradition, and by the impossibility of accounting for the phenomena upon
                    principles of mere mechanism. Perhaps some of our more pious readers may be
                    inclined to think that the Supreme Being has committed the immediate government
                    of the various planetary systems to powerful intelligences, or angels, who, as
                    his ministers, direct their motions with wisdom and foresight. Such an opinion
                    i§ certainly not absurd in itself; and it seems to be countenanced by an ancient
                    writer, who, though not known by the name of a philosopher, knew as much of the
                    matter as any founder of the most celebrated school.</p>
                <p>To object to either of these hypotheses, as has sometimes been done, that it
                    represents the government of the world as a perpetual miracle, betrays the
                    grossest ignorance; for we might as well call the movements of the bodies of men
                    and brutes, which are certainly produced by minds, miraculous. We do not affirm
                    that either hypothesis is certainly true; but they are both as probable and as
                    satisfactory as the hypothesis which attributes agency to attraction and
                    repulsion, to a subtile ether, or to a substance which is neither mind nor
                    matter. Were the immediate agency of intellect to be admitted, there would be no
                    room for many of those disputes which have been agitated amongst philosophers,
                    about the increase or diminution of motion in the universe; because an
                    intelligent agent, which could begin motion as well as carry it on, might
                    increase or diminish it as he should judge proper. If instinctive agency, or
                    something similar to it, be adopted, there is the same room for investigation as
                    upon the principles of mechanism; because instinct works blindly, according to
                    steady laws imposed by a superior mind, which may be discovered by observation
                    of their effects. As we consider this as by far the more probable hypothesis of
                    the two, we find ourselves involved in the following question: If a certain
                    quantity of motion was originally communicated to the matter of the universe,
                    how comes it to pass that the original quantity, still remains? Considering the
                    many opposite and contradictory motionswhich since the creation have taken place
                    in the universe, and which have undoubtedly destroyed a great part of the
                    original quantity, by what means has that quantity been restored?</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826749" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6749-0580"/>
                <p>If this question can be resolved by natural means, it must be upon the principles
                    of Newton; for, in every case where quantities and relations of quantities are
                    required, it is the province of mathematics to supply the information sought;
                    and all philosophers agree that Sir Isaac’s doctrine of the composition and
                    resolution of motion, though in what respects the heavenly bodies it may have no
                    physical reality, is so mathematically just, as to be the only principle from
                    which the quantity of motion, or the force of powers, can in any case be
                    computed. If we choose to answer the question, by saying that the motion left is
                    restored by the interposition of the Deity, then we might as well have had
                    recourse to him at first, and say that he alone is the true principle of motion
                    throughout the universe.</p>
                <p>Before we are reduced to this dilemma, however, it is necessary, in the first
                    place, to inquire whether there is or can be any real diminution of the quantity
                    of motion throughout the universe? In this question the Cartesians take the
                    negative side, and maintain that the Creator at the beginning impressed a
                    certain quantity of motion on bodies, and that under such laws that no part of
                    it could be lost, but the same portion of motion would be constantly preserved
                    in matter; and hence they conclude, that if any moving body should strike on any
                    other body, the former would lose no more of its motion than it communicated to
                    the latter. Sir Isaac Newton takes the contrary side, and argues in the
                    following manner: From the various compositions of two motions, it is manifest
                    there is not always the same quantity of motion in the world; for if two balls,
                    joined together by a slender wire, revolve with a uniform motion about their
                    common centre of gravity, and at the same time that centre be carried uniformly
                    in a right line drawn in the plane of their circular motion, the sum of the
                    motions of the two balls, as often as they are in a right line, drawn from their
                    common centre of gravity, will be greater than the sum of their motions when
                    they are in a line perpendicular to that other. Hence it appears, that motion
                    may be both generated and lost. But by reason of the tenacity of fluid bodies,
                    and the friction of their parts, with the weakness of the elastic power in solid
                    bodies, nature seems to incline much rather to the destruction than the
                    production of motion; and, in reality, motion becomes continually less and less.
                    For bodies which are either so perfectly hard or so soft as to have no elastic
                    power, will not rebound from each other; and their impenetrability will only
                    stop their motion. And if two such bodies equal to one another be carried with
                    equal but opposite motions, so as to meet in a void space, by the laws of motion
                    they must stop in the very place of concourse, lose all their motion, and be at
                    rest for ever, unless they have an elastic power to give them a new motion. If
                    they have elasticity enough to make them rebound with one fourth, one half, or
                    three fourths, of the force they meet with, they will lose three fourths, one
                    half, or one fourth, of their motion. And this is confirmed by experiments; for
                    if two equal pendulums be let fall from equal heights, so as to strike full upon
                    each other; if those pendulums be of lead or soft clay, they will lose all, or
                    almost all, their motion; and if they be of any elastic matter, they will only
                    retain so much motion as they receive from their elastic power.</p>
                <p>Motion, therefore, being thus, in the opinion of this celebrated author, lost or
                    absolutely destroyed, it is necessary to find some cause by which it may be
                    renewed. Such renovation Sir Isaac attributes to active principles; for
                    instance, the cause of gravity, whereby the planets and comets preserve their
                    motions in their orbits, and all bodies acquire a great degree of motion in
                    falling; and the cause of fermentation, whereby the heart and blood of animals
                    preserve a perpetual warmth and motion, the inner parts of the earth are kept
                    perpetually warmed, many bodies burn and shine, and the sun himself burnsand
                    shines, and with his light warms and cheers all things.</p>
                <p>Elasticity is another cause of the renovation of motion mentioned by Sir Isaac.
                    “We find but little motion in the world,” says he, “except what plainly flows
                    either from these active principles, or from the command of the wilier.”</p>
                <p>With regard to the destruction or positive lossof motion, however, we must
                    observe, that, notwithstanding the high authority of Sir Isaac Newton, it is
                    altogether impossible that any such thing can happen. All moving bodies which
                    come under the cognizance of our senses are merely passive, and acted upon by
                    something which we call <hi rend="italic">powers</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >fluids,</hi> and which are to us totally invisible. Motion, therefore, cannot
                    be lost without a destruction or diminution of one of these powers, which we
                    have no reason to think can ever happen. When two pendulums rush against each
                    other, the motion is the mere effect of the action of gravity; and that action,
                    which in this case is the power, continues to be the very same whether the
                    pendulum moves or not. Could motion, therefore, be exhausted in this case, we
                    must suppose, that by separating two pendulums to the same distance from each
                    other, and then letting them come together, for a great number of times, they
                    would at last meet with less force than before. But there is certainly not the
                    least foundation for this supposition; and no rational person will take it into
                    his head, that supposing the whole human race had employed themselves in nothing
                    else from the creation to the present day but in separating pendulums and
                    letting them stop each other’s motion, they would now come together with less
                    force than they did at first. Power, therefore, which is the cause of motion, is
                    absolutely indestructible. Powers may indeed counteract one another, or they may
                    be made to counteract themselves; but the moment that the obstacle is removed,
                    they show themselves in their pristine vigour, without the least symptom of
                    abatement or decay.</p>
                <p>Whether, therefore, we reckon the ultimate source of motion to be spiritual or
                    material, it is plain that it must be to our conceptions infinite; neither will
                    the phenomena of nature allow us to give any other explanation than we have
                    done; for no power whatever can lose more than its own quantity, and it seems
                    absurd to think that the Deity would create the world in such a manner that it
                    should ultimately become immoveable, and then have recourse to unknown
                    principles to remedy the supposed defect. On the principle we have just now laid
                    down, however, the matter becomes exceedingly plain and obvious. The Creator at
                    first formed two opposite powers, the action of which is varied according to the
                    circumstances of the bodies upon which they act; and these circumstances are
                    again varied by the action of the powers themselves in innumerable ways upon one
                    another, and the approach of one body to another, or their receding to a greater
                    distance. Where these powers happen to oppose each other directly, the body upon
                    which they act is at rest; when they act obliquely, it' moves in the diagonal;
                    or if the force acting upon one side is by any means lessened, the body
                    certainly must move towards that side, as is evident from the case of the
                    atmosphere, the pressure of which, when removed from one side of a body, will
                    make it move very violently towards that side, and if we could continually keep
                    off the pressure in this manner, the motion would assuredly be <hi rend="italic"
                    >perpetual.</hi> We must not imagine that motion is destroyed because it is
                    counteracted; for it is impossible to destroy motion by any means but removing
                    the cause; counteracting the effect is only a temporary obstacle, and must cease
                    whenever the obstacle is removed. Nature, therefore, having in itself an
                    infinite quantity of motion, produces greater or lesser motions, according to
                    the various action of the moving powers upon different bodies<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193826762" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6762-0581"/> or upon one another, without
                    a possibility of the general stock being either augmented or diminished; unless
                    one of the moving powers were withdrawn by the Creator, in which case the other
                    would destroy the whole system in an instant. As to the nature of these great
                    original powers, we must confess ourselves totally ignorant; nor do we perceive
                    any data from which the nature of them can be investigated. The elements of
                    light, air, &amp;c. are the agents; but in what manner they act, or in what
                    manner they received their action, can be known only to the Creator himself.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Perpetual MOTION,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Mechanics,</hi> a
                    motion which is supplied and renewed from itself, without the intervention of
                    any external cause; or it is an uninterrupted communication of the same degree
                    of motion from one part of matter to another, in a circle or other curve
                    returning into itself, so that the same momentum still returns undiminished upon
                    the first mover.</p>
                <p>The celebrated problem of a perpetual motion consists in the inventing of a
                    machine which shall have the principles of its motion within itself. M. de la
                    Hire has demonstrated the impossibility of any such machine, and shown that it
                    amounts to this, namely, to find a body which is both heavier and lighter at the
                    same time, or to find a body which is heavier than itself.</p>
