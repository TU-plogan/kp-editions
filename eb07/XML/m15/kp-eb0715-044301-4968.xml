                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">MOOR, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label>, an eminent
                    Grecian, was born at Glasgow on the 22d of June 1712, being the son of James
                    Moor and of his wife Margaret Park. His father, a teacher of mathematics in that
                    city, is commemorated as a lover of learning: when he did not think himself rich
                    enough to purchase a copy of Newton’s Principia, then sold at a very high price,
                    he transcribed the entire book with his own hand. He died before his son
                    attained the age of manhood. He also left a widow and two daughters. One of
                    these, named Elizabeth, became the wife of Robert Foulis, printer to the
                    university, by whom she had five daughters; but the other, whose name was Jane,
                    died unmarried, after she had for some time continued to live with her brother.
                    Dr Moor traced his descent from the family which produced Elizabeth Moor, the
                    consort of Robert the Second, and he was duly provided with a genealogical table
                    of his ancestry, but whether it was constructed by himself, we are not
                    distinctly informed. It may however have been as correct as the genealogical
                    tables of some more illustrious families, which occasionally exhibit a tree with
                    some very frail and suspicious branches. He was small in stature, and the
                    measles deprived him of the sight of one eye. From an early age, he discovered
                    an eager thirst of knowledge; and his acquaintance with Andrew Stalker the
                    bookseller, who allowed him the privilege of reading in his shop, seems to have
                    had its effect in encreasing this love of books.</p>
                <p>In the month of November 1725 he became a student in the university. The Greek
                    professor of that period was Alexander Dunlop, who was regarded as a zealous and
                    successful teacher. According to a contemporary record, “his thorough knowledge
                    and fine taste in that language, with his masterly and engaging method of
                    teaching it, raised the study thereof, which had been long neglected, unto
                    general esteem and reputation.” According to another, and apparently a better,
                    authority, Dr Hutcheson, who became a professor of philosophy in 17^9, “had
                    remarkable success in reviving the study of ancient literature, particularly the
                    Greek, which had been much neglected before his time: he spread such an ardour
                    for knowledge, and such a spirit of enquiry every where around him, that the
                    conversation of the students at their social walks and visits turned with great
                    keenness upon subjects of learning and taste, and contributed greatly to animate
                    and carry them forward in the most valuable pursuits.”<note anchored="true"

                    influence of Hutcheson’s lectures and writings is very clearly stated by Denina,
                    Discorso sopra le Vicende della Letteratura, p. 224.</p></note> Dunlop published
                    a Greek grammar, which at one time was extensively used in this part of the
                    kingdom. The professor of mathematics was Dr Simson, a man eminently
                    distinguished in his own department of science.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr Simson regarded him as one of the most
                    promising of his pupils, and has repeatedly mentioned him in his writings. In a
                    letter addressed to Earl Stanhope on the 22d of March 1751, having mentioned the
                    subject of applying the method of the°ancients to modern inventions, he proceeds
                    to remark, “My scholars, Mr Moor, ZMr Williamson, and particularly Mr Stewart of
                    Edinburgh, may I hope be able to do something this way; and I shall not fail to
                    recommend it to them, and direct them as far as I can.” (Trail’s Life of Simson,
                    p. 112.) In the preface to one of his publications, he speaks of Moor in these
                    terms: “Quae sequuntur Graeca ex praefatione Pappi Alexandrini ad lib. 7.
                    Collect. Mathem. quam Apollonii duobus de Sectione Rationis libris praefixit

                    contulit Dominus Jacobus Moor, tum in mathesi, tum in literis Graecis, quas in
                    hac academia profitetur, multum et feliciter versatus.” (Apollonii Pergaci
                    Locorum Planorum libri ii. restituti a Roberto Siinson, Μ. D. Matheseos in
                    Academia Glasguensi Professore. Glasguae, 1749, 4to.) In the notes to his
                    English edition of Euclid, the subsequent passage occurs: “The learned Mr Moor,
                    Professor of Greek in the University of Glasgow, observed to me that it plainly
                    appears from Archimedes Epistle to Dositheus prefixed to his books of the
                    Sphaere and Cylinder, which Epistle he has restored from ancient manuscripts,
                    that Eudoxus was the author of the chief propositions in this book,” namely, the
                    twelfth. (Elements of Euclid, p. 425. Glasgow, 1756, 4to.) Dr Williamson, who is
                    mentioned in one of these extracts, became chaplain to the British factory at
                    Lisbon, where he died at an early period of life. Dr Stewart, professor of
                    mathematics at Edinburgh, was the father of Dugald Stewart. “The two greatest
                    mathematicians,” says Dr Smith, “that I ever had the honour to be known to, and
                    I believe the two greatest that have lived in my time, Dr Robert Simson of
                    Glasgow, and Dr Matthew Stewart of Edinburgh, never seemed to feel even the
                    slightest uneasiness from the neglect with which the ignorance of the public
                    received some of their most valuable works.” (Theory of Moral Sentiments, p.
                    213.)</p></note> Moor imbibed the same ardent love of the ancient geometry, and
                    attained to no mean proficiency in this and other kindred studies. To the study
                    of natural philosophy he applied himself with an equal degree of relish; and, as
                    a proof of his successful exertions, it has been stated that the professor, Dr
                    Dick, “after demonstrating a proposition once to the students, used to make him
                    go over it the second time, instead of doing it himself.” On taking the degree
                    of A. Μ. his early proficiency in science was honourably marked by the
                    testimonial of his having made, not, according to the usual terms, “progressus
                    haud spernendos,” but “progressus egregios.” About this period he betook himself
                    so eagerly to the study of mathematics, that he left himself no leisure for
                    classical pursuits; and when he resumed the study of the Greek language, he
                    found his knowledge of it so much impaired as to require a laborious renewal.
                    From his own experience he was accustomed to deduce a practical advice, which
                    well deserves to be inculcated; namely, that those who, being chiefly occupied
                    with other pursuits, still wish to retain their classical learning, ought to
                    devote a portion, however small, of every day to classical reading.</p>
                <p>After completing his academical course, he kept a schooi in Glasgow, and, among
                    other branches, taught navigation. When in school, and not actually employed in
                    teaching, we are informed that he was accustomed to read the classics; and from
                    this circumstance we may reasonably infer that the scholars were not numerous,
                    or that they did not sufficiently occupy the master’s attention. It however
                    appears, that he speedily relinquished this avocation for that of a private
                    tutor: he was successively connected with the families of the earl of Kilmarnock
                    and the earl of Selkirk,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Dunbar Hamilton, the son of Basil Hamilton of Baldoon, succeeded to the
                    Selkirk peerage in the year 1744, on the death of John earl of Selkirk and
                    Rutherglen, when he resumed the family name of Douglas. “His lordship’s studious
                    disposition induced him to remain several years at the university of Glasgow,
                    where he cultivated the friendship of the celebrated Dr Hutcheson, of whose
                    philosophical opinions he retained through life a warm admiration.” (Wood’s
                    Peerage of Scotland, vol· ii. p. 489.) He was born in 1722, and died in
                    1799.</p></note></p>

                <p>and he accompanied his pupils to the continent. Of this early portion of his
                    history, some notices have been preserved by his son. “While with the earl of
                    Kilmarnock, he had already made a collection of books which he valued much. It
                    happened, while the earl was from home, that the family-seat was burned. On
                    being informed of it, he said he was chiefly sorry on account of the grief that
                    Mr Moor would feel from the loss of his books. The earl’s son was a good
                    scholar; which Mr Moor observing, entered him privately in the Greek without
                    acquainting his father, who for some time knew nothing of his son’s new
                    acquisition; until one day that, by his tutor’s desire, he read before him an
                    ode of Anacreon, to the great surprise and joy of the earl. While in these
                    noblemen’s families, he used to study much, and that chiefly at night, after the
                    others were gone to bed, sitting up late, and keeping himself from being drowsy
                    by drinking strong tea. But by this he hurt his health greatly, and had at times
                    some severe fevers. He was diligent and attentive to his pupils. During the
                    summer, when in the country with one of them at Lochlomond, on going out to
                    walk, he would after a while make him sit down, and taking a classic out of his
                    pocket, make him read to him.” As an indication of the opinion entertained of
                    his talents and address, it maybe mentioned, that in the year 1746, when the
                    earl of Kilmarnock was attainted of high treason, Moor, who was very far from
                    participating in his political opinions, was despatched to London for the
                    purpose of lending his aid in those solicitations of mercy which were
                    ineffectually addressed to the ministers of the crown. The unfortunate nobleman
                    was beheaded on Towerhill, and his hereditary honours were forfeited; but his
                    eldest son, a man distinguished by the amiableness of his character, as well as
                    the elegance of his person and manners, succeeded to the title and estate of his
                    maternal grandfather the earl of Errol.</p>
                <p>Moor’s first preferment was that of librarian to the university. At that period
                    the office was only tenable for four years, and the nomination alternately
                    belonged to the university and the town-council. On the 11th of November 1742 he
                    was appointed by the university; and in the ensuing month of May he received
                    from the council a similar appointment, which was to take effect at the
                    expiration of his first period of four years. The earliest work in which he is
                    known to have had any participation appeared under the following title: “The
                    Meditations of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, newly translated from the
                    Greek; with notes, and an account of his life.” Glasg. 1742, !2mo. A second
                    edition was printed in 1749, and a third in 1764, each consisting of two
                    volumes. One of the early projects of Dr Robertson was a version of the same
                    author; but finding himself thus anticipated, he did not persist in his
                    design.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Stewart’s Life
                    of Robertson, p. 8.</p></note> The first two books were translated by Dr Moor,
                    and the other ten by Dr Hutcheson, but the work was published without their
                    names.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This translation
                    was, after an interval of two years, followed by an edition of the original
                    work. “Marci Antonini Imperatoris eorum quae ad scipsum libri xii. post
                    Gatakerum ceterosque recogniti; et notis illustrati, a doctissimo viro R. I.
                    üxoniensi.” Glasguae, I744, 8vo. It is inscribed, in the name of R. Foulis, to
                    Dunbar Hamilton, “ob praeclarum ejus studium, in literis antiquis, in
                    philosophia, et in omnibus bonis artibus, sive ad vitam et mores, sive ad
                    rempublicam spectent, excolendis.” The edition was probably superintended by Dr
                    Moor. The notes are reprinted from the Oxford edition of 1704. At the end of the
                    translation of Antoninus, the following advertisement occurs: “The Printer gives
                    this public notice, that the Translation of Antoninus will be followed by
                    another, of the Dissertations of Epictetus preserved by Arrian, and not yet in
                    English. A considerable part of it is already finished; and the whole will ere
                    long be published.” We are not aware that this version ever made its
                    appearance.</p></note> Gataker, one of the most learned of modern critics, had
                    illustrated the original text with great depth of erudition. “The golden Boke of
                    Marcus Aurelius Emperour and eloquent Oratour” was “translated out of Frenche
                    into Englishe by John Bourchier, Knighte, Lorde Barners,” and in this form
                    passed through several editions. It was translated from the Greek by Meric
                    Casaubon, the learned son of a more learned father. It was afterwards
                    translated, in a style singularly quaint and ludicrous, by Jeremy Collier. A new
                    version was published in 1747 by James Thomson, and another in 1792 by Richard
                    Graves.</p>
                <p>Professor Dunlop, who had filled the Greek chair for upwards of forty years, was
                    at length induced to resign it; and on the 27th of June 1746 Moor “was
                    unanimously elected to the office which he had vacated. He was inducted on the
                    9th of July, when, as a probationary exercise, he read a critical disquisition
                    on the tenth chapter of Longinus. Dunlop, as emeritus professor, retained his
                    house and salary; and he moreover received from his successor the sum of six
                    hundred pounds, which was advanced by the earl of Selkirk.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This statement rests on the authority of some
                    manuscript notices of Dr Moor, written by his son', the late Air James Moor,
                    master of Irvine school. They were procured by the kindness of an amiable and
                    accomplished man, who has likewise quitted this transitory scene, Lockhart
                    Muirhead, LL. D. Professor of Natural History, and Principal Librarian of the
                    University of Glasgow. Dr Muirhead supplied most of the notices relative to
                    Moor’s academical history.</p></note> Such a transaction suited the commercial
                    spirit of the place, nor is this supposed to have been the most recent bargain
                    of a similar denomination. Dunlop did not survive beyond the ensuing month of
                    April; and in the course of the same year, 1747, the new professor resigned his
                    office of librarian. The summer of 1748 he spent in France, but not for the
                    purpose of mere relaxation. He still continued to blend the study of classical
                    literature with the study of the mathematical sciences; and at this period he
                    was occupied with preparations for an edition of the Greek text of Pappus, whose
                    Mathematical Collections, as Dr Trail has stated, are “the chief repository of
                    information respecting the geometry of the ancients, and especially respecting
                    their analysis, which has been the subject of much discussion among the moderns.
                    This most interesting work contains some curious mathematical history of former
                    times, but is more particularly valuable by the account, contained in the
                    preface to the seventh book, of the treatises of the analytical geometry of the
                    ancients, which together obtained the name of <hi rend="italic">τοτrος
                    αναkcομενος.</hi> In this preface there is, first, a general exposition of the
                    analysis employed by the ancients, both in the solution of problems and in the
                    demonstration of theorems; then follows a particular description of the nature
                    and contents of a certain number of these treatises, which we may presume were
                    considered by Pappus as the most important; and an enumeration of the whole is
                    added, consisting of thirty-three books. The seventh book of Pappus itself
                    consists of a number of lemmata, or subsidiary propositions, not contained in

                    propose to print by subscription the Works of Plato, on a new Type, the largest
                    of the Louvre sizes, just now cut by Alexander Wilson, Μ. A. Type-founder to the
                    University: in quarto and in folio. I. In IX. volumes in quarto, of which the
                    Greek in 6 volumes, and the Latin translation, with the notes, in 3: the price
                    to subscribers, one penny sterling per sheet. The whole will be contained in
                    about 500 sheets; so the price will be about 21. Is. 8d. in quires, on a fair
                    paper. A number will be printed on a fine large paper, at twopence sterling per
                    sheet. II. In VI. volumes in folio, with the translation on the same page,
                    below; likewise at one penny per sheet; and in about 740 sheets; which will
                    amount to about 31. Is. 8d. A number also on the finest writing paper (the same
                    on which we printed Cicero), at three half-pence per sheet; which will amount to
                    about 41. 12s. 6d. The Greek shall be accurately printed from the edition of H.
                    Stephens. The various readings, and his own conjectures, printed on the margin
                    of his edition, shall be printed at the bottom of each page. Any other readings

                    of each page, or at the end of the work, with proper distinctions. The notes of
                    H. Stephens, relating to the Greek text, which are printed at the end of his
                    edition, shall also be printed at the end of this. Also all other notes of any
                    merit, published since his edition, and all which we can procure besides.<note

                    length purchased by the late Mr Laing, an eminent bookseller of Edinburgh, in
                    whose Catalogue of i792 they are mentioned in detail. It is stated in more
                    general terms that “they consist of corrections upon the Latin version, critical
                    and philological remarks, illustrations of the philosophy, collations of printed

                    with much labour and at a very great expence.” Of the Basel edition of Plato,
                    1534, it is said that “the principal value of this copy arises from the labours
                    of Dr Moor. lor many years his attention was principally directed to this work.
                    The margins have, in his hand-writing, collations with other printed editions,
                    corrections upon the text, philological and critical remarks, &amp;c. Much
                    labour appears also to have been bestowed on the commentary of Proclus.” The
                    entire collection was ultimately purchased for the Bodleian Library at
                    Oxford.</p></note> The translation will be that of Ficinus; but with several
                    corrections published since, and all others which we can procure.</p>
                <p>“The Publishers propose to demand no money at subscription; only beg leave to
                    reserve it in their own choice, to call for, at delivery of the volume first
                    printed, which will contain the Laws and Epinomis, one guinea of the whole
                    price, upon their note to deliver the rest of the work according to the above
                    terms. N. B. The Laws and Epinomis make about a fifth part of the whole of
                    Plato’s works.—Gentlemen who chuse to favour this undertaking, and are at a

                    least, they give notice to the Printers, of the person with whom they have
                    subscribed. By either of these means, but especially by the former, the
                    undertakers will both have the satisfaction of knowing their encouragers, and of
                    having it in their power to prevent gentlemen from being disappointed of their
                    copies, or in the size or paper they had chosen.</p>
                <p>“As the undertakers are to do their utmost to render this edition the most
                    extensively useful, they take this occasion of inviting gentlemen of learning
                    every where to communicate what helps they can, either for establishing the
                    text, correcting the version, or illustrating the philosophy. Whatever of this
                    kind is received shall be gratefully acknowledged, printed with the author’s
                    name, if not forbid, and his labour suitably rewarded.”</p>
                <p>Dr Moor, after some hesitation, undertook the formidable task of editor; and it
                    is certainly to be regretted that the publishers did not persevere in a scheme
                    which presented so fair a promise of honour and emolument. Among those by whom
                    it was zealously encouraged we find two individuals who at least resembled each
                    other in their love of ancient literature, namely, Bishop Berkeley and John
                    Wilkes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bishop Berkeley,
                    writing to his friend Thomas Prior on the 30th of March 1751, mentions their
                    scheme in the following terms: “They are going to print at Glasgow two editions
                    at once, in quarto and in folio, of all Plato’s works, in most magnificent
                    types. This work should be encouraged: it would be right to mention it, as you
                    have opportunitv.” See Bishop Stock’s Memoirs of George Berkeley, D. D., late
                    Bishop of Cloyne in Ireland, p. 155. 2d. edit. Lond. 1784, 8vo. Ön the same
                    subject, a letter from Wilkes to R. Foulis, dated at London on the 3d of
                    December 1748, has lately been printed in Air Duncan’s Noticesand Documents
                    illustrative of the Literary History of Glasgow, during the greater part of last
                    Century, p. 54. Glasg. 1831, 4to. “I have since mentioned this,” he remarks, “to
                    Air Professor Ward of Gresham College, and to several other friends, who are
                    very willing to encourage so useful a design; and I am desired to write to you,
                    to beg you would send us printed proposals. We may venture to assure you of one
                    hundred subscriptions from the circle of our own acquaintance.”</p></note> This
                    scheme was not finally abandoned till the year 1759, when the printers found
                    themselves too deeply involved in an abortive and ruinous project of an academy
                    or institution for the fine arts. In the mean time, the professor was occupied
                    with a variety of pursuits closely connected with the duties of his office. Of
                    his grammar of the Greek language, the earliest fragment, consisting of only 72
                    pages, was published with the following<pb break="no" facs="nls:193825007"

                    in 1766; and after an interval of four years, the work appeared with its final
                    improvements: “Elementa Linguae Graecae; novis plerumque Regulis tradita,
                    brevitate sua memoriae facilibus. Pars prima, complectens Partes Orationis
                    declinabiles, et Analogiam duas in unam Syllabas contrahendi, ex ipsa Vocalium

                    indicates, is still incomplete: it not only omits the particles, or indeclinable
                    parts of speech, but likewise syntax, prosody, and accentuation; but, so far as
                    it extends, it is a work of very uncommon merit. The author’s familiarity with
                    the Greek geometry was perhaps of some advantage to him as a grammarian. To the
                    discussion of grammatical subjects he has applied no inconsiderable degree of
                    philosophic acumen; and here we sometimes meet with instances of a beautiful
                    analysis, especially in that portion of his work which relates to the
                    contraction of nouns. Of Moor’s grammar, the subsequent editions are very
                    numerous. Some editors have illustrated his book with annotations, and some
                    authors have without much scruple availed themselves of his labours. During his
                    own lifetime, a charge of this kind was preferred against Lord Monboddo, by an
                    anonymous writer in a periodical work edited by Dr Stuart. “We have formerly
                    remarked this author’s obligations to Mr Harris; and the charge of having
                    borrowed liberally from Professor Moor, without a proper acknowledgement, has
                    been urged very generally against him. The curious reader may see p. 506. 507.

                    acute grammarian has published, that he, in all probability, has availed
                    himself. It is well known to those who have heard Dr Moor’s lectures in the
                    university of Glasgow, that the whole of what is laid down in the book before
                    us, upon the derivation and composition of the Greek language, was repeatedly
                    inculcated by him to his pupils; and it is to be hoped that some of these, out
                    of gratitude to their ancient and languishing master, will undertake the task of
                    doing him compleat justice, and of wielding, in his defence, that lance which
                    his feeble arm can no longer sustain.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>A few years after the first appearance of his grammar, he published a neat little
                    volume entitled “Essays, read to a Literary Society, at their weekly Meetings
                    within the College of Glasgow. I. On the Influence of Philosophy upon the Fine
                    Arts. II. On the Composition of the Picture described in the Dialogue of Cebes.
                    III. On Historical Composition.” Glasg. 1759, 8vo. He has prefixed a dedication
                    ,of this tenor: “To the Right Honourable James Earl of Errol, Lord
                    High-Constable of Scotland, these Essays, on the taste of some of the chiefGreek
                    writers, whose works his Lordship has the pleasure of admiring in the original,
                    having at a very early time of life made in that language a very uncommon
                    progress; are, with every sentiment of respect, duty, and gratitude, inscribed
                    by Ja. Moor.” The second of his essays, which is perhaps the most valuable,
                    exhibits a successful attempt to explain the propriety and consistency of the
                    picture delineated by the Socratic philosopher with so much beauty of moral
                    colouring. Of this ancient relique he entertained a fervent admiration; and in
                    the year 1747 he had published an edition of Cebes, with some brief
                    annotations.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>KíßnTōs ∏M∙

                    Athenian Poet, adopted by the Republic of Lacedaemon, and employed to inspire
                    their Youth with Warlike Sentiments.” Glasg. 1759, 4to. To this publication,
                    which does not bear his name, he prefixed a characteristic inscription. “These
                    Remains of ancient Panegyric on martial Spirit and personal Valour, of old the
                    daily lessons of the Spartan youth, are with propriety inscribed to the young
                    Gentlemen lately bred at the University of Glasgow, at present serving their
                    country as Officers of the Highland Battalions now in America.” To the same
                    military gentlemen be has addressed his account of Tyrtaeus, which extends to
                    twenty-four pages. Besides the Greek text, with the Latin version of Stephanus,
                    he has given eight pages of “Observations on the Greek Text, which occurred
                    while the preface was at the press.” This maybe considered as rather a
                    perfunctory method of performing such a task, which would have required some
                    degree of research and deliberation; and indeed the preliminary account of
                    Tyrtaeus is not written with an adequate portion of critical care and precision.
                    It is observable that he does not even mention the name of Callinus the
                    Ephesian, to whom Stobaeus ascribes the second fragment. Of this very ancient
                    Greek poet, the history has lately been investigated by Franck with great
                    erudition and acuteness. He arrives at the conclusion that Callinus, author of
                    the fragment in question, flourished long before the age of Tyrtaeus, that he
                    even preceded the age of Hesiod; and that he was the earliest writer of elegiac
                    verse of whom we can discover any reliques, or of whom the ancients themselves

                    Tragedy, according to Aristotle; an Essay, in two parts.” Glasg. 1763, 8vo. The
                    brief passage in the Poetics to which this essay relates, has in no small degree
                    puzzled the modern critics.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    we are told that tragedy, by means of pity and terror, effects the purgation of
                    the passions. “Now,” as Dr Moor has remarked, “the difficulty which they find
                    here is, to explain in what manner tragedy, by exciting the two passions of
                    terror and pity, at the same time refines and purifies them; or, in what sense
                    we are to understand that tragedy proposes to refine and purify these two
                    passions by the very means of exciting them.” Since the days of Castelvetro and
                    Robortelli, innumerable attempts have been made to explain the passage, so as to
                    draw from it some consistent and forcible meaning. According to some
                    commentators, this purgation of the passions merely arises from the moral
                    influence of contemplating the direful effects produced by their excessive or
                    unregulated indulgence. According to others, the process of purgation or
                    purification is accomplished by that excitement of the passions which attends
                    the repre <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825020" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5020-0447"

                    excited, gradually become less violent in their influence upon the mind, as a
                    familiarity with all objects has a tendency to diminish the intensity of their
                    effect on the senses. Other explanations, or the different modifications of
                    these two, it is here superfluous to mention. That he was dissatisfied with all
                    of them, cannot perhaps excite much surprise. He contends that Aristotle nowhere
                    calls the passions <hi rend="italic">παόηματα</hi>; that the word by which he
                    uniformly describes them is <hi rend="italic">τrα∂η</hi>; and that the former
                    term always denotes sufferings or calamities. The signification of the verb
                    %α0α∕gw, and the cognate substantive <hi rend="italic">κα0αξpις,</hi> he has
                    carefully illustrated in the second part. “Thus,” he at length avers, “I hope I
                    have pretty fully proved that %α- <hi rend="italic">ia⅛ειν</hi> signifies to
                    clear away, to remove entirely, and that this is even its proper and primary
                    signification: consequently, <hi rend="italic">κα∂αξσις</hi> must of course
                    signify removal; and therefore <hi rend="italic">η οru0ηματοjν κα6αξσις</hi> is
                    an expression not liable, at least, to any imputation of impropriety. But I will
                    venture to go farther, and to say that it is introduced here with a nice and
                    beautiful propriety: for the words <hi rend="italic">καΘα'ιξtiv</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">κα0αξσις,</hi> from that first and simplest use which I have
                    hitherto been mentioning; I mean, to express the removal or clearing away of
                    whatever is amiss in external things; from that they came soon to be applied to
                    the removal of things amiss within, whether within the body or the mind; for, as
                    every one knows, they became even <hi rend="italic">voces signatae</hi> in
                    medicine for one method of removing what is amiss in the body, or the cause of
                    bodily disorder; and, from medicine, they came to be used for expressing the
                    removal of what is amiss, or the cause of disorder, in the mind.” And thus,
                    according to his hypothesis, “tragedy, by exhibiting such calamities on the
                    stage, would propose for its end and intention, <hi rend="italic"
                    >καDαlξειν,</hi> to remove such calamities out of human life; and propose to
                    accomplish that end by exciting the pity and terror of the audience at the
                    representation of them.” His explanation is certainly ingenious and plausible;
                    whether it is perfectly correct, may admit of some doubt. What is stated as to
                    Aristotle’s application of the words <hi rend="italic">παθημαrα</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">πd,0η,</hi> is not altogether accurate: he frequently uses the
                    latter word to denote sufferings, and sometimes the former to denote the
                    passions. This is one material objection to the professor’s explanation; and
                    another is to be found in a parallel passage of the author’s treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">De Pepublica,</hi> lib. viii. cap. vii. For, as Twining has
                    remarked, “whatever be the meaning of the term <hi rend="italic">καD-aνσις,</hi>
                    or purgation, here, must also be its meaning in the treatise on poetry; since to
                    that work Aristotle refers for a fuller explanation of it. The only difference
                    is, that here the term is applied to the effect of imitative music; there to
                    that of imitative poetry; of the species of it however which depended, we know,
                    upon music for a very considerable part of its effect.”<note anchored="true"

                    author’s idea that pity is to be purged by pity, terror by terror. Here it is
                    obvious that the hypothesis which we have been considering cannot apply with any
                    measure of propriety.</p>
                <p>In another tract, printed three years afterwards, Dr Moor gave a new proof of the
                    acumen with which he was accustomed to investigate subjects of grammar and
                    philology. “On the Praepositions of the Greek Language; an Introductory Essay.”
                    Glasg. 1766, 8vo. The general tendency of his speculations may be understood
                    from the following quotation. “Having gone thus far with each prae-position, not
                    without some satisfaction and encouragement to proceed, tho’ far from being
                    fully assured that I was right, I took a careful review of them all, comparing
                    these radical significations together. From which survey of the whole, compared
                    also with the flexions of nouns, I imagined that I did plainly perceive the true
                    use and design, in the Greek language, of that part of speech called
                    pracposition; viz. that the three chief circumstances of relation, or connexion,
                    in human life, are expressed by the flexions of nouns in the three oblique
                    cases; and that all other circumstances of relation or connexion are expressed
                    by the praepositions. By the three chief circumstances of relation or connexion
                    in human life, I mean <hi rend="italic">possession, interchange,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">action.</hi> Possession, or the relation between the possessor and
                    that which he possesses, by the genitive case; interchange, or mutual
                    communication, whether of words or things, by the dative case; action, or the
                    relation between the agent and what he acts upon, by the accusative case. All
                    other relations were, I thought, in Greek, expressed by the praepositions. These
                    other relations all refer to <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >motion, place</hi> or <hi rend="italic">time;</hi> and are what the schoolmen
                    would call the ‘ accidentia motus et quietis, loci et temporis.’ According to
                    the mutual connexion between the ideas of place and time, all praepositions
                    express place and time equally; tho’ perhaps place was the primary idea or
                    signification in all of them. With respect to motion and rest, some
                    praepositions express only the one of these; and then they govern only one case.
                    Others express both; and then they govern two cases; one when they express
                    motion, the other when they express rest.” From his speculations on this
                    subject, the praise of acuteness and ingenuity cannot be withheld. The
                    correctness of his theory of the Greek prepositions has however been called in
                    question by several writers, particularly by Mr Tate, who has stated several
                    objections that appear to be material.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    its elegance. His edition of the Arenarius of Archimedes, without preface or
                    annotation, has been considered as valuable for the accuracy of the text.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Professor Rigaud of Oxford
                    read a paper to the Ashmolean Society on the 11th of November 1836, giving “a
                    general account of the contents of the Arenarius, of the method invented by
                    Archimedes for the enumeration of very large numbers, and his artifice on the
                    principle of logarithms, for finding the value of their products. It then
                    entered on the state in which the Greek text of this treatise is now preserved
                    to us. The first critical edition was that which Dr Wallis published at Oxford
                    in 1676, which is very valuable, although he had not the advantage of any
                    manuscript to assist him, but principally depended for his authority on the
                    imperfect text of Hervagius. Torelli, in preparing the edition of the works of
                    Archimedes, which was published at Oxford in 1792, professes to follow Wallis,
                    and indeed departs only in a very few places from what he had adopted. Torelli
                    most probably was not aware that a much better text of the Arenarius had been
                    printed in Great Britain many years previous to the completion of his own la∙
                    hours. The book, indeed, is very scarce, as it was never published, and only a
                    few copies got abread. Any one acquainted with the characters of Foulis’s
                    printing, must have immediately recognised the press at which it was executed;
                    but it never had any regular title-page; and no particulars would probably be
                    now known of it, if Air Barnwell had not preserved them in a note, which he has
                    inserted in a copy belonging to the British AIuseum. From that valuable
                    memorandum, we learn that the editor was Dr AIoor, Professor of Greek at
                    Glasgow; and that he used a AIS. for it, which had been lent him by the Abbé
                    Sallier, as it is said, out of the French king’s library. He appears to have
                    sent it back in 17ð 1; but Air Barnwell, in 1828, could find no traces of it in
                    that extensive collection at Paris; nor was any further clew discovered to an
                    original authority for Dr Aloor’s very superior readings, till a AIS·, in 1830,
                    was left by Mr Powell, of Balliol, to the Observatory at Oxford. In this Air
                    Barnwell immediately observed a coincidence with the peculiar text of the
                    Glasgow edition; but reasons were given in Professor Rigaud’s paper for doubting
                    whether it was the identical AIS. used by Dr AIoor; and if it was, whether it
                    had ever belonged to the Royal Library at Paris. Anderson, in his translation of
                    the Arenarius, published in 1782, alludes to Dr Aloor’s (which he only knew as
                    an anonymous) edition; and, from mistaken caution, rejects the decided
                    improvements which it affords. There is an old Latin translation which Hervagius
                    added to his publication, although it essentially differs from his Greek text.
                    Air Anderson suspected that the Glasgow edition was altered, and accommodated to
                    this Latin, without considering (what is now indiputably clear), that, by their
                    agreement, the one became a confirmation of the other.”</p></note> It is a small
                    folio of thirty-two pages, without a Latin title, and without a date. Of the
                    elegant and correct edition of Herodotus, published in the year 1761 in 9 vols.
                    8vo, he is expressly mentioned by his son as having had the inspection. He may
                    probably have rendered a similar service to the edition of Thucydides, published
                    in the year 1759 in 8 vols. 8vo. But of the Glasgow press at that period, the
                    great boastand ornament is the splendid and accurate edition of Homer. The
                    editors were Dr Moor and Mr Muirhead, professor of humanity; and the edition
                    consists of four volumes in small folio. The two volumes containing the Iliad
                    appeared in 1756; and the remaining two, containing the Odyssey, Hymns, and
                    other reliques, followed in 1758. A preface to the Iliad, subscribed by both
                    editors, but probably written by the Greek professor, gives a minute account of
                    the method pursued in the révisa! of the text. Every sheet was read six times
                    before it was sent to press; twice by the ordinary corrector, James Tweedie,

                    Advocates Library there is a quarto volume of Aloor’s Papers, chiefly consisting
                    of brief annotations on Greek and Latin writers. Among other scraps, it contains
                    the following: “Erratum duplex in the Glasgow Homer, Iliad sr. 857∙ Fro αv¾oτjτα

                    da. Tweedie, whom 1 have caught in many pranks of this kind.” The volume
                    contains a letter from Lord Hailes to Dr Moor, dated at Edinburgh on the 20th of
                    August 17ð7, recommending the plan of publishing a collective edition of the
                    fragments of the Greek lyric poets, and communicating some emendations of
                    Alcaeus, Sappho, and Anacreon. “As I understand by our friend Air Smith,” says
                    this learned judge, “that you have made some emendations upon Anacreon, I cannot
                    but testify my desire that you apply your thoughts to the fragments of the Greek
                    lyrics, which are excellent, as you know, and much corrupted. An edition of such
                    fragments as comprehend a compleat sentiment, if published by you, would be an
                    acceptable present to the learned world.”</p></note></p>
                <p>As a relaxation from severer studies, Dr Moor occasionally indulged his fancy in
                    the composition of English, and even of Scotish verses. A collection, published
                    so early as the year 1751, contains his “Verses sacred to the Memory of the
                    Honourable Alexander Stuart, Master of Garlies: inscribed to the Right
                    Honourable Lord Boyle.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    we ascribe to him on the authority of the late Professor Richardson, who must
                    have been well acquainted with his personal and literary history. The young
                    gentleman here commemorated was the eldest son of Alexander Lord Garlies,
                    afterwards the sixth earl of Galloway. He died at Aix-la-Chapelle in the year
                    1738, and the verses were probably composed soon after that event. Another of
                    his poems, entitled the Linnet, or Happiness at Home, was in 1775 printed in a
                    periodical work, under the name of the author.<note anchored="true"

                    given,” says the anonymous author, “it will be seen that Dr Aloor’s claims to
                    poetic rank are of no ordinary cast. The Chelsea Pensioners and the AIistake are
                    distinguished by a dryness of humour and truth of colouring, which have not
                    often been surpassed. They evince powers which only required to have been
                    cultivated, to place their author on a level with the very best of our minor
                    poets.”</p></note> One of these is a popular song, entitled the Chelsea

                    Moor; who, as Mr Stewart has well remarked, “combined with a gaiety and a levity
                    foreign to this climate, the profound attainments of a scholar and a
                    mathematician.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    him to some mischances, and did not leave the respectability of his character
                    altogether unimpaired. He lived and died unmarried, but during a great part of
                    his life was subjected to female influence, not of the most refined
                    denomination.</p>

                <p>Of his personal history, little now remains to be told. On the 16th of May 1759,
                    he had been nominated vicerector till Dr Leechman’s state of health should
                    permit him to reside in college. His noble pupil the earl of Errol, having been
                    elected rector, appointed him vice-rector on <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825046"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-5046-0449"/>the 1st of September 1761. In consideration of his
                    talents and learning, the degree of LL.D, was conferred upon him on the 26th of
                    April 1763. On the I4th of June 1766 he was elected clerk of the university. His
                    constitution had never been vigorous, and about this period his health was much
                    impaired: he therefore obtained the permission of the senate to employ John
                    Young in teaching his classes during the ensuing session. Although he afterwards
                    found his health somewhat improved, he never recovered any considerable degree
                    of strength. On the 5th of May 1774 he resigned his professorship, on condition
                    of being allowed to retain his house and salary. He was succeeded by Mr Young,
                    who was likewise a man of talents and learning, and who was long conspicuous as
                    a zealous and efficient instructor of youth.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    declining years of Dr Moor were less comfortable than his friends could have
                    wished, or might have expected. His early connexion with men of rank had no
                    tendency to train him in habits of economy, and his domestic concerns were not
                    placed under the best management. Such were the embarrassments of his situation,
                    that in the month of November 1767 his household furniture was distrained. Two
                    years afterwards, he sold to the university his collection of medals for the sum
                    of thirty-two pounds. It is more to be regretted that his library, which was of
                    very’ considerable extent and value, was likewise sold during his own
                    lifetime;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bibliotheca
