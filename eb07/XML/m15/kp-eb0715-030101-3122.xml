                <p><label type="entry">MISSOURI</label>, one of the United States of North America,
                    is situated between 88° 17' and 94° 30 ’ of west longitude, and 36° and 40° 30'
                    of north latitude. It is 270 miles in length by 220 in breadth, and contains an
                    area of about 60,000 square miles. I fis bounded on the north and west by the
                    Missouri territory; on the east and northeast by the Mississippi, which
                    separates it from Illinois; on the south-east by the Mississippi, which
                    separates it in this quarter from Kentucky and Tennessee; and on the south by
                    Arkansas territory.</p>
                <p>A large portion of this state, situated in the south-east quarter, is low,
                    swampy, full of lakes, and in many places liable to inundation. Beyond this
                    region, which is generally marked by a bold line of rolling and fertile high
                    lands, the country gradually becomes mountainous, and continues so to the Osage
                    and its tributaries. It then becomes broken and hilly, until it opens upon the
                    boundless belt of prairies which spreads beyond the western limits of the state.
                    The best land is situated between the Missouri and the Mississippi; and no part
                    of this vast tract is mountainous, consisting chiefly of alluvial and hilly
                    prairies of a very rich soil. The importance of large navigable rivers to a
                    civilized and commercial people is well known; and no quarter of the globe is so
                    amply provided in this respect as Missouri, the greater part of rich and easily
                    cultivated soil stretching along the banks of majestic streams. The Mississippi
                    sweeps along its eastern border 550 miles, receiving in its course the great
                    river from which the state derives its name. The Missouri, entering the western
                    boundary, traverses the state, receiving on either side tributaries, which, if,
                    not contrasted with the stream into which they empty their waters, would deserve
                    the title of fine rivers. The Osage, rising in the angle between Arkansas and
                    Kansas Rivers, on the vast plains west from the state of Missouri, carries its
                    serpentine but navigable volume into Missouri River, near the centre of the
                    state. The St Francis and White Rivers rise in this state, and flowing
                    southward, connect it with the Arkansas. A great many large and beautiful rivers
                    enter the Missouri as tributaries. Some of these have a course in the state, but
                    most of them belong to the territory of Missouri.</p>
                <p>The soil of this state is as varied as the surface, every quality being found,
                    from the most productive and inexhaustible alluvium, to tracts of sterile clay
                    or siliceous sand. According to Mr Flint, there is a specific difference between
                    the alluvium of the two rivers Mississippi and Missouri; the bottoms of the
                    latter being more loamy and sandy, and those of its rival more clayey and sub
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823135" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3135-0302"/>stantial. On
                    the eastern border, and near the streams generally, a dense forest covered
                    Missouri; although in some parts naked prairie encroaches upon the streams.
                    Speaking in general terms, the south-east section is alluvial, and liable to a
                    partial annual inundation; the southwestern is mixed prairie and “flint hill”
                    land; the northern section, west from the Mississippi and north from the
                    Missouri, contains, as we have already said, the choicest land in the state. The
                    soil of the upland prairies is far inferior to that of the alluvial prairies.
                    Upon the whole, the good lands of this country have in general a great degree of
                    fertility; and thère is scarcely any part sufficiently level for cultivation
                    which does not produce good crops of corn without manure, whilst in many
                    instances the poorer lands are found to be better for wheat than the richer. The
                    prairies are in general level, and of an intermediate character between the
                    richer and poorer uplands; and the bottoms of all the water-courses are rich.
                    The geographical extent of Missouri, and its great diversity of soil, admit of a
                    corresponding variety of vegetable productions. Wheat and Indian corn have been
                    the staples of this state during the comparatively short period that any part of
                    it has been cultivated. Its soil also produces the other kinds of grain in
                    perfection. Cotton is raised in the south-eastern section; tobacco thrives well;
                    and flax and hemp are likely to become largely cultivated. Turnips and
                    bulbous-rooted vegetables grow to a great size. Pumpkins, squashes, and melons,
                    are nowhere raised in greater abundance; and sweet as well as Irish potatoes
                    thrive sufficiently well. Cultivated grasses have hitherto not succeeded so well
                    as the other articles of culture. At present the fodder provided for the stable
                    in winter is chiefly corn, its leaves and husks, with what is called prairie
                    grass. This is a coarse and tall grass, covering the prairies in the greatest
                    abundance. All the fruits of the northern and middle states thrive in an
                    uncommon degree. Three species of vine are common in all parts of the country;
                    whilst the warmth of summer, and the dryness of the atmosphere, peculiarly fit
                    this state for the cultivation of the medicinal plants, rhubarb, palma Christi,
                    and the poppy. Indeed many parts of it are likely to rival the best tracts east
                    of the Mississippi in the abundance of their productions. “This state,” says Mr
                    Flint, “has lands already, fit for the plough, sufficient to produce wheat
                    enough for the whole United States. Prairies of hundreds of thousands of acres
                    of first-rate wheat-lands, covered with grass, and perfectly free from shrubs
                    and bushes, invite the plough; and if the country were cultivated to a proper
                    extent it might become the granary of the world.” “Above all countries,” says
                    the same writer, “this is the land of flowers. In the season, every prairie is
                    an immense flower garden. In the early stages of spring rises a generation of
                    flowers, whose prevalent tint is peach-blossom; the next is a deeper red; then
                    succeeds the yellow, and. to the latest period of autumn the prairies exhibit a
                    brilliant golden hue.” Apiculture in all its forms, either as an art or as a
                    science, is yet in its infancy in Missouri, as it may be supposed to be in any
                    newly-settled country where nature has done so much. The climate is extremely
                    fickle and variable, and the changes of temperature are very great. During three
                    winters in five the Mississippi is passable on the ice at St Louis. Receding
                    from the Atlantic, it is in this state that the frigid winds of the north-west
                    are first experienced in all their force. The prevailing winds follow the
                    direction of the Mississippi Valley; those from the northward are cold, but the
                    southern winds are warm. The winter commences about Christmas, and is frequently
                    severe; but the summers are very warm, and as the country is bare, and open to
                    the sun’s influence, whilst the soil is of a warm and sandy texture, calculated
                    to admit the solar rays, a great quantity of caloric is imbibed. Less rain falls
                    here than in New England, or the southern states, and the atmosphere is much
                    drier and more bracing. It is, however, cold and windy; but successive years
                    vary so much that a general rule can scarcely be laid down. Uncertain as are the
                    revolutions in meteorology elsewhere, they are proverbially variable in the
                    state of Missouri and the adjacent regions. In regard to health, this state has
                    a somewhat suspicious character; but in course of time, by cultivation,
                    draining, and similar operations, it is likely to become as salubrious as any
                    other in the Union. Although but a few years since a tenement in any degree
                    superior to a temporary log-hut was a very rare object, the progress of
                    civilization is marked by the rapid disappearance of those primitive structures,
                    and the substitution of brick and stone houses. Bears, wolves, panthers,
                    buffaloes, elks, deer, the mole called gopher, the bite of which is said to be
                    poisonous, the prairie dog, rattle snakes, and other reptiles, are found in this
                    state. Great varieties of watergame swarm on the lakes, ponds, and rivers during
                    certain seasons of the year. Generally speaking, the hunter will find in no
                    country a finer field for his pursuits. The domestic animals are the same as in
                    other parts of the United States.</p>
                <p>Missouri is rich in minerals and metals, and it has become celebrated for immense
                    deposits of lead ore, chiefly of galena. It is dug out in various parts of the
                    state; but there is a district extending nearly a hundred miles in length and
                    forty in width, which is particularly distinguished for its lead mines. The
                    centre of the district is about seventy miles south-west from St Louis, and
                    about half as far from Herculaneum on the Mississippi. The ore is found in
                    imbedded masses, and appears evidently to be a deposit. Coal in immense strata
                    also exists in Missouri, and iron ore forms no inconsiderable part of many of
                    the hills. The other minerals discovered are plaster, manganese, zinc, antimony,
                    cobalt, various kinds of ochre, common salt, nitre, plumbago, porphyry, jasper,
                    calcedony, and marble. There are as yet but few public roads, although Congress
                    has paid attention to the construction of railways and other public works. A
                    railroad from Marion city to Palmyra has been commenced; and it is intended to
                    continue it to New York, the capital of Shelby county, and thence to the
                    Missouri, near Chariton. Another has been projectéd extending from St Louis to
                    Fayette, upwards of a hundred miles in length; and another leading from St Louis
                    to the lead mines in Washington and Franklin counties. With a few exceptions,
                    the habitable parts of Missouri constitute one vast plain, so that roads are
                    easily constructed, and those which have been made are remarkably good, and
                    passable at all seasons of the year. In 1825, commissioners of the United States
                    laid out a road through the wilderness, leading from Missouri to Mexico and the
                    Osages, by treaty, in consideration of 800 dollars, granted the right of making
                    and using the road through their lands.</p>
                <p>In reference to trade, it is not to be supposed that Missouri, so recently
                    settled, can have much, excepting in such articles as are immediately supplied
                    by nature. Accordingly, lead and fur constitute the staples of commerce. The
                    lead annually smelted exceeds three millions of pounds, a considerable quantity
                    certainly, but nothing compared with what might readily be obtained. There is
                    doubtless ore enough of the best quality to supply the whole world with lead.
                    The commerce in this article, therefore, is likely to increase rapidly; for the
                    mines are rich, and the part of the country in which they are situated is
                    remarkable for its salubrity, as well as for the fertility of its soil, and its
                    fine streams. Shot-towers are erected at Herculaneum and other places; and great
                    quantities of shot are exported. St Louis is the centre of the fur trade. Boats
                    are continually passing between this town and New <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193823148" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3148-0303"/>Orleans. Since Mexicoachieved
                    its independence, considerable commercial intercourse has been established with
                    the interior provinces of that republic, by means of the road above mentioned.
                    Amongst other companies incorporated by the legislature within these few years
                    are, the Missouri Insurance Company, capital one hundred thousand dollars, and
                    the privilege to increase it to four hundred thousand; the St Louis Marine
                    Railway Company; the St Louis Hospital; the St Louis Water-Works; and the St
                    Louis Marine and Fire Insurance Company. The bank of the United States has an
                    office of discount and deposit at St Louis. There are various other companies
                    established throughout the state, amongst which may be mentioned an iron
                    foundery on a respectable scale in the vicinity of St Louis, and one or two
                    large establishments at Bellevue, in the mine country, which smelt their own
                    iron from mines in the immediate vicinity.</p>
                <p>The most numerous denominations of Christians in Missouri are Methodists,
                    Presbyterians, and Catholics. Accörding to the American Almanac for the year
                    1837, the United Brethren or Moravians had thirty-three ministers, twenty-four
                    churches or congregations, and two thousand communicants; whilst the Catholics
                    had thirty-nine ministers. Religious instruction and good schools are less
                    esteemed and less common in this new state than in most others in the Union. St
                    Louis College, a Catholic institution, was founded in 1829: in 1836 there were
                    fifteen instructors, nine alumni, two hundred students, and 7500 volumes in the
                    library attached to it. Corporations have been formed for a number of academies,
                    colleges, and seminaries of education; and the legislature has passed an
                    enactment to sell all the lands appropriated to the interests of education, and
                    apply the funds thence arising to the purpose for which it was intended. There
                    are a number of convents in the state, to which young females are sent to be
                    educated. In 1810 there was only one newspaper in the state, butin 1836 the
                    number had increased to fifteen.</p>

                <p>Of this population 24,990 are slaves. In 1836 it was estimated at 210,000, being
                    an increase of 70,000 in less than six years.</p>
                <p>The commercial capital of Missouri, and the principal town west of the
                    Mississippi, is St Louis. It is situated on the western bank of the above-named
                    river, eighteen miles by water below the junction of the Missouri, fourteen
                    above that of the Maramac, thirty below that of the Illinois, and 200 above that
                    of the Ohio, being in long. 89.36. W., and lat. 38. 36. N. The situation of the
                    town is elevated, pleasant, healthy, and admirably adapted for commerce. The
                    ground upon which it stands rises gradually from the first to the second bank,
                    which is forty feet above the place upon which St Louis is chiefly built. On
                    this bank are the fortifications erected in early times for the defence of the
                    place.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823161" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3161-0304"/>
                <p>The town extends two miles along the river, in three parallel streets, which are
                    intersected by others crossing them at right angles. It contains several places
                    of public worship, amongst which is a Catholic cathedral. It has also a spacious
                    town-house, a theatre, a land office, a bank, a museum, two or three printing
                    offices, a brewery, and several mills. Many of the houses are built of stone,
                    but not a few are entirely constructed of wood. It is in a state of rapid
                    improvement, and fast increasing in population and trade. Its situation is
                    advantageous and interesting, being more central with regard to the whole
                    territory belonging to the United States than any other considerable town; and,
                    uniting the advantages of the three great rivers Mississippi, Missouri, and
                    Illinois, with their numerous branches, whilst it possesses unrivalled
                    facilities for trade, it will in all likelihood become a great city, and the
                    centre of a very extensive commerce. An idea of the present state of the trade
                    of St Louis, and the rate at which it increases, may be formed from the
                    following abstract made from the steam-boat register.</p>

                <p>The country around and to the west of St Louis, for a distance of fifteen miles,
                    is an extended prairie of a very luxuriant soil. This town was settled,
                    principally by French emigrants from Kaskaskias, soon after the peace of 1763,
                    when France ceded to Great Britain her right to all the country eastward of the
                    Mississippi. It came to the United States by the cession of Louisiana in 1803.
                    The population at that time was below 1000; in 1830 in had risen to 5852; and at
                    present (1837), judging from the increase of trade, it cannot amount to less
                    than 10,000 or 12,000.</p>
                <p>The other towns in the state of Missouri are, with a few exceptions, of but small
                    size and little importance. Herculaneum is situated on the western bank of the
                    Mississippi, thirty miles below St Louis, upon a narrow alluvial plain, hemmed
                    in on all sides but that facing the river by high and romantic bluffs, rendered
                    still more imposing by a number of shot-towers planted on their summits. This is
                    the chief place of deposit for the lead of the lead mines. St Genevieve is
                    situated at the upper extremity of a beautiful alluvial prairie about a mile
                    westward of the Mississippi. The town is finely situated, and has some trade,
                    most of the lead for exportation being brought to it. The population amounts to
                    about 1500. New Madrid is situated on the Mississippi, about fifty miles below
                    the mouth of the Ohio. Next to Natchez, it is the most noted landing place for
                    steam-boats on the Mississippi above New Orleans. It is chiefly deserving of
                    mention from having, along with the country around it, been visited, in 1811 and
                    the following year, by two of the most terrible and destructive earthquakes
                    which ever laid waste the works of man and nature. Jefferson, a new town above
                    the mouth of the Osage, on the south side of the Missouri, has become, since the
                    seat of government was removed there, the position of the public buildings; but
                    not being a fortunate selection, it has not greatly prospered. Franklin is
                    situated on the northern bank of the Missouri, 150 miles by land above St Louis.
                    It is estimated to contain above 200 houses, and about 1200 inhabitants. It is
                    surrounded by the largest body of rich land in the state, and is the centre of
                    a°populous region of opulent and respectable farmers. Potosi, the county town of
                    Washington, is the centre of the mine district. It is situated in a pleasant
                    valley surrounded by hills, sixty-five miles south-west from St Louis. St
                    Michael is an old French village amongst the mines, and there are a number of
                    other small villages in the same district. St Charles, on the Missouri, is a
                    pleasant village, containing about 1200 inhabitants. It was for a number of
                    years the political metropolis of the state; and no place in the western
                    territory has a more interesting country adjoining it than this village. The
                    other places are too small to require particular description.</p>
                <p>This state adopted its present constitution, and was admitted into the Union, in
                    1820. In its general features it resembles those of the other states. The
                    senators are elected for four years, and the representatives for two. The
                    governor is elected for four years. The judicial power is vested in a
                    supreme*court, a chancellor’s court, and circuit, and other subordinate courts,
                    the judges of which hold their offices during good behaviour. Every free citizen
                    who has resided a year in the state, and the last three months preceding the
                    election in the district, is entitled to a vote in that district. The
                    legislature meets at Jefferson every second year, on the first Monday of
                    November. The article which allowed the existence of slavery in the state was
                    long and bitterly contested in the national legislature; but the admirers of the
                    whip and chain prevailed. There is nothing, either interesting or remarkable in
                    the history of Missouri. It formed a part of the extensive country of Louisiana
                    which was purchased from France by the United States in the year 1803. Although
                    French settlements were commenced at St Louis and St Genevieve as early as 1764,
                    yet, at the time when the country was purchased, this portion of it contained
                    but few inhabitants. In 1804 this country was separated from the rest of
                    Louisiana, and erected into a territorial government by the name of the
                    Territory of Louisiana, which was afterwards altered to the Territory of
                    Missouri, and lastly to the State of Missouri. Immigration at first proceeded
                    rapidly, but received a check in the year 1811 from the sickliness of the
                    season; and the late war also effectually repressed for a time the increase of
                    the country. In 1817 various causes conspired to retard the advancement of this
                    state. Improvements of every description not only came to a dead pause, but
                    seemed to retrograde. This continued for several years; but in the year 1824
                    prosperity advanced anew, the tide of immigration once more set towards
                    Missouri, and it has ever since continued to improve.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Missouri Territory,</hi> a tract of country belonging to the
                    United States, which is bounded on the north by the British possessions, on the
                    east by the North-west Territory, Illinois and Missouri, on the south and
                    south-west by the territories of the Mexican republic, and on the west by the
                    Rocky Mountains. It is 900 miles in length by 800 in breadth. The belt of land
                    on the western bank of the Mississippi, which is partially wooded, is generally
                    from 200 to 400 in breadth. Then commence the vast prairies which constitute so
                    striking and impressive a feature in the immense country stretching beyond the
                    Mississippi and the Missouri. It is for the most part a plain, more or less
                    covered with grass, and in many places fertile; but in others it presents only
                    an ocean of moving sand. Countless multitudes of buffaloes, elks, and other wild
                    animals, graze upon it. The principal sources of the Missouri, Arkansas, and Red
                    River, are found in this territory; and several large branches of the
                    Mississippi, above the Missouri, come from the north-western part of the same
                    vast country. Of the Rocky Mountains, which are as yet but imperfectly known, Mr
                    Flint, in his Geography of America, gives the following account.</p>
                <p>“The Rocky Mountains commence in the unexplored regions to the north-west of the
                    United States, and, ranging across the sources of the Missouri, the Roche Jaune,
                    Platte, Arkansas, and Red River, in the Mexican states of Texas and Coahuila,
                    they diverge and unite with the ranges of Mexican mountains. They separate the
                    waters of the great tributaries of the Mississippi from those that fall into the
                    Columbia or Multnomah, the great lake of Buenaventura, and other waters of the
                    Pacific. They <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823174" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3174-0305"
                    />have a far greater extent than the Alleghany Mountains, are of a wider range,
                    and for the most part run, like them, in parallel ridges, though generally more
                    ragged, detached, and broken, and are by no means so regular. They are also of a
                    character decidedly more primitive. Their black, precipitous, and frowning
                    appearance has probably given them the name of the Rocky Mountains. Their bases
                    have an elevation of between 3000 and 4000 feet above the level of the sea.
                    James’s or Pike’s Mountain has been given as about 12,000 feet in height. As
                    this vast range of mountains is as yet but very imperfectly known, there is
                    little reason to doubt that many of the peaks, when more fully explored and more
                    accurately measured, will be found to approach much nearer in height to the
                    highest ranges in Mexicothan has been commonly supposed. Most of the more
                    elevated summits are above the limit of perpetual congelation. In one respect
                    they resemble the Al-Jeghanies. In numerous places the waters that run into the
                    Pacific rise near those that fall into the tributaries of the Mississippi. Thus
                    has nature kindly provided points of easy transit from the eastern to the
                    western side of these frowning and apparently impassable barriers of nature. By
                    communications of unquestionable veracity, from persons engaged in the Missouri
                    Fur Company, we learn that, following up the valleys of the sources of the
                    Platte to the opposite valleys of waters that fall into the Great Lake of
                    Buenaventura, on the other side, a good road was found, and easily passable by
                    loaded waggons.” This vast inland sea is one hundred miles in length by from
                    sixty to eighty in breadth, and its waters are much salter than those of the
                    ocean.</p>
                <p>There are other ranges of mountains, which traverse different parts of this
                    territory; as the Black Hills, the Ozark Mountains, the Masserne, and others.
                    There are also fertile belts of land on the margins of most of the rivers, and
                    some of them have a great extent of rich country. As we recede from the rivers,
                    the soil becomes poor, and extensive deserts are found in the southern regions.
                    In such a vast extent of level country, naked and open, the climate must of
                    course in a great measure depend upon latitude. Immediately beyond the state of
                    Missouri and the Arkansas territory, the climate is mild and temperate; but it
                    gradually becomes similar to that of Canada. There are very few settlements of
                    whites in this vast country, and none so considerable as to have any established
                    government. At Council Bluffs there is a military post, having one regiment of
                    infantry. Many tribes of Indians still possess vast tracts of country. The Sioux
                    are the most numerous; and the whole number has been estimated at about
                    140,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Missouri,</hi> a very large river of the United States,
                    which unites with the Mississippi a little beyond the thirtieth degree of north
                    lat. It originates in the Rocky Mountains, and takes the name of Missouri in
                    lat. 45. 10. north, and in long. 110. west, where the three branches, Jefferson,
                    Gallatin, and Madison unite. These head branches of the Missouri are navigable
                    to a considerable extent before their junction. Where the river makes its escape
                    from the Rocky Mountains, it presents a spectacle of rare sublimity. For a
                    distance of about six miles the rocks rise 1200 feet perpendicularly from the
                    water’s edge. The river is considerably diminished in width where it rushes
                    through these gates of the Rocky Mountains. One hundred and ten miles below this
                    chasm are the stupendous cataracts of the Missouri, one of which has a
                    perpendicular fall of eighty-seven feet, but according to Mr Flint of
                    ninety-eight feet. For about seventeen miles the river may be termed a series of
                    cataracts. Not far below these falls Maria’s River from the north joins the
                    Missouri. Itis a considerable stream, as are also the Dearborn, Fancy, Manoles,
                    Big Dry, and others, which enter still farther down. Below these the Missouri
                    receives the waters of the Roche Jaune or Yellow Stone, probably its largest
                    tributary. It rises in the same ranges of mountains as the main river, and in
                    many respects resembles it. It is a broad, deep, and sweeping stream, and at its
                    junction appears to be the larger of the two, entering from the south by a mouth
                    of 850 yards wide. Its course is commonly calculated at 1600 miles, and its
                    entrance is said to be 1880 miles above the mouth of the Missouri. It was
                    selected by the government as an eligible situation for a military post and an
                    extensive settlement. At the junction of the Yellow Stone, the Missouri has wide
                    and fine bottoms, but unfortunately its banks are almost destitute of timber,
                    which will retard its settlement for a long time. A great many rivers join the
                    Missouri below this. The following are the most considerable: Knife River;
                    Cannon-Ball River, which is 140 yards wide; Chienne, which is boatable 800
                    miles; Poncas, Qui-Courre, White Stone, Big Sioux, Floyd’s, and many other
                    streams, all enter on the south side. La Platte, which has a longer course than
                    any tributary of the Missouri, comes in from the south side. It rises in the
                    same ranges of mountains which give birth to the parent stream, and, measured by
                    its meanders, is supposed to have a course of 2000 miles before it joins the
                    principal stream. It is nearly a mile in width at its entrance; but, as its name
                    imports, is shallow, and not boatable except at its highest flood. Kansas, a
                    large tributary from the south, has a course of 1200 miles, and is boatable
                    nearly the whole of its course. From the north side, the following, amongst
                    other streams, flow into the Missouri: the Grand River, which is large, long,
                    deep, and boatable for a great distance; the Nowada, Little Platte, Charatous,
                    Bonne Femme, and Manitou.</p>
                <p>The whole length of the Missouri, above its junction with the Mississippi, has
                    been estimated at above 3100 miles. Add to this the distance from the mouth of
                    the Missouri to the Gulf of Mexico and the total will be nearly 4400 miles. The
                    Missouri is much longer than the Mississippi before their junction, and has a
                    much greater volume of water. It is about half a mile in breadth at its mouth,
                    but is wider in a great part of its course. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. r.
