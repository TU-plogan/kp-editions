                <p><label type="entry">MONTROSE</label>, a royal burgh and sea-port town of
                    Scotland, in the county of Forfar, distant seventy miles northeast from
                    Edinburgh, thirty porth-cast from Dundee, and about forty south from Aberdeen,
                    in longitude 2. 10. west, and latitude 56. 34. north. It is pleasantly situated
                    on the west side of a narrow sandy peninsula, formed by the German Ocean on the
                    east, the South Esk river on the south, and on the west by a large basin, into
                    which the tide, flowing np the South Esk, spreads itself after passing the town.
                    It is a burgh of high antiquity, and received its first charter from David I.,
                    although, from the tenor of that charter, it seems to have been a burgh even
                    before that time. The petty-customs, weigh-house and flesh-market dues, &amp;c.
                    are levied in virtue of a charter granted by David II. James IV. also granted a
                    charter, dated 1493, by which the magistrates are still empowered to levy
                    shore-dues, anchorage, and plankage, at the harbour, for the purpose of
                    upholding piers, buoys, and moorings. The magistrates likewise hold a writ of
                    privy seal from James VI. dated 1600, authorizing them to hold a weekly
                    grain-market on the High Street. Owing to an informality in the election of its
                    magistracy’in 1816, the burgh was disfranchised by the Court of Session; and in
                    1817 a new charter was granted by the crown, by which the old practice of
                    self-election was abolished, and every year ten of the council were renewed by
                    the suffrages of the guildry and trades. But the municipal reform act improved
                    on this charter, and now the magistrates and councillors are elected by the
                    parliamentary voters. The town-council consists of nineteen members, including
                    the provost, three bailies, dean of guild, treasurer, and master of the
                    hospital. Their jurisdiction extends over the royalty of the burgh. The
                    Constable Hill, which the town acquired by purchase, is beyond their
                    jurisdiction, although included in the parliamentary boundaries.</p>
                <p>The name of the town is connected with some important events in Scottish history.
                    It was here that in 1296 John Baliol surrendered his crown to Edward 1. of
                    England; and it was from the port of Montrose that the celebrated Sir James
                    Douglas embarked in 1330, with a numerous retinue, on a pilgrimage to the Holy
                    Land, to bury the heart of King Robert Bruce in the Holy Sepulchre. It is
                    distinguished as the first place in Scotland where the Greek language was
                    taught, and as having sent forth from its seminary the learned scholar and
                    divine, Andrew Melville. It is likewise the birth-place of the celebrated
                    Marquis of Montrose. This was the only town in Scotland, so late as the
                    commencement of the eighteenth century, where an individual could be found who
                    understood the management of pumps in coal-works. In December 1715, James, the
                    first pretender, landed here from the French fleet, which had passed the Frith
                    of Forth, the place of its destination; and here also, in February of the
                    ensuing year, he and his suite again embarked for France.</p>
                <p>The town is in general well built, and has of late years been considerably
                    enlarged by the erection of several new streets. The principal street extends,
                    under various denominations, the whole length of the town; and the centre part
                    of it, named the High Street, is spacious, and contains many elegant buildings.
                    From the east side of this main street run several cross streets, which connect
                    it with the different smaller streets and buildings lying in that direction. The
                    town-house, which stands in the High Street, is a handsome edifice of two
                    stories, with an arcade below, and contains the council-room, guild-hall,
                    courtroom, news-room, and public library. The old parish church, which is
                    collegiate, is a large, plain building, measuring 98 feet in length by 65 in
                    breadth. It has two tiers of galleries, and is seated for 2500, but contains
                    nearly 3000. A new steeple was attached to it in 1835, consisting of an elegant
                    and massive Gothic tower, upwards of a hundred feet high, surmounted by a spire
                    nearly of the same height. This is said to be the highest steeple in Scotland.
                    St John’s Church, formerly a chapel of ease to the old parish church, but to
                    which a parish was annexed in 1835, is a handsome edifice, seated for about 1500
                    individuals. There are also two congregations belonging to the United Associate
                    Synod, two of Episcopalians, one of Independents, one of Methodists, two of
                    Baptists, and one of Glassites. St Peter’s Chapel, belonging to the
                    Episcopalians not connected with the Scottish communion, was founded in 1722,
                    and is a neat and commodious place of worship. The Academy, erected in the year
                    1814, is a fine edifice. It is under the patronage of the town-council, and is
                    conducted by a rector, who teaches mathematics, geography, and modern languages;
                    and it has, besides, two teachers of English, two for writing and arithmetic,
                    and two for Latin and Greek. In ]832 a spacious seminary was erected by the
                    seven incorporated trades, for affording education on cheaper terms than those
                    of the Academy. There is a free school, founded by Mr David White, in which a
                    hundred boys are taught; and another supported by Miss Straiton’s, endowment, in
                    which forty-two boys and thirty-five girls are educated. Besides these, there
                    are numerous private schools throughout the town. The Lunatic Asylum, situated
                    in the Links, is a plain and commodious edifice. It was erected in 1780, but has
                    since then been considerably enlarged, and is now capable of containing eighty
                    patients. It is considered as being one of the best institutions of the kind in
                    Scotland. A portion of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193824916"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-4916-0439"/>building has hitherto been used as an infirmary
                    and dispensary; but the managers are now (1837) preparing to erect a separate
                    building for these purposes. In 1833 a commodious new jail was erected.</p>
                <p>There are in the town two libraries, one of which was established in 1785, on a
                    liberal plan, and now contains about 7000 volumes. The other, called the
                    Montrose Reading Society, possesses about 2200 volumes, and is supported chiefly
                    by the working classes. The two parish churches have likewise libraries attached
                    to them. A newspaper Was established in 1811, named the Montrose, Arbroath, and
                    Brechin Review, which is published every Friday morning; and another, in 1837,
                    called the Montrose Standard, every Thursday. There are here numerous
                    associations for the encouragement of commerce, literature, and science, as well
                    as for benevolent and charitable purposes.</p>
                <p>It has already been stated that the town is bounded on the west by the Basin.
                    This is an extensive level, over which the waters of the ocean, flowing up the
                    South Esk, spread at flood, but which again becomes dry with the ebbing of the
                    tide. During high water it presents the appearance of a vast lake, being about
                    seven miles in circumference, and not only adds greatly to the beauty of the
                    scenery, but is highly advantageous in a commercial point of view, as it affords
                    sufficient depth of water in the channel of the river for allowing small vessels
                    to be navigated to the distance of three miles above the harbour; whilst the
                    vast quantity of water by which it is filled, running back to the ocean with a
                    strong current at the ebbing of the tide, prevents the formation of a bar at the
                    mouth of the river, and thereby renders the harbour at all times accessible to
                    large vessels. The harbour iscommodious, and the entrance to it is easy, except
                    during easterly winds, the average depth on the bar at low water of spring tides
                    being eighteen feet. Two light-houses, with fixed lights, were erected on the
                    north side of the river in 1818, by which vessels are now enabled to take the
                    harbour with safety in the darkest nights. The lights are seen in clear weather
                    at the distance of eight miles. Accommodation for shipping, to the extent of
                    about 6000 tons, is about to be provided, by means of a wet dock on the north
                    side of the river, which will greatly promote the commercial prosperity of the
                    port.</p>
                <p>The great northern turnpike crosses the South Esk by meansof two bridges; one of
                    stone, with a revolving drawbridge in the centre, to allow vessels to pass up
                    and down the Basin, on the south side of the small island of Inchbrayock; the
                    other a magnificent suspension bridge, from Inchbrayock to the north side of the
                    river. The foundation-stone of this bridge was laid on the 18th of September
                    1828. It was designed by Captain Brown, the patentee, and finished ata cost of
                    about L.20,000. The distance between the towers at the two extremities of the
                    bridge, measuring from the centre of each, is 432 feet. There are four main
                    chains, supported by two stone towers, seventy-one feet in height; these form
                    the grand entrance to the bridge on each side, through an archway sixteen feet
                    wide by eighteen feet high. The four counter-abutments for securing the backstay
                    chains are 115 feet distant from the tower, reckoning from the centre of the
                    tower to the face <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the farthest wall of the chambers,
                    and consist each of an arched chamber, a strong counterfort or abutment, a
                    tunnel, and lying spandrel arch. From these main chains the platform is
                    suspended; this forms a roadway twenty-six feet in breadth, constructed upon
                    iron beams, to which the planking of platform is bolted. It is about to be
                    strengthened by an additional backstay chain. To prevent the hollow sound
                    arising from the tread of horses on the wooden platform or roadway, a
                    composition of coal, tar, pitch, and broken metal, is laid over the planking,
                    which, besides preserving it, is impervious to water. There is a pontage levied
                    at the bridge, which yields about L.1300 a year.</p>
                <p>Montrose is a town possessed of considerable commerce. It is a port of the
                    customhouse, and, as such, includes the havens and creeks from Bervie Brow to
                    the Tay. The gross receipts for the year ending 5th January 1835 amounted to
                    L.7369. 2s. 9d.; for the year ending same date 1836, to L.6827.3s. 2d. Nett
                    receipts, after deducting all expenses, for 1835, L.2135. 9s. 6d.; for 1836,
                    L.1672. 7s. 8d. The vessels belonging to the portamounted, in 1837, to 105,
                    registering about 11,050 tons. A great proportion of these are engaged in the
                    importation of flax from the different ports on the Baltic. A number are also
                    employed in bringing coals from Newcastle and Sunderland for the use of the town
                    and neighbourhood; and there are two large vessels engaged in the whale-fishery.
                    A very large steam-vessel, and two regular traders, are now employed in the
                    London trade. The exportation of cured herrings and salmon is considerable.
                    Ship-building is carried on to a considerable extent; and there is a commodious
                    patent slip for repairing ships. The principal business of the town consists in
                    making sail-cloth, sheeting, and linen; and there are now several extensive flax
                    spinning-mills connected with this trade, besides two rope and sail
                    manufactories.</p>
                <p>There are here very extensive links or downs between the town and the sea, which
                    afford one of the best golfing grounds in Scotland, a game practised by all
                    ranks. The race-ground on the links is admirably fitted for the purpose, but for
                    several years it has not been used.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Montrose have availed themselves of the general police act for
                    burghs, passed a few years ago; and the town is now properly protected by an
                    efficient body of police. Very great improvements have also been made in the
                    paving and cleaning of the streets. The town is well lighted with gas, and
                    abundantly supplied with water conducted by pipes from a distance of three
                    miles.</p>
                <p>Montrose unites with Forfar, Brcchin, Arbroath, and Bervie, in sending a member
                    to parliament. The number of voters in the parliamentary burgh is about 400. In
                    September 1836, the burgh funds were estimated at L.54,344. 2s. 7d. and the
                    debts and obligations at L.29,609. 11s., leaving a balance in favour of the town
                    of L.24,734.1 Is. 7d. The revenue of the tow n, arising from land, feu-duties,
                    and shore-dues, is nearly L.3000 a year.</p>
                <p>The population of the town in 1811 amounted to 8955; in 1821, to 10,338; and in
                    1831, to 12,055. The number of inhabited houses in the latter year was 1190. The
                    population is now (1837) estimated at 15,000.</p>
