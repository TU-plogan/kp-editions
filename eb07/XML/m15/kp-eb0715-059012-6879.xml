                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">MULL</label>, an island of the Hebrides, the third in size,
                    belonging to Argyleshire, and separated from the mainland by the narrow gut of
                    sea called the Sound of Mull. It is situated in longitude 5. 18. west, and
                    latitude 56. 27. north. Its figure is very irregular, being deeply indented by
                    arms of the sea. Its extreme length is about thirty miles, and its greatest
                    breadth twenty-five. The superficial area is estimated at 425 square miles. The
                    climate is humid, and heavy falls of rain are frequent from the west, being
                    probably caused by the high hills which form the mountainous tract in the
                    district of Torosay; and, on the whole, this island is considered as the most
                    boisterous of all the Hebrides. Winter, however, is much milder than on the
                    mainland; less snow falls, and the frost is of short continuance. There are on
                    the island several lakes, from which the brooks mostly descend. The island is
                    for the most part rugged and mountainous, rising to upwards of 2000 feet in
                    height; and almost every part of its shore is rocky and precipitous, exhibiting
                    scenery which awes by its natural “rudeness, as well as deep recesses and
                    shrubby ravines, which delight the mind with their fairy beauty. Benmore,
                    situated near the head of Loch-na-Keal, is the highest mountain, and is elevated
                    3097 feet above the level of the sea; it commands a view of nearly all the
                    Hebrides, and its ascent is neither very difficult nor tedious. Bientalindh, the
                    highest hill next to this, is 2294 feet, and also commands an extensive
                    prospect. The island is, with slender exceptions, an entire mass of trap-rock.
                    Limestone is found in the southern cliffs; but on the north-west side, near Inch
                    Kenneth, a green sandstone appears; indeed Inch Kenneth is formed of it. The red
                    granite of Mull is of admirable quality. Ou the northern shore of the Ross, in
                    particular, it is distributed in such a manner, and in masses so large and free
                    from fissures, that it would be easy to extract from it columns of twenty,
                    thirty, forty, and even fifty feet or upwards.</p>
                <p>Coal has been wrought in several parts of the island, but without a successful
                    result. There are many caves in the island, but those on the western coast, in
                    the district of Gribon, are the most remarkable. They are called Mackinnon’s
                    Cave and the Ladder Cave. The soil of Mull is both deep and fertile. The island
                    is very bare of trees, although at one time it was celebrated for its woods. The
                    uncommon moisture and ready drainage of the island are conducive to the
                    production of verdure in places which might otherwise be covered with useless
                    bog and heath. The land is therefore well fitted for grazing; and the
                    proprietors and tenants having turned their attention to that object, have
                    materially improved the breed of black cattle, and considerably increased their
                    number. The Tweeddale breed of sheep has been substituted for the ancient
                    Highland one. A few of the Cheviot race are also to be found in the low farms,
                    but the boisterous climate has prevented their general adoption. The breed of
                    horses is peculiar to the island, and they have been long noted for hardiness.
                    They are now greatly reduced, in consequence of the allotment of farms, the
                    introduction of green crops, and improvements in farming. A few are still
                    exported to the Irish market. Mull, in consequence of the action of the sea, is
                    not very productive of kelp, yet about 600 tons are manufactured annually. The
                    inhabitants are naturally <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826892"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-6892-0591"/>indolent: they follow no branch of industry;
                    rearing cattle, agriculture, fishing, and making kelp, being their only
                    employments.</p>
                <p>The antiquities of Mull are uninteresting. There are a few Danish remains, and
                    ruins of some of the ancient strongholds. The most striking of these is Castle
                    Duart, placed at the entrance of the Sound of Mull. At Balphe-trish is the
                    famous ringing stone. Mull is divided into the three parochial districts of
                    Kilfini <hi rend="subscript"> c</hi> hen, Kilninian, and Torosay, which also
                    comprehends several of the adjacent islets within its pastoral cure. There are
                    several villages in the island, but the only one of note is Tobermory, situated
                    near the head of the Sound. It was built in 1789, by the. Board of Trustees for
                    the^ Encouragement of the Fisheries, and comprises an upper and lower town, the
                    former consisting of very dingy streets; the latter is built in the form of a
                    crescent, and contains the custom-house, an inn, a post office, and from fifty
                    to sixty slated houses. The town has remained almost stationary since it was
                    built, partly in consequence of the peculiar habits of the people, and partly
                    owing to the unfavourable position of the town, and its distance from the
                    fishinggrounds. The number of boats employed at this station in the year ending
                    the 5th of April 1836 was 642, yielding employment, in fishing, gutting, and
                    packing, to 4552 persons. The number of cod, and of ling or hake, brought into
                    this port during that year, amounted to 43,090; of these, 1338 hundredweights
                    were cured; as also 705 barrels of white herrings. The number of men and boats
                    employed do not belong to Tobermory, but come from all quarters at the fishing
                    season. In 1831 the inhabited houses in the island were 1817, and the families
                    2031. The families employed in agriculture were 1297; in trades, 284; not
                    included in either of these classes, 450. The total number of males was 5265,
                    and that of females 5273, making in all 10,538. The actual population of
                    Tobermory amounts to about 1500.</p>
