                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    rend="smallcaps">Maisoor</hi></label>, a large province in the south of India,
                    situated principally between the eleventh and fifteenth degrees of north
                    latitude, and now-surrounded by the British territories subject to the Madras
                    presidency. Its length is estimated at 210 miles, and its average breadth at
                    140. The country consists of a high table land, enclosed between the Eastern and
                    the Western Ghauts, and elevated 3000 feet above the level of the sea, from
                    which rise numerous lofty hills, containing the sources of many rivers, such as
                    the Cavery, Toombuddra, Vedawati, Bhadri, Penar, and others. The elevation of
                    this inland plain varies at different places. The highest mountain of Mysore,
                    namely, Sivagunga, is 4600 feet; at the Pass of Peddanaik Durgum, the height is
                    1907 feet, according to barometrical observations; at Baitamangalum, 2435; at
                    Bangalore, 2807; at Hurrypur, 1831. The heat of the climate is mitigated by the
                    height of the ground, and the climate throughout the whole of this extensive
                    tract is remarkably temperate and healthy. This country has another peculiar
                    advantage, namely, that it is sheltered by the Ghaut Mountains from the violence
                    of the monsoons, which sweep along the lower plains, and deluge with torrents of
                    rain the coasts of Coromandel and Malabar. The clouds which are driven on the
                    land from the Indian Ocean by the south-west monsoon are opposed by the mountain
                    wall of the Western Ghauts; and although the higher and lighter clouds make
                    their way into the plains, and occasion frequent, and sometimes heavy showers,
                    which refresh the air and the ground, yet they are seldom of long continuance.
                    Occasional showers, however, fall at other seasons, and preserve the verdure of
                    the fields throughout the year.</p>
                <p>Thê country of Mysore, from its elevation and its temperate climate, not only
                    produces all the other grains and vegetables of other parts of India, but also
                    many of the fruits of Europe. ' It appears to have been formerly in a much
                    higher state of cultivation than at present; but has been <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193827750" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7750-0657"/>ruined partly by the invasion
                    of armies, partly by the rigorous administration of Hyder, and still more by
                    that of his son Tippoo. It is now rapidly recovering from its depopulation,
                    under the sway of the British. Rice is cultivated on the higher and lower
                    grounds; and the cultivation is much aided by means of reservoirs and wells,
                    whence the farmers irrigate their fields and gardens. The soil also produces the
                    sugar-cane, for which the black clayey lands are best adapted. The crop of
                    raggy, a species of coarse grain which supplies all the lower classes with their
                    common food, is the most important of any raised on the dry field. Wheat is
                    cultivated in gardens, or in the rich soil of the beds of the tanks, which have
                    been exhausted for-the purposes of irrigation. It is only a small quantity,
                    however, that is raised. The palma christi is found here, and produces abundance
                    of castor oil, which is used for the lamp and a variety of other purposes. The
                    betel-leaf tree thrives on the low grounds, where it can obtain a supply of
                    water; and the poppy is cultivated, both for making opium and on account of the
                    seed, which is much used in the sweet cakes that are eaten by the higher ranks
                    of the natives. The cocoa-nut palm begins to produce in this province when it is
                    seven or eight years old. Agriculture is here in a very backward state, and the
                    implements used are very imperfect. The plough has neither coulter nor
                    mould-board to divide and turn over the soil, and it seldom penetrates more than
                    three inches deep. The fields are in consequence very imperfectly cleared; and,
                    after six or eight ploughings in all directions, numerous small bushes remain as
                    erect as before the labour commenced. Considerable attention is however paid to
                    the manuring of the soil; every farmer collecting a heap from the dung and
                    litter of his cattle, intermixed with the ashes and soil of their houses. The
                    cattle reared are cows, buffaloes, sheep, and the long-legged goat; the native
                    breed of horses here, as in most parts of India, is a small, ill-shaped, vicious
                    pony. Above the Ghauts, asses are much used as beasts of burden. The breed is
                    small, and no pains are taken to improve it. Swine were formerly very common in
                    Mysore, but they were banished by Tippoo from the vicinity of the capital. There
                    are three varieties of sheep, red, white, and black. Common salt is fo*und in
                    abundance in many places, and effervesces on the surface during the dry season.
                    Carbonate of soda is also found amongst the Chitteldroog Hills, mixed with
                    common salt. Iron-ore abounds in different parts, though it is worked in a very
                    slovenly manner. At the iron works near Chinnara-yana Durga, the smelters
                    procure from the one about forty-seven per cent, of malleable iron, which is
                    however very impure. The principal rivers are the Cavery, the Toombuddra,
                    theVedawati, theBhadri, the Arkanati, the Penar, Palar, and Panaur. These rivers
                    are, however, all inconsiderable, with the exception of the Cavery, as long as
                    they continue within the limits of this province. There are many large tanks and
                    reservoirs in the higher grounds throughout Mysore, but there are no lakes. The
                    water in these tanks is always sweet, and preferred on this account to that of
                    wells, which is very frequently brackish. This province is divided into three
                    districts, namely, the Patana (or Seringapatam), the Nagara (or Bednore), and
                    the Chatracal (or Chitteldroog) districts. The chief towns are, Seringapatam,
                    Bangalore, Bednore, Chitteldroog, and Sera. Each district is managed by an
                    amildar, who is an officer of justice, police, and revenue, and who is
                    accountable for his conduct to the ministers of the rajah, the latter being kept
                    to their duty by the presence of the British resident. These amildars have under
                    them a number of accountants, in order to manage with accuracy the revenue
                    accounts.</p>
                <p>The present rajah of Mysore, who was raised to the throne after the fall of
                    Tippoo, is the descendant of a pastoral chief, who emigrated, with his tribe and
                    all their flocks and herds, from the province of Gujerat, and were allowed to
                    settle in Mysore. Cham Raj, the representative of this family, took possession
                    of the throne in the year 1507, though he still acknowledged himself the subject
                    of the Maha rajah of Annagoondy, who was a descendant of the ancient Hindu
                    monarchs of Bijanagur. In 1610, one of his successors took possession of the
                    city and fortress of Seringapatam, which may be considered as the beginning of
                    their sovereignty. The crown continued in the same line till about the year
                    1753, when the decline of this dynasty was followed by its final downfall, and
                    the rise on its ruins of the house of Hyder, of which, and of the subsequent
                    history of Mysore, a full account will be found under the article <hi
