                <p><label type="entry">MICHIGAN</label>, one of the United States of North America,
                    which, until 1835, was denominated a territory. It is situated between 41. 38.
                    58. and 46. 50. of north latitude, and 82. 15. and 87. 10. of west longitude,
                    being bounded on the north by the Straits of Michilimackinac, on the south by
                    Ohio and Indiana, on the west by Lake Michigan, and on the east by Lakes Huron,
                    St Clair, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819300" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9300-0007"
                    />Erie, and their waters. It may be described generally as 'a large peninsula,
                    somewhat resembling a triangle, with its base resting upon the states of Ohio
                    and Indiana. It is two hundred and fifty miles in length from north to south,
                    from one hundred and eighty to two hundred miles in breadth from east to west,
                    and comprehends a superficies of about 36,000 square miles. The surface of this
                    state is generally level, or gently undulating, there being no mountains, nor
                    even elevations, with the exception of a strip of table-land, stretching north
                    and south, and assuming towards the north the character of a ridge, but at the
                    highest it is only three hundred feet above the level of the lakes.
                    Notwithstanding the almost uniform flatness of the country, there is
                    comparatively little swampy or wet land; at any rate, not so much as is found on
                    the northern belt of the state of Ohio adjoining the lakes. The soil is a bed of
                    alluvial earth from thirty to one hundred and fifty feet deep, resting upon
                    limestone and argillaceous sandstone. Ferriferous sand rock, saliferous rock,
                    and millstone grit, are found alternating on the surface, at various points in
                    the middle and western parts of the peninsula. The general level of the
                    interior, towards the sources of the rivers, is interspersed with lakes and
                    morasses; and a considerable belt of land along the southern shore of Lake
                    Michigan is sandy and sterile, being exposed to the bleak and desolating gales
                    of the lake. But a great proportion of the land is fertile, and well adapted to
                    the purposes of agriculture. The country generally is divided into nearly equal
                    proportions of grass prairies, distinguished, according to their prevailing
                    character, by the names of wet and dry; and broad and deep forests of trees,
                    nearly similar to those of Kentucky, namely, black walnut, black cherry, honey
                    locust, buck-eye, pawpaw <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>, sugar-tree, mulberry,
                    elm, ash, hawthorn, coffee-tree, and the grand yellow poplar, which indicates
                    the richest soil. South of a line drawn due west from the southern extremity of
                    Lake Huron, Michigan consists of open land, known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Oak Plains.</hi> The soil is a loam, with varying proportions of
                    clay. It becomes fertile by cultivation, and is good farm land. In the country
                    bordering on the Kalemagoo and St Joseph Rivers, prairies of a black, rich,
                    alluvial soil, and unusual productiveness, frequently occur. The northern part
                    of the peninsula is less known, being occupied by Indians; but the land there is
                    in many parts more elevated than that farther south, and is covered with the
                    trees usually met with in those latitudes. Amongst the minerals found in this
                    state may be mentioned bog iron ore, lead ore, gypsum, and bituminous coal, but
                    none of them are present in great quantities. Peat is abundant in many parts.
                    There is a plentiful supply of water everywhere; rivers with their tributaries,
                    and small lakes and springs, being unusually numerous. The principal stream is
                    Grand River, which flows into Lake Michigan. It rises in the south-east angle of
                    the state, and interlocks at its sources, or in its course, with the waters of
                    the Raisin (which derives its name from the number of vine-trees on its banks),
                    the Black, the Mastigon, and the Saganum. Small boats reach its source, and, by
                    means of this river and that of the Huron, periogues pass from Lake Michigan to
                    Lake Erie. The St Joseph is a considerable stream, falling also into Lake
                    Michigan; as do the Kikal-amezo, Barbue, Beauvaise, St Nicholas, Marguettes, and
                    other rivers. On the other side of the peninsula are the Detroit, which is
                    twenty-five miles in length, and above a mile in average breadth; the St Clair,
                    which is forty miles in length and half a mile in average breadth; the St
                    Mary’s, which is fifty miles in length and three quarters of a mile in average
                    breadth; and the Huron, Thunder, and Sagana, which are considerable rivers.
                    Other streams there are in abundance, but not of such magnitude as to merit
                    particular attention.</p>
                <p>The peninsula of Michigan being surrounded upon all sides, excepting the southern
                    extremity, with water, the various lakes and straits require to be described.
                    That lake which bears the name of the state is one of the five great lakes in
                    the northern part of the United States. It is nearly three hundred miles in
                    length, about sixty miles in breadth, and has an average depth of about nine
                    hundred feet. The waters are clear and wholesome, and contain many kinds of
                    fish. In the north-west part there are two large bays, called Noquet’s and
                    Green; and on the east side there are also two, called Sable and Grand Traverse.
                    Lake Michigan is connected with Lake Huron by the Straits of Michilimackinac, a
                    channel forty miles in length from east to west, and four miles in breadth at
                    the narrowest part. Lake Hurpn is two hundred and eighty miles in length, about
                    ninety miles in breadth, and has a medium depth of nine hundred feet. There are
                    two large bays on this lake called Thunder and Sagana, the latter of which is
                    about forty miles in length, by from eight to twelve in breadth. Lake Huron is
                    connected with Lake St Clair by a strait of the same name, twenty-six miles in
                    length, and having deep groves of beautiful white pine, all along its banks.
                    Lake St Clair is only twenty-four miles in length by forty in breadth, and about
                    twenty feet in depth. It is connected with Lake Erie by the Strait of Detroit,
                    which is twenty-four miles in length, narrow, and studded with islands, but
                    navigable by large vessels. A rise and fall of water has been observed in some
                    of these inland seas, particularly at certain points of Lakes Michigan and
                    Huron; but the experiments instituted have failed to determine whether these are
                    to be regarded as tides corresponding with the flux and reflux of the ocean. In
                    the interior of this state there are great numbers of small lakes and ponds,
                    from which the rivers chiefly derive their origin.</p>
                <p>In consequence of the level nature of this region, and from its being nearly
                    surrounded by a belt of noble lakes, the climate is milder and more temperate
                    than might have been expected from its latitude. The southern parts are, of
                    course, more so than the northern, which is subjected to a Canadian temperature.
                    The transition from the cold of spring to the heat of summer is rapid; but the
                    change from summer to w⅛ter proceeds by slow degrees. .As generally
                    characterising the climate, the spring may be termed wet and backward, with an
                    average temperature of 50° of Fahrenheit; the summer dry, with a temperature of
                    80°; the autumn mild, with a temperature of from 60° to 65°; and the winter dry
                    but cold, the temperature being only from 20° to 25° upon an average. The winter
                    commences early in November, and does not terminate until the end of March. The
                    climate throughout the whole state is considered as healthy. From the general
                    fertility of the soil, the productions, as well natural as cultivated, are
                    numerous. The wild rice or wild oats, which covers the marshes near the margins
                    of the lakes and rivers, is a valuable grain of the former class. The great
                    varieties of forest trees we have already noticed. Wheat, Indian corn, oats,
                    barley, buck-wheat, potatoes, turnips, peas, apples, pears, plums, cherries, and
                    peaches, are raised easily and in abundance; and no part of the United States is
                    more abundantly supplied with fish, aquatic game, and wild fowls. The country is
                    favourable to cultivated grasses, more so than the territory to the westward;
                    and in all respects it is well adapted to farming operations. Possessing
                    admirable facilities for commerce, Michigan enjoys considerable trade. A number
                    of steam-boats are continually plying upon the lakes, bays, and rivers, by far
                    the largest proportion of which belong to Detroit, the capital. No inland
                    country, considering its comparatively recent settlement, possesses a greater
                    trade. The value of the imports for the year ending 30th September 1833 was
                    63,876 dollars, and the value of the exports for the same year was 9054 dollars;
                    the whole consisting of domestic produce.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819313" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9313-0008"/>
                <p>Detroit is the political capital, and the only place of any size in the state. It
                    is situated upon the western bank of the river of the same name, eighteen miles
                    from Lake Erie, and seven from Lake St Clair. It was settled as early as 1683 by
                    the French from Canada, who penetrated these inland districts for the purpose
                    -of prosecuting the fur trade. Its site is an elevation of between twenty and
                    thirty feet above the level of the river, and the plain upon which it stands is
                    adorned with beautiful and romantic scenery. The plan of the town upon the
                    river, and for twelve hundred feet backwards, is rectangular; behind this it is
                    triangular. The stre⅛ts are wide and airy, three of them running parallel to the
                    river; and these again are crossed at right angles by six other streets. It
                    contains above four hundred houses, some of which are built of stone. The public
                    edifices are, a council-house, statehouse, United States store, a Presbyterian
                    church, a Roman Catholic chapel, and other buildings. Three roads, constructed
                    by the general government, terminate in the centre of this town; the Chicago,
                    leading to Illinois; the Sigana, leading to the head of Sigana Bay; and the fort
                    Gratiot, to the foot of Lake Huron. A United States road, leading from Detroit
                    to Ohio, has also been completed. Several wharfs project into the river, one of
                    which is 140 feet long; and vessels of 400 tons burden can load and unload at
                    its head. The population of this place in 1830 amounted to 2222, but it has
                    since been greatly augmented. A strong and increasing tide of immigration has
                    set in; and as its situation is favourable for a very extensive inland commerce,
                    it must rapidly rise into a town of considerable importance. Hitherto its
                    prosperity has depended principally on the precarious support afforded by the
                    fur trade, the disbursement of public monies whilst it was a military post, and
                    the liberal appropriations of government for public objects. But the settlement
                    and cultivation of the surrounding country has advanced considerably, and the
                    impulse and vitality which this has imparted to trade is already great. In 1834
                    it possessed thirteen steam-boats, one brig, thirty-three schooners, and
                    thirty-five sloops, being an aggregate tonnage of four thousand nine hundred and
                    thirteen. A considerable number of these vessels trade between Detroit and Ohio;
                    others go regularly to Buffalo and other places. All along the banks of the
                    Detroit River are numerous mansions, chiefly built by the French. They are
                    embosomed in ancient and rich orchards, all having an appearance of comfort, and
                    some of splendour and opulence.</p>
                <p>Mackinac, or Michilimackinac, is a post-town and also a military post in this
                    state. It is situated on an island of the same name, about nine miles in
                    circumference, lying in the strait which connects Lakes Huron and Michigan. The
                    town stands on the south-east side of the island, on a small cove, which is
                    surrounded by a steep cliff one hundred and fifty feet in height. It consists of
                    two streets running parallel with the lake, intersected by others at right
                    angles, and contains a court-house, a jail, and several stores. It is much
                    resorted to by fur traders, and during the summer months is visited by thousands
                    of Indians on their way to Drummond’s Island. On a cliff above the town is the
                    fort, which is remarkably strong, indeed almost impregnable. The population of
                    the island may be about 1000. There are a number of other islands in Lake
                    Michigan, the largest of which, called Manitou, is six miles in length and four
                    in breadth. Fort Gratiot is a military post on St Clair River, and defends the
                    entrance into Lake Huron. The Sault de St Marie is of importance as a military
                    and trading post, being at the head of ship navigation on the great lakes, and
                    the grand thoroughfare of Indian communication for the upper countries as far as
                    the arctic circle, ail the fur trade of the north-west necessarily passing
                    through it. The government of the United States resölved to occupy this post,
                    and in June 1820 obtained from the Chippewayan Indians the cession of a tract of
                    land four miles square, commencing at the Sault, and extending two miles up and
                    the same distance down, with a depth of four miles. Michigan being now one of
                    the principal points of immigration, a correct statement of the number of
                    inhabitants is not to be expected.</p>

                </table>
                <p>The population, as shown in the above table, is 85,856, and it is given according
                    to the census taken near the end of the year 1834. The number of counties at the
                    commencement of the year 1836 was 36; and the population in July 1836 was
                    supposed to amount to 120,000. The Indians who reside in this state are chiefly
                    the Otta was, Miamies, Pottawattomies, Chippeways, and Wyandots. By ’different
                    treaties they have ceded the greater part of their native soil to the United
                    States; but they still retain some fine tracts of country, and have ‘many
                    reservations and villages even amongst the settlements. The Otta was and
                    Chippewayâ are hunters and trappers. The former are the most agricultural in
                    their habits; and a band of this tribe have a flourishing settlement at L’Arbre
                    Croche, on the western coast of Lake Huron. Some of the Indians have made mo
                    inconsiderable advances in cultivation and the arts of civilized life. Most of
                    the converts to Christianity are Roman Catholics; but the Protestants have
                    within these few years established missionary stations and schools amongst them.
                    Their numbers are gradually diminishing, and the whole may not exceed 8000. The
                    borders of St Clair River and Lake, Rivers Detroit, Raisin, Clinton, and
                    Plaisance Bay at the mouth of the Raisin, are settled by French inhabitants.
                    They occupy a belt of land upon the borders of these streams, three miles broad.
                    They are civil, honest, unobtrusive, and industrious, with little education, and
                    essentially deficient in enterprise.</p>
                <p>This state began to be regularly settled about the beginning of the last century.
                    Under the French the government was arbitrary, uniting the civil and military
                    authority in the power of a “commandant.” In the year 1763 it passed into the
                    hands of the British, along with other possessions in this quarter, which had
                    been wrested from the crown of France. By the treaty of Paris of 1783, the
                    country was transferred to the United States; and although the British
                    government held possession of the military posts until 1796, it ceased to
                    exercise criminal jurisdiction over it from that period. Subsequently it was <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193819326" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9326-0009"/> erected into a
                    district territorial government. Upon the breaking out of the last war with
                    America, this state became the theatre of part of the military operations.
                    Mackinack was captured by the British, and Chicago surrendered to the savages.
                    Soon afterwards the Americans made an inglorious surrender of Detroit, of which
                    Britain held possession for a year. But the disastrous affair on Lake Erie,
                    together with the subsequent defeat of the British on land, changed the current
                    of success, and Michigan was again amalgamated with the United States. For many
                    years it continued to be only what is called a territory, sending a delegate to
                    congress, who was elected biennially, and might debate in the great council of
                    the nation, but could not vote on any question. On the 11th of May 1835 a
                    constitution was formed by a convention which met at Detroit, with a view to the
                    erection of Michigan into a free and independent state. This being submitted to
                    the people for ratification or rejection in the October following, was approved
                    of, and forwarded to congress, which, towards the close of the session of 1836,
                    passed an act admitting Michigan into the Union as a state. The following are
                    some of the principal features of the constitution, taken from the American
                    Almanac for 1836.</p>
                <p>The powers of the government are divided into three distinct departments; the
                    legislative, executive, and judicial. The legislative power is vested in a
                    senate and house of representatives. The representatives are chosen annually,
                    and their number cannot be less than forty-eight, or greater than a hundred. The
                    senators are chosen for two years, one half of them every year, and they consist
                    as nearly as possible of one third of the number of the representatives. An
                    enumeration of the inhabitants is to be made in 1837 and 1845, and every ten
                    years after the latter period; and after every enumeration so made, and also
                    after each enumeration made by order of the United States, the number of
                    senators and representatives is to be apportioned anew amongst the several
                    counties, according to the number of white inhabitants. The legislature meets on
                    the first Monday in January every year. The executive power is vested in a
                    governor, who holds his office during two years, and a lieutenant-governor, who
                    holds his office for the same period. The governor, lieutenant-governor, and
                    members of the legislature, are chosen at the same time.</p>
                <p>The judicial power is vested in one supreme court, and in such other courts as
                    the legislature may from time to time establish. The judges of the supreme court
                    are appointed by the governor, with the advice and consent of the senate, for
                    the term of seven years. Judges of all county courts, associate judges of
                    circuit courts, and judges of probate, are elected by the people, for the term
                    of fourteen years. Each township is authorized to elect four justices of the
                    peace, who hold their offices for four years.</p>
                <p>In all elections every white male citizen above the age of twenty-one years,
                    having resided six months immediately preceding any election, is entitled to
                    vote at such election. Slavery, lotteries, and the sale of lottery tickets, are
                    prohibited. The seat of government is at Detroit, or such other place or places
                    as may be prescribed by law, until the year 1847, when it is to be permanently
                    fixed by the legislature. The governor has power to nominate, with the advice
                    and consent of the legislature, a superintendent of public instruction, who
                    shall hold his office for two years, and whose duties are prescribed by law. The
                    legislature is required to encourage, by all suitable means, the promotion of
                    intellectual, scientific, and agricultural improvement. The proceeds of all
                    lands which have been or may be granted by the Union to this state for the
                    support of schools, and which shall hereafter be sold or disposed of, are to
                    remain a perpetual fund, the interest of which, together with the rent of all
                    such unsold lands, is to be inviolably appropriated to the support of schools
                    throughout this state. The legislature is to provide for a system of common
                    schools, by which a school may be kept up and supported in each district at
                    least three months in the year; and any district neglecting to keep and support
                    such a school may be deprived of its equal proportion of the interest of the
                    public fund.</p>
                <p>Besides the state of Michigan, there is a tract of country lying to the westward
                    of Lake Michigan, which goes by the same name, and is attached to the state
                    without being included in it. This region is bounded on the east by Lake
                    Michigan, on the north by Lake Superior and the chain of small lakes connecting
                    that inland sea with the heads of the Mississippi, and on the west and
                    north-west by the Upper Mississippi. It has not been thoroughly explored; but,
                    judging of the whole from those portions which have been examined, it is likely
                    to become of great interest and importance as its natural resources are
                    developed. The district included between the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers is
                    particularly inviting. The soil is a rich black alluvial mould, irrigated by
                    innumerable streams of water, unbroken by mountain ridges, and in all respects
                    admirably adapted for agriculture. From its northern boundary south to the
                    Milwalky and the heads of Rock River, it is covered with a dense forest, which,
                    as traced farther down to the southern head of Lake Michigan, opens into fertile
                    and extensive prairies. It has been remarked as a geological characteristic,
                    that the pebbles which are usually found upon the surface of these prairies, and
                    to a depth of two or three feet downwards, are entirely wanting. Clay
                    constitutes the succeeding stratum. More than 36,000,000 pounds of lead were
                    yielded by the mining district in this region from the autumn of 1824 to that of
                    1829. Strong indications of the presence of copper appear on the southern shore
                    of Lake Superior. By the treaty of Prairie du Chien, which was entered into in
                    1829, the <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> United States purchased from several
                    Indian tribes a tract of about six millions of acres of land, of which between
                    two and three millions are supposed to be within the limits of the territory.
                    About one hundred and thirty-two thousand acres in the vicinity of Green Bay
                    have likewise been ceded. The former cession comprehends nearly all the mining
                    district of the Upper Mississippi, and is occupied by various Indian tribes. The
                    white population, which is confined chiefly to Green Bay, is estimated at six
                    thousand. Military posts are established at Green Bay, Prairie du Chien, Fort
                    Snelling on the river St Peters, and Fort Winnebago at the portage of the Fox
                    and Wisconsin Rivers. Settlements more or less extensive have been formed at
                    Green Bay, Pembino on Red River, Lake Winnepeg, Prairie du Chien, the
                    Mississippi, and the lead mine bordering on the latter river and the Wiscousin.
