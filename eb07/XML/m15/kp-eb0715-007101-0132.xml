                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">MILK</label>, a well-known fluid, prepared by nature in the
                    breasts of women, and the udders of other animals, for the nourishment of their
                    young.</p>
                <p>According to Dr Cullen, milk is a connecting and intermediate substance between
                    animals and vegetables. It seems to be immediately secreted from the chyle, both
                    being a white liquor of the same consistence; it is most copiously secreted
                    after meals, and is of an acescent nature. In most animals which live on
                    vegetables the milk is acescent; and it is uncertain whether it is not so
                    likewise in carnivorous animals. __ But, whatever there be in this, it is <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193820145" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0145-0072"/> certain that the
                    milk of all animals which live on vegetables is acescent. Milk being derived
                    from the chyle, we thence infer its vegetable nature; for in those who live on
                    both promiscuously, a greater quantity of milk is obtained, and more quickly,
                    from the vegetable than from the animal food. Milk, however, is not purely
                    vegetable, though we have a vegetable liquor which resembles it in taste,
                    consistence, colour, acescency, and the separability of the oily part, viz. an
                    emulsion of the <hi rend="italic">nuces</hi><hi rend="italic">oleosae</hi> and
                    farinaceous substances. But these want the coagulable part of milk, which seems
                    to be of an animal nature, approaching to that of the coagulable lymph of the
                    blood. Milk, then, appears to be of an intermediate nature between chyle taken
                    up from the intestines and the fully elaborated animal fluid.</p>
                <p>Its contents are of three kinds. First, there is an oily part, which, whatever
                    may be said concerning the origin of other oils in the body, is certainly
                    immediately derived from the oil of the vegetables taken into the stomach; for
                    with these it agrees very exactly in its nature, and would do so entirely, if we
                    could separate it fully from the coagulable part. Another mark of their
                    agreement is the separability, which proves that the mixture has been lately
                    attempted, but not fully performed. Secondly, besides this oily, there is a
                    proper coagulable part. And, thirdly, much water accompanies both, in which
                    there is dissolved a salino-saccharine substance. These three can be got
                    separate in cheese, butter, and whey; but never perfectly so, a part of each
                    being always blended with every other part.</p>
                <p>Nothing is more common, from what has been said of its immediate nature, than to
                    suppose that it requires no assimilation; and hence has been deduced the reason
                    of its exhibition in the most weakly state of the human body. But wherever we
                    can examine milk, we always find that it coagulates, suffers a decomposition,
                    and becomes acescent. Again, infants, who feed entirely on milk, are always
                    troubled with cructations, which every body observes are not of the same quality
                    with the food taken; and therefore it appears, that, like all other food, milk
                    turns naturally acescent in the stomach, and only enters the chyle and blood in
                    consequence of a new recomposition. It approaches then to the nature of
                    vegetable aliment, but is not capable of its noxious vinous fermentation, and
                    therefore has an advantage over it. Neither, from this quality, is it like
                    animal food, heating in the stomach, and productive of fever, though at the same
                    time, from its quantity of coagulable matter, it is more nourishing than
                    vegetables.</p>
                <p>Milk is the food most universally suited to all ages and states <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> the body; but it seems chiefly designed by nature as the food of
                    infants. When animals are in the foetal state, their solids are a perfect jelly,
                    incapable of an assimilatory power. In such state nature has perfectly
                    assimilated food, as the <hi rend="italic">albumen οvi</hi> in the oviparous,
                    and in the viviparous animals certainly somewhat of the same kind, as it was
                    necessary that the vessels should be filled with such a fluid as would make way
                    for an after assimilation. When the infant has attained a considerable degree of
                    firmness, as when it is separated from the mother, such a degree of weakness
                    still remains as makes somewhat of the same indication necessary; it behoves the
                    infant to have an alkalescent food ready prepared, and, at the same time, its
                    noxious tendency to be avoided. Milk then is given, which is alkalescent, and,
                    at the same time, has a sufficient quantity of acidity to correct the
                    alkalescent quality. As the body advances in growth, and the alkalescent
                    tendency is greater, the animal, to obviate that tendency, is led to take
                    vegetable food, as more suited to its strength of assimilation.</p>
                <p>Dr Cullen observes, that milk is suited to almost all temperaments; and it is so
                    to stomachs disposed to acescency, more than those substances which have
                    undergone the vinous fermentation; nay, it even cures the heartburn, checks
                    vinous fermentation, and precipitates the lees, when, by renewal of
                    fermentation, the wine happens to be fouled. It, therefore, very properly
                    accompanies a great deal of vegetable aliment; although sometimes its acescency
                    is troublesome, either fr.om the large portion taken in, or from the degree of
                    it; for, according to certain unaccountable circumstances, different acids are
                    formed in the stomach in different states of the body, as in a healthy’ body a
                    mild one, and in the hypochondriac disease one of a very acrid quality. When the
                    acidity of milk is carried to a great degree, it may prove remarkably
                    refrigerant, and occasion cold crudities, and the recurrence of intermittent
                    fevers. To take the common notion of its passing unchanged into the blood, it
                    can undergo no solution. But if we admit its coagulum in the stomach, then it
                    may be reckoned amongst soluble or insoluble foods, according as that coagulum
                    is more or less tenacious. Formerly rennet, which is employed to coagulate milk,
                    was thought an acid; but, from late observations, it appears, that, if it be an
                    acid, it is very different from other acids, and that its coagulum is stronger
                    than that produced by acids. It has been imagined that a rennet, which causes
                    coagulation of milk, is to be found in the stomachs of all animals; but
                    according to Dr Cullen, the coagulation of milk seems to be owing to a weak acid
                    in the stomach, the relics <hi rend="italic">of</hi> vegetable food, inducing,
                    in healthy persons, a weak and soluble coagulum; but in different stomachs this
                    may be very different, in some becoming heavy and less soluble food, and may
                    even be evacuated in a coagulated undissolved state both by stomach and
                    stool.</p>
                <p>As milk is acescent, it may be rendered purgative by mixture with the bile. Some
                    examples of this have been remarked. But it is more commonly reckoned amongst
                    those foods which occasion costiveness.</p>
                <p>Hoffman, in his experiments upon milk, ascertained that all kinds of it contained
                    much water; and when this was dissipated, he found the residuums very different
                    in their solubility. But we must not thence conclude, that the same insolubility
                    takes place in the stomach; for extracts made from vegetables with water are
                    often very insoluble substances, and hardly diffusible through water itself. In
                    Hoffman’s extracts of milk, therefore, somewhat of the same kind might have
                    appeared; and these substances, which in their natural state were not so, might
                    appear very insoluble. However, we may allow that milk is always somehow
                    insoluble in the intestines, as it is of a drying nature, and as cheese is very
                    costive. And this effect shows that milk is always coagulated in the stomach;
                    for if it remained fluid, no faeces would be produced, whereas sometimes very
                    hard ones are observed. In the blood-vessels it may, from its animal nature, be
                    considered as nutritious; but when we consider its vegetable contents, and
                    acescency in the <hi rend="italic">prirnae viae,</hi> we find that, like animal
                    food, it does not excite that degree of fever in the time of digestion, and that
                    from its acescency it will resist putrefaction. Hence its use in hectic fevers,
                    which, whatever be their cause, appear only to be exacerbations of natural
                    feverish paroxysms, which occur twice every day, commonly after meals, and at
                    night. To obviate these, therefore, we give such an aliment as produces the
                    least exacerbation of these fevers; and of this nature is milk, on account of
                    its acescent vegetable nature.</p>
                <p>There also appears something peculiar to milk, which requires only a small
                    exertion of the animal powers in order to its assimilation; and besides, in
                    hectic complaints, there is wanted an oily, bland food, approaching to the
                    animal nature; so that upon all these accounts milk is a diet peculiarly adapted
                    to them, and, in general, to most convalescents, and to those of inflammatory
                    temperaments.</p>
                <p>The milks of women, mares, and asses, in a great measure agree in their
                    qualities, being very dilute, having little <pb break="no" facs="nls:193820158"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-0158-0073"/>solid contents, and these, when evaporated to
                    dryness, being very soluble, and containing much saccharine matter of a very
                    ready acescency, and their coagulum being tender and easily broken down. From
                    this view they have less oil, and seem to have less coagulable matter than the
                    rest</p>
                <p>The milks of cows, sheep, and goats, agree in possessing qualities opposite to
                    those just mentioned; but here there is somewhat more of gradation. Cow’s milk
                    comes nearest to the former. Goat’s milk is less fluid, less sweet, less
                    flatulent, and has the largest proportion of insoluble part after coagulation,
                    and indeed the largest proportion of coagulable part; its oily and coagulable
                    parts are not spontaneously separable, and it never throws out a cream, or
                    admits of butter to be readily extracted from it. Hence the virtues <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> these milks are obvious, being more nourishing, though at
                    the same time less easily soluble in weak stomachs, than the three kinds above
                    mentioned, less acescent, and more rarely laxative, and peculiarly fitted for
                    the diet of convalescents without fever. The other kinds again are less
                    nourishing, more soluble, more laxative, from being more acescent, and adapted
                    to convalescents with fever.</p>
                <p>These qualities in particular milks are considerably diversified by different
                    circumstances. First, different animals living on the same diet give a
                    considerably different milk; for there seems to be something in the
                    constitution, abstracting from the aliment, which constitutes a considerable
                    diversity of milk, not only in the same species of animals, but also in the same
                    animal, at different ages, and at different intervals after delivery. This also
                    applies to the choice of nurses. Secondly, milk follows the nature of the
                    aliment more than any other juice in the human body, being more or less fluid
                    and dilute, and more or less solid and nourishing, in proportion as these
                    qualities are more or less in the aliment. The nature of the aliment differs
                    according to its time of growth, old grass being always found more nourishing
                    than young. Aliment, too, is always varied according to the season, as that is
                    warm or dry, moist or cloudy.</p>
                <p>The milk of each particular kind of animal is fitter for particular purposes,
                    when fed on proper food. Thus the cow delights in the succulent herbage of the
                    valley; if the sheep be fed there he certainly rots, but on the higher and more
                    dry side of the mountain he feeds pleasantly and healthily; whilst the goat
                    never stops near the bottom, but ascends to the craggy summit. The milks of
                    these animals, therefore, are always best upon their proper soil; and that of
                    goats is best in a mountainous country. In a dissertation of Linnaeus, we find
                    many observations concerning the diversity of plants on which each animal chuses
                    to feed. All the Swedish plants which could be collected together were presented
                    alternately to domestic animals, and then it appeared that the goat lived on the
                    greatest variety, and even on many which were poisonous to the rest; and that
                    the cow chose the first succulent shoots of the plant, and neglected the
                    fructification, which was preferred by the goat. Hence may be deduced rules
                    concerning the pasturage of different animals. Thus farmers find, that, in a
                    pasture which was only fit to feed a certain number of sheep, an equal number of
                    goats may be introduced, whilst the sheep are no less nourished than before.</p>
                <p>It is not easy to assign the difference between milk fresh drawn and that
                    detained in the open air for some time; but certainly there is some material
                    one, otherwise nature would not have directed infants universally to sucking;
                    and indeed it seems better fitted for digestion and nourishment than the other.
                    Physicians have supposed that this depended on the evaporation of some spirit;
                    but Linnaeus cannot conceive any thing except common water here; and besides,
                    these volatile parts can hardly be nutritious. A more plausible account seems
                    deducible from mixture.</p>
                <p>Milk newly drawn and recently mixed is exposed to spontaneous separation, a
                    circumstance hurtful to digestion; none of the parts being, by themselves, so
                    easily assimilated as when they are all taken together. Hence milk newly drawn
                    is more intimately blended, and therefore is most proper to weak persons and to
                    infants.</p>
                <p>Another difference in the use of milk exposed for some time to the air, is taking
                    it boiled or unboiled. Physicians have generally recommended the former; but the
                    reason is not easily assigned. Perhaps it may be that milk kept for some time
                    exposed to the air has gone so far towards a spontaneous separation; whereas the
                    heat thoroughly blends the whole, and hence its resolution is not so easy in the
                    stomach; and thus boiled milk is more costive than raw, and gives more faeces.
                    Again, when milk is boiled, a considerable quantity of air is detached, as
                    appears from the froth on the surface; and air is the chief instrument of
                    fermentation in bodies; so that after this process it is not liable to
                    acescency. For these reasons it is proper for the robust and vigorous.</p>
                <p>Another difference of milk is, according as it is fluid or coagulated. The
                    coagulated is of two kinds; either as induced by rennet, or occasioned by the
                    natural acescency of the milk. The former preparation makes the firmer and less
                    easily soluble coagulum; but, when taken with the whey nnseparated, it is less
                    difficult of solution, though more so than any other coagulum in the same case.
                    Many nations use the latter form, which is more easily soluble, but very
                    acescent, and therefore, in point of solution, should be confined to the
                    vigorous, or to those who live on alkalescent f bod; in fact, the Laplanders use
                    it as their chief acescent condiment. From the same considerations it is more
                    cooling, and in its other effects it is similar to all other acescent
                    vegetables.</p>
                <p>Milk by evaporation yields a sweet saline matter, of which Dr Lewis gives the
                    following proportions:</p>

                <p>The saline substance extracted from ass’s milk was white, and as sweet as sugar;
                    that of the others was brown or yellow, and considerably less sweet; that from
                    cow’s milk had the least sweetness of any.</p>

                    were obtained. The liquor which afterwards arose was acidulous, and by degrees
                    grew sensibly more and more acid as the distillation was continued. After this
                    came over a little spirit, and at last the empyreumatic oil. The remaining solid
                    matter adhered to the bottom of the retort, in the form of elegant shining black
                    flowers, which being calcined and elixated, yielded a portion <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Milk set in a warm place throws up to the surface an unctuous cream, from which,
                    by agitation, the butter is easily separated. The addition of alkaline salts
                    prevents this separation, not, as some have supposed, by absorbing an acid from
                    the milk, but by virtue of their property of intimately uniting oily bodies with
                    watery substances. Sugar, another intermedium between oils and water, has this
                    effect in a greater degree, though that concrete is by no means alkaline, nor an
                    absorbent of acids.</p>
                <p>The sweet saccharine part of the milk remains dissolved in the whey after the
                    separation of the curd or fromaginous matter, and may be collected from it in a
                    white crystalline<pb break="no" facs="nls:193820171"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-0171-0074"/> form, by boiling the whey till all remains of the
                    curdled substance have fallen to the bottom; then filtering, evaporating it to a
                    due consistence, setting it to shoot, and purifying the crystals by solution in
                    water and a second crystallization. Much has been said of the medicinal virtues
                    of this sugar of milk, but it does not seem to have any that are considerable.
                    It is from cow’s rrμlk that it has been generally prepared; and the crystals
                    obtained from this kind have but little sweetness.</p>
                <p>When milk is suffered to coagulate spontaneously, the whey proves acid, and on
                    standing grows more and more so until the putrefactive state commences. Sour
                    whey is used as an acid, preferable to the directly vegetable or the mineral
                    acids, in some of the chemical arts, as for dissolving iron in order to stain
                    linen and leather. In the bleaching of linen this acid was commonly made use of
                    for dissolving and extracting the earthy particles left in the cloth by the
                    alkaline salts and lime employed for cleansing and whitening it. Butter milk is
                    preferred to plain sour milk or sour whey, being supposed to give the cloth a
                    yellow colour. Dr Home, in his treatise on this subject, recommends water
                    acidulated with sulphuric acid, in the proportion of about half an ounce, or at
                    most three quarters of an ounce, to a gallon, as preferable in many respects to
                    the acid of milk, or that of any directly vegetable substance. He observes, that
                    the latter are often difficult to be procured, abound with oleaginous particles,
                    and hasten to corruption, whilst the vitriolic acid is cheap and pure, without
                    any tendency to pntrify; that milk takes five days to perform its office, whilst
                    the vitriolic acid does it in as many hours, perhaps in as many minutes; and
                    that this acid contributes also to whiten the cloth, and does not make it weaker
                    though the cloth be kept in it for months. He states, that acids, as well as
                    alkalies, extract an oily matter from the cloth, and lose their acidity and
                    alkalicity. Since this treatise appeared, the use of sour milk has been entirely
                    superseded by sulphuric acid.</p>
                <p>It is observable, that ass’s milk has a great tendency, on standing for a little
                    time, to become thick and ropy. In the Breslau collection for the year 1720,
                    there is a remarkable account of milk which had grown so thick and tenacious as
                    to he drawn out into long strings.</p>
                <p>New cow’s milk, suffered to stand for some days on the leaves of butterwort or
                    sun-dew, becomes uniformly thick, slippery, and coherent, and of an agreeable
                    sweet taste, without any separation of its parts. Fresh milk added to this is
                    thickened in the same manner, and this successively. In some parts of Sweden,
                    milk is thus prepared for food.</p>
                <p>New milk has a certain glutinous quality, in consequence of which it is used for
                    joining broken stone ware. There is a far greater tenacity in cheese prope^rly
                    prepared.</p>
                <p>Milk, when examined by a microscope, appears composed of numerous globules
                    swimming in a transparent fluid. It boils in nearly the same degree of heat with
                    common water; some sorts rather sooner, and others a little later. After boiling
                    it has less tendency to become sour than in its natural state. It is coagulated
                    by acids both mineral and vegetable, and by alkalies both fixed and volatile.
                    The coagulum produced by acids falls to the bottom of the serum; that made by
                    alkalies swims on the surface, commonly forming a thick coriaceous skin,
                    especially with volatile alkalies. The serum, with alkalies, proves green or
                    sanious; with acids, it differs little in appearance from the whey which
                    separates spontaneously. The coagulum formed by acids is dissolved by alkalies,
                    and that formed by alkalies is redissolved by acids; but the milk does not in
                    either case resume its original properties. It is coagulated by most of the
                    middle salts, the basis of which is an earth or a metallic body, as solution of
                    alum, fixed sal-ammoniac, sugar of lead, green and blue vitriol; but not by the
                    chalybeate or purging mineral waters, nor by the bit ter salt extracted from the
                    purging waters. Amongst the neutral salts which have been tried, there is not
                    one that produces any coagulation. They all dilute the milk, and make it less
                    disposed to coagulate with acids or alkalies. Nitre seems to have this effect in
                    a greater degree than the other neutral salts. It is instantly coagulated by
                    highly rectified spirit of wine, but scarcely by a phlegmatic spirit. It does
                    not mingle with expressed oils. All the coagula are dissolved by gall.</p>
                <p>It has generally been supposed by medical authors, that the milk of animals is of
                    the same nature with chyle, and that the human milk always coagulates in the
                    stomach of infants; but in a dissertation upon the subject published by Mr
                    Clarke, member of the Royal Irish Academy, we find both these positions
                    controverted. According to him, women’s milk, in a healthy state, contains no
                    coagulable, mucilaginous, or fromaginous principle, in its composition, or it
                    contains so little, that it cannot admit of any sensible proof. Dr Rutty states,
                    that it does not afford even a sixth part of the curd which is yielded by cow’s
                    milk; and Dr Young denies that it is at all coagulable either by rennets or
                    acids. This is confirmed by Dr Ferris, who, in the year 1782, gained the
                    Harveian prize medal by a dissertation upon milk. Mr Clarke informs us, that he
                    made a great number of experiments upon women’s milk, with a view to determine
                    this point. He made use of ardent spirits, all the different acids, infusions of
                    infants’ stomachs, and procured the milk of a great many different women; but in
                    no instance,· excepting one or two, did he perceive any thing like curd. This
                    took place in consequence of a spontaneous acescency; and only a small quantity
                    of soft flaky matter was formed, which floated in the serum. This he looked upon
                    as a morbid appearance.</p>
                <p>The general opinion that women’s milk is coagulable has arisen from the single
                    circumstance that infants frequently vomit the milk which they suck in a state
                    of apparent coagulation. This greatly perplexed Dr Young, who, after having
                    tried in vain to coagulate human milk artificially, concluded that the process
                    took place spontaneously in the stomach; and that it would always do so if the
                    milk were allowed to remain in a degree of heat equal to about 96° of
                    Fahrenheit. Mr Clarke took equal quantities of three different kinds of milk,
                    and put them into bottles slightly corked, and these bottles into water, the
                    temperature of which was kept up by a spirit of wine lamp as near as possible to
                    96° of Fahrenheit; but after frequently examining each bottle during the course
                    of the experiment, at the expiration of several hours there was not the smallest
                    tendency towards coagulation to be perceived in any of them. The cream was only
                    thrown to the surface in a thick and adhesive form, and entirely separated from
                    the fluid below, which had something of a grey and wheyish appearance. As the
                    matter vomited by infants is sometimes more adhesive than we can suppose cream
                    to be, Mr Clarke supposed that the curd might be so entangled with the cream as
                    to be with difficulty separated from it; but having collected a quantity of rich
                    cream from the milk of different women, he repeated the experiment with
                    precisely the same result, not being able in any one instance to produce the
                    smallest quantity of curd. To determine, however, what effects might be produced
                    upon milk by the stomach of an infant, Mr Clarke made the following experiment.
                    Having taken out the stomach of a foetus which had been deprived of life by the
                    use of instruments, he infused it in a small quantity of hot water, so as to
                    make a strong infusion. He added a tea-spoonful of this infusion to equal
                    quantities of cow’s and human milk, the consequence of which was, that the cow’s
                    milk was firmly coagulated in a short time, but the human milk was not altered
                    in the least; neither was the least coagulation produced by adding a second and
                    a third spoonful to the human milk. “Upon.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193820184" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0184-0075"/>
                <p>the whole, then,” says he “I am persuaded it will be found that human milk, in a
                    healthy state, contains little or no curd, and that the general opinion of its
                    nature and properties is founded upon fallacious analogy and superficial
                    observations made on the matter vomited by infants. We may presume, that the
                    cream of women’s milk, by its inferior specific gravity, will swim on the
                    surface of the contents of the stomach; and being of an oily nature, that it
                    will be of more difficult digestion than any other constituent part of milk.
                    When an infant, then, sucks very plentifully, so as to over-distend the stomach,
                    or labours under any weakness in the powers of digestion, it cannot appear
                    unreasonable to suppose that the cream shall be first rejected by vomiting.
                    Analogous to this, we know that adults affected with dyspepsia often bring up
                    greasy fluids from the stomach by cructation, and this especially after eating
                    fat meat. We have, in some instances, known this to blaze, when thrown into the
                    fire, like spirit of wine or oil.” Of this opinion he derives a confirmation
                    from the observation, that curds vomited by infants of a few days old are
                    yellow, whilst in the course of a fortnight or three weeks they become white.
                    This he accounts for from the yellow colour of the cream thrown up by the milk
                    of women during the first four or five days after delivery.</p>
                <p>Mr Clarke likewise controverts the common opinion, that human milk is so prone to
                    acidity that a great number of the diseases of children are to be accounted for
                    from that cause. “Whoever,” says he, “takes the trouble of attentively comparing
                    human milk with that of ruminant animals, will soon find it to be much less
                    prone to run into the acescent or acid process. I have very often exposed equal
                    quantities of human and cow’s milk in degrees of temperature varying from the
                    common summer heat, or 65°, to 100°; and I have constantly found that cow’s milk
                    acquires a greater degree of acidity in thirty-six hours than the human did in
                    many days. Cow’s milk becomes offensively putrid in four or five days; a change
                    which healthy human milk, exposed in the same manner, will not undergo in many
                    weeks, nay, sometimes in many months. I once kept a few ounces of a nurse’s
                    milk, delivered about six or seven days, for more than two years in a bottle
                    moderately corked. It stood on the chimney-piece, and was frequently opened to
                    be examined. At the end of this period, it showed evident. marks of moderate
                    acidity, whether examined by the taste, smell, or paper stained with vegetable
                    blues or purples; the latter it changed to a florid red colour; whereas cow’s
                    milk kept a few days changed the colour of the same paper to a green, thereby
                    clearly showing its putrescent tendency.”</p>
                <p>He next proceeds to consider the probability there is of milk becoming so
                    frequently and strongly acid as to occasion most of the diseases of infants. He
                    begins with an attempt to show that the phenomena commonly regarded as
                    indications of acrimony are by no means certain. Curdled milk has already been
                    shown to be no sign of acidity; and the other appearance, which has commonly
                    been thought to be so certain, namely, green faeces, is, in the opinion of Mr
                    Clarke, equally fallacious. In support of this he quotes a letter from Dr
                    Sydenham to Dr Cole, in which the former says, that the green matter vomited by
                    hysterical women is not any proof of acrid humours being the cause of that
                    disease, for sea-sick people do the same. The opinion that green faeces arc an
                    effect of acidity, proceeds upon the supposition that a mixture of bile with an
                    acid produces a green colour; but it is found that the vegetable acid, which
                    only can exist in the human body, is unable to produce this change of colour,
                    though it can be effected by the strong mineral acids. As nothing equi valent to
                    any of these acids can be supposed to exist in the bowels of infants, we must
                    therefore adopt some other method of accounting for the green faeces frequently
                    evacuated by them. “Why should sour milk, granting its existence, give rise to
                    them in infants, and not in adults? Have butter-milk, summer fruits of the most
                    acescent kind, lemon or orange juice, always this effect in adults by their
                    admixture with bile? This is a question which, I believe, cannot be answered in
                    the affirmative.” *</p>
                <p>Upon the whole, Mr Clarke considers the disease of acidity in the bowels, though
                    so frequently mentioned, as by no means common. He owns, indeed, that it may
                    sometimes occur in infancy as well as in adult age, from weakness of the
                    stomach, costiveness, or improper food; and an indubitable evidence is afforded
                    by faeces which stain the blue or purple colour of vegetables to a red, though
                    nothing can be inferred with certainty from the colour or smell.</p>
                <p>He then proceeds to state several reasons for his opinion, that the greater
                    number of infantile diseases are not owing to acidity. First, women’s milk, in a
                    healthy state, contains little or no coagulable matter or curd. Secondly, it
                    shows less tendency out of the body to become acescent than many other kinds of
                    milk. Thirdly, the appearances which have been generally supposed to
                    characterize its acidity do not afford satisfactory evidence of such a morbid
                    cause. Fourthly, granting this to he the case, we have plenty of mild
                    absorbents, capable of destroying all the acid which can be supposed to be
                    generated in the bowels of an infant; yet many children are observed to die in
                    consequence of these diseases, which are supposed to arise from acidity.
                    Fifthly, though the milk of all ruminant animals is of a much more acescent
                    nature than that of the human species, yet the young of these animals never
                    suffer any thing like the diseases attributed to acidity in infants. Sixthly,
                    history informs us that whole nations use’ sour curdled milk as a considerable
                    part of their food, without feeling any inconvenience; which, however, must have
                    been the case if acidity in the stomach were productive of such deleterious
                    effect as has been supposed. This reasoning appears to be very plausible, and
                    nothing has as yet been offered to contradict it.</p>
                <p>In a memoir by MM. Parmentier and Deyeux, members of the Royal College of
                    Pharmacy in Paris, we have an account of a great number of experiments on the
                    milk of asses, cows, goats, sheep, and mares, as well as women. The experiments
                    on cow’s milk were made with a view to determine whether any change was produced
                    in the milk by the different kinds of food eaten by the animal. For this purpose
                    some were fed with the leaves of maize, others with cabbage, others with small
                    potatoes, and others with common grass. The milk of those fed with the maize was
                    extremely sweet; that from the potatoes and common grass was much more serous
                    and insipid; and that from the cabbages proved the most disagreeable of all. By
                    distillation only eight ounces of a colourless fluid were obtained from as many
                    pounds of each of these milks; that obtained from those which fed upon grass had
                    an aromatic flavour; whilst a disagreeable one resulted from cabbage, and none
                    at all from the potatoes and maize. This liquid became fetid in the space of a
                    month, whatever substance the animal had been fed with, acquiring at the same
                    time a viscidity, and becoming turbid; that from cabbage generally, but not
                    always, becoming first putrid. All of them separated a filamentous matter, and
                    became clear on being exposed to the heat of 25° of Reaumur’s thermometer. In
                    the residuum of distillation no difference whatever could be perceived. As the
                    only difference therefore existing in cow’s milk consists in the volatile part,
                    our authors conclude that it is improper to boil milk either for common or
                    medicinal purposes. They observed also that any sudden change of food, even from
                    a worse to a better kind, was attended by a very remarkable diminution in the
                    quantity of milk. The residuum of the distillation yielded, in a strong fire, a
                    yellow oil and acid, a thick and black empyreumatic<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193820197" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0197-0076"/> oil, a volatile alkali, and
                    towards the end a quantity of inflammable air, and at last a coal remained
                    containing some fixed alkali with muriatic acid.</p>
                <p>On agitating in long bottles the cream from the milk of cows fed with different
                    substances, all of them were formed into a kind of half-made butter, of which
                    that formed from the milk of maize was white, firm, and insipid, that from
                    potatoes was softer and more pinguedinous, and that from common grass was the
                    best of all. Cabbage, as in other cases, gave a strong taste.</p>
                <p>In the course of these experiments, an endeavour was made to determine whether
                    butter is actually contained in the cream, or whether it be a chemical
                    production of the operation of churning. They could not find any reason
                    absolutely satisfactory on either side, but incline to the latter opinion;
                    because when cream has been allowed to remain amongst the milk, and the whole
                    curdled promiscuously, fat cheese, without any butter, is produced. The oily
                    parts cannot be separated into butter either by acids or any other means than
                    churning; even the artificial mixture of oil with the cream is insufficient for
                    the purpose.</p>
                <p>The serum of milk was reduced by filtration to a clear and pellucid liquor; and,
                    by mixture with fixed alkali, it deposited a portion of fromaginous matter which
                    had been dissolved in the whey. The sugar of milk was also found in this
                    liquor.</p>
                <p>In these experiments upon the milk of various animals, it was found that that of
                    asses yielded by distillation an insipid liquor, and deposited a liquor similar
                    to the lymph of cow’s milk. This kind is coagulated by all the acids, but not
                    into an uniform mass, exhibiting only the appearance of distinct flocculi. It
                    affords but little cream, which is with difficulty converted into a soft butter,
                    that soon becomes rancid. It has but a small quantity of saccharine particles,
                    and these are often mixed with muriatic selenite and common salt. Goat’s milk
                    has a thick cream, which is agreeable to the taste; and the milk itself may be
                    preserved longer in a sound state than any other species, the scum on its
                    surface being naturally convertible into palatable cheese. It is easily made
                    into firm butter, which does not soon become rancid, and has a good flavour. The
                    butter-milk contains a large quantity of fromaginous matter, which readily
                    coagulates; but it has still less saccharine matter than that of asses. Sheep’s
                    milk can scarcely be distinguished from that of a cow, and easily parts with its
                    cream by standing. It is of a yellow colour, of an agreeable flavour, and yields
                    a great proportion of butter; but this is not solid, and soon becomes rancid.
                    Mare’s milk is the most insipid and least nutritiousof any, notwithstanding
                    which it has been much recommended for weak and consumptive patients. It is
                    probable that, in such cases, it proves efficacious by being more consonant than
                    any other to the debilitated powers of digestion. It boils with a smaller fire
                    than any other kind of milk, is easily coagulated, and the distilled water does
                    not so soon change its nature. It has but a small quantity of fromaginous
                    matter, and very few oily particles. The cream cannot be made into butter; and
                    the whey contains about as much sugar as cow’s or goat’s milk.</p>
                <p>It has also been remarked, that in order to augment the quantity, as well as to
                    improve the quality, of the milk of animals, they should be well fed, their
                    stalls kept clean, and their litter frequently renewed. They should be milked at
                    stated hours, but not drained; and great attention should be paid to the breed,
                    because inferior cattle are maintained at as great expense as the most valuable
                    kinds. No change ought to be made in the food; although, if the milk be employed
                    for medicinal purposes, it may be improved by a proper mixture of herbs.</p>
                <p>In their experiments on women’s milk, MM. Parmentier and Deyeux differ somewhat
                    from Mr Clarke. They first tried the milk of a woman who had been delivered four
                    months before, and observed that, after the cream had been separated, the other
                    part appeared of a more perfect white, and that it could not be coagulated
                    either by vinegar or mineral acids, a circumstance which they attributed to a
                    superabundance of serum. But they found that in proportion to the age of the
                    milk it was more easily coagulable; and this was confirmed by experiments made
                    upon the milk of twenty nurses. Its coagulability was not increased by heat. The
                    cream, by agitation, formed a viscid unctuous matter, which, however, could not
                    be changed into perfect butter; but they found it extremely difficult to
                    determine the proportions of the various component parts of human milk, as it
                    differs remarkably, not only in different subjects, but in the same subject at
                    different times. In a nurse aged about thirty-two years, who was extremely
                    subject to nervous affections, the milk was one day found almost quite
                    colourless and transparent; in two hours afterwards, a second quantity drawn
                    from the breast was viscid like the white of an egg; and in a short time it
                    became whiter, but did not recover its natural colour until the evening. It was
                    afterwards found that these changes were occasioned by the woman having in the
                    mean time had some violent hysterical fits.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Milk</hi><hi rend="italic">of Vegetables.</hi> For the same
                    reason that the milk of animals may be considered as a true animal emulsient,
                    the liquors of vegetables may be termed <hi rend="italic">vegetable milks.</hi>
                    Accordingly emulsions made with almonds are commonly called <hi rend="italic"
                    >milk of almonds.</hi> But besides this vegetable milk, which is in some measure
                    artificial, many plants and trees contain naturally a large quantity of emulsive
                    or milky juices. Of this kind are lettuce, spurge, fig-tree, and the tree which
                    furnishes the elastic American resin. The milky juices obtained from all these
                    vegetables derive their whiteness from an oily matter, mixed and undissolved in
                    a watery or mucilaginous liquor. Most resinous gums are originally such milky
                    juices, which afterwards become solid by the evaporation of their more fluid and
                    volatile parts.</p>
