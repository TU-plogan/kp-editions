                <p><label type="entry">MONARCHY</label>, a large state governed by one man, or
                    astate where the supreme power is lodged in the hands of a single person. The
                    word comes from the Greek, <hi rend="italic">μovagχης</hi>, one who governs
                    alone; formed of <hi rend="italic">μονος, solus,</hi> alone, and <hi
                    rend="italic">ά</hi><hi rend="italic">ζχη, imperium,</hi> government. Of the
                    three forms of government, democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy, the last is the
                    most powerful, all the sinews of government being knit together, and united in
                    the hand of the prince; but then there is imminent danger of his employing that
                    strength to improvident or oppressive purposes. As a democracy is best
                    calculated to direct the end of a law, and an aristocracy to invent the means by
                    which that end shall be obtained, a monarchy is most fitted for carrying those
                    means into execution.</p>
                <p>The most ancient monarchy was that of the Assyrians, which was founded soon after
                    the Deluge. We usually reckon four grand or universal monarchies; the Assyrian,
                    Persian, Grecian, and Roman; though St Augustin makes them but two, namely,
                    those of Babylon and Rome. Belus is placed at the head of the series of Assyrian
                    kings who reigned at Babylon, and is by profane authors esteemed the founder of
                    that empire; by some he was considered as the same person whom the Scriptures
                    call Nimrod. The principal Assyrian kings after Belus were Ninus, who built
                    Nineveh, and removed the seat of empire to it; Semiramis, who, disguising her
                    sex, took possession of the kingdom instead of her son, and was killed and
                    succeeded by her son Ninyas; and Sardanapalus, the last of the Assyrian
                    monarchs, and more effeminate than any woman. After his death the Assyrian
                    empire was divided into three separate kingdoms, viz. the Median,’ Assyrian, and
                    Babylonian. The first king of the Median kingdom was Arbaces; and this kingdom
                    lasted till the time of Astyages, who was subdued and divested of his dominions
                    by Cyrus.</p>
                <p>In the time of Cyrus there arose a new and second monarchy called the Persian,
                    which lasted upwards of 200 years from Cyrus, whose reign began in the year of
                    the world 3468, to Darius Codomannus, who was conquered by Alexander, and the
                    empire transferred to the Greeks in 3674. The first monarch was Cyrus, founder
                    of the empire; the second, Cambyses the son of Cyrus; the third, Smerdis; the
                    fourth, Darius the son of Hystaspis, who reigned 521 years before Christ; the
                    fifth, Xerxes, who reigned 485 years before Christ; the sixth, Artaxerxes
                    Longimanus, who reigned 464 years before Christ; the seventh, Xerxes the second;
                    the eighth, Ochus or Darius, called Nothus, who reigned 424 years before Christ;
                    the ninth, Artaxerxes Mnemon, 405 years before Christ; the tenth, Artaxerxes
                    Ochus, 359 years before Christ; the eleventh, Arses, 338 years before Christ;
                    the twelfth, Darius Codomannus, who was defeated by Alexander the Great, and
                    deprived of his kingdom and life about 331 years before Christ. After his death,
                    the dominion of Persia was transferred to the Greeks.</p>
                <p>The third monarchy was the Grecian. As Alexander, when he died, did not declare
                    who should succeed him, there started up as many kings as there were commanders.
                    At first they governed the provinces, which were divided amongst them, under the
                    title of viceroys; but when the family of Alexander the Great became extinct,
                    they assumed the style and title of kings. Hence, in process of time, the whole
                    empire of Alexander produced four distinct kingdoms. The first was the
                    Macedonian, the kings of which, after Alexander, were Antipater, Cassander,
                    Demetrius Poliorcetes, Seleucus Nicanor, Meleager, Antigonus Doson, Philip, and
                    Perseus, under whom the Macedonian kingdom was reduced to the form of a Roman
                    province. The second was the Asiatic kingdom, which, upon the death of
                    Alexander, fell to Antigonus, comprehending the country now called Anatolia,
                    together with some other regions beyond Mount Taurus. From this kingdom
                    proceeded two lesser ones; that of Pergamus, whose last king, Attalus, appointed
                    the Roman people to be his heir; and Pontus, reduced by the Romans into the form
                    of a province, when they had subdued the last king, Mithridates. The third was
                    the Syrian, of whose twenty-two kings the most celebrated were, Seleucus
                    Nicanor, founder of the kingdom, Antiochus Deus, Antiochus the Great, Antiochus
                    Epiphanes, and Tigranes, who was conquered by the Romans under Pompey, when
                    Syria was reduced into the form of a Roman province. The fourth was the
                    Egyptian, which was formed by the Greeks in Egypt, and flourished near 240
                    years, under twelve kings, the principal of whom were, Ptolemy Lagus, its
                    founder; Ptolemy Philadelphus, founder of the Alexandrian library; and Queen
                    Cleopatra, who was overcome by Augustus, in consequence of which Egypt was added
                    to the dominion of the Romans.</p>
                <p>The fourth monarchy was the Roman, which lasted 244 years, from the building of
                    the city until the time when the royal power was abrogated. The kings of Rome
                    were Romulus, its founder, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius, Aneus Martius,
                    Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius, and Tarquinius Superbus, who was banished,
                    and with whom terminated the regal power.</p>
                <p>There seems in reality to be no necessity for making the Medes, the Persians, and
                    the Greeks, succeed to the whole power of the Assyrians, in order to multiply
                    the number of the monarchies. It was the same empire still; and the several
                    changes which happened in it did not constitute different monarchies. Thus the
                    Roman empire was <pb break="no" facs="nls:193824175"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-4175-0382"/>successively governed by princes of different
                    nations, yet without any new monarchy being thereby formed. Rome, therefore, may
                    be said to have immediately succeeded to Babylon in the empire of the world.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fifth-</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">Monarchy Men,</hi> in
                    the ecclesiastical history of England, were a set of wrong-headed and turbulent
                    enthusiasts, who arose in the time of Cromwell, and expected Christ’s sudden
                    appearance upon earth to establish a new kingdom; in consequence of which
                    illusion, they aimed at the subversion of all human government.</p>
