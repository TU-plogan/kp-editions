                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">MORELL, <hi rend="smallcaps">Andrew</hi></label>, an eminent
                    antiquary, was born at Berne, in Switzerland, on the 9th of June 1646. He had a
                    strong passion for medals, in the knowledge of which he equalled, if not
                    surpassed, all his contemporaries; and in the course of his travels, which were
                    extensive, he made large collections of them. His rapid progress in history
                    developed his taste for numismatics, which he regarded as one of the principal
                    foundations of historical knowledge; and this taste was improved by his
                    acquaintance with Charles Patin, author of a work on the subject, whom he had
                    accidentally met at Bale, and whose friendship he ever afterwards retained. In
                    1680, Morell went to Paris, where his reputation procured him admission into the
                    society of the learned, and where, in 1683, he published <hi rend="italic"
                    >Specimen Universae Rci Numrnariae Antiquae,</hi> a second edition of which,
                    corrected and enlarged, appeared at Leipzig in 1695. Soon after the publication
                    of this essay, which was intended as a specimen of a greater work, embracing a
                    complete collection and description of ancient medals, he was associated with
                    Rainssant in the keepership of the royal cabinet of medals, and applied with
                    indefatigable ardour to thç classification and arrangement of the rich materials
                    it contained. When he had completed this laborious task, the promised recompense
                    was from some cause deferred; and having complained of the delay in a manner
                    which displeased Louvois, he was by order of that minister committed to the
                    Bastille, where he was confined for more than three years. By the intercession
                    of the government of Berne, he was liberated on the 16th of November 1691, and
                    returned to his native city, where he resumed the prosecution of his great work,
                    but made little progress, being unable to defray the heavy expense necessary’
                    for the execution of his design. In 1694 he went to Germany, upon an invitation
                    from the Count de Schwartzenburg-Arnstadt, who had a fine collection of medals,
                    with the charge of which he intrusted Morell, at the same time furnishing him
                    with the means of carrying on his great work. But he did not long enjoy the
                    comfort and tranquillity which he found in the castle of Arnstadt. A fall from a
                    carriage, in which he dislocated his shoulder, and a consequent attack of
                    paralysis, obliged him to suspend his labours, and he died on the 11th of April
                    1703, lamenting that he had not been able to complete the work upon which he had
                    so long been engaged. Havercamp having collected and arranged his scattered
                    materials, published, in 1734, <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus Morellianus, give
                    Familiarum</hi><hi rend="italic">Romanarum Numismata</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Omnia,</hi> in two vols. folio, of which one consisted of plates and the other
                    of text. Morell having also left in manuscript the numismatical history of the
                    first twelve Roman emperors, Havercamp, Schlegel, and Gori, undertook to publish
                    it with ample commentaries; and the work appeared in 1752, under the title of

                    figures. Morell also published several letters, particularly one in Latin

                    known as a classical scholar and editor, was born at Eton, in Buckinghamshire,
                    on the 18th of March 1703. At the age of twelve, he was admitted on the
                    foundation at Eton School, and thence elected in 1722 to King’s College,
                    Cambridge, where he successively took his degrees in arts and theology. In 1731,
                    he was appointed curate of Kew, and for some time officiated in the same
                    capacity at Twickenham; in 1737, he was, on the presentation of his college,
                    instituted rector of Buckland; and in 1775, we find him acting as chaplain to
                    the garrison at Portsmouth. He died on the 19th of February 1784, after having
                    devoted his long life to the discharge of his ecclesiastical duties, and the
                    cultivation of the ancient languages, diffusing at once the love of religion,
                    and a taste for classical literature. His principal works are, 1. A Collection
                    of Theological Poems, original, and translated from the Latin of Vida, with
                    notes, London, 1732-36, in 8vo; 2. An edition of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales,
                    with modern imitations, London, 1737; 3. An edition of the works of Spencer,
                    1747; 4. The Hecuba, Orestes, Phoenissae, and Alcestes of Euripides, with
                    ancient scholia and notes, London, 1748; 5. An English translation of the
                    Hecuba, with annotations; 6. The Prometheus of Aeschylus, with scholia, notes,
                    and an English translation in blank verse, 1767; 7. Two Letters on Greek
                    inscriptions found upon an altar at Corbridge in Northumberland; 8. Editions of
                    the Greek Lexico of Hederick, and of the Latin Dictionary of Ainsworth; 9.
                    Thesaurus Graecae Poëseos, sive Lexico Graeco-Prosodiacum, Eton, 1762, in 4to,
                    an imitation of the <hi rend="italic">Gradus</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Parnassum,</hi> since considerably augmented and enlarged by Dr
                    Maltby, Cambridge, 1815; 10. Various other works, particularly a catalogue of Mr
                    Child’s library, in 4to, and Annotations on Locke’s Essay, 1793, 8vo. <hi
