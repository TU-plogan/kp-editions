                <p><label type="entry">MEZERAI, <hi rend="smallcaps">François Eudes de</hi></label>,
                    a celebrated French historian, the son of Isaac Eudes, a surgeon, was born at
                    Rye, in Lower Normandy, in 1610, and took the surname of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mezerai,</hi> from a hamlet near Rye. Having completed his studies at Caen, he
                    discovered a strong inclination to poetry; but on proceeding to Paris, he was
                    advised by one of his friends to apply himself to the study of politics and
                    history, and procured the place of commissary at war, which he held during two
                    campaigns. He then shut himself up in the college of St Barbe, in the midst of
                    books and manuscripts; and, in 1643, published the first volume of the History
                    of France, in folio. Some years afterwards, the other two volumes also appeared.
                    In that work Mézerai surpassed all who had written the history of France before
                    him, and was rewarded by the king with a pension of four thousand livres. In
                    1668 he published an Abridgment of his History of France, in three volumes
                    quarto, which was well received by the public; but as he inserted in that work
                    the origin of most of the taxes, with very free reflections, Μ. Colbert
                    complained of it, upon which Mézerai promised to correct what he had done in a
                    second edition. As his corrections, however, amounted rather to palliations than
                    changes or retractations, the minister caused half of his pension to be
                    suppressed. Mézerai complained of this in very severe terms, but the only answer
                    he obtained was the suppression of the other half. Annoyed at this treatment, he
                    resolved to write on subjects which could not expose him to such
                    disappointments, and composed his treatise on the origin of the French, which
                    did him much honour. He was elected perpetual secretary to the French Academy,
                    and died in the year 1683. He is said to have been extremely negligent of his
                    person, and so careless of his dress that he might have passed for a beg-ger
                    rather than a man of letters. He was actually seized one morning by the <hi
                    rend="italic">archers</hi><hi rend="italic">des pauvres,</hi> or parish
                    officers; a mistake which, so far from provoking, highly diverted him. He used
                    to study and write by candle-light, even at noon-day in summer; and, as if there
                    had been no sun in the world, always waited upon his company to the door with a
                    candle in his hand. In regard to religion, he affected a species of Pyrrhonism,
                    which, however, was not so much <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819235"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-9235-0002"/>in his heart as in his mouth, and rather the
                    effect of a contradictory humour than the result of conviction. This appeared
                    from his last sickness; for having sent for those friends who had been the most
                    frequent auditors of his licentious talk about religion, he made a sort of
                    recantation, which he concluded with desiring them to forget what he might
                    formerly have said upon the subject of religion, and to “remember that Mézerai
                    dying was more to be believed than Mézerai living.” The following is a list of
                    the works of Mézerai, viz. 1. Histoire de France, 1643, 1646, 1651, in three
                    vols. folio; 2. Abrégé Chronologique de ΓHistoire de France, 1668, in three
                    vols. 4to; 3. Traité de l’Origine des Français, Amsterdam, 1688, in 12mo; 4. Une
                    Traduction de l’Histoire des Tures de Chalcondyle, Paris, 1662, in two vols.
                    folio; 5. Une Traduction Française du Traité de Jean de Salisbury, intitulé <hi
                    rend="italic">La Vanité de la Cour,</hi> Paris, 1640, in 4to; 6. Traité de la
                    Vérité de la Religion Chrétienne, translated from the Latin of Grotius, Paris,
                    1644, in 8vo; 7. Histoire de la Mère et du Fils, that is, of Mary of Medicis and
                    Louis XIII., Amsterdam, 1730, in 4to. A compilation entitled <hi rend="italic"

                    Mézerai, though apparently without the slightest foundation.</p>
