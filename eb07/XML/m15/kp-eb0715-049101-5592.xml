                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    rend="smallcaps">yshire,</hi> a county in Scotland. The province of Moray
                    formerly included part of the shires of Inverness and Banff, and that of Nairn,
                    besides the present county; but the name is now confined to this district, which
                    is also known by the appellation of Elginshire. It is situated between 57° 12'
                    and 57° 43' north latitude, and between 3° 2' and 3° 58' west longitude,
                    extending about forty miles from north-east to southwest, and in breadth from
                    eight to fourteen miles in the interior, but upon the coast from seventeen to
                    twenty-three miles; and it contains, including its lakes, 480 square miles, or
                    307,200 English acres, of which only about one third is productive land. The
                    county of Moray has the frith of that name on the north, Banffshire on the east,
                    Inverness-shire on the south, and Nairnshire on the west. The river Spey, which,
                    with a few exceptions, separates it from Banffshire, is commonly considered as
                    its eastern boundary. On the south, it is intersected by a small part of
                    Inverness-shire, by which two parishes, Abernethy and Duthil, partly in this
                    county, are detached from the body of it. It is divided into fifteen entire
                    parishes, and contains part of nine more parishes, the rest of which are
                    situated in the counties adjacent. The presbyteries to which these parishes
                    belong are, Aberlour, Abernethy, Elgin, and Forres, all under the jurisdiction
                    of the synod ’ of Moray.</p>
                <p>The natural divisions are the low grounds which stretch along the coast, varying
                    in breadth, southward, from five to twelve miles, and the mountains which occupy
                    the interior; yet the former is not without ridges of hills, though of no great
                    height, which generally rise in a line parallel to the shore; nor the latter
                    without considerable tracts of low land, particularly on the branches of the
                    Spey and Findhorn, and the other streams which flow from the south. The climate,
                    soil, and productiveness of these two divisions are very different. The climate
                    on the coast is supposed to be as good as that of any part of Scotland, both in
                    respect to heat and to dryness; whilst the prevailing soil is a sandy loam, in
                    many parts affording plentiful crops, which ripen early, and are seldom injured
                    by bad weather in the harvest season. The wind blows from westerly points for
                    almost three fourths of the year. The strong gales are from the north-west, and
                    the most frequent rains are from this point and the north. Easterly winds,
                    however, prevail in the spring months, to the great injury of vegetation. The
                    annual fall of rain upon the north-east quarter, near Speymouth, is said to be
                    little more than twenty-five inches; and the medium temperature of the year
                    varies from 45° to 50°. In the mountain district, the winters are long and
                    severe; more rain falls than on the coast; and the labours of the harvest are
                    sometimes not brought to a close until the crops are covered with snow.
                    Limestone, sandstone, and slate, with marl, abound in various parts. Iron was
                    almost a century ago wrought in Strathspey by the York Buildings Company, and
                    lead at Stotfield by an English company. Lime is quarried and burned at six
                    different places. The rivers are the Spey, the Lossie, and the Findhorn, which
                    receive the waters of a great many mountain streams. The Spey, the most
                    considerable, has a course of thirty miles before it enters Morayshire, at
                    Aviemore, from which it flows in a deep channel, and with a considerable fall,
                    till it empties itself, after describing a line of about ninety-six miles in
                    all, into the sea at Spcymouth Bay. It is not navigable, except near its mouth,
                    and there only for small vessels; but it affords the means of bringing down to
                    the sea the forests on its banks; and the rents of its salmon fisheries, some
                    years ago, exceeded L.8000 per annum. The Lossie flows almost parallel to the
                    Spey, about ten miles distant, and, after a course of twenty-four miles, during
                    which it turns a number of corn mills, falls into the sea at Lossiemouth, about
                    six miles to the north of Elgin. The Findhorn, like the two former, flows from
                    south to north, and enters the Frith of Moray at the village that bears its
                    name, having traversed Inverness-shire, where it has its source, Nairnshire, and
                    this county, for a distance of sixty miles. There is also a valuable salmon
                    fishery on this river. The principal lakes, beginning on the east, are
                    Loughnaboe, which covers about sixty acres; Loch Spynie, which formerly spread
                    over more than 2000 acres, but has since been laid almost dry by drainage;
                    Inchstellie, Lochloy, and Loughnadurb, containing an island on which there are
                    the remains of an ancient fortress, and where it is said turnips have been found
                    growing naturally. Chalybeate springs are found in every quarter of the county,
                    but none of them are in much repute.</p>
                <p>The valued rent of Morayshire, in Scotch money, is L.65,603. 0s. 5d,, and the
                    real rent, in 1811, of the lands, was L.62,312. 9s. 6d. sterling, and of the
                    houses, L.2753. 14s. 6d. In the same year, the number of proprietors was
                    forty-one, five of whom held more than half the valuation and rental; and that
                    of the freeholders thirty-six. Only about .a fortieth part is held in feu, the
                    whole, with this exception, and small portions belonging to the burghs, being
                    freehold; but nearly a third is under entail. Many of the proprietors have
                    elegant mansions, of which the most considerable, beginning on the eastern
                    quarter, are Innes House, the Earl of Fife; Findrassie, Tod; Gordonstown and
                    Altyre, Cumming Gordon, Bart·; Duffus, Dunbar, Bart.; Darnway Castle, the Earl
                    of Moray; Brodie House, Brodie; Grange, Grant Peterkin; Burgie Castle, Tulloh;
                    and Elchies House, Graut.</p>
                <p>The size of farms on the coast does not often exceed 400 acres, and the greater
                    number are below 150 acres. The larger farms are generally held on leases of
                    nineteen years, as in other parts of Scotland, but many of the smaller tenants
                    have no leases. This division of the county produces all the species of corn
                    grown in Scotland, with turnips, potatoes, and clovers. In the higher district,
                    barley and oats, along with potatoes, are almost the only crops, with small
                    portions of turnips and cultivated herbage, and in some places a little flax.
                    The native cattle have been improved by crossing them with the West Highland
                    race; and of late years, through the exertions of a local Tanning Society,
                    crosses from the short-horned Teeswater and Aberdeenshire breeds have been
                    introduced, which have much increased the size of stock and aptitude to fatten,
                    thereby insuring to the agriculturists a fertile source of profit and advantage,
                    from the ready communication with the London markets, afforded by steam-vessels,
                    which now regularly navigate the Moray Frith. The sheep, which </p>

                    Upon the - larger farms on the coast the horses are of the very best
                    description, and even in the higher districts they are not inferior to those of
                    other parts of Scotland.</p>
                <p>The great stimulus given to the agricultural interest in the production of stock,
                    corn, and smaller commodities, for the London market, has incited corresponding
                    exertions in the owners of harbours along the coast to facilitate export. Those
                    of Findhorn and Burghead have of late been much improved by the construction of
                    additional quays; and a new harbour is at present (1837) erecting at Stotfield
                    Point, within six miles of Elgin, which is expected to be of very great
                    advantage to the surrounding district.</p>
                <p>This county contains within its bounds two of the noblest forests in Scotland,
                    viz. Abernethy Forest, of Scotch fir, and Darnaway Forest, chiefly oak of
                    ancient growth. There are also extensive recent plantations along the banks of
                    the rivers Spey and Findhorn at Fochabers, Quarry Wood, &amp;c.; and the
                    district generally is beautifully diver sified and sheltered by thriving clumps,
                    belts, and hedgerows.</p>
                <p>Morayshire employs few of its people in manufactures for sale. A woollen factory
                    has been established at New-mill, in the parish of St Andrews Lhanbryd; and in
                    the same quarter another for the weaving of cottons. There are tanneries at
                    Forres and Elgin; and, at the latter place, a tawing work of some consideration,
                    which sends most of its produce to London. The exports are cattle, sheep, wool,
                    corn, and salmon, with a variety of smaller articles. The value of the salmon
                    has been stated at about L.25,000, and that of the other exports at L.80,000
                    yearly. A considerable quantity of timber is floated down the Spey, and shipped
                    at Garmouth. The towns and villages’are, Elgin the county town, Forres,
                    Garmouth, Urquhart, Lossiemouth, Bishopmill, Findhorn, Rothes, and Bainatom. The
                    first two are burghs; Elgin is joined with Cullen, Banff, Peterhead, Inverury,
                    and Kintore, and Forres with Inverness, Nairn, and Fortrose, in the election of
                    members for the Scottish burghs. Both these places are of great antiquity. The
                    population in 1811,1821, and 1831 is exhibited in the following abstract.</p>
