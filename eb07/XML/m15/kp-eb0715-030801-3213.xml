                    artificial memory, and lay down rules for attaining it. Simonides the poet is
                    said first to have made this discovery, or at least to have occasioned its being
                    made. The story told of him is this. Being once at a feast, he recited a poem
                    which he had composed in honour of the person who gave the entertainment; but
                    having made a large digression in praise of Castor and Pollux, his patron, when
                    he had repeated the whole poem, only gave him half the sum he had promised,
                    telling him that he must get the rest from those deities who had an eqι^⅛ιare in
                    the honour<pb break="no" facs="nls:193823226" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3226-0309"/> of
                    his performance. Immediately afterwards, Simonides was informed that two young
                    men were without, and must needs speak with him. He had scarcely quitted the
                    house, when the room where the company was assembled fell down, killed all the
                    persons in it, and so mutilated the bodies that, when the rubbish was removed,
                    they could not be distinguished one from another; but Simonides, calling to mind
                    the place which every one had occupied, was by that means enabled to distinguish
                    them. Hence it came to be observed, that fixing a number of places in the mind,
                    in a certain order, served as a help to the memory; for we find by experience,
                    that upon returning to places once familiar to us, we not only remember them,
                    but likewise many things which we both said and did in them. This effort of
                    Simonides was afterwards improved into an art, and its nature is simply this:
                    You are required to form in your mind the idea of some large place or building,
                    which you may divide into a great number of distinct parts, ranged and disposed
                    in a certain order. <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> These you are frequently to
                    revolve in your thoughts, until, beginning at any part, you are able to run them
                    over one after another without hesitation. Then you are to impress upon your
                    mind as many images of living creatures, or any other objects which are most
                    likely to affect you, and to be soonest revived in your memory. These, like
                    characters written in short-hand, or like hieroglyphics, will stand to denote an
                    equal number of words, which cannot so easily be remembered. When therefore you
                    have a number of things to commit to memory in a certain order, all that you
                    have to do is, to place those images regularly in the several parts of your
                    building; and thus, by going over several parts of the building, the images
                    placed in them will be revived in the mind, by which means the things or words
                    themselves will arise in the order in which you desire to remember them. The
                    advantage of these images seems to be this, that, as they are more likely to
                    affect the imagination than the words for which they stand, they will for that
                    reason be more easily remembered, Thus, for instance, if the image of a <hi
                    rend="italic">lion</hi> be made to signify <hi rend="italic">strength,</hi> and
                    this word <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> be one of those which I am to
                    remember, and be placed in the porch, then, in going over the several parts of
                    the building, when I come to the porch I shall sooner be reminded of that image
                    than of the word <hi rend="italic">strength.</hi> Of this artificial memory both
                    Cicero and Quintilian have spoken; but we know not of any modern orator who has
                    ever made use of it. It seems indeed to have been a laborious way of improving
                    the memory, if it serves that end at all, and fitter for assisting us to
                    remember any number of unconnected words than a continual discourse, unless in
                    as far as the remembrance of one word may enable us to recollect others. It is,
                    however, in allusion to it that we still call the parts of a discourse <hi
                    rend="italic">places or topics,</hi> and say, in the first place, in the second
                    place, and so on.</p>
                <p>In Germany this art was revived by Μ. Aretin; and a pupil of his, Μ. Kaestner,
                    was permitted to teach the new doctrine at Leipzig, but on the express condition
                    of not allowing his hearers to write down his lectures. The following account is
                    given of this art in a letter from Paris written in the beginning of 1807:
                    “During my residence,” says the writer, “in this metropolis, I heard a great
                    deal of a new method of <hi rend="italic">mnémonique,</hi> or of a method to
                    assist and fix our memory, invented by Gregor de Fein-àigle. Notwithstanding the
                    simplicity with which he announced his lectures in the papers, I could not
                    determine myself to become a pupil of his, as I thought to find a quack or
                    mountebank, and to be laughed at by my friends for having thrown away my cash in
                    such a foolish man ner. Perhaps I should hesitate to this moment about the
                    utility of this newly-invented method to assist our natural memory, had I not
                    had the pleasure of dining at his excellency’s, the Count de Metternich, the
                    Austrian ambassador, who followed, with all his secretaries, the whole course of
                    lectures; they all spoke very advantageously of it, likewise several other
                    persons of the first rank I met there. In consequence of this I was inserted
                    into the list of pupils, and I follow at this moment the lectures. All I can
                    tell you about this method is, it is a very simple one, and easy to be learned,
                    adapted to all ages and sexes. All difficulties in such sciences as require an
                    extraordinary good memory, for instance, the names and epochs in history, are at
                    once overcome and obviated. There is not one branch of science to which this
                    method cannot be applied. It is easy to be perceived that such an invention
                    cannot pass without some critique, and even sarcasms, in the public prints; some
                    of them were very injurious, and plausible enough to mislead the public, who,
                    knowing nothing of the method, are always more ready to condemn than to assist.
                    Μ. Feinaigle, to answer all these critics at once, adopted a method not less
                    public for Paris than the public papers, but less public for the rest of Europe.
                    He gave a public exhibition to about 2000 spectators, in which he did not appear
                    at all, only about twelve or fifteen of his pupils; each of them made such an
                    application of the method as his situation in life required. The principal parts
                    were the following: History, about names and years; geography, with respect to
                    longitude, latitude, number of inhabitants, square miles, &amp;c.; grammar in
                    various languages, about different editions of the same work; pandects, their
                    division, and title of each book, title, &amp;c.; different systems of botany,
                    poetry, arithmetic, &amp;c. At last one desired the company to give him one
                    thousand words, without any connection whatsoever, and without numerical order;
                    for instance, the word <hi rend="italic">astronomer,</hi> for No. 62; <hi
                    rend="italic">wood,</hi> for No. 188; <hi rend="italic">lovely,</hi> for No.
                    370; <hi rend="italic">dynasty,</hi> for No. 23; <hi rend="italic">David,</hi>
                    for No. 90, &amp;c. till all the numbers were filled; and he repeated the whole,
                    notwithstanding he heard these words without order, and but once, in the
                    numerical order; or he told you what word was given against any one number, or
                    what number any one word bore. It is still more striking, but certainly also
                    more difficult, to retain as many numbers, however great they may be. For words
                    and numbers I could venture myself, with the greatest safety, as far as one
                    hundred of each; and I am sure, after having fixed them once, which is done in
                    less than ten minutes, I could repeat them to you at any period, without ever
                    thinking any more of them.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Phil. Mag. 28, 93.</p></note> Feinaigle afterwards delivered lectures on the
                    same subject to crowded audiences in London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and other
                    towns; but we do not find that any of his pupils received improvement from his
                    instructions, and very few of them could give any account of his method.</p>
