                <p><label type="entry">MOSAIC LAW</label>, the code of laws delivered to the
                    Israelites by Moses. This is the most remarkable system of jurisprudence ever
                    given to the world, as well as the most ancient of which we have any distinct
                    record. It was delivered, not to a settled nation, but to a people on their way
                    to a settlement at that time inhabited by numerous and powerful clans, from
                    whom, and from all other nations whatsoever, it was one of the main objects of
                    the law to separate and distinguish them; and when they had reached the promised
                    land, it was, with scarcely any alteration, found equally adapted to the people
                    after they had subjugated the hostile bands by which they were surrounded, and
                    were living in victorious peace amidst the trade and bustle, the pomp and
                    magnificence, of a great monarchy. Nor is this all. Its decalogue, or ten
                    commandments, has been adopted by the most enlightened nations as the moral law
                    of human nature. These precepts, too, were not promulgated at different times
                    according as circumstances seemed to dictate, like the Koran of a later age, but
                    were given at once, along with the other principles of the system; which
                    exhibits a unity of character and a singleness of purpose peculiar to itself. It
                    must be added, that throughout the whole code there evidently appears an end and
                    object, which, like the vital fluid meandering in our veins, imparts to the
                    system all its freshness, life, and vigour, and which being withdrawn or
                    accomplished, the body is left in the weakness and stillness of death.</p>
                <p>The Mosaic or Jewish law is generally said to be comprehended in these three
                    particulars; namely, the decalogue, or ten commandments, the judicial law, and
                    the ordinances of divine service, or the ceremonial law. But it was certainly
                    not so considered by the Jews themselves, nor by their lawgiver. The basis upon
                    which the whole law rested was historical. It was this: That God had chosen the
                    progenitor of the nation from amongst his idolatrous kinsmen, to impart to him
                    and his posterity a knowledge of the true God, and establish them in the land to
                    which the nation was now advancing, to be there governed by this law. The very
                    first words of the decalogue are, “I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out
                    of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; thou shalt have no other Gods
                    before me.” And, with the eye of faith, the believing Jew could look forward to
                    the distant future, and anticipate the time when there should “come forth a rod
                    out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch grow out of his roots,”—</p>

                <p>when a new seed should arise to serve Jehovah, not after the law of a carnal
                    commandment, but after the power of an endless life; and in the still remoter
                    future see a heavenly Canaan, wherein “the ransomed of the Lord” should be found
                    gathered out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation, and God
                    should be all in all.</p>
                <p>The Hebrew community, as it existed in the time of Moses, was placed under a
                    theocracy, in the strictest sense of that term. The fundamental principle of
                    their law was the recognition and obeying of God as the only true God, and in
                    particular as their sovereign; the law issued from his mouth; and the whole
                    Jewish judges, magistrates, and officers, were merely his deputies, to announce
                    to the people, or execute upon them, the divine promises and threatenings, with
                    a certainty like that of the laws of nature, of which, indeed, the laws of the
                    Hebrew commonwealth might reasonably enough be regarded as but a part.</p>
                <p>The principal copy of the law was committed to the custody of the priests and
                    elders,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Deut. xxxi.

                    powers; it was appointed to be publicly read and expounded to the people at
                    stated solemnities, “when all Israel was assembled together ;”<note

                    two first principles, or ordinances explanatory of how their end was to be
                    attained. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.<note

                    ><p>Exod. XX. 1-18.</p></note> it was enjoined on the people, 1. That there is
                    no other God but the Lord God, that brought them out of the land of Egypt: 2.
                    That no image or likeness of any creature whatever is to be made, as the divine
                    likeness, or for divine worship; implying the entire separation of the Deity
                    from all created beings, and his exclusive right to their worship and adoration:
                    3. That the name of God is not to be taken in vain, that is to say, either
                    lightly, or to a falsehood; implying the divine omniscience and power: 4. That
                    the seventh day is to be observed as a day of rest for all persons and for all
                    cattle within the Jewish territory, to restore them after their previous toils,
                    and, at the same time, to keepalive in the world a sense of the creation of all
                    things, and their great Creator: 5. That parents are to be honoured: 6. That the
                    life of man is not to be attacked: 7. That the relation of husband and wife is
                    not to be disturbed: 8. That the property of others is not to be violated: 9.
                    That false testimony is not to be borne: and, 10. That covetousness, and all
                    risings of envy, are to be avoided and repressed.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Judicial</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Civil Law</hi> was
                    next delivered to the nation; and here the first object which attracted the
                    notice of the great lawgiver was the Hebrew slave, upon whom was immediately
                    conferred the boon of an everlasting Sabbath. “If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six
                    years shall he serve, and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.”<note

                    all its horrors; for the slave was entitled to be treated at once as a sentient,
                    a rational, and an immortal creature. He enjoyed the common benefit of the
                    Sabbath<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. XX. 10;

                    and, in all cases, a master was indictable for killing his slave, if the latter
                    died under his hand.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Ibid. xxi. 20, 21.</p></note> The escape of a slave even operated his

                    16.</p></note> We have seen also, in the case of a purchased Hebrew slave, that
                    the service properly continued six years, and no more; in the seventh year he
                    behoved to be liberally furnished “from the flock, the floor, and the
                    wine-press,” and set free, alone if he came alone, with his wife if he came
                    married. But if his wife was given him by his master, she and her children
                    remained the master’s.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    does not appear to have had the benefit of the seventh year; but there was a
                    peculiarity in the case of her being betrothed to her master, for then he could
                    not sell her to a foreign nation;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Exod. xxi. 7, 8.</p></note> and where a female slave was
                    betrothed to the master’s son, she became, as it were, a daughter in the house,
                    and if the engagement was not completed by marriage, she was entitled to her
                    freedom.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. xxi.
                    9.</p></note> There was but one case of perpetual bondage. It was when a slave,
                    having married a female given him by his master, or having become attached to
                    his master’s home, preferred remaining in his house rather than accepting the
                    freedom of the year of release. In that case the man was taken before a
                    magistrate, and had his ear bored in token of perpetual service.<note

                    But this was plainly a sacrifice to the best feelings of our nature; and it
                    furnished the royal psaloust, and him of whom David was a type, with an

                    compulsory marriages. The one was where, a man having died leaving a widow
                    without issue, his brother was obliged to take the place of the deceased;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. XXV. 5, et

                    obliged to marry within their tribe, that the inheritance might not be severed
                    from it. The reason of the other regulation, which indeed existed before the

                    wisely adapted for a people out of whom the Messiah was to arise. The power of a
                    husband was great; he could disallow or annul his wife’s vows; he could bring
                    her at any time before the priest for trial by the waters of jealousy;<note

                    authority in general was, like that of a husband, very great indeed. A father

                    type="authorial"><p>Exod. xxi. 7∙</p></note> and we find, that as Abraham before
                    the law was about to offer up his son in sacrifice, so Jephtha under the law
                    actually offered up his daughter. A father seems also to have had power to
                    dispose of his daughters in marriage;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    done to a daughter living in her father’s house were repaired to the father.
                    Reverence to parents was indeed a peculiar characteristic of the Mosaic law.
                    They were the sovereigns of their family, its priest, and its prophet, which
                    last office they particularly filled when they stored the minds of their
                    household with the knowledge of their national history and law, which, whilst it
                    taught them their filial duty, taught them also their relation to the Great
                    Parent of all. A first-born son had some peculiar privileges over the other

                <p>The principle of the law of <hi rend="italic">inheritance</hi> was early stated;
                    but its several steps were not brought out till forty years after the
                    promulgation of the law, in the case of the daughters of Zelophehad. The course
                    of descent was this. The estate passed first to the children of the deceased,
                    preferring sons to daughters, and allowing the first-born son a double portion
                    of his father’s goods. On failure of children, the estate fell to the brothers
                    of the deceased, next to his father’s brothers, and, lastly, to the nearest
                    kinsman of the family.</p>
                <p>In the case of <hi rend="italic">deposit,</hi> if the thing deposited, money or
                    goods, was stolen, and the thief was not discovered, all that was required of
                    the depositary was, to swear that he had not acted wrongfully in the matter;
                    except in the case of cattle, when he was bound to make restitution, or show
                    that the animal had been torn in pieces by wild beasts.<note anchored="true"

                <p>A <hi rend="italic">hired</hi> thing, hurt or dying in the hand of the hirer,
                    needed not be made good; the hire stood for it.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. xxii. 15.</p></note></p>
                <p>In the case of <hi rend="italic">loan,</hi> if the thing borrowed was hurt or
                    died, the owner being present, the borrower was not bound to make it good; but
                    otherwise, if the owner was absent.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Ibid. xxii. 14, 15.</p></note> The case of a money loan was
                    peculiar; interest might be taken from foreigners, but not between Jews.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. xxii. 25.</p></note>
                    The general policy of the Hebrew code was to preserve moderation of means in
                    individuals, and a general equality throughout the nation; and this seems to
                    have been the particular policy of the Hebrew law of interest. For by the
                    regulation disallowing interest, coupled with the regulation, to be immediately
                    noticed, that debts were released at the Sabbatical year, the loan of money was
                    made difficult of attainment, and so the spirit of speculation, no less than the
                    contracting of debt, was prevented.</p>
                <p>The same principle, no doubt, pervaded the law of <hi rend="italic">pledge,</hi>
                    so that pledges were in fact only nominal. Raiment might be taken in pledge,
                    but, like all pledges from the poor,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>’- Deut, xxiv. 12, 13.</p></note> it required to be returned

                    <hi rend="italic">suretyship.</hi></p>
                <p>Various provisions were made in the law for the regaining of rights which had
                    been conveyed away. All lands and houses were sold with a power of redemption;
                    every fiftieth year was a year of jubilee for the restoration of lands other
                    than common burghal tenements,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    type="authorial"><p>Exod. xxi. 2, et seq.; Deut. xv. 1, 2, 12.</p></note> It was
                    also a Sabbatical year, or year of rest to the land, wherein the land was
                    neither sown nor reaped, but its natural produce was common to all. The reason
                    of these agrarian laws we have in Leviticus, xxv. 23: “The land shall not be
                    sold for ever, for it is mine, saith the Lord; and ye are strangers and
                    sojourners with me.”</p>
                <p>The benevolent sentiments were anxiously and impressively inculcated.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid, xxiii. 4, et seq.;
                    Deut. xxii. l,et seq.</p></note> Mercy, indeed, was, as we have seen, one of the
                    first principles of the law; and in the appointment of the Sabbath the Jew was
                    continually reminded of the divine compassion towards even the beasts of the
                    field, who had thus secured to them a weekly intermission from their labours.
                    Mercy was to be shown to every Jew, as to “a brother,” and whether he were a
                    friend or a foe; and all oppression was forbidden towards strangers, for, says
                    the divine lawgiver, “ye were strangers in the land of Egypt, and know the heart
                    of a stranger ;”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid.
                    xxii. 21.</p></note> and towards the widow and fatherless, for “if thou afflict
                    them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry; and
                    your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>The Mosaic <hi rend="italic">punishments</hi> were not very various. Recompense
                    was sometimes enjoined, by restitution, by compensation, and by fines. The
                    principle of retaliation was frequent, “eye for eye, tooth for tooth, and beast
                    for beast;” but the most common award was death, “to cut off the offender from
                    among the people,” and preserve the community from the moral contagion of his
                    example. Striking, cursing, or continuing obstinately disobedient to a parent,
                    was punished in this way;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    rendered him <hi rend="italic">unclean.</hi> The first notice which we have of
                    this is in the judicial law, where it is said, “ye shall be a holy people unto
                    me; neither shall ye eat any flesh torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it
                    to the dogs.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Deut.
                    xiv.</p></note> But the several occasions of defilement are stated at large in
                    that branch of the code which we are now considering;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Levit, xi.-xv.</p></note> where we find that
                    leprosy in the person, in garments, or in-a house, rendered these respectively
                    unclean, and that, amongst other things, certain animals, beasts, fishes, fowls,
                    and reptiles, were unclean. The defilement contracted was sometimes but
                    temporary, and ceased with the morning’s ablution; at other times it could be
                    removed only in the way prescribed by the law.</p>
                <p>There were also certain persons, places, and times, which were accounted
                    peculiarly holy. The holy place <hi rend="italic">par excellence was</hi> the
                    tabernacle, the outer court of which occupied a space of one hundred cubits in
                    length by fifty in breadth, or about one hundred and eighty feet by ninety. The
                    only entrance to this court was from the east by a hanging rail of blue, purple,
                    scarlet, and fine-twined linen. Here, under the open sky, stood a laver of brass
                    for the priests to wash in, and the altar of burnt-offering. Into this court
                    every clean Hebrew or proselyte of the covenant might enter with his offerings.
                    At the west end of this court stood a close tent about fifty-four feet in length
                    by eighteen in breadth, which was properly called the tabernacle, and divided
                    into two apartments. The first, which St Paul calls the <hi rend="italic"
                    >first</hi> tabernacle, was about thirty-six feet in length, and contained the
                    shew-bread, the candlestick of pure gold, &amp;c.; and into this, which was
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">the holy place,</hi> only the priests durst enter
                    or look. Beyond this apartment was another about eighteen feet square, called
                    the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> tabernacle, most holy place, or Holy of
                    Holies, which was separated from the first tabernacle by a veil of embroidered
                    linen hung upon pillars of wood overlaid with gold. Here stood the ark of the
                    covenant. It was made of wood overlaid with gold, and contained the book of the
                    testimony. Upon the ark, and of like dimensions with it, was the mercy-seat, of
                    pure gold, with a cherub of beaten gold on either side, stretching its wings
                    over the mercyseat, the face of the cherubim being towards each other. It was
                    from above the mercy-seat, and between the cherubim, that God met and communed
                    with Moses and the high priest; none else was permitted to enter the sacred
                    precincts, and even the high priest could only do so once a year, and this not
                    without blood, which he offered for himself and for the errors of the
                    people.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">priesthood</hi> was in the family of Aaron. The priests
                    served at the altar, prepared the victims, and offered the sacrifices; they kept
                    up the fire upon the altar of burnt-offerings, and in the lamps of the golden
                    candlesticks; they kneaded, baked, and offered the shew-bread; they publicly
                    blessed the people, and were consulted by them as the interpreters of the law,
                    and judges of controversies; and, in time of war, they carried the ark and
                    sounded the trumpets. Their garments, which were specially prescribed in the
                    law, were a tiara, a girdle, a linen tunic, and linen drawers. The high priest
                    had a plate or crown of gold an his tiara, with the inscription, “Holiness to
                    the Lord.” He had also the square breastplate of judgment, with its twelve
                    stones containing the names of the twelve tribes, and the Urim and Thummim fixed
                    in the breastplate; the ephod having on the shoulders two onyx stones, whereon
                    were also engraved the names of the children of Israel; the blue robe of the
                    ephod with golden bells hung to the skirt to sound when the high priest walked
                    in and out from the holy place; and, lastly, the high priest’s coat.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Levites,</hi> who were consecrated to God, instead of the
                    first-born of the nation, were assigned to the priests, to wait upon them, to
                    serve the tabernacle, to carry it, to encamp round it, and to minister in
                    relation to it. They were divided into three classes, from the three sons of
                    Levi, <hi rend="italic">Gershon, Kohatk,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Merari,</hi>
                    each of which had its own particular charge. The charge of one class was the
                    tabernacle, and its coverings and hangings; that of another was the boards of
                    the tabernacle, its bars, pillars, and sockets; and that of the third was to
                    bear “the most holy things,” that is to say, the sanctuary or most holy place,
                    and all the vessels and articles appertaining to it. But these were not to be
                    touched by them; they were to be taken down and put up by the priests, and
                    simply carried under cover by the bearers, and this upon their shoulders;
                    whereas the other two classes of the Levites had, the one two waggons and four
                    oxen, and the other four waggons and eight oxen, for their service.</p>
                <p>And as the Levites were appointed to assist the priests, so Moses was allowed
                    seventy elders of Israel “to bear the burden of the people with him.”</p>
                <p>The holy <hi rend="italic">Festivals</hi> were the weekly Sabbath and the three
                    great annual feasts, namely, 1. the Passover and feast of Unleavened Bread; 2.
                    the feast of Wecks, or of the first fruits of the ground; and, 3. the feast of
                    Tabernacles, or the gathering in of the corn and wine. The Passover was observed
                    on the fourteenth day of the first month of the Jewish year, which began in
                    March; and the feast of Unleavened Bread lasted the seven following days. The
                    feast of Wecks was a moveable feast. The feast of Tabernacles was in the seventh
                    month, or in our September. On the first day of the month, which was observed as
                    a Sabbath, the trumpets were sounded, whence that day was called the feast of
                    Trumpets. The tenth day, which was likewise Sabbatical, was the great day of
                    Atonement, when every one was required to afflict his soul; and on the fifteenth
                    day the feast of Tabernacles began, and lasted seven days. It was on the great
                    day of Atonement also that the Jubilee was proclaimed every fiftieth year, and
                    then every one returned to his family and possessions, and the land lay fallow
                    for a year. All these feasts and times were specially ordered in the law; and
                    the matter and manner of the sacrifices and offerings then to be made were
                    therein also specially prescribed. There were other sacred seasons, such as the
                    times of new moons; and every day the Temple was open for worship, and
                    sacrifices and offerings were made every morning and evening.</p>
                <p>Besides the stated sacrifices and offerings, free-will offerings were allowed;
                    and to meet particular vows, persons were valued in the law according to their
                    sex and age; but it was specially provided that no devoted thing should be
                    redeemed,—“every devoted thing is most holy unto the Lord.”</p>
                <p>A few words may now be added on the history of this remarkable code. It was
                    promulgated before the Israelites began their journey to Canaan; and they had
                    not proceeded far on their way thither when the authority of Moses was signally
                    vindicated, particularly on two occasions; first, when Miriam the sister of
                    Moses was struck with leprosy for envying and speaking against Moses; and next,
                    when Korah, grandson of Kohath, whose function was to carry “the most holy
                    things,” ambitious of a higher charge, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826593"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-6593-0568"/>headed a great company, who would have put down
                    all subordination and rank, on the pretence that “all the congregation were
                    holy, every one of them.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Numb. xvi. 3.</p></note> But Moses, after remonstrating with them on their
                    rebellion, invoked on them the divine vengeance, in consequence of which they
                    all perished. In the time of Joshua, the successor of Moses in the captaincy of
                    Israel, the people were settled in the promised land. From Joshua’s death they
                    had no regular succession of leaders down to the time of Samuel, when they
                    sought a king, and obtained one, first in the person of Saul, and then of David;
                    in whose reign, that is to say, nearly five hundred years after the departure
                    out of Egypt, a permanent Temple was erected at Jerusalem, instead of the former
                    Tabernacle. In their internal arrangements the Temple and Tabernacle were alike,
                    the house of God at Moriah consisting, like the Mosaic Tabernacle, of a porch or
                    court, the temple or sanctuary, and the most holy place, or place of the oracle;
                    but the change of the Tabernacle, which was ambulatory, to a fixed and permanent
                    temple, occasioned the alteration on the Mosaic code to which we alluded in the
                    beginning of this article. There was now no need for the Levites in their
                    capacity of bearers of the tabernacle. King David, therefore, distributed the
                    priests and the Levites into new classes, and appointed treasurers, singers,
                    porters, and other officers. His son Solomon, also, ordered for the temple an
                    immense molten sea, and caldrons for water for the sacrifices; and for himself a
                    throne of ivory overlaid with gold. This was the First Temple; for, at the
                    captivity of the last remaining tribes, it was finally destroyed; and, upon the
                    return of the Jews under Cyrus and Darius, a new temple on the same site was
                    erected, of which it was predicted that its glory should exceed the glory of the
                    former. This was accomplished in the appearance there of the Messiah, the king
                    and priest of a spiritual Israel, who has abolished the distinction between Jew
                    and Gentile, and, having offered up himself as a sacrifice for sin, is gone into
                    heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for his people, till they
                    also be introduced into the same presence as “kings and priests.” (u. u. u.)</p>
