                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    figures on copper, so as to form prints in imitation of painting in Indian ink.

                <p>The invention of this art has usually been attributed to Prince Rupert. But Baron
                    Heinikin, a judicious and accurate writer upon the subject of engraving,
                    asserts, with great appearance of truth, that it was a Lieutenant-colonel de
                    Siegan, an officer in the service of the landgrave of Flesse, w ho first
                    engraved in this manner; and that the print which he produced was a portrait of
                    the Princess Amelia Elizabeth of Hesse, engraved in the year 1643. Prince Rupert
                    learned the secret from this gentleman, and brought it into England when he came
                    over the second time with Charles II. Prince Rupert’s print of an executioner
                    holding a sword in one hand and a head in the other, a half length, from
                    Spagnoletto, is dated 1658. This art has never been cultivated with success in
                    any country but England.</p>
                <p>The prince laid his grounds upon the plate with a channelled roller; but, about
                    the same time, one Sherwin laid his grounds with a half-round file, which was
                    pressed down with a heavy piece of lead. Both these grounding tools have for
                    many years been laid aside; and a hand tool, resembling a shoemaker’s
                    cutting-board knife, with a fine cre-nelling on the edge, was introduced by one
                    Edial, a smith by trade, who afterwards became a mezzotinto engraver.</p>
                <p>Mezzotinto is very different from the common way of engraving. To perform it, the
                    surface of the plate is raked, hatched, or punched all over with a knife, or
                    instrument made for the purpose, first one way, and then the other, until the
                    surface of the plate is entirely furrow ed with lines or furrows, close and as
                    it were contiguous to each other; so that, if an impression were then taken from
                    it, it would be one uniform blot or smut. This being done, the design is drawn
                    or marked on the same face; after which, the artists proceed with burnishers,
                    scrapers, and other tools, to expunge and take out the dents or furrows in all
                    parts where the lights of the piece are designed to be; and that more or less as
                    the lights are to be stronger or fainter, leaving those parts black which are to
                    represent the shadows or deepenings of the draught.</p>
                <p>As it is much easier to scrape or burnish away parts of a dark ground
                    corresponding with the outline of any design sketched upon it, than to form
                    shades upon a light ground by an infinite number of hatches, strokes, and
                    points, which must all terminate with exactness on the outline, as well as
                    differ in their force and manner, the method of scraping, as it is called, in
                    mezzotinto, becomes much more easy and expeditious than any other method of
                    engraving. The instruments employed in this kind of engraving are, cradles,
                    scrapers, and burnishers.</p>
                <p>In this engraving, the plate must be prepared and polished in the same manner as
                    for other engravings, and afterwards divided equally by lines parallel to each
                    other, and traced out with very soft chalk. The distance of these lines should
                    be about one third of the length of the face of the cradle which is to be used,
                    and these lines should be marked with capital letters, or strokes of the chalk.
                    The cradle is then to be placed exactly between the first two lines, and passed
                    forwards in the same direction, being kept as steady as possible, and pressed
                    upon with a mode <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819248"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-9248-0003"/>rate force. The same operation must be repeated
                    with respect to all other lines, till the instrument has thus passed 'over the
                    whole surface of the plate. From the extremities of the other two sides, other
                    lines must then be drawn, which, intersecting the first at right angles, will
                    with them form squares; and the same operation must be repeated with the cradle
                    as in the case of the first. New lines must then be drawn diagonally, and the
                    cradle passed between them as before; and when the first diagonal operation is
                    performed, the lines must be crossed at right angles, like the former, and the
                    cradles passed between them in the same manner. The plates having undergone the
                    action of the cradle according to the disposition of the first order of lines, a
                    second set must be formed, having the same distances from each other as the
                    first. But they must be so placed as to divide those already made into spaces
                    one third less than their whole extent; that is, every one after the first on
                    each side will take in one third of that before it. These lines of the second
                    order must be marked with small letters, or lesser strokes, to distinguish them
                    from the first; and the same treatment of the plate must be pursued with respect
                    to them as was practised for the others. When this second operation is finished,
                    a third order of lines must be made. By these means, the original spaces will be
                    exactly divided into equal thirds; and the cradle must be again employed between
                    those lines, as before. When the whole of this operation is finished, it is
                    called <hi rend="italic">one turn;</hi> but in order to produce a very dark and
                    uniform ground, the plate must undergo the repetition of all these several
                    operations for above twenty times, beginning to pass the cradle again between
                    the first lines, and proceeding in the same manner through all the rest. When
                    the plate is prepared with a proper ground, the sketch must be chalked on it, by
                    rubbing the paper on the back with chalk; and it is also proper to overtrace it
                    afterwards with black lead or Indian ink. The scraping is then performed by
                    paring or cutting away the grain of the ground in various degrees, so that none
                    of it is left in the original state, except in the touches of the strongest
                    shade. The general manner of proceeding is the same as drawing with white upon
                    black paper. The masses of light are first commenced; then those parts which go
                    off into light in their upper part, but are brown below. The reflections are
                    next entered upon, after which the plate is blackened with a printer’s blacking
                    ball made of felt, in order to discover the effect, and then the work is
                    proceeded with, observing always to begin every part in the places where the
                    strongest lights are to be.</p>
                <p>The art of scraping mezzotintos has been applied to that of printing with a
                    variety of colours, in order to produce the resemblance of paintings. The
                    inventor of the method of doing this was Le Blon, a native of Frankfort, and
                    pupil of Carlo Marata, between the years 1720 and 1730. It was established by
                    the inventor upon this principle, that there are three primitive colours, of
                    which all the rest may be composed by mixing them in various proportions; that
                    any two of these colours being mixed together, preserve their original power,
                    and only produce a third colour such as their compound must necessarily give,
                    but if transparent colours be mixed, and three primitive kinds compounded
                    together, they destroy each other, and produce black, or a tendency to it, in
                    proportion to the equality or inequality of the mixture; and that if the three
                    primitive colours be laid, either separately or upon each other, by three
                    plates, engraved correspondent!y on these principles to the colouring of the
                    design, the whole variety of tints necessary may be produced. The requisites,
                    therefore, to the execution of any design in this method of printing are the
                    following: 1. To settle a plan of the colouring to be imitated, showing where
                    the presence of each of the three simple colours is necessary, either in its
                    pure state or combined with some other, to produce the effect required, and to
                    reduce this plan to a painted sketch of each, in which not only the proper
                    outlines, but the degree of strength, shall be expressed; 2. to engrave three
                    plates according to this plan, which may print each of the colours exactly in
                    the places where, and the proportion in which, they are wanted; 3. to find three
                    transparent substances proper for printing with these three primitive colours.
                    The manner in which Μ. le Bion prepared the plates may be briefly stated. The
                    three plates of copper were first well fitted to each other with respect to size
                    and figure, and grounded in the same manner as those designed for mezzotinto
                    prints; and the exact place and boundary of each of the three primitive colours,
                    conformably to the design, were sketched out upon three papers answering in
                    dimensions to the plate. These sketches were then chalked upon the plates; and
                    all the parts of each plate which were not to convey the colour to which it was
                    appropriated to the print were entirely scraped away, as in forming the light of
                    mezzotinto prints. The parts which were to convey the colours were then worked
                    upon; and where the lightest or most diluted tints of the colour were to be, the
                    grain in the ground was proportionally taken off; but where the full colour was
                    required, it was left entire. In this, regard was had not only to the effects of
                    the colour in its simple state, but also to its combined operation, either in
                    producing orange-colour, green, or purple, by its admixture with one alone; and
                    further, to its forming brown, gray, and shades of different degrees, by its
                    co-operation with both the others. But though the greater part of the engraving
                    was performed in the mezzotinto manner, yet the graver was employed occasionally
                    for strengthening the shades, and for correcting the outline where it required
                    great accuracy and steadiness. It was found necessary sometimes to have two
                    separate plates for printing the same colour, in order to produce a stronger
                    effect; but the second plate, which was used to print upon the first, was
                    intended only to glaze and soften the colours in particular parts which might
                    require it. As to the black and brown tints, which could not be so conveniently
                    produced in a due degree by the mixture of the colours, umber and black were
                    likewise used.</p>
                <p>With respect to the order in which the plates are to be applied, it may be proper
                    to observe, that the colour which is least apparent in the picture should be
                    laid on first; that which is between the most and least apparent next; and that
                    which predominates last of all; except where there may be occasion for two
                    plates for the same colour, as was before mentioned, or where there is any
                    required for adding browns and shades.</p>
                <p>Μ. le Blon applied this art to portraits, and showed, by the specimens he
                    produced, the possibility of its being brought, by further improvements, to
                    afford imitations of painting which might have some value. It is, nevertheless,
                    much better adapted to the simpler subjects, where there are fewer intermixtures
                    of colours, and where the accuracy of the reflections and demi-tints are not so
                    essentially necessary to the truth of the design, from the greater latitude of
                    form and disposition of the colour, as in plants, anatomical figures, and some
                    subjects of architecture. But perhaps plates engraved, or rather finished, with
                    the tool, particularly with respect to the outline, would be better accommodated
                    in some of these cases than those prepared only by scraping. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>.</p>
                <p>Μ. Cochin remarks, at the end of an account he has given of Μ. le Blon’s manner,
                    that although this ingenious artist confined his method principally to the use
                    of three colours, yet, should this invention be again taken up and cultivated,
                    there would be more probability of success in using a greater variety; and that
                    several different kinds might be printed by one plate, provided they were laid
                    on in their respectively proper places by printing-balls, which should <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193819261" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9261-0004"/> be used for that
                    colour only. His hint might, however, be very greatly improved by the further
                    assistance of pencils, accommodated to the plates, for laying on the colours in
                    the proper parts.</p>
