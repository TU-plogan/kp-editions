                <p><label type="entry">MILAN</label>, called by the Italians Milano, and by the
                    Germans Mailand or Mayland, is one of the governments into which the Austrian
                    kingdom of Lombardy is divided. It was known as the duchy of Milan, till it came
                    under the dominion of the imperial family of Austria. In the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Italy</hi> of this work, the history of the ancient realm of
                    the Longobards, with its kings of the iron crown, is noticed, as well as the
                    other remarkable events respecting this country; and here we need only state the
                    dates of the principal occurrences under the independent dukedoms.</p>
                <p>The first duke was Gallea2o Visconti, who was installed in that dignity by the
                    Emperor Wenzel in the year 1395; and it continued in his family till the male
                    line became extinct in 1447. France made some urgent efforts to obtain the
                    authority, but these were of no avail, as Francisco Sforza, who had married an
                    illegitimate daughter of the last Visconti, succeeded in gaining possession of
                    the supreme power in this beautiful country, and transmitted it to his
                    successors, who ruled till 1499. At that period Louis XII. king of France, and
                    Francis I. emperor of Germany, laid claim to it. It was long the subject of
                    contention between these two great powers, sometimes possessed by one, sometimes
                    by the other, till after the decisive battle of Pavia in 1525, by which the
                    emperor became master of Milan; and, By the treaty of Madrid in 1556, the
                    possession of it was confirmed, when Francis granted it to Maximilian Sforza, to
                    be held as a fief of the Holy Roman empire. The house of Sforza became extinct
                    in 1535, upon which the Emperor Charles V. granted the duchy to his son Philip
                    the Second, king of Spain. It remained under the power of the heirs of that
                    crown till the war of the succession in 1706, when the events of that contest
                    placed it in the hands of the house of Austria; but, by the treaty of Vienna in
                    1735, and by that of Worms in 1745, several portions of the country were
                    delivered over to the king of Sardinia. The French revolution occasioned a
                    successful invasion and much fighting, which in 1796 produced the ephemeral
                    Cisalpine republic, which was annihilated by the Austrians and Russians in 1799;
                    but the decisive battle of Marengo in 1801 gave the whole country to Bonaparte,
                    who soon erected his kingdom of Italy, with the city of Milan as its capital and
                    the residence of his viceroy. The peace of Paris in 1814 restored it again to
                    the Austrian dominions, under which it has continued to the present day.</p>
                <p>Milan is at present divided into the following nine delegations.</p>
                <p>By a late return, it appears that the males under seventeen years of age were
                    390,634, those between seventeen and twenty-four 88,993, those between
                    twenty-four and thirty-four 105,780, those between thirty-four and forty-six
                    230,405, and those above forty-six were not classed, as the account was taken
                    for military purposes, from which persons above that age are exempt.</p>
                <p>The chief occupation of this body of inhabitants consists in the cultivation of
                    the soil. As that subject has been discussed in what appears its most
                    appropriate place in this work under the head of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Lombardy,</hi> our readers are referred to that article. This government
                    contains 462,700 families, who inhabit 279,160 houses, in fifteen cities,
                    ninety-seven market-towns, and 3217 villages. It is bounded on the east by the
                    government of Venice, on the north by the Swiss cantons, on the west by the
                    territory of Sardinia, and on the south by Parma, Modena, and Sardinia. The
                    northern part is mountainous and sterile, comprehending a portion of the Alps
                    and extensive lakes; but the southern and much the larger part is level and
                    highly fertile, being watered by numerous streams issuing from the lakes, all of
                    which, with their various tributary rivulets, are finally emptied into the Po.
                    There are abundance of canals connected with the rivers and with each other,
                    which are made use of both for the purposes of irrigation and for the conveyance
                    of goods; but on these highly interesting topics we must refer the reader, as
                    before, to the general article <hi rend="smallcaps">Lombardy.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Milan,</hi> a city, the capital of the Austrian kingdom of
                    Lombardy, as well as of the delegation in which it stands. Although it has
                    suffered much by war, and by the political events of the last fifty y <hi
                    rend="subscript"> s</hi> ears, it is still the richest, and, except Naples, the
                    most populous city of Italy. It stands on the river Olona, and, by means of the
                    canal called <hi rend="italic">Naviglio Grande,</hi> is connected with the river
                    Ticino, and, by the Martesana, with the river Adda. From this water intercourse,
                    and from the excellence of the roads in all directions round the city, the
                    markets are supplied with every necessary in the most convenient and easy
                    manner.</p>
                <p>The city is nearly of a circular figure; it is walled, but scarcely defensible
                    against a decided attack; and it is protected by a citadel containing six
                    bastions. The whole compass of the wall is 5900 fathoms, or nearly seven English
                    miles. The longest part, from the <hi rend="italic">Porta Rσmana</hi> to the
                    Porta <hi rend="italic">Sempione,</hi> is 1800 fathoms; and the broadest part,
                    from the <hi rend="italic">Porta Ticenese</hi> to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Porta</hi><hi rend="italic">Orientale,</hi> is 1600 fathoms. The wall is
                    furnished with eleven gates, some of which are the most striking objects of the
                    city, and merit special notice. The most remarkable of these is that at the gate
                    leading to 4icino, which resembles the entrance to a Roman temple. It is built
                    of granite, and consists of colossal pillars of the Ionic order, with an
                    appropriate peristyle; and in connection with it is the fine bridge over the
                    Naviglio Grande. The <hi rend="italic">Arco dclla Pace,</hi> or <hi

                <p>phal arch to celebrate his conquest and dominion over Italy. It was not finished
                    at the fall of Napoleon in 1813, but was completed by the Emperor of Austria in
                    1816, and a name given to it intended to commemorate the return of peace. The
                    pillars, of six feet in circumference and forty feet in height, formed out of a
                    single block of marble, are its most distinguishing ornaments. The arch resting
                    on them, of a breadth nearly equal to that of Constantine, is ornamented with a
                    car of bronze, to which six horses are harnessed, and in which the goddess of
                    victory is seated. The whole building is of white marble, with the various
                    figures and bas-reliefs of bronze.</p>
                <p>The streets of this city are generally narrow and crooked, and rather gloomy from
                    the height of the buildings. One of the streets, the Corso, or High Street, is
                    an exception; it runs through the whole city, is nearly two miles and a half in
                    length, is of great breadth, and on both sides has magnificent and lofty houses.
                    In the whole city the pavement is far better than is usually seen in towns on
                    the Continent. It is composed of small pieces of marble or of granite, and in
                    the middle, where the carriages pass, there are in the narrow streets two, and
                    in the broad streets four, rows of flat granite laid down, on which the wheels
                    run; and for foot passengers there is a similar pavement close to the houses.
                    The streets are kept clean, which is owing to a branch of industry exercised by
                    the poorest people, who collect in baskets whatever filth can be converted into
                    manure, and carry it out of the gates, where it always finds ready
                    purchasers.</p>
                <p>There are in Milan few piazzas or squares, and none either large, fine, or even
                    regular. The Piazza di Duomo is long, but narrow and disfigured by the
                    booth-like shops and buildings that surround it. The Piazza di Mercante has in
                    its centre a porticowhere the traders assemble, but it is small. The Piazza
                    Fontana has a fine fountain, with two excellent figures in marble. The Piazza
                    d’Armi, formerly the Foro Bonaparte, is the best promenade in Milan. It is used
                    as an exercising place for the garrison, stands near the citadel, and on Sundays
                    and holidays is much frequented by the more fashionable part of the inhabitants.
                    It is planted with trees, and is about 600 yards long and 540 broad.</p>
                <p>Amongst the public buildings in Milan, the churches are the most remarkable; the
                    first of which, the <hi rend="italic">Duomo</hi> or cathedral, is the most
                    remarkable. Next to St Peter’s at Rome, it is the largest church in Italy. It is
                    480 feet in length, 285 feet in breadth; the height of the cupola is 240 feet,
                    and of the highest pinnacle 352 feet. This vast edifice, dedicated to St
                    Charles, was commenced so long ago as the year 1386. The various turns of fate
                    that have attended the city have had their influence in retarding or furthering
                    the progress of the work. Under Napoleon, large sums were drawn from the public
                    revenue and applied to this structure; and since the restoration of the Austrian
                    government, the Emperor of Austria has directed 12,000 francs, or about L.500,
                    to be paid monthly till the completion of the edifice. It is now finished,
                    except the placing of a number of statues, for which vacant places are left, and
                    some few ornaments which wait the finishing touch of the artists. The outside of
                    the church, which is wholly of white marble, and which in several places, from
                    the weather, had become black, has been well rubbed, and now appears quite as
                    white as the newer parts.</p>
                <p>It is to be regretted that there is no place from which a good point of view of
                    this cathedral can be obtained. On three sides it is built up by narrow streets,
                    and only the majestic front with its five colossal entrances can be seen from
                    the Piazza di Duomo.</p>
                <p>The whole building is in the Gothic style, but it has been frequently departed
                    from, which is considered by the critics as its greatest,, or, indeed, its only
                    fault. A vast collection of figures from the hands of the most eminent
                    statuaries, to the number of more than 5000, are placed upon the walls, upon the
                    Gothic turrets, and upon the pinnacles. They are images of various saints, all
                    as large as life. Richly-ornamented galleries, with finely-carved volutes and
                    roses, extend from one tower to the other. The roof is a surprising work, which
                    is reached by a winding staircase of two hundred steps, from which the labyrinth
                    of pillars surrounding the spectator has a most singular effect. In the centre
                    of the roof rises the majestic dome, on which is placed a bronze statue of the
                    Virgin Mary.</p>
                <p>The church has five entrances, which lead to that number of divisions, pointed
                    out by fifty-two octagonal marble pillars, eighty-six feet in height, which are
                    bound together at the top by Gothic arches. The altars are numerous and richly
                    ornamented, and on the floor a meridian line was inserted in 1786. The floor is
                    composed of pieces of marble of different colours, by which various ornamental
                    figures are formed. The first entrance to this edifice is most imposing and
                    exciting. The panorama from the top is very gratifying, exhibiting near to it
                    the whole circuit of the city; the verdant fields in contact with it on the
                    south side; the rich plain of Lombardy, extending to the river Po, and
                    terminating with the Apennines, studded with towns, villages, and hamlets,
                    intermingled with vineyards and woods of mulberry trees; whilst on the north the
                    same kind of prospect is bounded by the Alps, having Monte Rosa in front, with
                    ranges of mountains rising one above the other, the most distant rearing their
                    tops into the region of eternal snow. The other ecclesiastical edifices are
                    numerous, being stated to be no less than seventy-nine, most of them of great
                    interest; but our space will admit of noticing but a few of the most remarkable.
                    The imperial collegiate church of St Ambrosio is distinguished by its antiquity;
                    and the most costly ornaments, and numerous objects of art, are to be seen
                    within it. It is a kind of museum for the history of the arts, and is also the
                    church in which the kings of Lombardy of the iron crow n were consecrated. The
                    church of St Alessandro contains valuable treasures in paintings chiefly in <hi
                    rend="italic">fresco,</hi> and sumptuous statuary; whilst the capitals of the
                    pillars that support it are of bronze. The church of St Nazaro is one of the
                    finest and largest in the city, and is adorned with some of those best
                    paintings, both in oil and in fresco, which have immortalised the masters of the
                    Italian school. St Sebastian’s is worthy of notice from its architecture in the
                    rotunda form. It was formerly a Roman temple, and still displays many specimens
                    of its antiquity. It is said to have been one of the three churches which
                    Barbarossa spared from his general devastation. The church of St Fidele unites
                    simplicity with great extent, but its façade is yet unfinished. The St Maria
                    Maggiore contains many very fine ancient paintings, and the monument of St
                    Bernhardin. The celebrated fresco painting of the Last Supper, by Leonardo da
                    Vinci, remains in what was formerly the refectory of the Dominican convent, but
                    is now used as a magazine for hay and straw. It has been much neglected, and the
                    saltpetre, which has extended itself over the wall on which it is painted, has
                    destroyed the glow of the colours, and in many places the paint has peeled off,
                    whilst in others it is covered with mould. Several amongst the civil buildings
                    are deserving of notice. The royal palace, though its exterior makes but little
                    impression, is the residence of the viceroy. It is called the Villa, and
                    contains a magnificent apartment, in which stands .the throne. It contains many
                    curiosities, and amongst the rest the fresco paintings of Appiani. The palace of
                    the archbishop is a fine piece of architecture, and contains an admirable
                    collection of paintings The Palace Marini, now used as an office for the public
                    accounts, is considered as the most perfect, as it is one of the largest,
                    buildings in Milan. Besides these edifices, the mint, in which <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193820054" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0054-0065"/>is a fine statue of Philip
                    II. of Spain, the Villa Belgioso, the palaces of the families of Serbelloni, of
                    Cicona, of Litta, of Melzi, of Andreani, of Borromeo, and of numerous others,
                    are of great extent, as well as of various kinds of architecture, and produce
                    much interest amid the general aspect of the city.</p>
                <p>Of modern buildings, the barracks, erected under the viceroyship of Eugene
                    Beauharnois, are the largest, the most handsome, and the most convenient, of any
                    pile of the kind in Europe.</p>
                <p>The establishments and the erections devoted to the sciences, to literature, and
                    to the fine arts, are the most distinguishing objects on which the Milanese can
                    pride themselves. Above all others is the Brera, formerly the college of the
                    Jesuits, and before them of a brotherhood called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Umiliati</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> at present it is connected with the
                    university of Pavia. The interior square of the building is surrounded with
                    colonnades, on the ground floor composed of Doric, and on the upper floor with
                    Ionic pillars, forming open halls. The tower of this edifice is employed as an
                    astronomical observatory, and the garden is made use of for the purpose of
                    botany. The ground floor is adapted for lecture-rooms, and the upper floor
                    contains a library of more than 100,000 volumes and numerous valuable
                    manuscripts. Adjoiningto it is the picture-gallery, containing many excellent
                    productions, especially some most valuable fresco paintings, which have been
                    preserved and removed from the churches and monasteries in and around the city.
                    On the upper story are apartments, wherein is a collection of numerous casts of
                    ancient and modern sculpture in plaster of Paris, and also one of coins and
                    medals.</p>
                <p>The next in celebrity of the libraries in Milan is the Ambrosian, founded by
                    Cardinal Borromeo. It consists of 60,000 volumes of books, and 15,000 of
                    manuscripts, now bound so as to form only 6000 volumes. With this, in some other
                    apartments, are connected collections of pictures and of statuary, both of great
                    merit. Besides these public establishments, there are many collections of old
                    and valuable works in the libraries Fagnani, Melzi, Reina, Litta, Archinto, and
                    Trivulzi.</p>
                <p>In this large city, where the destitute, the aged, and the infirm, are very
                    numerous, the institutions for their relief are upon a commensurate scale. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Ospitale Maggiore</hi> is a prodigious range of building, with
                    a beautiful front, entered by magnificent portals of 450 feet in length. The
                    usual number of patients contained in it is from 3700 to 4000. With this is
                    connected the foundling hospital, in which 1100 children are maintained within
                    the walls, and about 2900 are sent to board in the villages around the city.
                    There is also a large lying-in-hospital; a lunatic asylum, in which are kept
                    generally 420 insane persons; the lazaretto, containing many small houses
                    without the gates, as a precaution against the plague; the Trivulzi, which
                    contains 480 poor of both sexes, above seventy years of age, who are maintained
                    by property bequeathed to it by the noble family of that name; an orphan-house,
                    which supports 350 young persons, and several smaller institutions. Besides
                    these, the monks and the nuns of the order of mercy have each their benevolent
                    establishments.</p>
                <p>The places of amusement are not numerous, though upon a large scale. The
                    opera-house, <hi rend="italic">Della Scala,</hi> is one of the most extensive
                    theatres of Europe. It was built in 1776, on the site of an ancient church of
                    that name. It contains 240 boxes in six tiers, one above the other, and has
                    seats for 800 persons in the pit, besides standing room in the centre and both
                    sides of it, so that it is calculated to contain 7000 spectators. The
                    performers, both in music and dancing, are of the very first class during the
                    fashionable season. There is also another, the imperial theatre, or Canobbianca,
                    and four or five snlall private theatres.</p>
                <p>The city, including the suburbs and the garrison, contains 163,000 inhabitants.
                    The chief wholesale trade consists in silk, either raw or spun, and in cheese;
                    for the particulars of which see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Lombardy</hi>
                    in this work. The retail trade is much divided, and consists in that usually
                    carried on in large cities, which it dispenses to the towns and the villages
                    around it for domestic use. As Milan is a kind of metropolis to the north of
                    Italy, and resorted to in the winter by the rich, at that time of the year the
                    tradesmen are in full occupation; but at other seasons they have little
                    occupation, except what arises from the foreign visitors.</p>
                <p>The city, by observation taken at the cathedral, is in long. 9. 5. 45. E. and
                    lat. 45. 27. 35. N.</p>
