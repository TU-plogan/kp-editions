                    Chancellor of England, was the son of Sir John More, knight, one of the judges
                    of the King’s Bench, and born in the year 1480, in Milk Street, London. He was
                    first sent to a school at St Anthony’s, in Threadneedle Street, and afterwards
                    introduced into the family of Cardinal Moreton, who in 1497 sent him to
                    Canterbury College, Oxford. During his residence at the university he constantly
                    attended the prelections of Linacre and Grocinus, upon the Greek and Latin
                    languages. Having in about two years made considerable proficiency in academical
                    learning, he came to New Inn, in London, to study the law; and, after some time,
                    he removed thence to Lincoln’s Inn, of which his father was a member.
                    Notwithstanding his application to the law, however, being now about the age of
                    twenty, he was so attached to monkish discipline, that he wore a hair shirt next
                    his skin, practised frequent fastings, and often slept on a bare plank. In the
                    year 1503, being then a burgess in parliament, he distinguished himself in the
                    house, in opposition to the motion for granting a subsidy and three fifteenths
                    for the marriage of Henry VII.’s eldest daughter, Margaret, to the king of
                    Scotland. The motion was rejected, and the king was so highly offended at this
                    opposition from a beardless boy, that he revenged himself on More’s father, by
                    sending him, on a frivolous pretence, to the Tower, and obliging him to pay
                    L.100 for his liberty. Being now called to the bar, More was appointed
                    law-reader at Furnival’s Inn, which place he held during three years; but about
                    this time he also delivered, with great applause, a public lecture in the Church
                    of St Lawrence, Old Jewry, upon <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> St Augustin’s

                    friar, but he was dissuaded fromcarrying it into effect; and, by the advice of
                    Dr Colet, he married Jane, the eldest daughter of Mr John Colt of Newhall, in
                    the county of Essex. In 1508 he was appointed judge of the Sheriff’s Court in
                    the city of London, was made a justice of the peace, and became eminent at the
                    bar. In 1516 he went to Flanders in the retinue of Bishop Tonstal and Dr Knight,
                    who were sent by Henry VIII. to renew the alliance with the archduke of Austria,
                    afterwards Charles V. On his return, Cardinal Wolsey wished to engage More in
                    the service of the crown, and offered him a pension, which he refused.
                    Nevertheless, it was not long before he accepted the place of master of the
                    requests, was created a knight, admitted of the privy council, and in 1520 made
                    .treasurer of the exchequer. About this time he built a house on the banks of
                    the Thames, at Chelsea, and married a second wife. This lady, by name Middleton,
                    and a widow, was old, ill tempered, and covet ous; nevertheless, Erasmus says,
                    he was as fond of her as if she had been a young maid.</p>
                <p>In the fourteenth year of Henry VIII. Sir Thomas More was made speaker of the
                    House of Commons, and in this capacity he had the resolution to oppose the then
                    powerful minister, Wolsey, in his demand of an oppressive subsidy; but
                    notwithstanding this, it was not long before he became chancellor of the duchy
                    of Lancaster, and was treated by the king with singular familiarity. The king
                    having once dined with Sir Thomas at Chelsea, walked with him nearly an hour in
                    the garden, with his arm round his neck. After he was gone, Mr Roper, Sir
                    Thomas’s son-in-law, observed how happy he was to be so familiarly treated by
                    the king. To this Sir Thomas replied, “I thank our lord, son Roper, I find his
                    grace my very good lord indeed, and believe he doth as singularly favour me as
                    any subject within this realm; howbeit, I must tell thee, I have no cause to be
                    proud thereof, for if my head would win him a castle in France, it would not
                    fail to go off.” From this anecdote it appears that Sir Thomas fully appreciated
                    the king’s real character.</p>
                <p>In 1526 he was sent with Cardinal Wolsey and others on a joint embassy to France,
                    and in 1529 accompanied Bishop Tonstal to Cambray. The king, it seems, was so
                    well satisfied with his services on these occasions, that in the following year,
                    when Wolsey fell into disgrace, he made him chancellor; a circumstance which
                    seems the more extraordinary, as we are informed that Sir Thomas had repeatedly
                    declared his disapprobation of that divorce, upon which the great Defender of
                    the Faith was then so earnestly bent. Having executed the office of chancellor
                    for about three years, with equal wisdom and integrity, he resigned the seals in
                    1533, probably to avoid the danger of a refusal to confirm the king’s divorce.
                    He now retired to his house at Chelsea, dismissed many of his servants, sent his
                    children with their respective families to their own houses (for hitherto he
                    had, it seems, maintained all his children, with their families, in his own
                    house, in the true style of an ancient patriarch), and spent his time in study
                    and devotion. But the capricious tyrant would not permit him to enjoy
                    tranquillity. Though now reduced to a private station, and even to indigence,
                    his opinion of the legality of the king’s marriage with Anne Boleyn was deemed
                    of so much importance, that various means were tried to procure his approbation;
                    but all persuasion having proved ineffectual, he was, with some others,
                    attainted of misprision of treason, for encouraging Elizabeth Barton, the nun of
                    Kent, in.her treasonable practices. His innocence in this affair appeared so
                    clearly, however, that thèy were obliged to strike his name out of the bill. He
                    was then accused of other crimes, but with the same effect; until, refusing to
                    take the oath enjoined by the act of supremacy, he was committed to the Tower,
                    and, after fifteen months’ imprisonment, brought to trial at the bar of the
                    King’s Bench for high treason, in denying the king’s supremacy. The proof rested
                    solely on the evidence of Rich the solicitor-general, whom Sir Thomas, in his
                    defence, sufficiently discredited; nevertheless the jury brought him in guilty,
                    and he was condemned to suffer death as a traitor. The merciful Henry, however,
                    indulged him with simple decollation; and he was accordingly beheaded on Tower
                    Hill, on the 5th of July 1535. His body, which was first interred in the Tower,
                    was begged by his daughter Margaret, and deposited in the chancel of the church
                    at Chelsea, where a monument, with an inscription written by himself, had been
                    erected some time before. This monument, with the inscription, is still to be
                    seen in that church. The same daughter, Margaret, also procured his head after
                    it had remained fourteen days upon London Bridge, and placed it in a vault
                    belonging to the Roper family, under a chapel adjoining to St Dunstan’s Church,
                    in Canterbury. Sir Thomas More was a <pb break="no"

                    learning, and an upright judge; austere in religion, yet cheerful, and even
                    affectedly witty.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This
                    last disposition, we are told, he could not restrain even at his execution. The
                    day being come, he ascended the scaffold, which seemed so weak that it was ready
                    to fall to pieces; whereupon he said, “I pray, see me safe up; and for my coming
                    down, let me shift for myself.” His prayers being ended, he turned to the
                    executioner, and with a cheerful countenance said, “Pluck up thy spirits, man,
                    and be not afraid to do thy office; my neck is very short, take heed therefore
                    thou strike not awry for saving thy honesty.” Then laying his head upon the
                    block, he bade him stay until he had put aside his beard, saying that it had
                    never committed any treason.</p></note> Picty was a principal ingredient in his
                    character, and he was equally devout and exemplary in all his conduct. In his
                    hours of relaxation he had recourse to music, and had always a person to read to
                    him whilst he sat at table, in order to prevent improper conversation before his
                    children and servants. He lived in habits of intimacy with the most learned men
                    of his time, particularly Erasmus, who held the first place in his affections,
                    and deserved his esteem; nor was he less respected and admired abroad. When the
                    Emperor Charles V. heard of his death, he said to the English ambassador, Sir
                    Thomas Elliot, “I understand that the king, your master, has put to death his
                    faithful servant and wise counsellor Sir Thomas More.” The ambassador answered
                    that he had heard nothing of the matter. “It is too true,” replied the emperor;
                    “and this I will say, that if I had been master of such a servant, of whose
                    abilities I have, these many years, had no little experience, I would rather
                    have lost the best city in my dominions than so worthy a counsellor.” It is even
                    said that the ruthless tyrant, who had pursued him with inflexible perseverance
                    to the scaffold, felt some compunctious visitings of remorse when the thirst of
                    vengeance had ceased to operate; and, upon receiving the news of his execution,
                    observed to Anne Boleyn, “Thou art the cause of this man’s death ;” after which
                    he hastily withdrew, and shut himself up in an adjoining chamber.</p>
                <p>Sir Thomas More was the author of various works, both in English and in Latin, of
                    which the best known and most generally esteemed is his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Utopia.</hi> His English works were collected and published by order of Queen
                    Mary in 1557; his Latin works appeared at Basil in 1563, and at Louvain in 1566;
                    and both show that he was thoroughly conversant with every branch of polite
                    learning. For a minute account of his works, the reader is referred to Oldys’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Librarian,</hi> and preface to Dibdin’s edition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Utopia.</hi> The best, because the most discriminating and
                    judicious character of More, is that drawn by Sir James Mackintosh in his <hi
                    rend="italic">History of England</hi> (vol. ii. p. 177, et seq.), to which the
                    reader is referred. “He was the first Englishman who signalised himself as an
                    orator, the first writer of prose which is still intelligible, and probably the
                    first layman since the beginning of authentic history who was chancellor of
                    England, a magistracy which has been filled by as many memorable men as any
                    office of a civilized community.”</p>
                <p>This excellent person left one son and three daughters; of whom Margaret, the
                    eldest, was remarkable for her knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages. She
                    married Mr Roper of Wellhall, in Kent, whose life of Sir Thomas More was
                    published by Mr Hearne at Oxford in 1716. Mrs Roper died in 1544, and was buried
                    in the vault of St Dunstan’s in Canterbury, with her father’s head in her
                    arms.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">More,</hi><hi rend="italic">Hannah,</hi> a distinguished
                    writer of religious and moral works, was born at Stapleton, in Gloucestershire,
                    in the year 1745. Her father held the humble situation of village schoolmaster;
                    but his sobriety and diligence were such as to secure for him an appointment to
                    the parochial school of St Mary Redcliff, at Bristol. Here his daughter gained
                    the intimacy and patronage of Dr Stonehousc, and opened an establishnιent for
                    boarders, having previously, through the same interest, been enabled to set on
                    foot a flourishing and respectable day-school. Her first literary efforts were
                    some poetical pieces, written for the edification of her pupils, and amongst
                    them was a pastoral drama. Manuscript copies of these pieces were seen and
                    admired by several persons of literary taste and discrimination at Bristol, who
                    strongly recommended their publication. They accordingly appeared, and the
                    drama, which was entitled the Search after Happiness, soon became very popular.
                    This flattering reception having induced the author to try her strength in the
                    highest walk of dramatic poetry, she successively brought upon the stage her
                    tragedies of the Inflexible Captive, Percy, and the Fatal Falsehood, which
                    closed her dramatic career. Mr Garrick was warmly attached to her, and, by the
                    exertion of his wonderful histrionic powers in the second of these compositions,
                    it was enacted at Drury Lane during fourteen successive nights; but none of her
                    dramas now retain any hold of the stage. Soon after the production of her first
                    tragedy, she published two legendary poems, entitled Sir Eldred of the Bower,
                    and the Bleeding Rock, founded upon popular traditions current in Somersetshire.
                    These pieces had very great success, as had also her volume of Essays for Young
                    Ladies, which she afterwards expunged from the edition of her works published
                    in*1801, on the ground that the book was superseded by her Treatise on Female
                    Education.</p>
                <p>In 1782, Hannah More greatly added to her reputation by the publication of a
                    volume of Sacred Dramas, to which was annexed a poem called Sensibility, which
                    was much commended by Dr Johnson, then the autocrat of literature. Being asked
                    his opinion of the author on one occasion, he replied, “I know and esteem her
                    well, Sir; and I think her the best of all our female versifiers.” In 1786, this
                    indefatigable writer gave to the world two poems, Florio, a tale, and Bas Bleu,
                    or the Conversation. The first is a respectable and not ill-natured satire on
                    the frivolous manners of the young gentlemen of the period. The second is also a
                    satire on the Blue Stocking Club, which met at Mrs Montagu’s, in Portman Square,
                    and was so called from one of the members always wearing that article of dress.
                    Other works successively proceeded from her pen. Of these the principal are, a
                    Poem on the Slave Trade, printed in 1788; a tract entitled Thoughts on the
                    Manners of the Great, which appeared the same year; an Estimate of the Religion
                    of the Fashionable World, published in the year 1791, and esteemed one of her
                    best productions; Remarks on the Speech of Μ. Dupont, in the National
                    Convention, on Religion and Education (the speaker had openly avowed atheism in
                    that assembly); and further, with the view of opposing the propagation of
                    sedition and infidelity, she, in 1795, commenced at Bath, the Cheap Repository,
                    which was published in monthly numbers, and contained several very <hi
                    rend="subscript"> t</hi> pleasingly written tales. This periodical obtained a
                    very wide circulation, and was said to have had considerable effect in calming
                    the public mind, then agitated by the doctrines so prevalent in France.</p>
                <p>Mrs More now removed from Bristol to Cheddar, where objects of misery having
                    deeply affected her sympathetic and religious feelings, she opened a number of
                    schools for educating the poor children, and alleviating their misery. Her
                    benevolent designs were at first strenuously opposed; but she ultimately
                    succeeded in establishing a number of schools, not only at Cheddar, but all
                    round the Mendip Hills; and the good effects which they produced soon became
                    apparent. In 1799 appeared her Strictures on the Modern System of Female
                    Education, three editions <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825644?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-5644-0495"/> of which issued from the press in the same year.
                    This work was censured by some of the critics as too austere; but
                    notwithstanding this circumstance, she was called upon by the highest,
                    personages in the realm to put her sentiments in writing on the proper course of
                    instruction to be adopted for the infant heiress to the British throne. She set
                    diligently to work to obey the royal commands, and produced, in 1805, a work in
                    two volumes, under the unassuming title of Hints towards forming the Character
                    of a Young Princess. It gave high satisfaction generally; but offence was taken
                    in one quarter, and much abuse was in consequence poured upon it. In the year
                    1809 was published Coelebs in Search of a Wife; two years afterwards appeared
                    Practical Piety, and Christian Morals; in 1815 came out an Essay on the
                    Character and Writings of St Paul; and, soon after her sister Martha’s death in
                    1819, the literary career of Mrs More terminated with the publication of Modern
                    Sketches. She was now aged and infirm, but still continued to take a great
                    interest in the welfare of charity schools, bible and missionary societies, and
                    other benevolent and religious institutions. Her piety supported her in her
                    later afflictions, and she expired with the composure, and full of the hope and
                    faith, of a Christian, on the 7th of September 1833. She is said to have
                    realised L.30,000 by her works, a very considerable proportion of which she
                    bequeathed to religious and benevolent societies.</p>
                <p>The works of Hannah More have always been highly esteemed by the religious world,
                    and she is generally considered as one of the most distinguished of that class
                    of writers who unite great piety with considerable literary talent, and dedicate
                    the creations of fancy as well as the deductions of reason to the service of
                    religion. Her poetry is not much prized, except by a select few, for the piety
                    and sound judgment which it displays. In this respect it bears a general
                    resemblance to the verse of Cowper; but it is not very copiously embued with
                    that fine ethereal spirit, which alone can give vitality and soul to the
                    inspirations of the muse. Her prose is justly admired for its sententious
                    wisdom, its practical good sense, its masculine vigour, and the dignified
                    religious and moral fervour which pervades it. Coelebs passed through six
                    editions in one year; and since its first appearance it has frequently been
                    reprinted, besides being translated into several foreign languages. (ιι. <hi
