                <p><label type="entry">MOGULS</label>, a celebrated nation of Asia, whose conquests
                    in former times were the most rapid and extensive of any people recorded in
                    history. They themselves deduce their origin from Japhet, or, as they call him,
                    <hi rend="italic">Japhis,</hi> the son of Noah. His son Turk was, according to
                    them, the first king, or khan, of those nations who are now known by the
                    separate denominations of <hi rend="italic">Turks, Tartars,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Moguls;</hi> and the Tartars especially assert, that their proper
                    designation is <hi rend="italic">Turks.</hi> To this prince is attributed many
                    of those inventions which barbarous nations commonly ascribe to their first
                    sovereigns. He was succeeded by Taunak, in whose reign the whole posterity of
                    Turk were divided into four large tribes, denominated the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ordas</hi> of Erlat, Gialair, Kaugin, and Ber-las or Perlas; from the last of
                    which the famous Timour-Beg, or Tamerlane, was descended. From this time till
                    that of Alanza Khan we meet with nothing remarkable. In the reign of Alanza, the
                    Turks, being immersed in all kinds of luxury, universally apostatized ‘into
                    idolatry. Having two sons, Tartar and Mogul, he divided his dominions between
                    them, and thus gave rise to the two empires of the Tartars and Moguls.</p>
                <p>These two nations had not long existed before they began to make war upon each
                    other; and after long contention, the event at last was, that II Khan, emperor
                    of the Moguls, was totally overthrown by Siuntz Khan, emperor of the Tartars;
                    and so complete was the defeat that the Mogul nation seems to have been almost
                    exterminated. Only two of II Khan’s family survived this disaster. These were
                    Kajan his youngest son, and Nagos his nephew, who were both of the same age, and
                    had both been married the same year. These two princes,.with their wives, had
                    been taken prisoners by Siuntz Khan, but found means to effect their escape to
                    their own country, where they seized upon all the cattle which had not been
                    carried off by the Tartars, an act that was easily done, as there were none to
                    dispute the property with them; then stripping some of the slain, they took
                    their clothes and retired into the mountains. They passed several mountains
                    without much difficulty, and at last advanced to the foot of one exceedingly
                    high, which had no way over it but a very small path made by certain animals,
                    called, in the Tartar language, <hi rend="italic">archara.</hi> This path they
                    found themselves obliged to make use of, although it was so narrow and steep
                    that only one could pass at a time, and he was in the most imminent danger of
                    breaking his neck at the least false step. Having ascended the mountain on one
                    side by this path, they descended by the same on the other; and were very
                    agreeably surprised to find themselves in a most delightful tract, interspersed
                    with rivulets and charming meadows, abounding with a vast variety of delicious
                    fruits, and enclosed on all sides by inaccessible mountains, in such a manner as
                    to shelter them from the future pursuits of the Tartars. Here they lived some
                    time, and gave this beautiful country the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Irgana-kon,</hi> in allusion to its situation; <hi rend="italic">irgana</hi>
                    signifying, in the old language of the Moguls, a valley, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >kon,</hi> a steep height.</p>
                <p>In process of time these two families increased greatly. Kajan, whose posterity
                    was the most numerous, called his descendants <hi rend="italic">Kajatk</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but the people springing from Nagos were divided into two
                    tribes, one of which received the appellation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nagosler,</hi> and the other that of <hi rend="italic">Durlagan.</hi></p>
                <p>The two Mogul princes and their descendants lived in this place for more than
                    four hundred years; but the latter having found it too narrow for them,
                    meditated a return to the country from which their forefathers had been driven.
                    For some time, however, this proved impracticable, as the path which conducted
                    their ancestors had been long previously destroyed. At last they discovered that
                    one part of the high mountain above mentioned was not very thick in a certain
                    place; and also, that it consisted entirely of iron ore. To this, having before
                    set fire to a layer of wood, and another of charcoal, placed along the foot of
                    the mountain, they applied seventy large bellows, and at last melted the
                    mountain in such a manner that an opening was made, large enough for a loaded
                    camel to pass; and through this passage they all marched out with great joy.</p>
                <p>The Moguls having thus issued as it were from a new <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193823317" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3317-0316"/>world, overthrew the Tartars
                    in their turn, and continued to form a considerable nation till the time of
                    their great hero Temujin, afterwards called Genghiz Khan, whom they extol in the
                    most extravagant manner. It is difficult however, to say, at the time when
                    Temujin made his appearance, how far the dominions of the Moguls extended, or in
                    what estimation they were held by their neighbours. It seems to be pretty
                    certain that great part of the vast region now known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Tartary</hi> was then in a state of considerable civilization, and
                    likewise extremely populous, as we find mention made of many cities which the
                    Moguls destroyed; and the incredible multitudes whom they slaughtered abundantly
                    prove the populousness of the country. On the east, the country of the Moguls
                    and Tartars had the great desert which divides Tartary from China; on the west
                    it had the empire of Karazm, founded by Mahmoud Gazni; and on the south were the
                    countries now known by the name of Hindustan, Siam, Pegu, Tonquin, and
                    Cochin-China. Thus it comprehended the eastern part of Modern Tartary, and all
                    Siberia. This whole region was divided amongst a great number of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ay-macks</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tribes,</hi> who had each one
                    or more khans, according as it happened to be more or less numerous, or divided
                    into branches. Amongst these, that of the <hi rend="italic">Kara-its</hi> was
                    the most powerful. Their prince assumed the title of <hi rend="italic">Great
                    Khan,</hi> and, amongst the rest, the Moguls were tributary to him; but,
                    according to the Chinese historians, both the one and the other were tributary
                    to the emperor of Kitay or Katay.</p>
                <p>China was divided into two parts; the nine southern provinces being in the hands
                    of the Chinese emperors of the Song dynasty, who kept their court at Hang-chew,
                    the capital of the province of Chekyang; and the five northern provinces,
                    excepting part of Shensi, being possessed by the Kin, a people of Eastern
                    Tartary, from whom are descended the Manchoo Tartars, who are at present masters
                    of China. This vast dominion was named <hi rend="italic">Kitay</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Katay,</hi> and was divided into two parts; that which belonged to
                    China was properly called <hi rend="italic">Kitay</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and the part which belonged to Tartary was called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Karakitay,</hi> in which some even include the territories of the Moguls,
                    Kara-its, and other tribes which form the subject of the present history. The
                    western part of the empire of Kitay was possessed by a Turkish prince, who had
                    lately founded there a new kingdom called <hi rend="italic">Hya,</hi> and whose
                    capital city was Hya-chew, now Ninghya in Shensi, from which the kingdom took
                    its name. To the west of Hya lay Tangut, a country of great extent, and formerly
                    very powerful, but at that time reduced to a low state, and divided amongst many
                    princes, some of whom were subject to the emperor of Hya, and others to the
                    emperor of China. All Tartary to the westward as far as the Caspian Sea, with
                    the greater part of Little Buckharia, which then passed under the general name
                    of <hi rend="italic">Turkestan,</hi> was subject to Ghnrkhan, Khurkhan, or Kaver
                    Khan; to whom even the Gazni monarchs are said to have been tributary. This
                    Ghurkhan had been prince of the Western Kitan or Lyau, who, when driven out of
                    Kitay by the king, settled in Little Buckharia, and the country to the north,
                    where they founded a powerful state about the year 1124.</p>
                <p>Thus the Moguls, properly so called, had but a very small extent of empire which
                    could be called their own, if indeed they had any, when Temujin made his
                    appearance. This hero is believed by the Tartars to have been of divine origin,
                    since his family could be traced no farther back than ten generations. The names
                    and transactions of his predecessors are equally uncertain and unimportant. He
                    himself, however, was born in the year 1163, and is said to have come into the
                    world with congealed blood in his hands; whence it was prognosticated that he
                    would be a great warrior, and obtain the victory over all his enemies.</p>
                <p>This prediction, if any such there was, Temujin most literally fulfilled. At the
                    time of his father’s decease, his subjects amounted to between thirty and forty
                    thousand families; but of these about two thirds quickly deserted, and Temujin
                    was left almost without subjects. When only thirteen years of age, he fought a
                    bloody battle against these revolters; but he was either defeated, or gained an
                    indecisive victory, so that he remained in obscurity for twenty-seven years
                    longer. His good fortune at last he owed to the friendship of Vang Khan, who
                    ruled over a great number of Tartar tribes to the north of Kitay, and has been
                    heard of under the name of <hi rend="italic">Prester John</hi> amongst the
                    Europeans. This prince took Temujin under his protection; and a rebellion having
                    afterwards been raised against himself, Temujin was made his general, and the
                    khan was kept in possession of his throne. Soon after this, Temujin subdued the
                    tribes which had revolted from himself, and treated them with the utmost
                    barbarity.</p>
                <p>This happened in the year 1201; but Vang Khan, instead of continuing the friend
                    of Temujin, now became jealous, and resolved to destroy him by treachery. With
                    this view he proposed a marriage between Temujin’s son Juji and his own
                    daughter, and another between Temujin’s daughter and his own son. Temujin was
                    invited to the camp of Vang Khan, in order to celebrate this double marriage;
                    but having received intelligence of some evil intention against him, he excused
                    himself to Vang Khan’s messengers, and desired that the ceremony might be put
                    off to some other time.</p>
                <p>A few days after the departure of these messengers, Badu and Kishlik, two
                    brothers, who kept the horses of one of Vang Khan’s chief domestics, came and
                    informed Temujin, that the Grand Khan, finding he had missed his aim, was
                    resolved to set out instantly, and to surprise him next morning, before he could
                    suspect any danger. Temujin, alarmed at this intelligence, quitted his camp in
                    the night time, and retired with all his people to some distance. He was
                    scarcely gone when Vang Khan’s troops arrived, and discharged an incredible
                    number of arrows amongst the empty tents; but finding nobody there, they pursued
                    Temujin in such haste that they fell into great disorder. In this condition they
                    were suddenly attacked and routed by Temujin, after which ensued an open war
                    with Vang Khan.</p>
                <p>By this quarrel almost all the princes of Tartary were put in motion, some taking
                    part with Temujin, and others with Vang Khan. But at last fortune declared in
                    favour of the former. Vang Khan was overthrown in a battle, where he lost forty
                    thousand men, and was obliged to fly for refuge to a prince named Tayyan Khan,
                    who was Temujin’s father-in-law, and his own enemy, and by whom he was
                    ungenerously put to death. Temujin immediately began to seize on his dominions,
                    great part of which voluntarily submitted; but a confederacy was formed against
                    him by a number of Vang Khan’s tributaries, at the head of whom was Jamuka,a
                    prince who had already distinguished himself by his enmity to Temujin; and even
                    Tayyan Khan himself was drawn into the plot, through jealousy of his
                    son-in-law’s good fortune. But Temujin was well prepared; and in the year 1204
                    he attacked Tayyan Khan, entirely routed his army, killed himself, and took
                    Jamuka prisoner, whose head he caused instantly to be struck off; after which he
                    marched against the other tribes who had conspired against him. These he quickly
                    reduced; took a city called Kashin, where he put all to the sword who had borne
                    arms against him; and subjugated all the Mogul tribes in 1205.</p>
                <p>Temujin having now none to oppose him, called a general diet, which he appointed
                    to be held on the first day of the spring in the year 1206; that is, on the day
                    in which the sun entered Aries. To this diet were summoned all the great <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193823330" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3330-0317"/> lords, both
                    Moguls and Tartars; and in the mean time, to establish good order in the army,
                    he divided his soldiers into bodies of ten thousand, a thousand, a hundred, and
                    ten men, with their respective officers, all subordinate to the generals, or
                    those who commanded the bodies of ten thousand; and these were to act under his
                    own sons. On the day of holding the diet, the princes of the blood and great
                    lords appeared dressed in white. Tcmujin, habited in the same manner, with his
                    crown on his head, sat down on his throne, and was complimented by the whole
                    assembly, who wished him the continuance of his health and prosperity. After
                    this they confirmed the Mogul empire to him and his successors, adding all those
                    kingdoms which he had subdued, the descendants of whose vanquished khans were
                    deprived of all right or title to them; and after this he was proclaimed emperor
                    with much ceremony. During this inauguration, a pretended prophet declared that
                    he came from God to tell the assembly, that thenceforth Temujin should assume
                    and bear the name of “Genghiz Khan,” or “the Most Great Khan of khans
                    prophesying also, that his posterity should be khans from generation to
                    generation. This prophecy, which was no doubt prompted by Temujin himself, had a
                    surprising effect on his subjects, who from that time concluded that all the
                    world belonged of right to them, and even thought it a crime against heaven for
                    any body to pretend to resist them.</p>
                <p>Genghiz Khan having now reduced under his subjection all the wandering tribes of
                    Moguls and Tartars, began to think of subjugating those countries to the south
                    and southwest of his own, where the inhabitants were much more civilized than
                    his own subjects; and the countries being full of fortified cities, he must of
                    course expect to meet with more resistance. He began with the emperor of Hya,
                    whose dominions he invaded in 1209, and who at last submitted to become his
                    tributary. But in the mean time Genghiz Khan himself was supposed to be
                    tributary to the emperor of Kitay, who, in 1210, sent him an officer demanding
                    the customary tribute. This was refused with the utmost indignation, and a war
                    commenced, which ended only with the dissolution of the empire of Kitay.</p>
                <p>In the year 1216, Genghiz Khan resolved to carry his arms westward, and therefore
                    left his general Muchuli to pursue his conquests in Kitay. In his journey
                    westward he overthrew an army of three hundred thousand Tartars who had revolted
                    against him; and in 1218 he sent ambassadors desiring an alliance with Mohammed
                    Karazm Shah, emperor of Gazna. His ambassador was haughtily treated; the
                    alliance was, however, concluded, but soon afterwards broken, through the
                    treachery, as it is said, of the Karazmian monarch’s subjects. This brought on a
                    war, attended with the most dreadful devastations, and which ended with the
                    entire destruction of the empire of Karazm or Gazna.</p>
                <p>After the reduction of Karazm, part of the Moguls broke into Iran or Persia,
                    where they also made large conquests, whilst others of their armies invaded
                    Georgia and the countries to the west; in both cases committing such enormities
                    that the Chinese historians say both men and spirits burst with indignation. In
                    1225, Genghiz Khan returned to Hya, where he made war upon the emperor for
                    having sheltered some of his enemies. The event was, that the emperor fell in
                    battle, and his kingdom was conquered, or rather destroyed; but this was the
                    last exploit of the cruel conqueror, who died in 1227, as he marched to complete
                    the destruction of the Chinese.</p>
                <p>The Mogul empire, at the death of Genghiz Khan, extended over a prodigious tract
                    of country, being more than eighteen hundred leagues in length from east to
                    west, and upwards of a thousand in breadth from north to south. Its princes,
                    however, were still insatiable, and pushed their conquests upon all sides. Oktay
                    was acknowledged emperor after Genghiz Khan, and had under his immediate
                    government Mogulestan, or the country of the Moguls properly so called, with
                    Kitay, and the countries eastward to the Tartarian Sea. Jagaty, his brother,
                    governed under him a great part of the western conquests. The country of the
                    Kipjacks, and others to the east and north-cast, north and north-west, were
                    governed by Batu or Patu, the son of Juji, who had been killed in the wars;
                    whilst Tuli or Toley, another son of Genghiz Khan, had Khorassan, Persia, and
                    that part of India which had been conquered. On the east side the Mogul arms
                    were still attended with success; not only the empire of Kitay, but the southern
                    part of China, was conquered. On the west side matters continued much in the
                    same way till the year 1254, when Magu, or Menkho, the fourth khan of the
                    Moguls, raised a great army, which he gave to his brother Hulaku or Hulagu, in
                    order to extend his dominions westward. In 1255 he entered Iran, where he
                    suppressed the Ismaelians or Assassins, of whom an account is given under the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Assassins</hi>; and two years afterwards he
                    advanced to Bagdad, which he took, and cruelly put to death the caliph, treating
                    the city with no more lenity than the Moguls usually treated those places which
                    fell into their hands. Every thing was put to fire and sword; and in the city
                    and its neighbourhood the number of slain, it is said, amounted to one million
                    six hundred thousand. The next year he invaded Syria. The city of Damascus was
                    delivered up, and, as it made no resistance, the inhabitants were spared; but
                    Aleppo being taken by storm, a greater slaughter ensued there than had taken
                    place at Bagdad, not even the children in their cradles being spared. Some
                    cities of this country revolted the next year, or the year after; but having
                    again fallen into the hands of the Moguls, they were plundered, and the
                    inhabitants butchered without mercy, or carried into slavery.</p>
                <p>Hulaku died in 1264, and at his death we may fix the greatest extent of the Mogul
                    empire. It now comprehended the whole of the continent of Asia, excepting part
                    of Hindustan, Siam, Pegu, Cochin-China, and a few of the countries of Lesser
                    Asia, which had not been attacked by them; and during all these vast conquests
                    no Mogul army had ever been conquered, except one by Jaloloddin. From this
                    period, however, the empire began to decline. The ambition of the khans having
                    prompted them to invade the kingdoms of Japan and Cochin-China, they were
                    miserably disappointed in their attempts, and lost a great number of men. The
                    same ill success attended them in Hindustan, and in a short time this mighty
                    empire broke into several smaller ones. The governors of Persia, being of the
                    family of Genghiz Khan, owed no allegiance to any superior; and those of Tartary
                    were similarly circumstanced. The Chinese threw off the yoke, and thus the
                    continent of Asia wore much the same face that it had done before Genghiz Khan
                    began his conquests.</p>
                <p>The successors of Hulaku reigned in Persia till the year 1335; but that year
                    Abusaid Khan, the eighth from Hulaku, having died, the affairs of that country
                    fell into confusion for want of a prince of the race of Genghiz Khan to succeed
                    to the throne. The empire, therefore, was divided amongst a great number of
                    petty princes, who fought against each other almost without intermission, till,
                    in the year 1369, Timour Beg or Tamerlane, one of these princes, having
                    conquered a number of others, was crowned at Balkh, with the pompous title of
                    “Sahib Kharan,” that is, “the emperor of the age, and the conqueror of the
                    world.” As he had just before taken that city, and destroyed one of his most
                    formidable rivals who had shut himself up in it, the new emperor began his reign
                    with beheading some of the inhabitants, imprisoning others, burning their
                    houses, and selling the women and children as slaves. In the year 1370 he
                    crossed the Sihun, made war on the Getes, and attacked.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823343" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3343-0318"/>
                <p>Karazm. Next year he granted a peace to his enemies; but two years after, he
                    again invaded the country of the Getes; by the year 1379 he had fully conquered
                    that country, as well as Khorassan; and from that time he continued to extend
                    his conquests in much the same manner as Genghiz Khan had done, though with less
                    cruelty. In 1387 he had reduced Armenia, Georgia, and all Persia; the conquest
                    of which last was completed by the reduction of Ispahan, seventy thousand of the
                    inhabitants of which were slaughtered on account of a sedition raised by some
                    rash or evil-disposed persons.</p>
                <p>After the reduction of Persia, Timour turned his arms northward and westward,
                    subduing all the countries to the Euphrates. He took the city of Bagdad; subdued
                    Syria; and having ravaged great part of Russia, returned to Persia in 1396,
                    where he splendidly feasted his whole army. In 1398 he crossed the Indus on the
                    17th of September, invaded Hindustan, reduced several fortresses, and made a
                    vast number of captives. However, as he was afraid that, in case of any
                    emergency, these prisoners might take part with the enemy, he gave orders to his
                    soldiers to put all their Indian slaves to death; and, in consequence of this
                    inhuman order, more than one hundred thousand of these poor wretches were
                    slaughtered in less than an hour.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the year 1399, Timour was met by the Indian army, whom, after
                    a desperate battle, he defeated with great slaughter, and soon afterwards took
                    the city of Delhi, the capital of the country. Here he seated himself on the
                    throne of the Indian emperors; and here the scherifs, kadis, and the principal
                    inhabitants of the city, came to make their submission, and begged for mercy.
                    The tame elephants and rhinoceroses were likewise brought to kneel before him as
                    they had been accustomed to do to the Indian emperors, and made a great cry as
                    if they implored his clemency. These war elephants, one hundred and twenty in
                    number, were, at his return, sent to Samarcand, and to the province where his
                    sons resided. After this, at the request of the lords of the court, Timour made
                    a great feast, at which he distributed presents to the princes and principal
                    officers.</p>
                <p>Delhi at this time consisted of three cities called Seyri, Old Delhi, and Jehan
                    Penah. Seyri was surrounded with a wall in the form of a circle. Old Delhi was
                    also walled, but much larger, lying south-west of the other. These two parts
                    were joined on each side by a wall; and the third, situated between them, was
                    called Jehan Penah, which was larger than Old Delhi. Penah had ten gates; Seyri
                    had seven, three of which looked towards Jehan Penah; and this last had thirteen
                    gates, six to the north-west, and seven to the south-east. Every thing seemed to
                    be in a quiet posture, when, on the !2th of January 1399, the soldiers of
                    Timour, being assembled at one of the. gates of Delhi, insulted the inhabitants
                    of the suburbs. The great emirs were ordered to put a stop to these disorders;
                    but their endeavours proved ineffectual. The sultanas having a curiosity to see
                    the rarities of Delhi, and particularly a famous palace adorned with one
                    thousand pillars, built by an ancient king of India, went with all the court
                    into the city; and the gate being on that occasion left open for every body,
                    above fifteen thousand soldiers got in un perceived. But there was a far greater
                    number of troops in a large place between Delhi, Seyri, and Jehan Penah, who
                    committed great disorders in the two last cities. This made the inhabitants in
                    despair fall on them; and many, setting fire to their houses, burnt their wives
                    and children. The soldiers, seeing this confusion, did nothing but pillage the
                    houses, whilst the disorder was increased by the admission of more troops, who
                    seized the inhabitants of the neighbouring places that had fled thither for
                    shelter. The emirs, to put a stop to this mischief, caused the gates to be shut;
                    but they were quickly opened by the soldiers within, who rose in arms against
                    their officers, so that by the morning of the 13th the whole army had entered,
                    and this great city was totally destroyed. Some soldiers carried out as many as
                    an hundred and fifty slaves, men, women, and children; nay, some of their boys
                    had twenty slaves a piece to their share. The other spoils, in jewels, plate,
                    and manufactures, were immense; for the Indian women and girls were adorned with
                    precious stones, and had bracelets and rings on their hands, feet, and even
                    toes, so that the soldiers were loaded with them. On the 15th, in Old Delhi, the
                    Indians retired into the great mosque to defend themselves; but being attacked
                    there by the Tartars, they were all slaughtered, and towers erected with their
                    heads. A dreadful carnage now ensued throughout the whole city, and several days
                    were employed before the inhabitants could be made to quit it entirely; and as
                    they went forth, the emirs took a number of them into their service. The
                    artisans were also distributed amongst theprinces and commanders; all but the
                    masons, who were reserved for the emperor, in order to build him a spacious
                    stone mosque at Samarcand.</p>
                <p>After this terrible devastation, Timour marched into the different provinces* of
                    Hindustan, everywhere defeating the Indians who opposed him, and slaughtering
                    the Ghe-bres or worshippers of fire. On the 25th of March he set out on his
                    return, and on the 9th of May he arrived at Samarcand. In a few months after his
                    arrival he was obliged to undertake an expedition into Persia, where affairs
                    were in the utmost disorder on account of the misconduct of his son, whom he had
                    appointed sovereign of that empire. Here Timour soon settled matters, after
                    which he again set out on an expedition to the westward, reduced many places in
                    Georgia which had not submitted before, and invaded and conquered Syria. At the
                    same time he quarrelled with Bajazet the Turkish sultan, then engaged in an
                    enterprise against Constantinople, in which he would probably have succeeded had
                    not Timour interposed. At first the cause of this quarrel was, that Bajazet had
                    demanded tribute from a prince who was under Timour’s protection, and is said to
                    have returned an insulting answer to the Tartar ambassadors who were sent to him
                    on that account. Timour, however, who was an enthusiast in the cause of
                    Mahommedanism, and considered Bajazet as engaged in the cause of heaven when
                    besieging a Christian city, was very unwilling to disturb him in so pious an
                    enterprise, and therefore undertook several expeditions against the princes of
                    Syria and Georgia, in order to give the Turkish monarch time to cool and return
                    to reason. Amongst other places he again invested the city of Bagdad, which had
                    cast off its allegiance to him; and having taken it by assault, he made such a
                    dreadful massacre of the inhabitants, that one hundred and twenty towers were
                    erected with the heads of the slain. In the mean time Bajazet continued to give
                    fresh provocation, and even protected one Kara Yussuf, a robber, who had openly
                    insulted the caravan of Mekka, so that Timour at length resolved to make war
                    upon him. The sultan, however, foreseeing the danger of bringing such a
                    formidable enemy against himself, thought proper to ask pardon, by a letter, for
                    what was past, and to promise obedience to Timour’s will for the future. This
                    embassy was graciously received; and Timour returned for answer, that he would
                    forbear hostilities, provided Bajazet would either put Kara Yussuf to death, or
                    send him to the Tartar camp, or expel him from his dominions. Along with the
                    Turkish ambassadors he sent one of his own, telling Bajazet that he would march
                    into the confines of Anatolia, and there wait his final answer.</p>
                <p>Though Bajazet had seemed at first willing to come to an agreement with Timour,
                    and evidently dreaded his superior power, yet he now behaved in such an
                    unsatisfactory manner that the Tartar monarch desired him to prepare for <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193823356" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3356-0319"/> war; upon which
                    he raised the siege of Constantinople, and having met Timour with an army
                    greatly inferior to the Tartars, was utterly defeated and taken prisoner.
                    According to some account^ he was treated with great humanity and honour; whilst
                    others inform us that he was shut up in an iron cage, against which he dashed
                    out his brains the following year. At any rate, it is certain that he was not
                    restored to liberty, but died in confinement.</p>
                <p>This victory was followed by,the submission of many places of Asia Minor to
                    Timour; and the Greek emperor owned himself tributary, as did likewise the
                    sultan of Egypt. After this Timour once more returned to Georgia, which he
                    cruelly ravaged; and then he marched to Samarcand, where he arrived in the year
                    1405. Here, being now an old man, this mighty conqueror began to look forward to
                    that state which at one time or other becomes the dread of all living creatures;
                    and Timour, in order to quiet the remorse of his conscience, came to a curious
                    resolution, which he communicated only to his intimate friends. This was, that
                    “as the vast conquests he had made were not obtained without some violence,
                    which had occasioned the destruction of a great number of God’s creatures, he
                    was resolved, by way of atonement for his past crimes, to perform some good
                    action, namely, to make war on the infidels, and exterminate the idolaters of
                    China.” This atonement, however, he did not live to accomplish, for he died the
                    same year, of a burning fever, in the seventy-first year of his age and
                    thirty-sixth of his reign.</p>
                <p>Upon the death of Timour, his empire fell immediately into great disorder, and
                    the civil wars continued for five or six years; but at last peace was restored,
                    by the settlement of Shah Rukh, Timour’s son, on the throne. The latter,
                    however, did not enjoy the empire in its full extent, or indeed much above one
                    half of it; having only Karazm, Khorassan, Kandahar, Persia, and part of
                    Hindustan. Neither was he, though a brave and warlike prince, able to extend his
                    dominions; yet he transmitted them to his son Ulug-Beg, who proved a wise and
                    learned monarch, and is famous for the astronomical tables which he caused to be
                    composed, and which are well known at this day. Ulug-Beg was killed in 1448, by
                    his son Abdallatif, who six months after was put to death by his own soldiers.
                    Upon the death of Abdallatif, Abdallah, a grandson of Shah Rukh, seized the
                    throne; but, after reigning one year, he was expelled by Abusaid Mirza, the
                    grandson of Miran Shall, the son of Timour. His reign was one continued scene of
                    wars and tumults, until at last he was defeated and taken prisoner by one Hassan
                    Beg, who put him to death in 1468. From this time we may look upon the empire of
                    Timour as entirely dissolved.</p>
                <p>On the death of the above-mentioned monarch, his son Baber succeeded him, but was
                    soon driven out by the Usbeck Tartars; after which he resided some time in
                    Gazna, whence he made incursions into Hindustan, and at length became master of
                    the whole empire, excepting the kingdoms of Dekkan, Guzerat, and Bengal. See <hi
