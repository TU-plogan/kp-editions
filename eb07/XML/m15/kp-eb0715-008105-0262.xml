                    the existence of a happy and a holy age at the commencement of the world’s
                    history, so among most of them do we find traces, more or less distinct, of an
                    expectation that a period of still greater excellence will immediately precede
                    its close. In several of the oriental religious systems this expectation

                    accord with those of the Jewish Scriptures, that this poem seems to have been
                    commonly regarded by the early church as prophetic of the birth and reign of

                <p>Among the Jews this expectation assumed a more definite form, and was expressed
                    in less hesitating language. Their prophets distinctly revealed to them the
                    certainty of a period of future felicity under the reign of the Messiah;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See, among other passages,
                    Is. ii. 1-4, ix. xi. xxv.; Zech. xiv.</p></note> and they had, from a
                    comparatively early age, the tradition, that that period would extend through a
                    thousand years. This tradition seems to have had its rise in the notion, that as
                    the work of creation was divided among six ordinary days, so the world would
                    have to pass through six divine days of toil and suffering (each of which days
                    they imagined to be a millennium, from a misinterpretation of Ps. xc. 4); and
                    that as God rested on the seventh day, so should the seventh millennium be a
                    period of universal rest and quiet under the reign of the Messiah. In the
                    rabbinical writings, frequent allusions to this opinion are to be found, the
                    most important of which have been collected by Wetstein, in his notes on Apoc.
                    xx. Of these allusions, the following may be taken as a specimen: “There is a
                    tradition in the bouse of Elias, that the righteous whom the holy blessed God
                    shall raise from the dead, shall not return again to the dust, but for the space
                    of <hi rend="italic">a thousand years,</hi> in which the holy blessed God shall
                    renew the world, they shall have wings like the wings of eagles, and shall fly
                    above the waters.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    loc.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>From the Jews, this notion of a personal reign of the Messiah with his saints on
                    earth, was adopted by several in the early church, by whom the passage in the
                    Apocalypse above referred to was confidently quoted in support of the opinion.
                    By some of these the blessings <pb break="no" facs="nls:193820275"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-0275-0082"/>anticipated during the millennium were regarded as
                    entirely of a temporal and sensual kind, while others looked forward to that
                    period as a season of spiritual enjoyment and religious harmony. In neither of
                    these forms, however, does the opinion ever seem to have become general in the
                    church. Indeed we are expressly informed by Origen, that it was confined to
                    those “of the simpler sort,” and to such as, “refusing the labour of
                    intelligence, followed the superficial mode of literal interpretation.”<note

                    early church, as the documents we possess are too few, and too partial in their
                    information, to justify our expressing any definite opinion on the subject. From
                    the testimony of Eusebius, we learn that the first who taught it in the church
                    was Papias, a bishop of Phrygia, in the earlier part of the second century, who
                    professed to have received a traditional revelation on the subject from the
                    apostles. Influenced by a regard to the piety and antiquity of the man <hi

                    >τΤξοβεβλημενοι),</hi> several ecclesiastics, and among the rest Irenaeus and
                    Justin Martyr, adopted his opinion. Adherents were also found in the Latin
                    church, especially from among the Montanist party. It is justly remarked,
                    however, by Professor Neander, that the defensive attitude which the advocates
                    of the doctrine perpetually assume in regard to it, affords a strong presumption
                    that it was not the doctrine of the church in general.<note anchored="true"

                <p>In the third century it was vehemently assailed by Origen, and as eagerly
                    defended by Nepos, a bishop of the district of Arsinoe, in Egypt. The latter,
                    however, was but a feeble antagonist for so redoubtable a controversialist as
                    Origen, whom his scholars delighted to style the Adamantine; and consequently
                    his interference served only to quicken the downfall of the cause he had
                    espoused. The assault of Origen was followed by that of Dionysius, bishop of
                    Alexandria, and one of Origen’s most able scholars, which seems, in the Eastern
                    church at least, completely to have driven the opinion into obscurity.<note

                    traces of it in ecclesiastical history, until we arrive at the tenth century,
                    when it was revived, though in a very altered form, and used for the purpose of
                    terrifying the ignorant populace into larger concessions to the ambition and
                    avarice of the papal power. They were taught that the millennium, during which
                    Satan was to be bound, was to be calculated from the birth of Christ, and
                    consequently was then rapidly drawing to a close; that at its termination Satan
                    would be again set free, and the reign of Anti-Christ would commence; and that,
                    after a short season of triumph to the enemies of the church, the last judgment
                    would take place, and the world be consumed by the final conflagration. So
                    powerful was the effect produced by the teaching of this doctrine, that
                    multitudes, as the eventful year that was to close the last century of the
                    millennium approached, forsook their homes, “and hastened to the shores of
                    Palestine, with the pious persuasion that Mount Sion would be the throne of
                    Christ when he should descend to judge the world; and these, in order to secure
                    a more partial sentence from the God of mercy and charity, usually made over
                    their property before they departed, to some adjacent church or monastery.”<note

                    any of the expected convulsions, the minds of the people recovered their
                    equilibrium. Those who had fled returned to their homes, and resumed their
                    wonted occupations; “and the only lasting effect of this stupendous panic was
                    the augmentation of the temporal prosperity of the church.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>Since the reformation, the opinion of the early Millennarians has been revived in
                    the church; and the doctrine of a personal reign of Christ on earth with his
                    saints has been maintained by many excellent persons, as one of the truths
                    clearly revealed in the Scriptures. The tenets of those who avow this opinion
                    are chiefly the following :— That Jerusalem is to be rebuilt, the temple
                    restored, and sacrifice again offered on the altar; that this city is to form
                    the residence of Christ, who is to reign there in glory with all his saints for
                    a thousand years; that for this purpose there shall be a resurrection of all the
                    pious dead, that none of the Saviour’s followers may be absent during his
                    triumph; that at the close of the thousand years, they shall all return to
                    heaven, and the world be left to Satan and his followers for a season; and that
                    then the general resurrection and last judgment shall take place, and the
                    history of the world be brought to a close. In support of these tenets, they
                    appeal to numerous passages in the prophetical writings of the Old Testament, to
                    some sayings of Christ himself recorded in the Evangelists, to one or two
                    detached passages in the writings of the apostles, and principally to the
                    declarations of St John in the Apocalypse. The passages in the Prophecies on
                    which most stress is laid by them, are those in which the latter-day glory seems
                    to be described in connection with the return of the Lord of Hosts unto Zion,
                    the establishment of his sanctuary with men for ever, and the coming of the
                    nations to Jerusalem to receive instruction, and offer their homage to him.<note

                    sorrow shall befall the church, until Christ come to restore the one to its
                    former glory, and to exalt the other over all its enemies.<note anchored="true"

                    apostles are chiefly two: the one the address of St Peter to the Jews,—“Repent
                    and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of
                    refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; when he shall send Jesus
                    Christ, which before was preached unto you ;”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Acts, iii. 19, 20.</p></note> which is held
                    to prove that Christ shall come again, and that this event shall be attended
                    with times of refreshing to the Jews; the other the declaration of St Paul to
                    the Thessalonians,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ep.
                    iv. 16.</p></note> that “the dead in Christ shall rise first;” from which it is
                    inferred that there will be a resurrection of the just antecedent to the general
                    resurrection. The main prop of the doctrine, however, is the passage in the
                    twentieth chapter of the Apocalypse, already referred to, and which is as
                    follows: “And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given unto
                    them; and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus,
                    and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his
                    image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands; and
                    they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead
                    lived not again till the thousand years were finished. This is <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193820288" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0288-0083"/>the first resurrection.”
                    Verses 4, 5. Here it is contended that we have a distinct testimony in favour of
                    a millennial reign of Christ and his people, and of a resurrection of those who
                    had been faithful to him, as well as of those who had suffered for his sake,
                    antecedent to that of the rest of the dead, and hence called “the first
                    resurrection.”</p>
                <p>By those who oppose this system, it is generally admitted that the expectation of
                    a long season of uninterrupted triumph to the cause of Christ, is one which is
                    fully authorized by the declarations of Scripture. It is denied, however, that
                    these declarations, when properly interpreted, support the notion of a personal
                    reign, and a twofold resurrection. With regard to the passages from the Old
                    Testament prophecies, it is maintained, that many of those adduced by
                    Millennarians, as favouring their system, have been already fulfilled in the
                    temporal history of the Jewish nation, and that in others which seem to have a
                    still future reference, Jerusalem is used as typically representative of the
                    Christian church in its triumphant state; the temple is spoken of in reference
                    to the ministrations of the Gospel; and the coming of the people to Jerusalem is
                    set forth as indicative of the universal prevalence of the Christian faith. The
                    inference deduced by Millennarians from the words of our Lord above referred to,
                    is regarded by their opponents as at best very obscure and far-fetched, while,
                    on the other hand, it is contended, that the obvious comparison which our Lord
                    draws between the destruction of Jerusalem and his second coming, as well as the
                    circumstances of appalling and unexpected suddenness with which his appearance
                    will be made, seem much better to accord with the notion, that the coming spoken
                    of is his coming to judgment, than with the opinion that it is an advent for
                    which his church shall be longing, and the world prepared. In the statement of
                    St Peter to the Jews, it is admitted that there are some expressions which would
                    seem at first sight to favour the milìennarian scheme; but it is argued that
                    every such inference is precluded by the words which follow, and in which the
                    apostle declares, that the heavens must retain Christ “until the restitution (or
                    accomplishment) of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his
                    holy prophets since the world began.” As, therefore, by the showing of
                    Millennarians themselves, the glories of the millennium form part of the “all
                    things” that are revealed in inspired prophecy, and which must be fulfilled <hi
                    rend="italic">before</hi> Christ shall re-appear on earth, it is plainly
                    impossible that he can come to our world in person at the <hi rend="italic"
                    >commencement</hi> of that period; and consequently the times of refreshing
                    spoken of by St Peter must be interpreted of other blessings than those which
                    would flow from the personal reign of Christ at Jerusalem. As to the statement
                    of St Paul, that “the dead in Christ shall rise first,” it is affirmed that a
                    single glance at the context is sufficient to convince us that the apostle is
                    not establishing a difference between the righteous and the wicked as to the
                    time of their respective resurrections; but is simply showing that those
                    believers who are alive at the season of Christ’s second advent shall not enjoy
                    any advantage over those who are dead, for the latter shall be raised first,'
                    <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> previous to the common ascent of the whole to meet
                    the Lord in the air. In reference to the passage from the Apocalypse, it is
                    contended, 1st, That the expression “<hi rend="italic">first</hi> resurrection”
                    no more necessitates a twofold <hi rend="italic">corporeal</hi> resurrection,
                    than the phrases “first and second death,” so frequently employed by the same
                    writer, necessitate the supposition of a twofold corporeal dissolution; but that
                    in both cases we have an instance of the same intermingling of the spiritual
                    with the material, as in our Lord’s declaration, “Let the dead bury their dead,”
                    where, as is generally admitted, the first adjective is used in a spiritual or
                    metaphorical, the second in a literal and corporeal sense: 2<hi rend="italic"
                    >dly,</hi> That the phrase, “the rest of the dead,” refers to “the remnant”
                    spoken of in the 21st verse of the 19th chapter (the words in the original are
                    the same in both verses, <hi rend="italic">lιι λοιποι),</hi> by whose
                    resurrection is intended the temporary restoration of the reign of evil after
                    the millennium: 3<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> That it is not a legitimate
                    interpretation to regard the expression, “I saw the <hi rend="italic">souls
                    of</hi> them that were beheaded,” &amp;c. as intimating their <hi rend="italic"
                    >corporeal</hi> resuscitation; for though we may properly enough speak of a <hi
                    rend="italic">soul</hi> when we mean <hi rend="italic
                    smallcaps"> ά</hi><hi rend="italic">person,</hi> yet it would outrage all
                    propriety of language for any one to say that he saw the souls <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> certain individuals, when he meant that he saw these individuals
                    themselves: <hi rend="italic">4thly,</hi> That by the return to the earth of the
                    souls of the martyrs and confessors, nothing more is intimated than the
                    universal prevalence of that holy and determined spirit by which they were
                    distinguished; in the same way as the ancient prophecy, that Elias should return
                    to earth before the appearance of the Messiah, is allowed to have received its
                    accomplishment when John the Baptist came “in the <hi rend="italic">spirit</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">power</hi> of Elias:” <hi rend="italic">5thly,</hi> That
                    it is as contrary to sound principles of interpretation to expound a book
                    professedly symbolical literally, as it would be to expound a professed
                    narrative symbolically: <hi rend="italic">6thly,</hi> That it is imperative on
                    those who insist on the literal interpretation of this passage to be consistent,
                    and interpret literally the whole book, in which case we should have literal
                    vials, and trumpets, and mill-stones, and chains, and burning lakes, &amp;c.; an
                    extent of literality for which few will be hardy enough to contend: and, <hi
                    rend="italic">lastly,</hi> That by interpreting the whole passage symbolically,
                    and understanding by it a prediction of a season of joyful triumph to the
                    church, during which the whole world shall be under the religion of Christ, and
                    the zeal and piety of its holiest members in its purest days shall be
                    universally diffused, no violence is done to any part of it, while a meaning is
                    elicited in entire accordance with the general tenor of Scripture.</p>
                <p>It is further objected by those who are opposed to Millennarianism, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">first</hi> place, that the hypothesis is in itself exceedingly
                    improbable; for since Scripture assures us that the departed saints are already
                    with Christ in heaven, in the enjoyment of unspeakable felicity, it is hardly
                    conceivable that they would leave such a state to dwell for a thousand years on
                    earth, in a state which at best must be one of imperfect enjoyment, and then
                    return to heaven to permit their enemies for a season to reign in their stead:
                    2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> That the miliennarian notion of a resurrection of
                    the righteous, antecedent to that of the wicked, is directly opposed to the
                    testimony of Scripture, which represents the two as simultaneous; see, <hi
                    rend="italic">e. g.</hi> John v. 28-29, &amp;c.: <hi rend="italic">3dhy,</hi>
                    That the idea of a long interval elapsing between the advent of Christ and the
                    last judgment, is inconsistent with those passages which represent the one as
                    immediately consequent upon the other; such as, 2 Thess. i. 7—10; 2 Tim. iv. 1,
                    &amp;c.: <hi rend="italic">4thly,</hi> That, on the millennarian hypothesis,
                    there can be no judgment of the righteous whatever, for they having been once
                    admitted to <hi rend="italic">reign</hi> with Christ, can never after that be
                    placed for trial at his bar,—a hypothesis clearly at variance with innumerable
                    passages of Scripture, such, <hi rend="italic">e. g.</hi> as Rom. xiv. 10-12;
                    Math. XXV. 31—46, &amp;c.: <hi rend="italic">5thly,</hi> That to represent the
                    millennium as a state of immortality on earth, is to confound it with the New
                    Jerusalem, though the two are distinctly revealed as separate states, the one
                    previous and the other subsequent to the final judgment: and, <hi rend="italic"
                    >lastly,</hi> That the theory of millennarianism is in two points at least
                    self-contradictory; for it not only represents Christ as reigning until the <hi
                    rend="italic">last</hi> enemy has been destroyed, and yet supposes the existence
                    of a whole host of enemies, who, at the close of that reign, are to be gathered
                    together; but also represents them as contending with the saints, until they are
                    consumed by fire from God (Rev. xx. 7-10), though, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193820301" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0301-0084"/>according to another part of
                    their hypothesis, the saints shall before this have returned with Christ to
                    heaven. For these reasons, among others <hi rend="italic">of</hi> less weight,
                    this hypothesis of a personal reign of Christ on earth has been rejected by the
                    majority of divines, and the period of the millennium regarded as a season of
                    great spiritual blessedness, consequent on the complete triumph of Christianity
                    throughout the earth. <hi rend="smallcaps">(n. n. n. n.)</hi></p>
