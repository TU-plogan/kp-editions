                    of government, and other local advantages, to disregard the mandates of the
                    emperor, so that they can scarcely be said to acknowledge his sovereignty.<note

                    description of Morocco, and the most correct map hitherto completed of that
                    empire, will be found in the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society of
                    London. They are by Lieutenant Washington of the navy; and his valuable
                    communication was read in 1831. It does not appear to have been seen by some
                    recent writers on geography, a circumstance which will account for some
                    discrepancies between the present article and other accounts of the empire of
                    Morocco, particularly in reference to the latitude and longitude of
                    places.</p></note> The grand physical feature of Morocco is the Atlas mountain
                    chain, which traverses it first from east to west, then from north to south, and
                    again from east to west, till it terminates at Cape Nun, upon the shores of the
                    Atlantic. Offshoots or ramifications of this stupendous mountain spine intersect
                    the country in various directions, and some of them attain a great elevation.
                    Miltsin, the highest peak of Atlas visible from Morocco, a distance of seventy
                    miles, and not two hundred, as has been uniformly asserted, is 11,400 feet above
                    the level of the sea. This is below the limit of perpetual snow assigned by
                    Humboldt in his Personal Narrative; yet only once in twenty years had these
                    summits been seen entirely destitute of snow. At 6400 feet above the level of
                    the sea, which was the highest point reached by Mr Washington in 1830, the
                    mountain, he informs us, “was of a hard, red sandstone, the strata running in an
                    east and west direction, and dipping 10° south.” Mr Washington continues: “We
                    had thus only passed limestone,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>“This formation, it is believed, is of secondary limestone,
                    and probably is generally diffused throughout the skirts of the Atlas, forming
                    the basis of all the lower ranges of the mountains, to the height, perhaps, of
                    three or four thousand feet. Of marble we saw nothing in our journey, except in
                    some of the buildings in Morocco; and, after much inquiry, could not decide,
                    from the ignorance or apathy of the Moors, whence it came, but it is believed
                    from Italy. The great columns and pillars of white marble yet existing in this
                    country are between Fez and Mekinez, and described as the ruins of a triumphal
                    arch and temple; but of <hi rend="italic">rosso-antico</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi> and other ancient marbles, which have been historically
                    almost proved to have come from Mauritania, we could hear nothing.”</p></note>
                    micaceous schist, and sandstone, that is, transition and secondary rocks; no
                    traces of the primitive, except a boulder of granite, or rather of gneiss, in
                    the valley below, and veins of foliated quartz in the schistose hills. Besides,
                    the tendency of the formation is to table-land, ridges, and rounded summits, not
                    to sharp or Alpine peaks; neither did we on our route through the country see
                    any trace of volcanic agency, nor is there any thing in the outline of Atlas
                    indicating the former existence of a crater.” At the height of 2400 feet the
                    mountain consisted of a strata of lime running north-east and south-west, the
                    dip about 70° to south-east, and which followed the undulation of the hills.
                    There is a range of hills which presents a striking appearance, even as seen
                    from Morocco. It is called the Arina range, and consists of a basis of lime;
                    “strata east and west; dip 20° to the south-east; its north-western face
                    precipitous, five hundred feet high, and deeply channelled with the
                    water-courses, and having dark-red clay, possibly metallic, between the strata
                    of lime.” At the foot of Atlas is a range of schistose hills, varying from five
                    to eight hundred feet in height, and assuming every variety of shape, “truncated
                    cones, pyramidal, pine apple, sugar loaf, &amp;c.; one of which was covered with
                    masses of gneiss, or coarse-grained granite, abounding with black mica; many of
                    these blocks were several tons weight.” These quotations will serve to convey an
                    idea of the more remarkable geological features of the country. The rivers are
                    comparatively few in number, ιnd, except near the sea, are small in size. The
                    most considerable are the Moulouia or Mulwia, the Seboo, the Oomerbegh, the
                    Tensift, and the Suz. All these, except the first, fall into the Atlantic. The
                    Oomerbegh (mother of herbage) has the longest course of any river in the empire.
                    It rises in that part of the Atlas chain which separates the provinces of Fas
                    and Tedla, and forms the boundary between Temsena and Ducaila. After a very
                    winding course of above two hundred miles, it falls into the Atlantic at Azamor,
                    where it is about one hundred and fifty yards wide. It has been conjectured that
                    the Mulwia derives its origin from the opposite side of the same mountain, and
                    that in this quarter are situated the highest summits of the Atlas range; but
                    this has not yet been determined. “The river Tensift,” says Mr Washington,
                    “springing from the northern hills, about forty miles eastward of the city,
                    flows along at their base about four miles north of Morocco, and, joined by
                    several streamlets from Atlas, reaches the Atlantic fifteen miles south of
                    Saffy, nearly one hundred miles distant; the river is shallow, but rapid; the
                    channel here (on the plain of Morocco) about three hundred yards wide, but
                    fordable, except in the spring, in almost all places.” Several considerable
                    streams, which derive their origin from widely-separated parts of the Atlas
                    chain where it traverses Fas, unite and form the river Seboo. The principal head
                    branches are the Wad Werga and Wad Leaen; the latter is joined by another stream
                    larger than itself, but without a name. As it approaches the ocean, the Seboo
                    winds in “the boldest sweeps imaginable, through a rich and varied plain.” It is
                    “about four hundred yards wide; a bar of sand, a quarter of a mile from its
                    outlet, extends almost across, and is nearly dry at low water spring tides;
                    inside from three to four fathoms water <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825761"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-5761-0504"/>rise of tide seven or eight feet.” The town of
                    Mehedia stands upon the southern bank of the river; and between it and the city
                    of Fas, situated about eighty miles in the interior, but more than double that
                    distance measured by the windings of the river, there is water communication, of
                    which, however, no advantage is taken. About twenty miles to the south-west of
                    the Seboo, the Bu Regreb falls into the Atlantic at Slaa or Salee, a place
                    renowned in the annals of piracy. This river is formed by the junction of the
                    Weroo and Bu Regreb. It is about four hundred yards broad at its mouth at full
                    tide. These are the principal streams in Morocco. They have all several
                    tributaries, and there are besides a considerable number of rivulets, which flow
                    directly to the ocean. There are a few lakes, one of which, called Murja Ras ed
                    Dowra, is twenty miles in length by one and a half in breadth.</p>
                <p>Except during three months in summer, the climate is mild in temperature,
                    pleasant and salubrious even to Europeans; whilst the country, generally
                    speaking, is free from those marshy tracts which, in the tropical regions, are
                    the pregnant source of the most malignant forms of disease. In the northern
                    provinces the climate is nearly the same as that of Spain, having the autumnal
                    and vernal rains peculiar to the south of Europe. Towards the Great Desert,
                    however, the rains are less general and certain, and the heat in consequence is
                    more oppressive. Indeed, to the south of the river Suz, little or no rain falls
                    throughout the year. We may, however, observe generally, that, throughout the
                    emperor’s dominions, the air has for the most part a congenial softness, and a
                    degree of serenity, which render the climate peculiarly delightful. The seaport
                    towns have the additional advantage of being frequently refreshed with
                    sea-breezes.</p>
                <p>The soil of Morocco varies in its nature and quality, yet in general it is in the
                    highest degree productive, and, under proper cultivation, is capable of
                    producing all the luxuries of the eastern and western hemispheres. Some parts of
                    the sea coast, it is true, are sandy and barren; but the plains of the interior
                    consist of a rich black loam of extraordinary fertility. The mountainous parts
                    might also be rendered extremely productive, if the inhabitants did not almost
                    entirely neglect agriculture. It is a rule which scarcely admits of an
                    exception, that where nature does much for man, he does little for himself. Yet
                    notwithstanding the slight cultivation which it receives, the soil is so
                    fertile, that fruit and grain are produced, not only in quantities sufficient
                    for the wants of the people, but also for exportation. Morocco formerly supplied
                    a part of Spain with the necessaries of life, but of late years the exportation
                    of corn has been totally prohibited. The principal grain is wheat. Barley is
                    likewise abundant, and oats grow spontaneously. Indian corn, peas, beans, hemp,
                    tobacco, and a great variety of esculent vegetables, are amongst the products of
                    the soil. All the culture which it receives consists merely in burning the
                    stubble before the autumnal rains commence, and then ploughing it about six
                    inches deep. The olive in its best state, the citron, the orange, and the cotton
                    tree, cover the hills; and experience has proved that sugar, rice, and indigo
                    may be raised to much advantage, and at a very trifling expense of labour. Many
                    varieties of the vine succeed in the northern provinces; and figs, dates,
                    pomegranates, melons, almonds, peaches, apricos, pears, cherries, plums, and, in
                    short, all the fruits to be found in the southern provinces of Spain and
                    Portugal, are produced in abundance. The natives preserve their grain in
                    “matamores,” or holes made in the earth, lined and covered with straw, to
                    prevent the rain from soaking through; and in these receptacles grain may be
                    kept fresh for five or six years. The forests of Morocco are full of oaks with
                    sweet acorns, cork-trees, cedars, arbutuses, and gum-trees. Copper, tin, iron,
                    antimony, and other metals. including silver and gold, are found in various
                    parts; but as the Moors are ignorant of mining operations, they have proved of
                    little value to the country.</p>
                <p>In describing topographically the provinces of Morocco, we shall commence with
                    the most northerly. For an account of Fez, however, it is only necessary to
                    refer to the article under that head. The next place in importance is the
                    sea-port of Tangier, situated on a steep acclivity rising at once from the
                    beech, long. 5. 48. and lat. 35. 47. 54., thirty miles west-south-west of
                    Gibraltar. It is surrounded by mouldering walls, with round and square towers at
                    short distances, and three strong gates. Its defences toward the sea consist of
                    two batteries, one above the other, on the south side of the sea-gate. High upon
                    the wall, and directly in front of the landing-place, are about twelve guns; to
                    the north, in a circular battery commanding the bay, which is about three miles
                    wide, are twenty more guns, of all calibres, but in very bad condition; and,
                    crowning the whole, to the north is an old and extensive castle, the residence
                    of the governor. On the land side, walls and a ruined ditch form the only
                    defences. The gates are shut at sunset, and a watch is set at night. With the
                    exception of the main street, which crosses the town irregularly from the sea to
                    the land-gate, the streets are narrow and crooked. The houses are low, with flat
                    tops, except those of the European consuls, many of which are good. El Jaama
                    Kibeer is large and rather handsome. Its tower, placed at the north-west angle,
                    is lofty, and wrought in coloured tessellated work, as is also the pavement of
                    the mosque, round which sweeps a colonnade of low pillars, with a fountain in
                    the centre. There are two public markets well supplied with vegetables, fruits,
                    poultry, game, and meat, which is good and cheap. The town is the residence of a
                    pasha, whose territory extends about twenty-five miles to the southward. Outside
                    the walls are some productive gardens belonging to the different consuls
                    resident here, who, with their families, are numerous enough to form a very
                    agreeable society. The anchorage in the bay is very tolerable, excepting in
                    strong north-west winds. Were the mole rebuilt, the remains of which are still
                    visible under water, the landing on the beach would be always secure. The ruins
                    of Old Tangier, supposed to be the ,Tingis of the ancients, and a Roman bridge,
                    are still standing at the southern part of the bay. Four small batteries, of
                    about six guns each, defend the sand-hills around the shores. This town was long
                    a subject of eager contention between the Moors and Portuguese; but the latter
                    obtained possession of it in 1471, and kept it for nearly two centuries, when it
                    passed into the hands of the English as pan of the marriage portion of the queen
                    of Charles II. It was wisely abandoned by Britain about twenty years afterwards.
                    The population of Tangier is from seven to eight thousand, including fifteen
                    hundred Jews, who are the chief artisans.</p>
                <p>Thirty miles south-east of Tangier is Tetuan, pleasantly situated near the
                    opening of the straits into the Mediterranean, in long. 5. 24. lat. 35. 36. It
                    is built upon a rising ground between two ranges of high mountains, one of them
                    forming a part of the lesser Atlas. The town is of considerable extent, and has
                    defences nearly of the same description as those of Tangier. The streets are
                    narrow and filthy; the houses are two stories in height, but they have a mean
                    appearance from the streets, which in many instances are nearly arched over by
                    them. The El Kaisseria, or fair, for the disposal of goods, is filled with
                    shops, which are well supplied with almost every variety of goods, both of
                    European and African manufacture. The latter are brought by means of the annual
                    caravans from Fez, and the former by vessels from Spain and from Gibraltar. They
                    have, besides, many manufactures of their own, so that Tetuan may be ranked next
                    to Fez in commercial importance. The mosques are large and numerous. The port is
                    situât-ed<pb break="no" facs="nls:193825774" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5774-0505"/> on a
                    river about two miles from the sea, and is named Marteen; but only small craft
                    can reach it, as the stream is nearly choked up with sand. The entrance is
                    defended by a high square tower, on which are mounted twelve pieces of ordnance.
                    The population of Tetuan was formerly estimated at 20,000, but it is supposed to
                    be now considerably below that number.</p>
                <p>Nearly midway between Tetuan and Tangier is Ceuta, formerly the capital of <hi
                    rend="italic">Hispania Transfretana,</hi> and occupied by the Moors. It was
                    afterwards taken by the Arabs, and again in 1415 reduced by the Portuguese, from
                    whom it passed into the hands of the Spaniards, in whose possession it now
                    remains. Being a commanding position, it acquired great value in the eyes of the
                    maritime states, as affording the means of checking the Barbary pirates; and to
                    the Spaniards, in particular, its importance has not been diminished by the loss
                    of Gibraltar. Various efforts have been made by the sovereigns of Morocco to
                    recover it; butas it is almost impregnable on the land side, a military force,
                    without the aid of a fleet, must for ever prove ineffectual. It is situated in
                    long. 5. 17. 25. lat. 35. 54. 10. Between this place and Tangier, which is
                    distant about a day’s journey, the whole coast is rugged, and interspersed with
                    projecting cliffs. About twenty miles to the west of Cape Spartel, and five
                    miles west from Tangier, stands the town of Arzilla, in long. 6. 0. and lat. 35.
                    29. 30. It is a walled square of about a quarter of a mile, situated on the open
                    beach. The walls, which were built by the Portuguese, have a few guns mounted on
                    them on the side facing the sea. The population may be about 1000. The next
                    place of any consequence on the coast is El Araïsh, which is situated on an
                    abrupt declivity of sandstone, upon the southern bank of the river El Kos, at
                    its outlet into the Atlantic, in long. 6. 9. and lat. 12. 50. The town is
                    walled, and strongly defended, on the land side by a ditch and a citadel, and
                    towards the sea by a battery of thirteen guns and a venerable castle, with
                    concave flanks and orillons. El Araïsh is a picturesque ruin. Moslemin
                    superstructures are reared upon the foundations of Christian temples; the
                    principal mosque was once a Roman Catholic church. Here was formerly the
                    residence of European consuls, and their deserted houses still line the Marina,
                    commanding a fine view of the port and of the Atlantic. Supplies are abundant,
                    and there is some little commerce in charcoal and other articles; but the town
                    is fast falling to decay. The population may amount to about 4000, including
                    Jews. The river El Kos, signifying a bow, and so named from its windings, may be
                    traced through a beautiful valley far away to the eastward. Its banks are
                    fertile, and enriched by many gardens; which fully justifies the propriety of
                    bestowing its present name on the town, El Araïsh, or the flower gardens. From
                    an inscription over the walls on the sea-gate, it appears that this place was
                    taken from the Moors, and fortified, by the Spaniards, in 1610.</p>
                <p>The route of Mr Washington from Tangier to the capital of Morocco passed through
                    all the towns of importance in die empire with the exception of Fez and
                    Mogadore, as well as some of the most fruitful and populous parts of the
                    country. Leaving Tangier, the road leads in a south direction “over a sandy
                    soil, through the productive gardens that surround the town; then through an
                    undulating country, over rounded schistose hills, about 300 feet high; mica
                    slate, with veins of foliated quartz, occurring rarely; direction north-west and
                    south-east; dip of strata 75° to south-west, and covered with scanty herbage;
                    passing occasionally an Arab village of a few hovels, fenced by a hedge of aloes
                    and prickly pear, or Indian fig; here and there a patch of Guinea corn;
                    otherwise no signs of cultivation.” The road then proceeds ten miles south by
                    west over a hill called Dahr Acclaou, well wooded with cork, wild olive, droo,
                    myrtle, heath, broom, palmetto, and other trees and shrubs. It then winds ten
                    miles in a southerly direction through a valley about eight miles wide,
                    abounding in springs, and having a soil of light clay, but little cultivated.
                    Proceeding southwards, Mr Washington passed several tracts of rich alluvial
                    soil, woods of fine cork trees, and numerous Arab villages, the country becoming
                    more populous, and presenting traces of higher cultivation. The Arabs possessed
                    herds of cattle, horses, mules, and flocks of sheep. The first place of any
                    importance is the town of Al Ksar, situated in a flat tract of rich, partially
                    wooded meadow-land, through which meanders, in a west-northwest direction, the
                    river El Kos, a rapid but shallow stream, and about an hundred yards wide in
                    November. The plain to the south-east is bounded by beautiful mountain scenery;
                    and conspicuous, by its singular conical form, arises the peak of Sarsar, at the
                    foot of which, said to be inhabited by Shereefs, is the town of Wazen.</p>
                <p>Al Ksar, situated about half a mile from the river on its northern bank, in long.
                    5. 52. lat. 34. 57. 10., is surrounded by orchards and gardens of orange,
                    pomegranate, and palm, in great luxuriance. It was built by Jacob, son of
                    Almansor, about the end of the twelfth century, and is connected in history with
                    the wars of Granada. The town is encompassed by old ruinous walls about a mile
                    and a half in circumference, and having loopholes, battlements, and small square
                    towers fifty paces apart. The streets are narrow, and at intervals arched
                    across. The houses are remarkable for having ridged roofs of tile. Mr Washington
                    counted fourteen mosques, many of which were lighted up and spacious; and the
                    bazaar contained a few mean shops, but no business was doing, markets and inns
                    being deserted and lifeless. The population amounts to about 8000, of which 500
                    may be Jews; but doubtless it had once been much more populous.</p>
                <p>The course now lay through a succession of valleys and over low ranges of hills
                    to the great plain of Mamora, over which herds of cattle range. As the
                    travellers entered the grazing country, Arab villages changed into <hi
                    rend="italic">douars,</hi> or circular encampments of from twenty to thirty
                    tents. Approaching the Atlantic by a south-westerly course, Mr Washington
                    reached the large lake called Murja Ras el Dowra, which extends parallel with
                    the coast nearly twenty miles. It contains several islands, with saints’ tombs,
                    insulated spots being here, as well as elsewhere, sacred to holy purposes. The
                    lake was covered with wild fowl of every description, and fine eels are obtained
                    from its waters. The surrounding margin exhibits little or no trace of
                    cultivation; but the soil, although light and sandy, is productive of various
                    annual plants, and on the western shore is a forest. The Arabs have here a great
                    number of douars and coubbas. The country now became hilly, and the soil
                    gravelly and sandy, but producing colocynth and coarse herbage. Mr Washington
                    next crossed the Wad Seboo, and entered the town of Mehedia, which is situated
                    on a height of about ten feet, on the southern bank of the river, and about ten
                    miles from the sea, in long. 6. 36. and lat. 34. 18. When in possession of the
                    Portuguese it was a place of some consequence, as the ruins of handsome
                    fountains, arches, churches, and fortifications attest. It had a double wall,
                    and was otherwise well fortified; but at present eight mounted guns constitute
                    its sole defence. The town now contains only 300 or 400 inhabitants, chiefly
                    fishermen, who subsist by the sale of shebbel, a fish resembling salmon, which
                    is here caught in great abundance. Between this place and Salee, about sixteen
                    miles to the south-south-west, is the extensive forest of Mamora, said to cover
                    eight miles of country. It is chiefly inhabited by lions and wild bears. Passing
                    under an ancient aqueduct extending a mile in length, having arches thirty feet
                    high, eight feet wide, and four feet thick, Mr Washington entered the town of
                    Salee.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825787" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5787-0506"/>
                <p>Slaa, or Salee, once the terror of the seas, and renowned for those rovers whose
                    daring exploits spread terror along the shores even of Christendom, and whose
                    city and port were a constant scene of riot, bustle, and activity, is now
                    ruined, silent, and desolate. The present town, built on a sandy point extending
                    to the sea, and forming the northeastern bank of the river, is about half a mile
                    in length by a quarter of a mile in breadth. It is surrounded by walls thirty
                    feet in height, having square towers at every fifty paces. The defences are a
                    long battery of twenty guns facing the sea, a round fort at the entrance of the
                    river, and a gun or two on the gates. The mosques, arches, and fountains in the
                    city appear to be of high antiquity, and show traces of beautiful sculpture; but
                    the streets are narrow, and the houses, like those of all Moorish towns, are
                    sombre. The population is about ten thousand, of whom five hundred may be Jews,
                    who apparently have little or no occupation. The river Bu Regreb is here about
                    five hundred yards broad when full. The bar, about one eighth of a mile from the
                    entrance, runs almost across in a west-south-westerly direction, with three or
                    four feet on it at low water,'but leaving a channel at each end. The Moors use
                    the eastern, where there is a rise of nine or ten feet of tide; and inside the
                    harbour is quite sheltered, with water sufficient for a frigate. The imperial
                    dock-yard is here, and ship-building is carried on to a small extent. The
                    presence of several ferry-boats, some small traders, and a few fishing boats,
                    give to this river an animated appearance quite uncommon amongst the Moors.</p>
                <p>The town of Rabatt stands on the south-western side of the Bu Regreb, fifty or
                    sixty feet above its level, upon banks of crumbling sand-stone. With its
                    minarets, palm-trees, ruined walls, old mosques, and, crowning the whole, its
                    venerable <hi rend="italic">kassbah</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> or
                    citadel, with its battlements all grouped in the most picturesque manner, it has
                    an imposing appearance from the opposite shore. It extends three quarters of a
                    mile in length by about one third of a mile in breadth, and is defended towards
                    the sea and the river by three batteries and the citadel, and on the land side
                    by a strong wall thirty feet in height, with square towers and angles of
                    masonry. The main street of Rabatt, which runs parallel to the river, contains
                    the principal shops, which are not very attractive, and the markets, which are
                    abundantly supplied with excellent fruits and vegetables. The orange orchards,
                    vineyards, and cotton plantations, are extensive. The most conspicuous object is
                    the ruined mosque, and lofty tower, called by the Moors Sma Hassan, which stands
                    two hundred and twenty feet above the level of the river. Mr Washington counted
                    ten mosques, besides the mausoleum of a sultan, and that of the hero of Moorish
                    Africa, the great Almansor. The Moorish population may amount to eighteen
                    thousand, and the Jewish to about three thousand. The Jews are the chief
                    artisans, and they have a part of the town allotted to them, called <hi
                    rend="italic">Millah,</hi> which is exceedingly filthy. Rabatt is situated in
                    lat. 34. 2. 30. N., and long. 6. 46. W. One mile south-east of the town are the
                    ruins of the Roman or Carthagenian town called Shella, formerly a place of note,
                    and, according to D’Anville, the limit of the Roman station on this coast.
                    Several ancient but ruined towns and villages were passed by Mr Washington,
                    amongst which were Tomana, distant seven miles from Rabatt and three from the
                    coast; El Mansoria, a square of one hundred and fifty paces, enclosing an Arab
                    village, in lat. 33. 46. 10. N., and long. 7. 20. W.; Fidallah, situated six
                    miles from El Mansoria, on a fine corn plain, at three quarters of a mile from
                    the sea, and employed as a magazine for grain before Mogadore was built; and,
                    lastly, Dar el Beida, a small walled town about half a mile square, which stands
                    on a point projecting into the sea, and forming a bay three quarters of a mile
                    deep. The roadstead is well sheltered from westerly winds, and protected by a
                    few piecçs of cannon. The town was built for the exportation of corn, and was
                    long in possession of the Portuguese. It is walled in, has three mosques,
                    several houses built in the European style, and a population of about seven
                    hundred, including Jews.</p>
                <p>Between this place and Azamor, thirty-three miles distant, the country presents a
                    rich and varied appearance, and the signs of cultivation become more
                    conspicuous. There are numerous gardens, a forest of a beautiful evergreen tree
                    called <hi rend="italic">droo,</hi> resembling the <hi rend="italic"
                    >arbutus</hi> in blossom, and bearing a brown berry which yields a coarse
                    species of oil. Mr Washington saw many ploughs at work; large plantations of
                    henna, herds of cattle, flocks of sheep and goats, and a great number of Arab
                    encampments.</p>
                <p>On the south-western bank of the river Oom-erbegh, one mile and a half from its
                    outlet, stands the town of Azamor, in lat. 33. 17. 37. N., and long. 8. 15. W.
                    It is surrounded by a wall about a mile and a half in circumference, but in
                    ruins. The streets are narrow and filthy, and the town is dull and lifeless,
                    maritime trade being interrupted by a bar of sand across the mouth of the river.
                    The population may be about three thousand, including Jews. The surrounding
                    country is open and destitute of wood, but well cultivated, and laid out in
                    plantations of henna, of which three crops a year can be produced by irrigation.
                    At a few miles distance from Azamor is the town of Mazagau, situated on a
                    peninsular point projecting north about one mile, and forming with another point
                    a sandy bay about a mile and a half in depth, which affords a good roadstead for
                    small vessels. The town is well built, and respectably defended towards the sea
                    by several redoubts. It enjoys some little commerce, has excellent water, and is
                    well supplied with provisions. The population amounts to about two thousand,
                    including Israelites. It is situated in long. 8. 21. W. and lat. 33. 15. N.</p>
                <p>The course of Mr Washington now lay through the interior of the province of
                    Ducaila, celebrated for its breed of horses, and its woollen manufactures of
                    sulhams, haicks, carpets, and the like. The soil of the plain is a light loam,
                    covered with stones, flint, and the like. It is well cultivated, and laid out in
                    gardens and Indian corn fields. With the exception of a few scattered
                    palm-trees, there is no wood; but the Arabs encamp here in great numbers, as
                    herds of cattle and flocks of sheep find plenty of pasture, and are supplied
                    with water from several springs and wells. The plain is of vast extent, and
                    presents many varieties of vegetation; palmetto and colocynth occurring in
                    swampy spots, fine grass occasionally, patches of Guinea corn, gardens, and so
                    on. Mr Washington passed a large market on the great plain, where camels,
                    horses, mules, asses, rude implements of husbandry, coarse woollen manufactures,
                    corn, vegetables, fruit, dates, almonds, henna, and other articles, were exposed
                    for sale. Ducaila may be described as a succession of plains, the largest being
                    that on which the imperial city stands. The plain of Morocco extends in an east
                    and west direction, between a low range of schistose hills to the north, and the
                    lofty Atlas to the south; it is about twenty-five miles wide, and apparently a
                    dead flat to the foot of the mountains. It lies about fifteen hundred feet above
                    the level of the ocean, and, as far as the eye reaches east or west, appears to
                    have no limit. This vast level plain, therefore, may stretch from the shores of
                    the Atlantic on the west, to the foot of the Atlas on the east, a distance of
                    about two hundred miles. This tract of country, however, does not all go by the
                    name of Morocco, portions of it to the east and west being distinguished by
                    other appellations. The soil is a light sandy loam, interspersed with numerous
                    rounded stones of crystallized quartz, agates, porphyry, a green stone,
                    carnelians, and other minerals. It is, generally speaking, covered with low
                    brushwood of the thorny plant called <hi rend="italic">sidra neback,</hi> or
                    buckthorn. The banks of the streamlets are fringed with <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193825800" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5800-0507"/> oleanders of great beauty,
                    whilst to the north a forest of palm trees and olives, and to the south the
                    towering snowclad summits of the Atlas mountains, impart a picturesque grandeur
                    to the scene.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Morocco,</hi> the capital of the empire, is situated on the
                    northern side of this rich plain, the principal mosque standing in latitude 31.
                    37. 40. north, and longitude 7. 36. 0. west. It is surrounded by a
                    strongly-built machicoated wall of tapia-work, thirty feet high. The foundations
                    are of strong masonry; square towers are placed at intervals of fifty paces;
                    there are eleven strong double gates; and the whole is six miles in
                    circumference. This vast area, however, is far from being entirely occupied with
                    buildings; it also comprehends large gardens· and open spaces from twenty to
                    thirty paces in extent. Of the eleven gates of the city now open, that which
                    conducts to the palace of Beb el Rom is by far the best specimen of architecture
                    to be seen. It is a Moorish horse-shoe arch, richly sculptured in arabesque
                    work, in imitation of shoe-nails, and the like; and however false in principle
                    such a plan of an arch may be, it is said to have a pleasing effect to the eye.
                    The streets of Morocco are narrow and irregular, seldom wider than lanes in
                    European cities, and in many cases the lines of houses on either side are
                    connected by bridges with gates, possibly intended for defence in case of
                    attack. Several open spaces, which scarcely deserve the name of squares, are
                    used as marketplaces, and for other purposes. The houses, which are generally
                    stony, have flat roofs and terraces, the side towards the street being plain and
                    white-washed. As an apology for windows, there are here and there narrow
                    unglazed openings; but the interior disposition of the tenement is much in the
                    Spanish style. Many of the doors are of cypress wood, and highly sculptured. The
                    rooms, which are long and narrow, open into a court, sometimes surrounded with
                    arcades, and having a fountain in the centre. With the exception of a mat and a
                    cushion or two, they are destitute of furniture, which, with the want of windows
                    and fires, conveys to a European any thing but an idea of comfort and
                    convenience. On the outside of the southern main wall, and facing the Atlas,
                    stands the palace of the sultan. It is encircled by a wall equal in strength to
                    that which surrounds the city, and occupies an area fifteen hundred yards in
                    length by six hundred in breadth. The whole is portioned into squares laid out
                    in gardens, round which are detached pavilions, forming the imperial residence.
                    The floors of the rooms are tessellated with variously coloured tiles, but
                    otherwise they are quite plain, the furniture consisting only of a mat, a small
                    carpet at one end, and some cushions. Within the city there are nineteen
                    mosques, two emdrasas or colleges, and one hospital. El Koutubia, the principal
                    mosque, stands alone in a deserted place of twenty or thirty acres, and is
                    conspicuous above all by its lofty square tower rising to the height of two
                    hundred and twenty feet without diminishing, thus producing a striking and
                    singular effect. It is divided into seven stories, and its height is apparently
                    about seven times its diameter. This tower resembles, and is said to be coeval
                    with, the Sma Hassan at Rabatt, and the Giralda at Seville, built towards the
                    close of the twelfth century, but reconstructed by Christians in the thirteenth
                    century. Upon the summit of the tower of El Koutubia is a small turret, in the
                    shape of a lanthorn, from which it derives the name of Sma el Fanar. The body of
                    the mosque, although large, is an irregular building, and insignificant when
                    contrasted with the lofty tower by which it is surmounted. Next in height, and
                    coeval in erection, although modernized and well painted, is the mosque of Beni
                    Yussuf. It has a college of talebs, that is, seekers or students, attached to
                    it; and a saint’s tomb stands opposite its southern door, formed of three
                    arches, and surmounted by a cupola, delicately wrought with rich Saracenic
                    tracery. El Moazin, said to be the most ancient sacred edifice, is very large,
                    and has several courts opening into each other. The Moorish horse-shoe arches
                    intersect each other in various directions, and have a very rich effect.
                    Attached to this mosque are gates, said to have been carried away in triumph
                    from Seville by the great Almansor, as our Henry VIII. did those of Boulogne.
                    The patron saint of the city is called Bel Abbas. This mosque is composed of a
                    square saloon, covered with an octangular cupola, carved and painted with
                    arabesques, and on the outside covered with varnished and coloured tiles. The
                    sepulchre of the saint is richly ornamented, and on one side of it is placed the
                    alms-chest. Adjoining the mosque are various court-yards, with arcades and rooms
                    to lodge poor, old, maimed, and invalid people. The hospital is capable of
                    containing fifteen hundred patients; and this place is also a sanctuary or house
                    of refuge for those who are persecuted by despotism. Here they find a
                    never-violated asylum, and can negociate till pardon is obtained. The chief of
                    this establishment bears the title of El Emkaddem, or the Elder, and is
                    venerated as a saint. The college and mosque called Emdrasa del Emshia stands
                    near the south wall of the city. Here are the sepulchres of the sultans of the
                    Moluc Saidia dynasty, once adorned with statues and busts, which a bigoted
                    Moslemin emperor caused to be effaced. The other mosques it would be superfluous
                    to describe.</p>
                <p>The Great Bazaar, called El Kaisseria, is a long range of shops, or rather
                    stalls, protected from the weather, and divided into compartments. The articles
                    which Mr Washington saw exposed for sale were, silk scarfs, shawls, and
                    handkerchiefs, from Fez; sulhams, haicks, gellabias, and carpets, from Ducaila;
                    cloth, linen, hardware, tea, and sugar, from London; almonds, raisins, henna,
                    and al kohol, from Suse; very fine corn, caravances, beans, and the like, from
                    Shragna; very luscious dates from Tafilet; and abundance of boots, slippers,
                    saddles, coarse pottery, mats, cord, &amp;c. of domestic manufacture, together
                    with embroidery in gold and silver, in which they particularly excel. There are
                    two or three markets, the principal of which is called Sok el Khamise. It is
                    held near the north gate of the city, on a Thursday, and is well supplied with
                    home manufactures. There is another for the sale of horses, camels, mules,
                    horned cattle, sheep, and other animals. The city is supplied with water by
                    fountains, some of which exhibit traces of delicate sculpture. There are several
                    tan-yards, one of which was said to employ fifteen hundred persons.</p>
                <p>The Miilah, or Jewish Quarter, which is situated at the south extremity of the
                    city, is a walled enclosure, of about a mile and a half in circumference. It is
                    populous, but, as usual, filthy in the extreme. All the Jews pay a capitation
                    tax to the sultan, and are treated with the greatest contempt. Mr Washington was
                    offered for sale, by the scheikh of the Jews and a rabbi, the only copy of the
                    New Testament in Hebrew and Spanish, the last relic of the Spanish hospicio
                    which once existed within the walls of the imperial city. Mahommedanism, in all
                    its withering influence, reigns undisturbed. The Jews exercise several arts and
                    professions, being the only goldsmiths, tinmen, and tailors, in Morocco. The
                    Moors are the shoemakers, carpenters, masons, smiths, and weavers of haicks.
                    With regard to the number of inhabitants in this city, travellers are much at
                    variance. Jackson, with his usual liberality, assigns it 270,000; whilst Ali Bey
                    (Don Juan Badia) in 1804 fixed the population at 30,000, a number doubted by
                    other individuals. This extraordinary disagreement must be accounted for from
                    the plague and other terrible visitations occasionally sweeping off thousands of
                    inhabitants in a very short time. Mr Washington says that <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193825813" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5813-0508"/> the population cannot exceed
                    one hundred thousand, and is perhaps not above eighty thousand, including five
                    thousand Jews. As the women rarely show themselves in the streets, it is
                    difficult to estimate the number with any degree of exactness. The city,
                    however, exhibits unequivocal tokens of having once had a far greater
                    population. The dreadful plague, and more dreadful famine, which visited this
                    country a few years since, committed fearful ravages. Not half the space within
                    the gates is now inhabited; ruined walls and tenantless houses meet one at every
                    turn; nothing flourishes but vegetation, which, even in the months of December
                    and January, is rife and luxuriant, its springing freshness forming a striking
                    contrast to the mouldering walls around.</p>
                <p>The remains of numerous subterranean aqueducts surround the town. Some of these
                    are ten or twelve feet in depth, and stretch across the plain to the foot of the
                    Atlas. They are chiefly in ruins, and consequently out of use. This is the
                    strongest evidence which can be produced in support of the fact, that the
                    population of this country was far greater formerly than it is at present; and
                    also that the arts were then more cultivated than they are now. A want of water
                    is never hinted at by any traveller who has visited the imperial city; so that
                    the few aqueducts which remain entire being sufficient for the supply of the
                    present inhabitants, we are naturally led to conclude that those which have now
                    fallen into disuse once conveyed a sufficiency of this indispensable element to
                    a more abundant population, as well as to the grounds laid out in gardens in the
                    vicinity of the city. Cemeteries also extend beyond the walls, both north and
                    south; and there is one to the east of very considerable dimensions. This city
                    was formerly surrounded with gardens and plantations extending to a great
                    distance, but they have now for the most part disappeared. A few, however, still
                    remain, and the sultan has three of about fifteen acres in extent within the
                    city, and two of about twenty acres each, two miles distant from the walls.
                    Every variety of fruit-tree enriches these gardens, olive, orange, pomegranate,
                    citron, mulberry, walnut, peach, apple, pear, vine, fig, date, aprico, and the
                    like; whilst trees of beautiful texture or foliage, the cedar, poplar, accacia,
                    the solemn cypress, and the stately palm, together with a profusion of flowers
                    and flowering shrubs, form a picturesque scene where the unchecked luxuriance
                    and beautiful wildness of nature add a charm to the studied elegancies of the
                    more regular ornaments of art. The grounds are well supplied with water by means
                    of the conduits already mentioned.</p>
                <p>The city of Morocco was built about the middle of the eleventh century, by Yousef
                    Abu Tashfin, and at first obtained the name of Marakash. In the following
                    century it reached its highest degree of prosperity; but there is little in its
                    history except what belongs to the country generally, and as such will
                    afterwards be given.</p>
                <p>A few towns of Morocco, not yet mentioned, require some notice, and amongst these
                    Mequinez has claims to precedence, as being the first city in the empire after
                    Morocco and Fez. It is situated in a beautiful valley about sixty miles inland
                    from Sallee, in lat. 33. 58. 30. E., and long. 5. 30. 0. N. It owes its
                    importance to the policy of Sultan Muley Ismael, who, after conquering the
                    various small kingdoms which now constitute the empire, for the purpose of
                    strengthening the northern division, erected a walled town capable of containing
                    a large garrison. There was formerly a Spanish hospitium here, as well as at
                    Morocco; but it has long been deserted by the monks. At the south end of the
                    city stands the palace, which forms an immense quadrangle enclosing a number of
                    gardens well watered by streams from the adjacent country. In the centre of this
                    enclosure is the harem, which again surrounds a small piece of ground planted
                    with trees, and in vested by a gallery supported on massive columns. This royal
                    residence (the sultan occasionally inhabits it) is rendered more spacious by
                    being constructed entirely upon the ground floor. The rooms, as usual, are
                    narrow, but long and high; and the walls are inlaid with glazed tiles of bright
                    colours. Many of the Jews here are affluent; and the inhabitants are described
                    as more courteous and hospitable than those belonging to any other part of the
                    empire. The population is estimated by Mr Jackson at 110,000 souls, but this is
                    very probably an exaggeration. Ali Bey states, that the surrounding country,
                    which, at a distance, appears to be a level plain, is in reality composed of a
                    labyrinth of round hills, between which several small streams wind in
                    innumerable sinuosities. The soil is sandy, with little clay, and produces
                    nothing but palms and olives.</p>
                <p>Mr Washington, in his return from the imperial city, passed some interesting
                    ruins. From the banks of the Oom-erbegh to the sea-coast at Tidallah, a distance
                    of seventy miles, the country consists of a series of plains, at first gravelly
                    and desert-like, but latterly of a fine rich soil, though little cultivated, and
                    but thinly peopled. At twenty miles north of the Oom-erbegh, he stopped at a
                    place called Kaisar, and both name and tradition agree in pointing out this spot
                    as of high antiquity. Our traveller traced the foundation of a building, the
                    north side of which was two hundred and fifty paces long, with towers at the
                    corners, and walls of unhewn limestone five feet thick, but level with the
                    ground. Other foundations of great extent were also visible, with a well and
                    conduits leading to a spring; and the plain seemed admirably adapted for com.
                    These circumstances, together with the existence of several tumuli at some
                    distance, have led travellers to conclude that this has been a Mauritanian or
                    Roman station. Twelve miles to the north of this spot, the peasants have a
                    tradition, that here a city, called Caria, had sunk into the ground; that many
                    substantially-built wells were in the neighbourhood; that coins had been found
                    (which they described as of <hi rend="italic">brass'),</hi> of the size of a
                    Spanish dollar, and with an inscription of straight sticks and dots. Can this be
                    other than the Roman denarius.</p>
                <p>It remains for us shortly to describe the most southerly part of the empire, the
                    province or kingdom of Suz or Suse. Agadeer or Agadir, better known under the
                    Portuguese name of Santa Cruz, the last, port in proceeding southward in the
                    emperor’s dominions, is situated in lat. 30. 35. N. Its bay, Mr Jackson says, is
                    probably the best roadstead for shipping in the empire, being large, deep, and
                    well defended on every side from all winds. The town stands upon an elevated
                    position, and it is of great natural strength, besides being defended by walls
                    and batteries. It was fortified in 1503 by Emanuel, king of Portugal, but taken
                    by the Moors about thirty years afterwards; and continuing in the possession of
                    these last, it might have attained to considerable importance, had not the
                    refractory conduct of one of its governors provoked the emperor in 1773 to
                    dismantle it, and transfer its commercial privileges to Mogadore. Forty-four
                    miles eastward from Santa Cruz stands Tarudant, formerly the capital of a petty
                    kingdom, and still the principal town in the province. It is situated on a fine
                    but uncultivated plain about twenty miles south of the Atlas range. The walls,
                    now half in ruins, enclose an area much larger than is occupied by the
                    buildings, which are scattered about without any regularity. It still, however,
                    possesses a noble palace, adorned with gardens containing the most delicious
                    fruits; but, generally speaking, it has lost its trade, its population, and the
                    consequence which once belonged to it as a provincial capital. Its reputation is
                    now confined to the manufacture of a superior kind of saltpetre^ and the
                    preparation of leather used for saddles. The other places included in the
                    province of Suz are too small to require mention.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825826" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5826-0509"/>
                <p>Our knowledge of Tafilet, the eastern province or kingdom, is rather limited,
                    although the communications with the country, the ancient Sugulmessa, are very
                    important. It is a flat plain, and the portion of the soil which is not
                    sheltered by trees is bare sand. Comparatively little corn is grown; and what is
                    produced is sown by the bank of a swelling river, one of the largest in the
                    empire. Its name implies the gullet, being conferred on it from its forcing its
                    way through a narrow rocky pass during a part of its course. The melting of the
                    Atlas snows causes an annual overflow, which, as it never rains here, is of as
                    much importance to the country as the inundation of the Nile is to Egypt; and
                    the natives accordingly celebrate the event by festivities and public
                    rejoicings. The people of Tafilet inhabit fortified towns, consisting of about
                    four hundred families each, and subsist chiefly on dates, for which their
                    country is much celebrated, and the milk of their camels. Deer and ostriches are
                    numerous. The cities of Morocco and Fez are both entrepôts of Tafilet. The
                    capital city, which bears the same name, is, by the route of the caravans,
                    twenty days’journey from Morocco, across Mount Atlas, and four hundred miles
                    from the foot of the mountain. When trade has reached Tafilet, there is a
                    further transport to the utmost point in the interior, where is the grand mart;
                    and during this journey the most cruel privations are endured, chiefly arising
                    from the want of water. Tafilet, besides its intercourse in that direction,
                    sends tobacco and dates to Guinea in exchange for gold dust. Salt is the chief
                    article which this city receives from ^Morocco, and the trade in it is in the
                    hands of the sultan, a proof of its importance. These caravans are always
                    commanded and attended by Moors of distinction; they take with them blankets of
                    the manufacture of Fez, tobacco, and salt; their great return is in young
                    slaves.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of the empire of Morocco may be divided into six classes; namely,
                    Moors, Arabs, Shelluhs, Berebbers, Jews, and Negroes.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Moors</hi> are the descendants of those who were expelled
                    from Spain when the Moorish dynasty was extinguished in that country. They
                    chiefly inhabit the towns, and may be considered as the aristocracy of the
                    country; filling the high offices of government, and forming the military. Their
                    language is the Mogreb, or occidental Arabic, intermingled with Spanish. For a
                    more particular account of the Moors, see the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Barbary States.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Arabs</hi> came originally from the desert, and, spreading
                    themselves over the plains, there pitched their tents, commonly in a circle,
                    hence called <hi rend="italic">douars,</hi> and followed a pastoral life. When
                    the soil is unproductive, the herbage scanty, or their tents become overrun with
                    insects, so as to be no longer habitable, they emigrate to another place, a
                    spring ora saint’s tomb generally influencing the selection. They are mostly
                    under the middle size, and slightly formed, but are a hardy race, and capable of
                    great endurance. They are hospitable, and may be trusted under a promise, but
                    are otherwise much given to thieving. Their language is the Koreish, or Arabic
                    of the Koran, but greatly corrupted.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Berebbers</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Shelluhs</hi> inhabit
                    the mountain range of Atlas; the former occupying the north-eastern partas far
                    as the province of Tedla, and the latter the space extending from thence to the
                    south-west. They live chiefly in villages, consisting of houses built of stones
                    and mud, with slated roofs; but occasionally they live in tents, and even in
                    caves. Their principal occupation consists in hunting; but they also cultivate
                    the ground, and rear many bees. From their mode of life, they are more robust
                    and active than their neighbours of the plains. It has been conjectured that
                    they are the aborigines of this country, and the direct descendants of Ham,
                    having been driven to the mountains by the incursions of the Arabs and Moors.
                    Their language bears no affinity to the Arabic, although the latter tongue is
                    partially intermixed with it. It has long been a disputed point whether the
                    Shelluh and Berebber are the same language. Jackson declares they are not; but
                    later writers are of a different opinion, holding them to be dialects of the
                    same parent stock.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Jews</hi> in Morocco, as in most other countries, are a
                    degraded race, despised and insulted by the Moors, whom they cheat in turn upon
                    all occasions, and not only abused and struck by adults, but stoned by children
                    for the slightest real or imaginary offence. They have no redress against these
                    grievances; and they must also submit to undertake the most menial offices, such
                    as those of servants, porters, and scavengers. They are likewise the chief
                    mechanics, interpreters, and the like; and, besides being an exceedingly
                    serviceable, are a very numerous body.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Negroes</hi> are slaves, and a marketable commodity; but,
                    from their high character for fidelity, they sometimes reach stations of great
                    importance, and obtain their freedom. They constitute the sultan’s body guard,
                    and the only standing army in Morocco.</p>
                <p>The government of this country is absolute, unmitigated despotism. The sultan is
                    the head of both church and state, which are inseparable. The laws are the
                    edicts of the despot, who in the capital administers justice in person. In the
                    provinces, his authority is delegated to the <hi rend="italic">kalifa</hi> or
                    pasha, who faithfully copies the imperial despotism; yet judgment is generally
                    correct, and always prompt. The leading principle of legislation appears to be,
                    Keep the people poor, and they will not rebel. The religion of Morocco is
                    Mahommedanism, and in performing their religious duties, such as prescribed
                    prayers, ablutions, and the like, the Moors are very attentive, even when
                    travelling. They look upon Christians as having no religion at all; and,
                    perhaps, from the specimens they often meet with, they are not far wrong in this
                    opinion.</p>
                <p>The revenue is derived from taxes paid in kind, one tenth of corn and one
                    twentieth of cattle. There is a capitation tax on all Jews; and districts where
                    crimes have been committed are subjected to fines. But the revenue is uncertain,
                    and government is frequently compelled to levy it by force from some of the Arab
                    tribes. The whole may amount to about one million sterling. The military are a
                    species of militia, who are called out when required. They receive no pay, but
                    are furnished with a horse; and when those of the provinces visit the capital,
                    they receive a trifling present. The only standing army is the sultan’s body
                    guard, which is about five thousand strong. All the soldiers carry long muskets,
                    in the use of which they are very dexterous, firing at full gallop; and many of
                    them are good marksmen. They are accustomed to sleep on the ground, without any
                    covering, even in cold nights, which renders them hardy; but they are by no
                    means formidable, as they have not an idea of the advantage to be derived from
                    moving in regular bodies. If their first charge is indecisive, they are easily
                    put to flight. They have no artillery for the field, its management under such
                    circumstances being beyond their comprehension.</p>
                <p>The education <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the youth is confined to learning the
                    Koran, which they commit to memory in the schools, with the management of a
                    horse, and the use of fire-arms. Music is almost unknown in the country, a rude
                    pipe, and still more barbarous drum, being their only instruments. These are
                    made to sound without any pretensions to concord; but amongst the Shelluh
                    mountaineers, whose songs are plaintive and pleasing, the charms of harmony are
                    not unknown.</p>
                <p>The usual food throughout the country is a dish called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kuseasu,</hi> which consists of mutton and fowls stewed with a few vegetables,
                    and served up in a large earthenware.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825839" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5839-0510"/>
                <p>pan, filled to overflowing with granulated paste, forming a savoury and
                    nutritious dish. This is placed on the ground, and around it half a dozen of
                    persons sit down cross-legged. Chairs, tables, knives, forks, spoons, and
                    plates, are superfluities unknown to the Moors. Coffee is not used, but tea is
                    very generally so, and presented to visitors at all hours of the day. The Moors
                    do not smoke tobacco, but snuff is taken in great quantities. They occasionally
                    smoke the leaves of the hemp plant, which partakes of the soothing qualities of
                    opium. A sort of confection of the seed of this plant, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >keef</hi> has the same properties, and the use of this article is consequently
                    much resorted to.</p>
                <p>The trade of Morocco is not at all commensurate with its size, or the number of
                    its inhabitants. The only manufacture is that of the leather which bears its
                    name. The other exports consist of sweet and bitter almonds, gum-barbary,
                    gum-soudan, gum-sandrac, bees’ wax, goat-skins, oil of olives, sheeps’ wool,
                    ostrich-feathers, elephants’ teeth, pomegranates, raisins, worm-seed,
                    rose-leaves, glue, fennel, walnuts, cummin seeds, lead ore, capers, carraway
                    seeds, and similar productions. The articles of import which meet the readiest
                    market are cloths of various fabrics, cambrics, muslins, blue linens, striped
                    silk, velvets, damask, sugars and spices of all kinds, tea, gums of sundry
                    descriptions, iron, wrought pewter, tin, white-lead, copper in sheets, mirrors,
                    earthenware, paper, coral beeds, Brazil wood, and Mexican dollars. Besides the
                    commercial transactions now mentioned, Morocco maintains a constant intercourse
                    with the negro nations beyond the Sahara, whence are brought gold dust, ivory,
                    and gums, more especially that valuable sort which is known by the name of gum
                    Senegal, or Soudan. The principal inlet to European produce is the port of
                    Mogadore, where accounts are kept. The circulating medium consists of nutkeels
                    of ten ounces, the ounce being divided into four olankeels, and the olankeel
                    into twenty-four fluce. From their proportion to the Spanish dollars, the
                    olankeel may be valued at one penny, the ounce at four pence, and the nutkeel or
                    ducat at three shillings and four pence. The weights and measures are as follow:
                    The commercial pound is generally regulated by the weight of twenty Spanish
                    dollars; so that one hundred pounds Mogadore weight, or the quintal, is equal to
                    one hundred and nineteen pounds avoirdupois. The market pound for provisions is
                    fifty per cent, heavier, or one pound twelve ounces and a half avoirdupois. The
                    corn measures are for the most part similar to those of Spain, but there are
                    considerable discrepancies. The cubit or canna, which is equal to twenty-one
                    English inches, is the principal long measure. Various estimates have been given
                    of the annual value of the exports and imports to and from Morocco, on the
                    loosest authority.</p>

                <p>The empire of Morocco is a remnant of the great African monarchies founded by the
                    Saracens. The dynasty of the Aglabites, whose seat of empire was at first
                    Kairwan, and that of the Edrisites, whose capital was Fez, were both subjugated
                    by the Fatimites, who, finding employment for their arms in conquering Egypt,
                    allowed their western dominions to be usurped by the variously-named Zuhites.
                    These again were supplanted by the Moravedi or Mora-beth, who rose into military
                    consequence about the middle of the eleventh century. Their chief, Abu Bekr Ben
                    Omar Lamathouni, with an army of Marabouts, made himself master of the country,
                    after which he assumed the title of Emir al Mumenim, or Prince of theFaithful.
                    His successor,</p>
                <p>Yussuf Abu Tashfin, pushed on his conquests, carrying his arms into Spain; and to
                    this prince is ascribed the building of the city of Morocco, which at first
                    obtained the name of Marakash. In the middle of the twelfth century this warlike
                    people gave way before the Almohades, a sect or tribe of more austere character,
                    and supposed to be <hi rend="italic">Kabyles</hi> of the Berber nation. This
                    tribe subjugated a considerable portion of Africa, but were not so fortunate in
                    Spain as their predecessors. After the lapse of a century, intestine discords
                    exposed the Mohadi to the successful attacks of several rival tribes,
                    particularly the Merinites, or Beni Merini, who ultimately obtained possession
                    of the kingdoms of Fez and Morocco. This tribe, however, did <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193825865" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5865-0512"/> not push its conquests far,
                    and its power was shaken by hordes of unknown name and origin, who continued to
                    issue from the eastern desert. It was ultimately overthrown by the Oatazi, an
                    obscure race, who envied the greatness of the Beni Merini, and aspired to
                    supreme dominion. Coincident with the triumph of the Oatazi was the invasion of
                    the Portuguese, who established themselves along the coast, and began to disturb
                    the country with a view to the propagation of Christianity. This emergency in
                    their affairs induced the Oatazi to call to their aid the Shereefs settled at
                    Tafilet. In fact, they appear to have been invited on account of their character
                    as the supposed descendants of Mahommed, under the emergencies of the state,
                    menaced with extraneous violence. Hassan Shereef had the merit, in the eyes of
                    his country, of delivering it from the dangers of foreign thraldom; and he
                    compensated himself by the possession of the sceptre, which he left to his
                    family. He was completely successful in his enterprise; and having subjugated
                    the zealots, who had shaken the empire, he placed on the throne that dynasty
                    which continues to occupy it to the present day. With the regal power the
                    descendants of Hassan unite the more sacred distinction which attaches to their
                    pedigree as the progeny of Mahommed.</p>
                <p>Mr Washington, the only traveller who can be fully relied on, estimates the
                    actual population of Morocco at between five and six millions. <hi
