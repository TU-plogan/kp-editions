                    >Claude-François-Xavier</hi></label>, a distinguished historian, was born in
                    1726 at Ornans, a small town of Franche-Comté, being descended from an old
                    family connected with the profession of the law. When his studies were
                    completed, he was admitted amongst the Jesuits; and after having taught
                    classical learning in several towns, he was appointed professor of rhetoric in
                    the College of Lyons, one of the most celebrated institutions of the society in
                    France. In a discourse, crowned by the academy of Dijon, he ventured to
                    pronounce an eulogium on Montesquieu, an act of boldness which offended his
                    superiors, and, from the disagreements that ensued, led to his return to the
                    world. The Abbé Millot, who was often successful in academical competitions,
                    fancied that his talents fitted him to excel in the pulpit; but after having
                    preached, without success, an advent at Versailles, and a lent at Lunéville, he
                    abandoned a career for which he was disqualified by the weakness of his voice
                    and the timidity and embarrassment of his manner. The desire <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> being useful to young people had induced him to undertake translations;
                    and it was with this view that he composed abridgements of the history of France
                    and of England, two works which had great success. About this time the Marquis
                    of Felino, minister of Parma, having established in that city a college for the
                    education of the young nobility, appointed the Abbé Millot to the chair of
                    history, on the recommendation of the Duke of Nivernais. He was stranger to the
                    intrigues which agitated the court, and, for the benefit of his pupils, formed
                    the plan of an abridgement of general history. Whilst he was occupied with this
                    work, Felino was marked out by his enemies as an object of popular hatred,
                    insulted in the streets of Parma, and menaced even at∙the gates of his own
                    palace. From this moment the Abbé Millot refused to quit his patron. In vain was
                    it represented to him that the affection he evinced for the unfortunate minister
                    would cause him to lose his place. “My place,” said he, “is with a virtuous man,
                    my benefactor, who is persecuted; I shall not lose that at least.” On the
                    retirement of the Marquis of Felino, the Abbé Millot returned to France, where
                    his courageous conduct was known, and had procured him many friends. The court
                    of Versailles, in name of that of Parma, granted him a pension of four thousand
                    francs; and, in 1778, he was appointed preceptor to the Duke d’Enghien, a
                    situation for which he was indebted to the high opinion entertained of his
                    character. He was about to reap the reward of his labour and pains, when he was
                    seized with an illness, which soon carried him off in the fifty· ninth year of
                    his age. He died on the 21st of March 1785, the same day on which, nine years
                    afterwards, his august pupil was shot in the fosse of Vincennes. The Abbé Millot
                    had been received into the French Academy in 1777, in the room of Gresset. His
                    election, managed by the house of Noailles, was a transaction or compromise
                    between the parties which then divided the academy. There was one of the members
                    who qualified his suffrage by declaring that he grant ed it only upon the
                    condition that the recipiendary should write a little better; and D’Alembert, to
                    tranquillize the philosophers, who hesitated to support an abbé, said to them,
                    “I assure you he has nothing of a priest but the habit.” The Abbé Millot was a
                    man of a cold and serious character; he had no love for society, seldom spoke in
                    company, and avoided that egotism which is so tyrannical in conversation.
                    Attentive to the discussions which were continually arising about him, he rarely
                    took part in them; and contradiction never ruffled his temper. Grimm, who saw
                    him often in the society of Paris, describes his appearance as melancholy and
                    dejected. “Nevertheless,” adds the baron, “he is one of the happiest beings I
                    know, because he is moderate, content with his lot, and attached to his
                    particular kind of life and labour.” D’Alembert used to cite him as the man in
                    whom he had found the fewest prejudices and the least pretensions. The following
                    is a complete list of his works, viz. 1. <hi rend="italic">Deux Discours,</hi>

                    Besançon, 1816, in 8vo. Other works have been ascribed to Millot, but these are
                    now known not to have been his. He was a member of the academies of Lyons,
                    Nancy, and Châlons-sur-Marne; but that of Besançon neglected to adopt a man who
                    did so much honour to the province, an omission which was repaired in 1814, by
                    proposing as the subject of a prize an eloge on Millot.</p>
