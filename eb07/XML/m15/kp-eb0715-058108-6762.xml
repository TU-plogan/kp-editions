                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">MOULD, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Mold</hi></label>, in the
                    mechanical arts, is a cavity artificially cut, with a design to give its form or
                    impression to some softer matter applied therein. Moulds are implements of great
                    use in sculpture, foundery, and other arts. The workmen employed in melting the
                    mineral or metallic ore dug out of mines have their several moulds to receive
                    the melted metal as it comes out of the furnace; but these are different
                    according to the diversity of metals and works. In gold mines they have moulds
                    for ingots, in silver mines for bars, in copper and lead mines for pigs or
                    salmons, in tin mines for pigs and ingots, and in iron mines for sows, chimney
                    backs, anvils, caldrons, pots, and other large utensils and merchandises of
                    iron, which are here cast, as it were, at first hand.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Moulds</hi> of founders of large works, as statues, bells,
                    guns, and other brazen works, are of wax, supported within-side by what we call
                    a core, and covered without-side with a cape or case. It is in the space
                    occupied by the wax, which is afterwards melted away to leave it free, that the
                    liquid metal runs, and the work is formed, being carried thither through a great
                    number of little canals, which cover the whole mould.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Moulds</hi> of moneyers are frames full of sand, in which
                    the plates of metal are cast which are intended to serve for striking species of
                    gold and silver.</p>
                <p>A sort of concave moulds made of clay, having within them the figures and
                    inscriptions of ancient Roman coins, are found in many parts of England, and
                    supposed to have been used for casting money. Mr Baker having been favoured with
                    a sight of some of these moulds discovered in Shropshire, bearing the same types
                    and inscriptions with some of the Roman coins, gave an account of them to the
                    Royal Society. They were found in digging for sand, at a place called Ëyton in
                    Shropshire, about a mile from the great Watling-street Road. They are all of the
                    size of the Roman denarius, and of little more than the thickness of our
                    halfpenny. They are made of a smooth pot or brick clay, which seems to have been
                    first well cleansed from dirt and sand, and well beaten or kneaded, to render it
                    fit for taking a fair impression. There were a great many of them found
                    together, and some have not unfrequently been found in Yorkshire; but they do
                    not seem to have been met with in any other place, except at Lyons, where
                    several are said to have been discovered. They have been sometimes found in
                    great numbers joined together side by side, on one flat piece of clay, as if
                    intended for the casting of a great number of coins at once; and both these, and
                    all the others that have been found, seem to have been of the Emperor Severus.
                    They are sometimes found impressed on both sides, and several have the head of
                    Severus on one side and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> well-known reverse of his on
                    the other. They seem plainly to have been intended for the coinage of money,
                    though it is not easy to say in what manner they can have been employed for that
                    purpose, especially those which have impressions on both sides, unless it may be
                    supposed that they coined two pieces at the same time by <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193826775" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6775-0582"/>the help of three moulds, of
                    which this was to be the middle one. If, by disposing these into some sort of
                    iron frame or case, as our letter-founders do the brass moulds for casting their
                    types, the melted metal could be easily poured into them, it would certainly be
                    a very easy method of coining, as such moulds require little time or expense to
                    make them, and therefore new ones might be supplied as often as the old ones
                    happened to break.</p>
                <p>These moulds seem to have been burned or baked sufficiently to make them hard;
                    but not so as to render them porous like our bricks, whereby they would have
                    lost their smooth and even surface, which in these is plainly so close, that
                    whatever metal should be formed in them would have no appearance like the
                    sandholes by which counterfeit coins and metals are usually detected.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Moulds</hi> of founders of small works are like the frames
                    of coiners. It is in these frames, which are likewise filled with sand, that
                    their several works are fashioned; and when the two frames of which the mould is
                    composed are rejoined, the melted brass is run.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Moulds</hi> of letter-founders are partly of steel and
                    partly of wood. The wood, properly speaking, serves only to cover the real mould
                    which is within, and to prevent the workman, who holds it in his hand, from
                    being incommoded by the heat of the melted metal. Only one letter or type can be
                    formed at once in each mould.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Moulds,</hi> in the manufacture of paper, are little frames
                    composed of several brass or iron wires, fastened together by another wire still
                    finer. Each mould is of the dimensions of the sheet of paper to be made, and has
                    a rim or ledge of wood to which the wires are fastened. These moulds are more
                    usually called frames or forms.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Moulds,</hi> with furnace and crucible makers, are made of
                    wood, of the same form with the crucibles, that is, in the form of a truncated
                    cone; they have handles of wood to hold and turn them with, when, being covered
                    with the earth, the workman has a mind to round or flatten his vessel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Moulds</hi> for leaden bullets are little iron pincers, each
                    branch of which terminates in a hemispherical concave, and these when shut form
                    an entire sphere. In the lips or sides where the branches meet is a little jet
                    or hole, through which the melted lead is conveyed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Laboratory</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Moulds</hi> are
                    made of wood, for filling and driving all sorts of rockets, cartridges, and
                    fuses.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Glaziers</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Moulds.</hi> The
                    glaziers have two kinds of moulds for casting their lead in. In the one, they
                    cast the lead into long rods or canes fit to be drawn through the vice, and the
                    grooves formed therein; and this they sometimes call ingot-mould. In the other,
                    they mould those little pieces of lead a line thick and two lines broad,
                    fastened to the iron bars. These may also be cast in the vice.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Goldsmiths’</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Moulds.</hi> The
                    goldsmiths use the bones of the cuttle fish to make moulds for their small
                    works, which they do by pressing the pattern between two bones, and leaving a
                    jet or hole to convey the metal through, after the pattern has been taken
                    out.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Moulds,</hi> amongst masons, are pieces of hard wood or iron
                    hollowed within-side, corresponding to the contours of the mouldings or cornices
                    to be formed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Moulds,</hi> amongst plumbers, are the tables upon which
                    they cast sheets of lead, and which they sometimes call simply <hi rend="italic"
                    >tables.</hi> Besides these, they have other real moulds, with which they cast
                    pipes without soldering.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Moulds,</hi> amongst the glass-grinders, are wooden frames,
                    on which they make the tubes wherewith they fit their perspectives, telescopes,
                    and other optic machines. These moulds are cylinders, of a length and diameter
                    according to the use they are to be applied to, but always thicker at one end
                    than the other, to facilitate the sliding. The tubes made on these moulds are of
                    two kinds; the one simply of pasteboard and paper, and the other of thin leaves
                    of wood joined to the pasteboard. To make these tubes to draw out, the last or
                    innermost only is formed on the mould; each tube made afterwards serving as a
                    mould to that which is to, go over it, but without taking out the mould from the
                    first.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Moulds</hi> used in basket-making are very simple,
                    consisting ordinarily of a willow or osier turned or bent into an oval, circle,
                    square, or other figure, according to the baskets, panniers, hampers, and other
                    utensils intended. On these moulds they make, or more properly measure, all
                    their work; and accordingly they have them of all sizes and shapes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mould,</hi> in ship-building, a thin, flexible piece of
                    timber, used by shipwrights as a pattern whereby to form the different curves of
                    the timbers, and other compassing pieces in a ship’s frame. There are two sorts
                    of these, viz. the bend mould and hollow mould. The former of these determines
                    the convexity of the timbers, and the latter their concavity on the outside,
                    where they approach the heel, particularly towards the extremities of the
                    vessel. The figure given to the timbers by this pattern is called their <hi

                    tallow-chandlers, are of two kinds. The one for the common dipped candles, being
                    the vessel in which the melted tallow is disposed, and the wick dipped, is of
                    wood, of a triangular form, and supported on one of its angles, so that it has
                    an opening of near a foot a-top. The other, used in the fabric of mould candles,
                    is of brass, pewter, or tin. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
