                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Military Discipline,</hi> the training of soldiers, and the
                    due enforcement of the laws and regulations instituted by authority for securing
                    obedience and repressing all disorderly habits or tendencies. Next to the
                    forming of troops, military discipline is an object of the first importance. It
                    is the soul of all armies; and, unless it be established with great prudence,
                    supported with unshaken resolution, and enforced with rigour tempered by
                    judgment, an army is no better than an armed mob, and is more formidable to the
                    state that maintains it than dangerous to its declared enemies.</p>

                    country or town which refuses to pay the contributions imposed upon them, or
                    which has incurred that penalty from any transgression of the usages of war.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Military State,</hi> in British polity, is one of the three
                    divisions of the laity. This state includes the whole of the soldiery, or such
                    persons as are peculiarly appointed for the safeguard and defence of the
                    realm.</p>
                <p>In the time of the Anglo-Saxons, the military force of England was in the hands
                    of the dukes or heretochs, who were constituted throughout every province and
                    county in the kingdom, being taken from the principal nobility, and such as were
                    most remarkable for being <hi rend="italic">sapientes, fideles, et animosi.</hi>
                    Their duty was to conduct and regulate the English armies with unlimited power,
                    <hi rend="italic">prout eis</hi><hi rend="italic">visum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fuerit,</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">honorem</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">coronae</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">utilitatem regni.</hi> And because of this great power, they were
                    elected by the people in full assembly, that is, by folkmote, in the same manner
                    as sheriffs were elected; according to the fundamental maxim of the Saxon
                    constitution, that where any officer was to be intrusted with such power as, if
                    abused, might tend to the oppression of the people, that power should be
                    delegated to him by the vote of the people themselves. The ancient Germans, the
                    ancestors of our Saxon forefathers, had also their dukes, as well as kings; with
                    an independent power over the military, as the kings had over the civil state.
                    The dukes were elective, the kings hereditary; <hi rend="italic">reges</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic">nobilitate,</hi><hi rend="italic">duces
                    ex</hi><hi rend="italic">virtute sumunt.</hi> In constituting their kings, the
                    family or blood royal was regarded; in choosing their dukes or leaders, they had
                    respect to warlike merit alone. Caesar relates of their ancestors in his time,
                    that whenever they went to war, either offensively or defensively, they elected
                    leaders to command them. This large share of power, thus conferred by the
                    people, though intended to preserve the liberty of the subject, was perhaps
                    unreasonably detrimental to the prerogative of the crown. Accordingly we find
                    that, in the reign of King Edmund Ironside, a very bad use was made of it by
                    Edric, duke of Mercia, who, by his office of duke o r heretoch, was entitled to
                    a large command in the king’s army, and by his repeated treachery at last
                    transferred the crown to Canute the Dane.</p>
                <p>It seems to be universally agreed by all historians, that Alfred first settled a
                    national militia in this kingdom, and by his prudent discipline made all the
                    subjects of his dominions soldiers. But we are unfortunately left in the dark as
                    to the particulars of this celebrated regulation; although, from what has been
                    observed, the dukes seem to have been left in possession of a power so large and
                    independent that, on the death of Edward the Confessor, it enabled Duke Harold,
                    though a stranger to the blood royal, to ascend the throne of this kingdom, in
                    prejudice of Edgar Etheling, the rightful heir.</p>
                <p>Upon the Norman conquest, the feudal law, in all its rigour, was introduced into
                    this country, the whole of that system being built on a military plan. Hence all
                    the lands in the kingdom were divided into what were called <hi rend="italic"
                    >knights fees,</hi> in number above sixty thousand; and for every knight’s fee,
                    a knight or soldier, <hi rend="italic">miles,</hi> was bound <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193820080" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0080-0067"/>to attend the king in his
                    wars for forty days annually; in which time, before war was reduced to a
                    science, the campaign was generally finished, and a kingdom either conquered or
                    victorious. By this means the king had, without any expense, an army of sixty
                    thousand men always ready at his command. Accordingly we find one amongst the
                    laws of William the Conqueror, which commands and enjoins the personal
                    attendance of all knights and others, <hi rend="italic">quod</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">habeant</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    facere.</hi> This personal service in process of time degenerated into pecuniary
                    commutations or aids; and at last the military part of the feudal system was at
                    the Restoration abolished, by statute 12 Car. II. c. 24.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Military</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Martial Law,</hi> is
                    that branch of the laws of war which respects military discipline, or the
                    government and control of persons employed in the operations or for the purposes
                    of war. Military law is not exclusive of the common law; for a man, by
                    becomingia soldier, does not cease to be a citizen or a member of the
                    commonwealth. He is a citizen still, capable of performing the duties of a
                    subject, and answerable in the ordinary course of law for his conduct in that
                    capacity. Martial law is, therefore, a system of rule superadded to the common
                    law, for regulating the citizen in his additional character of soldier; a
                    temporary character assumed for a special end, and to be laid aside when that
                    end has been attained, and when the disturbance which gave occasion to it has
                    subsided. For, as the law knows nothing of a mere soldier, or one bred up to no
                    other profession than that of arms, so a perpetual standing army is against the
                    principles of the constitution, and, if without consent of parliament, is
                    clearly against law.</p>
                <p>Throughout all Europe, in the feudal times, property was commonly held upon
                    condition of military service; and the possessors of land were, by virtue of
                    their right, at once its cultivators in peace and its defenders in war. But the
                    fetters of land under the feudal system were incompatible with a state of
                    commerce, and the arbitrary power of lords over their vassals was adverse to
                    civil liberty; its strictness declined; the services of tenants were commuted
                    for money, and with money were purchased the services of mercenaries, who were
                    ready to make war a trade. The disorders incident to the disbanding of these
                    troops, the changes which had taken place in the mode of warfare, and the
                    necessity of attending to the balance of power in Europe, all concurred to
                    suggest the idea of a disciplined standing army, which was formed first in
                    France, and then in the other states of Europe. The military despotism, however,
                    which ensued on the Continent was in this country happily prevented by the
                    spirit of a free people; and at the Revolution it was asserted and declared,
                    that the raising or keeping up a standing army within the kingdom, in time of
                    peace, without consent of parliament, is contrary to law. The expediency of a
                    standing army is admitted, and at the same time the liberties of the people are
                    maintained. A standing army therefore exists, but primarily for the benefit,
                    because only with the consent, of the people.</p>
                <p>In early times the king’s justiciar was <hi rend="italic">caput</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">legis</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >militiae</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> at the head not only of the law, but also
                    of the military force of the kingdom. But in England, on the division of the <hi
                    rend="italic">aula</hi><hi rend="italic">regis,</hi> the constable and marischal
                    presided over a court of chivalry for the determination of matters of honour and
                    arms. From time to time, however, other tribunals were subsequently instituted
                    for the administration of martial law; and at length, after the Revolution,
                    when, in addition to the militia* and other local troops of the kingdom, a
                    regular standing army was judged necessary for the safety of the realm, the
                    defence of the possessions of the crown, and the preservation of the balance of
                    power in Europe, acts were passed for the maintenance of military order and
                    discipline. Scotland differed from’ England in this respect, that there was here
                    no distribution of the powers of the lord justiciar, such as took place in
                    England, nor was there ever any court of chivalry. In other respects the two
                    countries were, in as far as concerns martial law, very much alike.</p>
                <p>The first of the military acts which passed after the Revolution was occasioned
                    by a mutiny in a body of English and Scotch troops (amongst whom were the
                    regiment of dragoons now called the Scotch Greys, and the royal Scotch regiment
                    of foot), on being ordered to Holland to replace some of the troops of that
                    country which King William had brought over with him. The circumstance was
                    communicated to parliament, and on the 3d April 1689 an act was passed for
                    punishing mutiny, desertion, &amp;c. It authorized the king to grant commissions
                    to certain officers to hold courts martial, for the trial of crimes committed by
                    officers and soldiers; and this act, which has been renewed from time to time,
                    has since the Union been extended to Scotland.</p>
                <p>An act of the same nature was passed in the parliament of England, 13 Cha. II.
                    stat. i. c. 9, authorizing the lord high admiral to grant commission to inferior
                    vice-admirals, &amp;c. to assemble courts-martial for the trial of offences
                    committed at sea by officers, marines, or others in the king’s naval service.
                    But this statute was in many points altered by subsequent enactments, till at
                    last all the laws relating to courts-martial for the sea service were reduced
                    into one act, applying equally to the whole united kingdom, namely, 22 Geo. II.
                    c. 33, explained and amended by 19 Geo. III. c. 17.</p>
                <p>The more recent statutes for the government of the forces, naval and military,
                    are 1 Will. IV. c. 14, 15; 2 and 3 Will. IV. c. 23, 28; 3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 5,
                    6; 4 and 5 Will. IV. c. 4, 5, &amp;c. To detail the provisions of these acts
                    would extend this article beyond the limits allowed to it; and it is not
                    necessary to do so, as the acts themselves, which are very full and explicit,
                    must be in the possession of those interested in them. We shall only observe,
                    that the judgments of courts-martial, like those of other courts, are liable to
                    be taken cognizance of in the superior courts of common law, and the members
                    punished for illegal proceedings, and for all wilful and corrupt abuse of
                    authority against the known, obvious, and common principles of justice.</p>
