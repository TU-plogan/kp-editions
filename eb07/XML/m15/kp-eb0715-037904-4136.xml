                <p><label type="entry">MONAGHAN</label>, an inland county in the province of Ulster,
                    in Ireland, is bounded on the north by the county of Tyrone, on the east by
                    those of Armagh and Louth, on the south by those of Louth and Cavan, and on the
                    west by those of Cavan and Fermanagh. It extends over a surface of 327,048
                    acres, of which 309,968 acres are capable of cultivation, 9236 are unprofitable
                    mountain or bog, and 7844 are under water.</p>
                <p>According to Whitaker, the tribe of the Scoti, which spread itself over the
                    greater part of the interior of Ireland, inhabited this county in the time of
                    Ptolemy. In a subsequent period of Irish history it formed part of the territory
                    of Uriel or Orgial; and, from the principal family which then resided in it, was
                    also known by the name of M‘Mahon’s country. In the reign of Elizabeth it was
                    reduced into shire-ground, and was divided into the five baronies which still
                    exist, namely, those of Cremorne, Dartry, Farney, Monaghan, and Trough. These
                    are subdivided into nineteen parishes, and four parts of parishes, the remainder
                    of which are in some of the adjoining counties.</p>
                <p>According to the ecclesiastical arrangements of the country, Monaghan is wholly
                    included in the diocese of Clogher, the see of which is in the city of the same
                    name in the county of Tyrone. It contains twenty-one parishes.</p>
                <p>The general appearance of the surface is hilly, yet not rising into heights of
                    considerable elevation. Its principal mountain range is that of Slievebaugh, a
                    rugged and barren tract which separates it from Tyrone. Its highest summit,
                    called Cairnrnore, commands an extensive view of the surrounding country on
                    every side. Crieve Mountain, in the south, is still more elevated, but of
                    smaller superficial extent. There are no rivers of any consequence. The Finn,
                    which rises near the centre of the county, scarcely merits the title <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> river until after its entrance into Fermanagh; and the
                    Blackwater, forming part of the northeastern boundary towards Tyrone, is the
                    receptacle of many of the smaller rivulets which take their rise here. But,
                    though deficient in rivers of magnitude, it is amply furnished with stι earns of
                    running water, well suited to the purposes of agriculture and of manufacturing
                    industry; nor can any other county boast of such a number of lakes, although few
                    of them are of an extent such as to entitle them to specific notice. The number
                    of these lakes is 184, thirty of which are considerable sheets of water. The
                    most remarkable are Lough Eagish, on Crieve Mountain, which supplies water for a
                    long Succession of mills and bleaching-greens; Lakes Damby, Camm, and Oona.
                    Others near Castleblaney, Dawson Grove, and Mount Lewis, are celebrated for the
                    beauty of the surrounding scenery.</p>
                <p>The soil is of various kinds. In the central parts it consists of a rich
                    limestone. The southern districts are partly of the same quality, and partly a
                    deep clay, capable of a high degree of cultivation under judicious management.
                    The north consists mostly of a stiff’ retentive clay, marshy in winter, and
                    hardening quickly by the heat of summer, yet interspersed in many parts with
                    tracts of valuable limestone soil. Whilst the limestone formation predominates
                    in the level districts, the more elevated portions exhibit traces of a different
                    character. To the north the hills show sandstone; but those in the south are of
                    basalt or whinstone. Coal has been found in more than one place, but in veins so
                    poor and scanty as not to encourage the outlay of capital upon its exploration.
                    Slates of good quality are quarried in Crieve Mountain. A lead mine was also
                    worked there, but has long since been relinquished as unprofitable. Ochre,
                    potters’ clay of such quality as to cause an exportation of it to Dundalk for
                    the manufacture of glazed earthenware, brick clay, manganese, antimony, and
                    fullers’ earth, are also found here. There is a chalybeate spring at
                    Drumtubberbuy, on Cairnmore, the water of which casts up a thick scum of ochre.
                    A well near Clones is much celebrated for its efficacy in cases of jaundice,
                    whence it has acquired its name of Granabuymore, or “the great yellow cure.” A
                    spring at Tullaghan throws up water which, although perfectly tasteless and
                    clear, deposits an incrustation on the banks near its source. This county has a
                    large proportion of bog, which, together with its great number of lakes, and its
                    exposure to the north-western winds, render it very damp, although it is far
                    from being unwholesome.</p>
                <p>The results of inquiries as to the population, made at different periods, are as

                <p>Die estates in land are of every value, from L.20,000 per annum to L.20; being
                    partly held under grants of the escheated lands in Ulster in the time of James
                    I., and partly arising out of the forfeitures in the time of Cromwell. Leases
                    are for short terms, usually twenty-one years, and one or three lives. The
                    mountainous districts are frequently held in joint tenancy by a large number of
                    occupants. The tenants of one of those mountain districts once formed a
                    community of very singular character. Their village consisted of nearly two
                    hundred cabins, on a tract of 500 acres of bog, at Blackstaff, near
                    Carrickmacross, but so barren as not to afford the means of the lowest animal
                    subsistence, so that they were forced to derive their support from patches of
                    land rented by them ata considerable distance from their place of residence. The
                    community allowed itself to be governed by a mayor, chosen annually by all the
                    members. The holder of the largest potatogarden was sure to be elected. All
                    disputes w ere referred to him, and no appeal was known to be made from his
                    decision. His fee was a bottle of whisky, which was invariably shared by him
                    with the contending parties. The office was one of honour rather than of profit;
                    for there was no instance of a mayor holding his post for two successive years.
                    The community was broken up in consequence of the rebellion of 1798, at which
                    time the members were compelled to quit their village, and to reside upon their
                    detached plots; yet, for several years afterwards, they held an annual convivial
                    meeting on the site of their deserted village.</p>
                <p>The mansions of the landed proprietors are numerous and elegant; the houses of
                    the wealthier farmers, and more particularly of those who combine manufactures
                    with agriculture, exhibit every indication of comfort; but the dwellings of
                    cottiers and labourers are miserable in the extreme. The dress of the male
                    peasantry is home manufactured frize, dyed blue; that of the female generally
                    cotton. Flesh meat seldom forms a part of their dietary. The cottiers in the
                    districts remote from towns are unable to procure any food but potatoes seasoned
                    with salt. Fuel is cheap and abundant, in consequence of the quantity of bog.
                    The language is both English and Irish; but the latter predominates in the more
                    retired parts of the county.</p>
                <p>The state of agriculture has improved with great rapidity during the last twenty
                    or thirty years. The accounts given shortly after the year 1800 describe the old
                    country plough of clumsy construction, the slide-car without wheels, the
                    conveyance of the manure and field produce on horses or asses’ backs, and the
                    application of manual labour and spade-husbandry as being generally prevalent.
                    At present all the improvements introduced by scientific •agriculturists are to
                    be seen in practice here, as far as they have been found consistent with the
                    peculiar nature of the soil and climate. Ploughs on the most improved plan,
                    Scotch carts, and implements of various kinds to supersede the improvident
                    exertion of manual labour, are universal; yet in some parts where the nature of
                    the ground forbids the use of the plough, considerable tracts of land are still
                    cultivated by the spade. The old, stunted, and ill-conditioned breeds of black
                    cattle, sheep, and hogs, have given way to the most esteemed British or foreign
                    stocks, the character of which has not unfrequently been made more suitable to
                    the agricultural localities by judicious crossings with the native breeds. Wheat
                    and oats are the principal species of grain. Barley and bear are largely grown
                    in the hilly districts. Clover is much encouraged, and few farmers are without a
                    patch of it, however small. It is cut green for soil, and is found extremely
                    economical. The tops of furze or gorse are also used, when pounded, as food for
                    horses, and prove highly palatable to the animal, as well as very nutritious.
                    Flax, for the growth of which the soil is peculiarly favourable, is very
                    generally raised. The manure is formed of composts, of which lime and burned
                    turf mould are generally component parts; marl, though common, is little used.
                    The fences in some parts are of white thorn, interspersed with sallows; in
                    others a slight mound of earth serves rather to determine the boundary than to
                    prevent trespassing. Asses and pigs are numerous. Fish abound in the numerous
                    lakes. The county was once almost a continuous forest, excepting the higher
                    lands, which appear to be of a nature ungenial to the growth of trees. The
                    numerous demesnes of the nobility and gentry are richly embellished by
                    plantations of modern growth. Ash and sycamore are much encouraged. The wood of
                    the latter is in great repute for some parts of mill-machinery. Osieries are
                    frequently to be found in the marshy bottoms at the foot of hills, and prove
                    highly profitable.</p>
                <p>The principal manufacture is that of linen, which was long carried on with great
                    spirit, and produced a considerable export; but it has latterly declined, partly
                    in consequence of the increasing preference given to cotton goods. The woollen
                    manufacture is chiefly employed in supplying the domestic consumption. The sand
                    or gritstone of Cairnmore has given rise to a manufacture of millstones there,
                    which are in considerable demand. Tanyards are frequent. Coarse earthenware is
                    manufactured at Glasslough, and a small iron-work near Clones supplies most of
                    the agricultural implements used in the county.</p>
                <p>The remains of antiquity are but few. The most remarkable are two round or pillar
                    towers; one in the burial-ground of Clones, and the other at Inniskeen, on the
                    borders of Louth. The former consisted of five stories, the traces of which are
                    still visible in the walls; and its door is about four feet above the level of
                    the ground. Near it is a large stone coffin, above ground, with a cover of the
                    same <pb break="no" facs="nls:193824162" xml:id="kp-eb0715-4162-0381"/>material
                    shaped like the roof of a house. The latter of these towers is in a much
                    inferior state of preservation, and is unique, as having its door upon a level
                    with the surrounding country, although this is supposed by some to be the effect
                    of a modern alteration. Near Clones arc two large raths; one in good
                    preservation, exhibiting distinct traces of its fossesand embankments; the other
                    smaller, and much decayed. Danish forts are numerous. The only monastic
                    structure of which any vestiges remain is that of Clones, which was a foundation
                    of regular canons. It was destroyed by Hugh de Lacy, shortly after the arrival
                    of the English; but was rebuilt soon afterwards, and secured from a similar fate
                    by the erection of a castle in its neighbourhood. An abbey of Conventual
                    Franciscans was founded at Monaghan by one of the M‘Mahons; but it was
                    afterwards totally destroyed, and a castle erected on its site, which also was
                    in a ruinous state in the reign of James I. Ruins of castles are to be seen at
                    Donaghmoyne and Dawson’s Grove.</p>
                <p>Monaghan, the county town, is situated near the centre of the county, at a short
                    distance from the Blackwater, to the south. Its ancient name was Muinechan, “the
                    town of Monks,” given to it from the religious establishment formerly existing
                    there. The principal buildings are a market-house, in which a brisk linen trade
                    is carried on, erected by Lord Rossmore in 1792; a court-house; and a parislu
                    church. In the immediate vicinity of the town is a Roman Catholic chapel, a
                    Presbyterian meeting-house in the New Market, the county infirmary, the diocesan
                    school-house, the barrack for cavalry at the northern entrance of the town, and
                    an extensive county prison, which has been built at an expense of L 20,000. The
                    town contains a brewery, and carries on a pretty considerable trade in linen.
                    Its population in 1831 amounted to 3848 souls. The other towns whose population
                    exceeds 1000 souls are as follow:—Carrickmacross, 2979; Clones, 2381; Balli-bay,
                    1947; and Castleblayney, 1828.</p>
