                    >Hector,</hi> a distinguished Scottish poet, born on the 22d of October 1746, at
                    Rosebank, on the Esk, and almost amongst the classic woods of Hawthornden. Here
                    his father, descended from an old respectable family in the south of
                    Argyleshire, had retired from military service to enjoy the undisturbed calm of
                    domestic life. Pecuniary circumstances, however, ere long forced him, with his
                    family, from this choice retreat, to, occupy a farm on the banks of Loch Lomond,
                    where part of the boyhood of Hector, the youngest and favourite child, was spent
                    amongst those scarcely less beautiful or less classic scenes, on which the young
                    eyes of Buchanan and Smollett had gazed with delight; and where their “rural
                    pipe,” as well as his own, was first tuned to freedom and love.</p>
                <p>His early education, with the exception of a short time spent at a school in the
                    neighbourhood, was solely conducted by his father at home, who, along with the
                    common branches, carefully imbued his mind with, piety and good morals, and,
                    with parental fondness and pride, also encouraged his boyish passion for the
                    muses. Preparatory, however, to going to Bristol to the house of a wealthy
                    mercantile relative, who had promised to provide for young Hector, the latter
                    was, at the age of twelve, sent to Glasgow for two years, to acquire those
                    branches immediately applicable to a commercial life. On his arrival at Bristol,
                    he was occupied for a short time in the counting-house of his relative, and in
                    completing his commercial education previously to his departure for the West
                    Indies. Having spent three years, with neither comfort nor success, in
                    mercantile pursuits in Antigua, and other three with strict honour and integrity
                    in a civil capacity, in the office of the provost-marshal of Granada, he
                    returned to his native land with the acquisition of the French language, but
                    with no more wealth than when he departed.</p>
                <p>Both his mother and sister had died in his absence, and his father did not
                    survive his return above a year and a half. The small inheritance to which he
                    thus succeeded he sunk in an annuity; but this only enabled him indolently to
                    waste six valuable years in a connection which, howsoever regarded in the
                    islands he had left, is still properly dishonourable in this, and which must, no
                    doubt, as much as “the idìe propensity of rhyming,” have impeded his future
                    success in life. The loss of his annuity by bankruptcy, however, broke the spell
                    which had bound him, and urged him to seek some resource for warding off the
                    immediate approach of want.</p>
                <p>In this emergency, through the interest of a friend in London, he was appointed
                    to the office of assistant-secretary in the flag-ship of Admiral Geary. Having
                    made two cruises, the one under Admiral Geary, and the other under Admiral
                    Darby, he resigned a situation which necessity alone had made him at first
                    accept. Soon afterwards, however, he was induced to undertake the same office in
                    the flag-ship of Sir Richard Bickerton, appointed to the East Indian station.
                    During this service he was present in the last naval engagement with the able
                    French commander Sufffein; and though his inkstand before him was swept away by
                    the first broadside, and a block fell over his head on the quarter-netting, he
                    evinced more calm intrepidity than the lyric bard of Rome in the battle of
                    Philippi, or the unrivalled orator of Greece on the field of Chaeronea.</p>
                <p>Before leaving the Indian shores, on the conclusion of peace with America, he
                    visited Surat, the sculptured excavations ofElephanta,and “smiling Salsett’s
                    cave-wrought coast.” An account of these singular remains of Indian superstition
                    and antiquity, his first attempt at authorship, beguiled the tedium of his
                    voyage home, and was afterwards published in the Archaeologia. Neither enriched
                    with the gold of India, nor secured in a competence by a permanent appointment,
                    he returned to Scotland after an absence of five years, where, to his
                    mortification, he found, as too frequently happens, that success or adversity is
                    considered as the proof of good or bad conduct.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823213" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3213-0308"/>
                <p>The reversion of his bankrupt annuity being still unsettled, and economy
                    necessary, he retired for two years to a humble residence in the neighbourhood
                    of Stirling, distinguished alike by the beauties of nature and the memorials of
                    national glory and independence. In this retirement, enhanced by the contrast of
                    vertical suns and tropical scenes, and so congenial to thought and the muses, he
                    produced the beautiful descriptive poem of “The Links of Forth,” which gained
                    him the enlightened friendship of Mr Graham of Gartmore.</p>
                <p>The exhausted state of his pecuniary resources, however, compelléd him to revisit
                    the West Indies. On his arrival in Jamaica he was appointed to an office in the
                    customhouse at Kingston; but the debilitating effects of fever, and other
                    circumstances connected with his duties, obliged him to repair to the upland
                    vale of Guanaboo, whose lively hues of vegetation, and “coolness wafted in
                    perfume” from the orange, the logwood, and the lime <hi rend="italic"
                    >(citrus</hi><hi rend="italic">medica,</hi><hi rend="italic">var.~)</hi> at once
                    exhilarated the mind and invigorated the constitution. Here, by a providentially
                    good fortune, he met with two old school-fellows, whom distance and time now
                    more closely united in friendship, and who, with a liberality becoming their
                    wealth, made him share in their success. At the request of the distinguished Dr
                    Currie, he drew up an impartial statement “on the treatment of the negroes,”
                    which was published at Liverpool by his esteemed friend, to whose memory he has
                    done justice, both in “The Scottish Muse,” and in “The Rose o’ Kirtle:”</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N">“And ye wha mourn at Curric’s urn,</l>
                    <l part="N">Or weep by Mersey’s river,</l>
                    <l part="N">Learn, that the rose that virtue blows,</l>
                    <l part="N">Though dead, will bloom for ever.”</l>
                </lg>
                <p>Upon his passage home he composed the second canto of the sweetly wild poem of
                    “The Harp,” founded on a tradition of the Hebrides, and communicated to him by
                    Graham of Gartmore, with whom, on his return to Stirlingshire, he lived for
                    nearly two years in the closest intimacy of friendship. From prudential motives,
                    however, and perhaps not a little in the spirit of “not burning his harp for
                    woman,” he retired from this loved abode to Argyleshire, in order to break off a
                    mutual attachment between him and a near relative of his patron. But this
                    separation told on his sensitive and feeling frame, though the interesting
                    scenery of Argyleshire, the society of friends, and the composition of admired
                    songs to the favourite airs of the country, considerably alleviated his tender
                    pain.</p>
                <p>Welcomed, from the popularity of his songs, by the fashionable society of
                    Glasgow, he was, by the liberality of a friend, about to engage there in
                    business, when, on the breaking out of the revolution in France, the commerce
                    and prosperity of that city experienced a reverse so severe as completely to
                    prevent the execution of his intentions. Soon after he was afflicted with a
                    nervous disorder, which, by improper treatment, continued about six years.
                    During this malad xed his residence for a time in a cottage near the fielu or
                    Bannockburn, “dear to the muse, but doubly dear to'liberty.” Here, unable either
                    to read or write above a few minutes without distress, he, like the blind
                    minstrels of other times, composed “Scotland’s Skaith,” by memory alone; the
                    happiest effort of his genius, and which induced his countrymen to consider him
                    as the gifted bard on whom the inspiring mantle of Burns had fallen. The sequel
                    to this simple, pathetic tale, which ran through fourteen editions in a year, he
                    composed in the same manner, and published under the title of “The Waes of War
                    ;” but this was not so well received, from its being then considered as
                    satirically reflecting upon the Dutch campaign.</p>
                <p>In the hope of recovery from his long-protracted complaints, although by many
                    deemed irremediable, he again sailed for Jamaica. This voyage happily
                    contributed alike to restore his health and to afford him a future competence.
                    By the death of one of the companions of his boyhood, the Grahams of
                    Three-Mile-River, whose kindness and liberality he had formerly experienced when
                    in Jamaica, he now received a legacy, and the surviving brother settled on him
                    an annuity for life. Under his friendly roof, previously to his return, he wrote
                    “The Scottish Muse,” descriptive of the various vicissitudes of his own poetical
                    life; and also a grateful epitaph to his deceased friend, as in duty he might
                    “with a brother’s woes record his own.”</p>
                <p>Upon his arrival in Scotland, almost like one risen from the grave, when the
                    voice of envy is silenced by death, a species of posthumous fame hailed his
                    return. With the well-deserved emoluments of his poetical labours, and another
                    bequest of an intimate medical friend in Jamaica, in addition to his annuity, he
                    spent the evening of his days in the capital of his native land, in the
                    enjoyment of publicly-awarded honour, lettered ease, and comparative affluence.
                    Here he published “The Pastoral or Lyric Muse of Scotland,” illustrative of the
                    music and song of the Scottish Arcadia—the green hills and dales of the Teviot,
                    Tweed, and Yarrow: also two satirical poems, entitled “Town Fashions,” and
                    “Bygane Times and Late Come Changes.” His last literary efforts were “The
                    Scottish Adventurers,” and an unpublished autobiography in three volumes, which
                    has been the chief guide in this brief account. Such were the calm labours of
                    the years spent in Edinburgh, till the 15th March 1818, when, at an age beyond
                    the common limit of human existence, he closed his frequently adverse, but not
                    inglorious career, leaving a name endeared to his countrymen, and embalmed in
                    the song of his father-land.</p>
                <p>Born a poet, with a musical ear, a melodious voice, and a feeling mind, MacneilΓs
                    disposition ill accorded with the rough life of the British seamen, and still
                    less with the cautious acquiring habits of the merchant. From his attachment to
                    truth, he was free, undisguised, and even severe; quick in temper, yet serene
                    and social; proudly honourable, yet warm and benevolent. True to nature and
                    feeling, as a poet he excels in the simple and pathetic; and though his humour
                    and satire be less successful, his manner is serious and his aim uniformly well
                    directed.</p>
                <p>In the year 1801 an edition of his poetical works issued from the London press,
                    in two vols. 12mo. The second edition, Edinburgh, 1806, in two vols. 12mo,
                    contains additional songs, The Rose o’ Kirtle, and Verses on Dr Doig, to whom
                    the beautiful octavo edition of Scotland’s Skaith, Edinburgh, 1795, is
                    dedicated. The third edition, Edinburgh, 1812, in two vols. 12mo, does not, as
                    might be supposed, contain the following poems, though written after the
                    publication of the preceding edition: The Pastoral or Lyric Muse of Scotland,
                    Edinburgh, 1808, 4to; Town Fashions, or Modern Manners delineated, Edinburgh,
                    1810, 12mo; Bygane Times and Late Come Changes, Edinburgh, 1811, 12mo.</p>
                <p>His publications in prose are, an Account of the Caves of Canara, Ambola, and
                    Elephanta, in the eighth volume of the Archaeologia, 1787; On the Treatment of
                    the Negroes in Jamaica, Liverpool, 1788; and The Scottish Adventurers, or the
                    Way to Rise, a historical tale, two vols. Edinburgh, 1812, 8vo. (s. s.)</p>
