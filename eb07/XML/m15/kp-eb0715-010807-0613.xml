                <p><label type="entry">MINAS GERAES</label>, an important interior province of .
                    Brazil, in South America. On the south it is separated from the provinces of Rio
                    and St Paulo by a mountain chain called the Serra Mantiqueira; on the north the
                    rivers Verde and Carynhenha divide it from Bahia and Pernambuco; on the east it
                    is bounded by part of Bahia, Porto Seguro, and Espiritu Santo; and on the west
                    by Goyaz. It is situated between the thirteenth and twenty-second parallels of
                    south latitude, and is above six hundred miles in length by about three hundred
                    and fifty in average breadth. This is the most mountainous province in Brazil.
                    Hills swell up in every direction, forming an elevated table-land, and the
                    country gradually assumes the features of a romantic alpine region. The golden
                    mountains traverse the whole extent of the province, but they do not rise more
                    than 4000 feet above the level of the sea; nor are they characterised by rugged
                    cliffs or gigantic rocky summits, such as the Alps or Cordilleras exhibit. They
                    consist of long series of detached ranges, having agreeable campos on their
                    summits, and are separated from one another by sloping and pastoral, but not
                    very deep valleys. Owing to the elevation of its table-land, the climate of
                    Minas Geraes is temperate when compared with other countries under the torrid
                    zone; and none of the provinces of Brazil abound more with rivers and mountain
                    torrents. Of these, the greater part have their origin in the Serra Mantiqueira,
                    and are received by four general channels. Two of them, the Rio Doce and the
                    Jequitinhonha, flow to the eastward, the former irrigating the comarca of Villa
                    Rica, and the latter that of Serro do Frio. The St Francisco has a northerly
                    course, and waters the comarca of Sahara; whilst the Rio Grande, or Para, takes
                    a westerly direction, after receiving the Rio das Mortes, which gave its former
                    name to the comarca of St Joao del Rey. The soil in general is very fertile,
                    yielding in abundance, and with little trouble, the grains and fruits of Europe;
                    besides the aromatic plants and other vegetable productions characteristic of
                    such regions, such as cotton, tobacco, sugar, maize, mandioc, coffee, indigo,
                    ipecacuana, columbo root, jalap, liquorice, vanilla, various gums, and Jesuits’
                    bark. The grape yields a delicious wine, but the inhabitants of the gold and
                    diamond districts drink a humbler liquor, and neglect their vineyards. The
                    forests in this province have only been partially explored, and they still
                    constitute strongholds of the Indians. The trees of which they consist are
                    consequently little known, but many of them are well adapted for dyeing and
                    tanning. These arts, however, have hitherto made little progress, as the
                    inhabitants are averse to employments of this nature, their attention being
                    chiefly directed to the glittering but often useless treasures found in the
                    bowels of the earth. The adraganth, or dragon’s gum, in this district, is of the
                    best quality. The sugar-cane grows in a wild state; the roads are covered with
                    arcades formed by its branches, which reach in many parts to the height of
                    thirty feet. The cattle are allowed to go at large on the open tracts of the
                    country, and left to subsist on whatever they can find. In the summer months,
                    when the grass throughout the wide extent is withered and burnt, they flock to
                    the margins of brooks; but this resource soon fails them, and vast numbers
                    perish from hunger. This province is very rich in mineral productions, and here
                    the principal mines of gold and diamonds are situated. The following metals and
                    minerals are also found: Platina, silver, copper, iron, lead, mercury, antimony,
                    bismuth, fossilcoal, sulphur, emeralds, rubies, topazes, chrysolites, sapphires,
                    agates, aqua-marinas, amethysts, and almost all the precious stones.</p>
                <p>Minas Geraes is divided into five comarcas; namely, St Joao del Rey, Sahara,
                    Paracatu, Villa Rica, and Serro do <pb break="no" facs="nls:193820626"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-0626-0109"/>Frio. In drawing up an account of these, we have
                    been chiefly indebted for information regarding them to the works of Mr Mawe, Mr
                    Luccock, and Drs Von Spix and Martins. We shall follow the route of the
                    first-named traveller from the frontier to Villa Rica. At rather more than a
                    league’s distance from the river Paraibuna is Rosinha do Negro, a small village,
                    situated, like others in this part of the country which are connected with a
                    large plantation, at the bottom of a deep hollow, and by the side of a small
                    stream. Two leagues farther on is another register, called Mathias Barboza,
                    formed by mud-walls, enclosing a large area, with a gateway at each end, through
                    which the public road passes. This place is the great toll-house of Minas
                    Geraes, and the duties collected, amounting to L.25,000 annually, are every
                    three months remitted to Villa Rica. The road, which lies through extensive
                    tracts of wood, continues to ascend in a direction north-west by north; and
                    there is a very sensible change in the temperature. Amongst the trees are the
                    pine and the common box-tree, the latter attaining a height of more than twelve
                    feet. As the road continues to ascend, the trees get smaller, the heaths and
                    ferns larger and more vigorous, and the air becomes cool and fresh, except
                    between the hours of two and four p. <hi rend="smallcaps">μ.</hi> Several
                    fazendas succeed one another at intervals as the traveller proceeds on his
                    journey to the capital. That called Mantequeira is situated in a large plain,
                    consisting of rich land, watered by numerous streams, but overrun with weeds and
                    brushwood. Some leagues further inland is Barbazena, which consists of between
                    three and four hundred houses, and where a considerable traffic was at one time
                    carried on with the interior in baize, cotton goods, salt, and iron. Much of the
                    trade, however, is now removed to St John’s. Barbazena is pleasantly situated on
                    the southern declivity of a considerable hill, and here the two great roads from
                    the mining country unite; the one to the westward leading to St Joao del Rey,
                    Sahara, and Cujaba; the other in a northerly direction, conducting to Villa
                    Rica, Tijuco, and Minas Novas. In the vicinity of a place called Louza there is
                    a hill covered with micaceous iron ore, and the road for above half a mile is
                    strewed with a rich oxide of iron. At Alto de Virginia and S. Antonio do Ouro
                    Branco are extensive gold washings; but between these places and the capital the
                    route lies oyer bleak and sterile mountains.</p>
                <p>Villa Rica, the capital of Minas Geraes, dates its title as a town no further
                    back than 1711, previously to which period it bore the name of Piro Oreto (black
                    gold), which is still retained by the mountain on the eastern declivity of which
                    it is situated. It occupies two hills, and part of the circumjacent valley or
                    hollow. The principal street runs for nearly two miles in a straight line along
                    the slope of the Morro. Several streets lead from the lower part of the city to
                    that situated on the high ground; and they are all paved, and connected by four
                    stone bridges. The houses are built of stone, two stories high, covered with
                    tiles, and in general white-washed. It is well supplied with water from a number
                    of public fountains distributed through the town. Amongst the public buildings,
                    some of which are not without a claim to splendour, is the governor’s palace,
                    which is situated on the highest projection of the hill; and opposite is a
                    group, of which the inhabitants are particularly proud, formed by the
                    town-house, the prison, and the theatre. In one of the lower parts of the town
                    stands the treasury, attached to which are the mint and the custom-house. There
                    are ten churches, several of which are richly ornamented, and contain paintings
                    and images. Villa Rica enjoys a very considerable trade. Almost every week large
                    convoys set out with the productions of the country, consisting of cotton,
                    hides, marmalade, cheese, precious stones, bars of gold, and other articles. In
                    exchange they bring back salt, wines, calicoes, handkerchiefs, hams, iron-ware,
                    and negroes to be employed in the gold washings and other occupations. Almost
                    all kinds of trades are here carried on; the principal are saddlers, tinmen, and
                    blacksmiths. There are likewise manufactories of gunpowder, hats, and pottery;
                    and they spin and weave wool, worsted, and cotton; but the trade of the
                    goldsmith is prohibited. All the manufactures are purely domestic: ,and the
                    implements and modes of using them are of the oldest and most unimproved
                    description. The climate of this city is delightful, being equal, it is said, to
                    that of Naples. The range of the thermometer in summer is from 64° to 80°; and
                    in winter it rarely descends below 50° of Fahrenheit. From the great elevation
                    of the city, however, it is subject to sudden alternations of temperature during
                    the course of a single day, and thunder-storms are frequent. Both soil and
                    climate are remarkably .favourable to fruits and vegetables, and numerous
                    orchards are situated on the side of the mountain. The system of horticulture,
                    however, is very bad; and, notwithstanding the fertility of the country, the
                    market is but ill supplied with culinary articles. Of the population it is
                    difficult to form an estimate, as the amount is given by different travellers at
                    from eight thousand to twenty thousand; and Mr Luccock states that it is
                    continually fluctuating. According to one traveller, the greater part of the
                    inhabitants consist of blacks and mulattoes; another says there are more whites
                    than blacks; and a third states that there is a considerable proportion of
                    Portuguese.</p>
                <p>This is the very centre of the gold country, and a somewhat particular
                    description of this extraordinary spot is necessary. “To contemplate the gold
                    mines of Villa Rica with advantage,” says Mr Luccock, “it will be necessary to
                    recollect, that the land is composed of schist, or a sort of slaty clay, resting
                    upon a core of granite, gneiss, or sandstone, sometimes laminated, at other
                    times solid, the gold being scattered in small particles amid the superjacent
                    schist and clay;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr Von
                    Spix, however, denominates the superjacent stratum an ironstone floetz,
                    consisting partly of clay coloured by oxide of iron, but principally of
                    lithomarge, generally of a reddish-brown colour. In this mass there is a large
                    quantity of compact brown ironstone: and also detached nodules of quartz, mica
                    slate, and, though rarely, fragments of topazes. The gold in this formation
                    occurs either in very small grains and crystals within the layers of clay and
                    lithomarge, or as a coating on brown ironstone, or imbedded in it in folia.
                    Below this ironstone floetz is a species of mica slate, containing a large
                    proportion of iron; and through the mass there is disseminated a considerable
                    quantity of gold, particularly in the quartz veins by which it is traversed.
                    Gold in abundance is likewise found in other formations.</p></note> and that the
                    town is placed at the junction of several streams, whose waters have only one
                    outlet by a narrow bason, cut by their force through the surface down to the
                    more firm component parts. Before this outlet, called the Rio do Carino, became
                    so deep as it is, a small lake must have existed among the hills, through which
                    all the waters of the upper country passed, bringing with them and depositing in
                    the bottom a variety of heavy matter.” By this means the ground was raised,
                    whilst the outlet was deepened, until the water was entirely drained off; thus
                    leaving the bottom dry, in the shape of a level plain, composed of the debris of
                    various kinds, mingled with which was a considerable quantity of gold. This
                    plain is surrounded by mountains containing, it is supposed, much gold,
                    notwithstanding what has been washed down or extracted from them. A stream
                    traverses the plain, and, when flooded by rain, small trenches are formed on its
                    banks, into which the water runs, and, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193820639"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-0639-0110"/>depositing the sediment suspended in it, more or
                    less gold is generally mingled with the mass; and on the occasion of a flood the
                    whole of the inhabitants turn out and pursue the search for the precious metal.
                    On the side of the hill the bottoms of the natural streams are searched, and
                    where these do not exist, excavations are formed, and the courses of streams are
                    turned and made to pass through them. So numerous are the perforations of this
                    kind, that the side of the mountain presents the appearance of a honey-comb. The
                    greatest quantity of gold has been found on the eastern declivity of the Mono of
                    Villa Rica, and here the search for it is conducted more systematically. Sieves
                    and raw ox hides are placed at certain distances in trenches full of water,
                    which is conducted from the summit; the first is intended to stop the coarser
                    sand, and the second is to catch the gold dust in the hair, which stands erect;
                    sometimes woollen cloths are used for this purpose. The gold found here varies
                    in colour according to the nature of the other metals or minerals with which it
                    is mixed. The Morro of Villa Rica extends in a direction east and west along the
                    valley of the Ribeiro do Oiro Preto or do Carmo, to Passagem, a village
                    containing about one hundred and fifty houses, situated about two leagues from
                    the capital. Gold mines or washings are likewise situated in the vicinity of the
                    episcopal city of Mariana (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mariana),</hi> at the
                    Presidio de St Joao Baptista, on the Rio de San Joze, where it washes the base
                    of the Altos de St Miguel, at the aldeaof St Joze de Barra Louga, and at various
                    other places throughout the province. A district in which the beautiful fazenda
                    of Capao is situated, is that where the well-known Brazilian topazes are found.
                    What is called the topaz mine is only an open quarry, consisting of two breaks
                    or slips in the mountain side. These precious stones are found in three
                    different places. The mine which Dr Von Spix examined was a hill immediately
                    behind the fazenda of Lana, which, on one side, for a considerable breadth and
                    to a height of sixty feet, had become so softened by rains, and by water
                    conducted upon it by art, that it had become like a marsh. The soil is thrown up
                    into long heaps with shovels, and washed, by means of water conducted over it,
                    into a narrow channel, with some wooden lattices fixed in it, so that only the
                    more solid parts remain behind, which are then broken with hoes, and with the
                    hands in search of topazes. The quantity found here annually may amount to
                    between fifty and sixty arrobas,, but many of them are of an inferior, quality.
                    The greater part of these topazes is exported from this place to Rio de Janeiro,
                    and a smaller portion to Bahia. The euklase is also found here, and has
                    attracted the attention of the inciros since mineralogists have inquired after
                    it. This stone is in general scarce, and is more frequently met with in the mine
                    of Capao than in that of Lana. Five leagues to the westward of Çapao is the iron
                    foundery of De Prata, which produces annually about one thousand arrobas of
                    iron. The ore is a rich iron glance, but particularly magnetic iron stone, the
                    very thick beds of which stand out near the foundery. The rock is mica slate. A
                    league and a half to the south-southeast of De Prata are the gold and lead mines
                    of Senhor Romualdo Joze Monteiro do Barros. The gold mine is a cream-coloured
                    clay slate traversed by auriferous veins of quartz, amongst which the metal is
                    disseminated, along with manganese. The mine of Cujabeira, in which the chromate
                    of lead is found, is a low hill of clay, scarcely a league distant from the
                    fazenda. The red lead ore is found in a vein of friable, grayish-white, granular
                    quartz, amongst pretty much integrated, white, sealylithomarge. The crystals of
                    the chromate of lead are very small, and seldom show well-defined terminal
                    planes. Not far from this estate is the arraial of Matozinho, which contains
                    about one hundred and fifty houses, with several churches; and on the opposite
                    side of the river Paraopeba is situated Congon-has, containing about two hundred
                    houses, and several chapels, one of which, although small in dimensions, vies in
                    the splendour of its ornaments with any ecclesiastical edifice in the country.
                    It has indeed been designated the Loretto of Brazil. ìn external appearance it
                    is not more than respectable, but the interior decorations and emblazonry,
                    consisting of the precious stones of Brazil, are on the most splendid scale.
                    Eight miles to the north-east of Marianna is the arraial of Antonio Perreira,
                    where gold mines are situated; but we must now quit the land of gold for the
                    land of diamonds, situated in the comarca of Serro do Frio.</p>
                <p>The comarca of Serro do Frio is divided from that of Villa Rica by the river
                    Doce. Villa do Principe, the capital, is situated about one hundred and ten
                    miles northnorth-east of Marianna, close upon the confines of the diamond
                    district. Like the other provincial capitals of Minas, this town has its
                    smelting-house, with the usual appointments, its ouvidor, who holds also the
                    office of mint master, and a <hi rend="italic">juiz de for a.</hi> It contains a
                    church, five chapels, and about five thousand inhabitants, a considerable
                    portion of whom are shopkeepers, the rest being artizans, farmers, and miners.
                    The country around Villa do Principe is very fine and open, being free from
                    those impenetrable forests which occur so frequently in other parts of the
                    province. The climate is mild and salubrious; the soil is productive, yielding
                    Indian corn, legumes, cotton, and sugar. A few leagues beyond this town the
                    aspect of the country changes, and the district in which Tejuco is situated is
                    sterile and unproductive. This town is irregularly built on the side of a hill,
                    and contains a church, several chapels, and a number of shops stocked with
                    English cottons, baizes, and cloths, with other kinds of manufactured goods.
                    What is termed the diamond ground extends about sixteen leagues from north to
                    south, and about eight from east to west; and several thousand negroes, who are
                    superintended by about two hundred whites, are employed in searching for the
                    precious mineral. The largest of the diamond works, called Mandango, is situated
                    on the river Jequitinhonha, which in this part is about nine feet deep, and
                    about as broad as the Thames at Windsor. .Mr Mawe has minutely described the
                    process by which the diamonds are obtained, the chief object of his visit being
                    to examine the mines. The part of the river which was then worked was a curve or
                    elbow from which the current had been diverted by means of a canal. The deeper
                    parts of the channel were laid dry by means of chain-pumps worked by a
                    waterwheel, and the <hi rend="italic">cascalho</hi> was then removed by means of
                    machinery. This stratum of debris consists of similar materials to that found in
                    the gold district. During the dry season sufficient cascalho is dug up to occupy
                    all the hands during the rainy months. This gravelly matter is washed in troughs
                    placed under sheds erected for the purpose. The negroes are formed into working
                    parties called troops, containing two hundred each, under the direction of an
                    administrator and inferior officers. Besides the precious stone, which is
                    principally sought, gold is found in the debris. Diamonds are by no means
                    peculiar to the beds of rivers or deep ravines; they have been found in cavities
                    and water-courses, even on the summits of the loftiest mountains. They of course
                    vary exceedingly in size. Some are so small that four or five are required to
                    weigh one grain, consequentlysixteenor twenty to the carat. There are seldom
                    found more than two or three diamonds of from seventeen to twenty carats in the
                    course of a year; and not once in two years is there found throughout the whole
                    washings a stone of thirty carats. There are other diamond works in this comarca
                    besides Mandango, particularly those of Monteiro, and those situated on the Rio
                    Pardo. Thirty-five leagues from Tejuco, in a north-easterly<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193820652" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0652-0111"/> direction, is Tocaya, the
                    principal place in the district of Minas Novas. The road to it runs nearly
                    parallel with the Jequitinhonha, in the numerous rivulets flowing, into which
                    river are found white and blue topazes, aqua-marinas, and the chrysoberyl, a
                    stone held in high estimation in Brazil. Twenty-five miles north-north-east of
                    Villa do Principe is the town of Fanado or Bom Succeso, in the neighbourhood of
                    which diamonds of an inferior quality are found. There are several other
                    arraials in this comarca, amongst which may be mentioned Bara do Rio das Velhas,
                    a place of considerable commerce, and, but for its insalubrity, likely to become
                    one of the largest places in the province.</p>
                <p>The great river San Francisco is the boundary line between the comarca of Serro
                    do Frio and that of Paracatu. This almost Unknown district, prior to 1815, was
                    included in the comarca of Sahara. A new ouvidor was then appointed for the
                    township and circuit of Paracattf, the villages of Desemboque and Araxa being
                    subsequently detached from the comarca of Villa Boa in Goyaz, and annexed to the
                    new ouvidoria. Paracatu do Principe, the only town, owes its origin to its
                    mines, first discovered in 1744. These consist of gold and lead; but diamonds
                    have also been found in some places.</p>
                <p>The comarca of Sahara, which-formerly included all the western part of Minas
                    Geraes north of the comarca of Rio das Mortes, takes its name from its head
                    town, the Villa Real do Sahara. This town stands near the confluence of the
                    small river of the same name with the Das Velhas, about thirty-five miles
                    north-north-west of Marianna, and is surrounded with mountains. About twelve
                    miles from Sahara there is said to be a tepid lake, two miles in length by one
                    in breadth. It has acquired the name of the Holy Lake, from its waters having
                    been found to possess medicinal virtue in various diseases. Fifteen miles north
                    of Sahara is the flourishing parish of St Luzia, which contains a considerable
                    population, and is ornamented with five Roman Catholic temples. The only towns
                    in the comarca besides Sahara are Villa Nova da Raynha, better known by its
                    Indian name of Caethe, containing about 5000 inhabitants; it is twelve miles
                    east-south-east of Sahara, and has in its suburbs good potteries; and Pi-tangui,
                    situated on the right margin of Para, about eighty miles west-north-west of
                    Sahara. Its inhabitants, about 20,000 in number, breed horses, cattle, hogs, and
                    sheep, and cultivate cotton and the sugar-cane.</p>
                <p>The comarca of St Joao del Rey or Rio das Mortes occupies the southern extremity
                    of the province adjoining those of St Paulo and Rio. It is itself larger than
                    the whole kingdom of Portugal, and the land is for the most part rich and
                    fertile in a high degree. From March to November the climate is fine and dry,
                    the nights being sometimes sharp and frosty. Ice is occasionally formed, and
                    snow falls, but they disappear before the noon-day sun. About the middle of
                    November the rainy season is ushered in by violent thunder and lightning. Rain
                    comes invariably from the south, and in continued damp weather the air is
                    unpleasantly cold. The Villa St Joao del Rey, antecedently called Rio das
                    Mortes, is a handsome little town, surrounded by a bulwark of romantic hills and
                    broken rocks, with tracts entirely sterile, and others covered with the most
                    luxuriant verdure. Its situation is so agreeable and central, that an intention
                    was once formed of making it the capital. There are in St Joao about 6000
                    inhabitants, of whom only one third are white people, the rest being negroes and
                    mulattoes. For their employment and support there are no manufactures, except a
                    small one of hats of a peculiar kind. In the adjoining country a large quantity
                    of woollen cloth is made from native produce, and serves for ordinary clothing.
                    Yet the trade of St Joao del Rey must be considerable; for Dr Von Spix informs
                    us that four constantly employed caravans, each of fifty mules, annually go
                    backwards and forwards to the capital, conveying thither bacon, cheese, some
                    cottons, woollen hats, horned cattle, mules, and gold bars; and bringing back in
                    return European goods, chiefly Portuguese and English, such as calicoes,
                    handkerchiefs, lace, iron-ware, wine, porter, and liqueurs. The gold mine, to
                    which the town owes its origin and celebrity, and whence such masses of mineral
                    wealth have been extracted, is situated within the town. It is nothing more than
                    a deep pit, and is now little resorted to. St Joao del Rey is situated eighty
                    miles south-west of Villa Rica, about the same distance south-south-west of
                    Sahara, and upwards of two hundred miles north-west of Rio. The population of
                    Minas Geraes has been computed at between six and seven hundred thousand
                    inhabitants, of whom nearly a fourth are slaves. Indians are found only upon the
                    eastern confines of the province, or in the impenetrable forests of the Serra do
                    Alar.</p>
