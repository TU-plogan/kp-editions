                <p><label type="entry">MONSTER</label>, a birth or production of a living being,
                    degenerating from the proper and usual disposition of parts in the species to
                    which it belongs; as, when there are too many members, or too few, or some of
                    them are extravagantly out of proportion, either on the side of excess or
                    defect. The word comes from the Latin <hi rend="italic">monstrum,</hi> a
                    derivative of <hi rend="italic">monstrando,</hi> showing; and hence also the box
                    in which relics were anciently <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> kept to be shown
                    was called <hi rend="italic">monstrum.</hi> Dugdale mentions an inventory of the
                    church of York with this article, <hi rend="italic">Item</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >unum monstrum</hi><hi rend="italic">cum</hi><hi rend="italic">ossibus

                    Aristotle defines a monster to be a defect of nature, when, acting towards an
                    end, she cannot attain to it, from some of the principles being corrupted.</p>
                <p>Monsters do not propagate their kind, for which reason some rank <hi
                    rend="italic">mules</hi> amongst the number of monsters, as also <hi
                    rend="italic">hermaphrodites.</hi> Females which bring forth twins are found
                    most liable to produce monsters. The reason probably is, that although the twins
                    are covered with one common chorion, yet they have each their separate amnios,
                    which by their contiguity may chance to grow together, and so occasion a
                    confusion or blending of the parts.</p>
                <p>Various theories have been proposed by philosophers and physiologists to account
                    for the production of monsters. But after all, it must be confessed, that we are
                    very little acquainted with those deviations from the ordinary course of
                    nature.</p>
                <p>With respect to structure, monsters are of various kinds. Some have an excess or
                    defect in certain parts, such as those which are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >acephalous,</hi> or want the head; those which have two heads, two arms, two
                    legs, and one body, or which have two bodies and one head, or which have three
                    legs; and those which want the arms or the legs. Others err through an
                    extraordinary and deformed conformation, through an unnatural union of certain
                    parts or viscera, through a great derangement in one or more of their members,
                    and through the extraordinary place which these often occupy in consequence of
                    this derangement or transposition. The monster described by Dr Eller of the
                    Academy of Berlin was of this kind. It was a foetus of nine months, twenty-eight
                    inches long, with an enormous head and frightful countenance; and in the middle
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193824695" xml:id="kp-eb0715-4695-0422"/>of a broad and
                    vast forehead it had a reddish eye, without either eyebrows or eyelids, and sunk
                    deep into a square hole. Immediately below this eye was an excrescence which
                    strongly resembled a penis with a glans, a prepuce, and an urethra; the part
                    covered with hair was likewise below the nape of the neck. In other monsters we
                    meet with the unnatural union of some parts, which, from their destination and
                    functions, ought always to be separate; and the separation of other parts,
                    which, for the same reasons, ought constantly to be united. The reader may see
                    the different ways in which the formation of monsters takes place, in four
                    memoirs by Μ. Leméry, inserted in <hi rend="italic">E</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">des Sciences,</hi> 1738 and 1739.</p>
                <p>In the volume published by the Academy of Sciences in the year 1724, mention is
                    made by Μ. Geoffroy of a monster born in Barrois, 1722. This monstrous
                    production consisted of two children without the inferior extremities, and
                    joined together by a common navel. Each of them had a nurse, sucked, and eat
                    pap; and the one sucked whilst the other slept. The reader may likewise consult
                    the second part of Winslow’s Memoirs on Monsters, inserted in the volume
                    published by the Academy of Sciences in 1734, where he will find the history of
                    the two very extraordinary twin monsters, who exhibited during their lives a
                    great difference in their moral and physical qualities. We are obliged to refer
                    simply to these memoirs, as they are too long for abridgment.</p>
                <p>It is observed by Haller, that in some monsters the natural structure has been
                    changed by some shock or passion, whilst in others the structure, independently
                    of any accident, appears to have been originally monstrous; such as when all the
                    members are reversed from left to right, when the person has six fingers, and in
                    many other instances. Μ. de Maupertuis mentions that there was at Berlin a
                    family who for several generations had six fingers on each hand. Μ. de Riville
                    saw an instance of this at Malta, of which he has given a description. Μ. Renou,
                    surgeon at Pomitieraye, in Anjou, published an account of some families with six
                    fingers, who were to be found in several parishes of the Lower Anjou, and which
                    had existed there from time immemorial. This deformity was perpetuated in these
                    families even when they intermarried with persons who were free from it. Whether
                    the propagation of these supernumerary organs, which are not only useless, but
                    inconvenient and even disagreeable, be owing to the father or mother, the
                    children of both sexes are subject to it indiscriminately. A father and mother
                    with six fingers frequently have a part, and sometimes the whole of their
                    children, free from this deformity; but it again makes its appearance, and in a
                    very great degree, in the third generation. From this it appears that such a
                    fault in the conformation is hereditary. Μ. Reaumur likewise published the
                    history of a family in the island of Malta, the children of which were born with
                    six fingers and six toes. But it deserves to be inquired, whether these
                    supernumerary fingers were real fingers. (The reader may here consult the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal de Physique</hi> for November 1774, p. 372.) This variety
                    of <hi rend="italic">sexdigitary</hi> hands and feet is not comprehended in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur quelques</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Conformations</hi><hi rend="italic">Monstrueuses des Doigts dans l’Homme,</hi>
                    which is inserted in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for 1771. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal de Physique for</hi> August 1776, we find a description of
                    a double uterus and vagina observed in a woman who died in childbed, by Dr
                    Purcell of Dublin; and in that for June 1788, we have an account, by Baron
                    Dietrich, of a man with seven fingers on each hand.</p>
                <p>Monsters are more common and more extraordinary in the vegetable than in the
                    animal kingdom, because the different juices are more easily deranged and
                    confounded together. Leaves are often seen, from the internal parts of which
                    other leaves spring forth; and it is not uncommon to see flowers of the
                    ranunculus from the middle of which issues a stalk bearing another flower.
                    Bonnet informs us, that in certain warm and rainy years he has frequently met
                    with monsters of this kind in rose-trees. This observer saw a rose, from the
                    centre of which issued a square stalk of a whitish colour, tender and without
                    prickles, which at its top bore two flower-buds opposite to each other, and
                    totally destitute of a calyx; and a little above the buds issued a petal of a
                    very irregular shape. Upon the prickly staff which supported the rose, a leaf
                    was observed which had the shape of a trefoil, together with a broad flat
                    pedicle. In the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for 1707, mention is made of
                    a rose, from the centre of the leaves of which issued a rose branch two or three
                    inches long, and furnished with leaves. In the Memoirs for 1775, a singular
                    instance is mentioned of a monstrosity observed by Duhamel, in an apple-tree
                    ingrafted with clay. At the place of the insertion there appeared a bud which
                    produced a stalk and some leaves; the stalk and the pedicle of the leaves were
                    of a pulpy substance, and had the most perfect resemblance both in taste and
                    smell to the pulp of a green apple. An extraordinary <hi rend="italic"
                    >chamaemelum.</hi> is mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Acta Helvetica.</hi>
                    Bonnet, in his <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur</hi><hi rend="italic">l’
                    Usage</hi><hi rend="italic">des Feuilles,</hi> mentions likewise some monstrous
                    productions which have been found in fruits with kernels, analogous in their
                    nature to those which occur in the flowers of the ranunculus and of the
                    rose-tree. He observed a pear, from the eye of which issued a tuft of thirteen
                    or fourteen leaves, very well shaped, and many of them of the natural size. He
                    noticed a second pear which gave rise to a ligneous and knotty stalk, on which
                    grew another pear somewhat larger than the first. The stalk had probably
                    flourished, and the fruit had formed. Reynier has mentioned some individuals
                    monstrous with respect to the flower, in the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Physique et</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire Naturelle</hi> for November 1785.</p>
                <p>These vegetable productions, which are so extraordinary, and so contrary to the
                    common course of things, do nevertheless present deviations subject to
                    particular laws, and reducible to certain principles, by distinguishing such as
                    are perpetuated either by seed or by transplanting, from those which seem to be
                    only accidental. Monstrosities which are perpetuated exist in the original
                    organization of the seed of the plant, such as marked or curled leaves, &amp;c.
                    The word <hi rend="italic">monster</hi> is more properly applied to those
                    irregularities in plants which arise from frequent transplantation, and from a
                    particular culture, such as double flowers; but those monstrosities which are
                    not perpetuated, and which arise from accidental and transient causes deranging
                    the primitive organization of the plant when it comes to be unfolded, being the
                    effect of diseases, of heat or cold, of a superfluity or scarcity of juices, of
                    a depravation of the vessels contributing to nutrition, of the sting of insects,
                    and of contusions and natural grafts, retain also the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >monsters. Of</hi> this kind are knobs or swellings, stunting, gall-nuts,
                    certain streaks, and other similar defects.</p>
