                    consummate British general, a fearless soldier, and an accomplished gentleman,
                    was born at Glasgow, on the 13th of November 1761. He was a son of Dr Moore, the
                    author of Zeluco and other works just mentioned, and received the principal part
                    of his education on the Continent, whilst his father attended the Duke of
                    Hamilton in his travels. Of his early years the meagre biography of his brother
                    has supplied us with few particulars, excepting that he was “really a pretty
                    youth,” and, in the true spirit of his country, quarrelled with French boys of
                    his own age. In 1776, the Duke of Hamilton procured him an ensigncy in the 51st
                    regiment, then quartered in Minorca; and he afterwards obtained a lieutenancy in
                    the 82d, with which he served in America until 1783, when he was reduced with
                    his regiment. By the interest of the Duke of Hamilton, he was subsequently
                    brought into parliament for the Lanark district of burghs, which he for a short
                    time represented. In 1787 or 1788, he obtained the rank of major in the fourth
                    battalion of the 60th regiment, then quartered at Chatham, but afterwards
                    negociated an exchange into the 51st. In 1790, he succeeded by purchase to the
                    lieutenant-colonelcy of the same regiment, which, the following year, he
                    accompanied to Gibraltar. After some other movements, he was sent to Corsica,
                    where, owing to a misunderstanding between the military and naval commanders,
                    General d’Aubant resigned the command to him under the most critical
                    circumstances; and here, though still a young officer, and without parliamentary
                    friends, he was called to fight the battles of the army against a domineering
                    old admiral, Hood, who possessed great influence at home, and who had shown
                    himself capable of the most outrageous violence, not unaccompanied with
                    subtlety. By dint of firmness, however, he succeeded in controlling this daring,
                    obstinate, clever, headstrong man; and was at length relieved from the difficult
                    and embarrassing situation in which he had been placed, by the arrival of Sir
                    Charles Stuart, who having assumed the command of the army in 1794, appointed
                    Moore to command the reserve. At the siege of Calvi, which followed, the latter
                    particularly distinguished himself, and received his first wound in storming the
                    Mozzello fort. He gave his opinion against besieging Bastia, which afterwards
                    surrendered after a very feeble defence, though the place was strong and the
                    garrison numerous; but this, as a military judgment before the event, was
                    nevertheless sound and just, for Moore never could have anticipated that General
                    Gentili would neglect to avail himself of the means in his power, “because he
                    wished to do his duty and no more,” and had property in England.</p>
                <p>Sir Charles Stuart having been recalled, in consequence of a disagreement with
                    the viceroy, Colonel Moore returned to England in 1795, and being immediately
                    appointed a brigadier-general in the W <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> est
                    Indies, he was attached to a brigade of foreign troops, consisting of ChoiseuΓs
                    hussars, and two corps of emigrants. On the 25th of February 1796, he received
                    orders to take charge of and embark with Perryn’s brigade, destined to join the
                    expedition to the West Indies under Sir Ralph Abercromby; and having hurried to
                    Portsmouth, where he had scarcely time to prepare a few necessaries, he sailed
                    for the West Indies at daylight on the 28th, with no other baggage than a small
                    portmanteau. He arrived at Barbadoes on the 13th of April 1796, and there waited
                    on the commander-in-chief, who had preceded him in the Vengeance line-of-battle
                    ship. That calm and sagacious observer soon appreciated his merit, and in the
                    operations against St Lucia, which immediately followed, employed him in every
                    arduous and difficult service. During the siege of Morne Fortunée, his conduct,
                    as expressed in general orders, was the admiration of the whole army; and, after
                    the capitulation, he was appointed to the government of the island,
                    notwithstanding he had earnestly requested permission to accompany the
                    commander-in-chief <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825072"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-5072-0451"/>and the troops in the reduction of the other
                    islands. In this situation, beset with all manner of difficulties, his conduct
                    was not less admirable than in the field, and, temperingjustice with humanity,
                    the severity of military examples with a due consideration of the circumstances
                    which palliated the conduct of the negroes and republicans, he subdued
                    discontent, restored order, and re-established security. He abhorred the cruelty
                    of punishment, and deplored the necessity of it; but whilst he inflicted it
                    reluctantly, he did ample justice to the heroic qualities of the misguided
                    people, whom oppression had rendered desperate. He warred against them, and
                    punished their crimes, but he admired their courage, and he despised,
                    reproached, and restrained the whites, whose tyranny had first sown in the
                    hearts of the unfortunate negroes the seeds of that ferocity which it was his
                    painful duty to repress. From certain published extracts of ajournai kept by
                    him, it appears that he had the very worst opinion of the emigrants and
                    proprietors of slaves, whom he speaks of with contempt and indignation; that he
                    deplored the condition of the blacks, and threatened the emigrants with
                    punishment for casting reflections on the submissive republicans; that he
                    checked them for their ill treatment of the negroes, and repeatedly assured the
                    people that royalist or republican would be neither a merit nor a demerit with
                    him; and that he suspected the slave proprietors of wishing for detachments of
                    troops to enable them to tyrannize over the negroes, a system he abhorred and
                    never would sanction. “Why,” he exclaimed, “is a man to be treated harshly
                    because he is not white? All men are entitled to justice; and from me they shall
                    have it, whether they be white, black, royalist, or republican.” This noble
                    language was not agreeable to the emigrants; but he had no preference for them,
                    and wished to curb their insolence, because, instead of profiting by their
                    misfortunes, they had only whetted their prejudices, and thirsted to gratify
                    their revenge, by oppressing their fellow-creatures. Nor was he at all surprised
                    that so many of the blacks should have hailed the opportunity of gaining their
                    freedom. With the observant and humane spirit which so peculiarly distinguished
                    him, he remarked, “that the West Indies was the only country in the world where
                    industry and cultivation added nothing to the happiness of the people; because
                    all was for the benefit of the few who were white, and nothing went to the
                    comfort of the many who were black.”</p>
                <p>Having reduced the numerous bands of armed negroes who had taken to the woods,
                    and completely re-establish-ed tranquillity in St Lucia, Moore was relieved from
                    the command of the island, and returned to England in August 1797. In November,
                    Sir Ralph Abercromby having received the command of the forces in Ireland,
                    desired that General Moore should be placed on his staff, and the latter
                    accordingly accompanied him to Dublin in the beginning of December. During the
                    period immediately preceding the rebellion, he held an important command in the
                    south of Ireland, which, being much disaffected, was considered as the quarter
                    where the enemy were, in the event of an invasion, likely to attempt a landing.
                    FIis head-quarters were at Bandon, and the troops under his command, amounting
                    to 3000 men, formed the advanced guard of the south. When the insurrection broke
                    out in 1798, he was at first employed under Major-General Johnstone at New Ross,
                    but was afterwards detached towards Wexford, at that time in the hands of the
                    insurgents. On this occasion he had only the 60th sharpshooters, 500 light
                    infantry, fifty of Hompesch’s dragoons, and six pieces of artillery; and with
                    these troops he had not proceeded above a mile when a large body of insurgents
                    appeared on the road, advancing to attack him. The rebels, amounting to about
                    6000 men, headed by one Roche, attacked with great spirit, and maintained the
                    conflict with much obstinacy, but were at length defeated, driven from the
                    field, and pursued with great loss. After the action he was joined by two
                    regiments from Duncannon, and took post for the night upon the ground where the
                    combat had commenced. Next day, when he had resumed his march, he was met by two
                    men from Wexford, with proposals on the part of the insurgents to lay down their
                    arms and submit on certain conditions; but General Moore, having no power to
                    treat, declined entertaining these proposals, and continued his march to
                    Wexford, which he delivered from the power of the insurgents. He was afterwards
                    employed to suppress a remnant of the rebellion in Wicklow, where many of the
                    insurgents had taken refuge amongst the mountains and bogs, whence they issued
                    to wage a sort of desultory warfare. Speaking of this affair in his journal, he
                    says that “moderate treatment by the generals, and the preventing of the troops
                    from pillaging and molesting the people, would soon restore tranquillity; that
                    the latter would certainly be quiet if the gentlemen and yeomen would only
                    behave with tolerable decency, and not seek to gratify their ill humour and
                    revenge upon the poor ;” and he adds, “that he judged their harshness and
                    violence had originally driven the farmers and peasants to revolt, and that they
                    were as ready as ever to renew their former ill usage of them.”</p>
                <p>These and other similar observations on the insurrection of 1798, extracted and
                    published from General Moore’s journal, do equal honour to his head and heart,
                    evincing the discriminating and unimpassioned sagacity of the statesman, united
                    with that high and liberal feeling which forms the greatest ornament in the
                    character of the accomplished soldier. “In this country,” says he, “they quell
                    disturbances by proclaiming districts, and letting the soldiers loose upon the
                    people, and the military are encouraged to violence against all who are called
                    disaffected.” Again, “the giving away of militia regiments was managed so as to
                    serve parliamentary purposes, and they were officered in the same view. Thus the
                    most profligate of men are empowered to work any evil that their cupidity or
                    revengeful passions prompt them to; and so complete are the ramifications of
                    corruption, and so complicated the abuses, that the appointment of a dictator
                    seems to be the only cure.” When the chancellor Fitzgibbon asserted in a speech
                    he delivered at the time, “that conciliation had already been tried with the
                    Catholics, but that it had only created discontent, and that each new concession
                    produced new demands,” General Moore remarked, that “nothing could be more
                    natural in the people, nothing more unreasonable than the chancellor’s
                    complaint; that the Catholics had a right to be put on the same footing with
                    their fellow-subjects; that they were pleased with each approach to that
                    equality, but unsatisfied till they obtained all; that the government was
                    impolitic and unjust to favour one part to the oppression of nineteen; and that
                    all to whom equal rights were denied were oppressed.” He further expressed his
                    indignation at the treatment of the poor people, and his disapproval of the
                    system of government, which he describes as “having no other object than that of
                    terrifying the poor, ready always to grant any power to act against them, but
                    indulging the rest of the community in every sort of abuse and violence.” With a
                    government acting in this spirit, with an army “formidable to every body but the
                    enemy,” and with an exasperated faction in the heart of the country to take
                    advantage of the one, and encourage the utmost license of the other, the wonder
                    is not that the oppressed people, when arms were in their hands, should have
                    committed some excesses, but that they did not rise in mass, and by one great
                    simultaneous effort bury their oppressors under the ruins of their own tyranny.
                    The enlightened views, the calm discernment, and the just and humane sentiments
                    of Moore, are honourable to his memory, and worthy of the chief under whom he
                    served, but stand <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825085"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-5085-0452"/>in striking contrast to the short-sighted policy,
                    the ferocious prejudices, the blind bigotry, and the inhuman violence, of those
                    by whom he was surrounded, in all departments of the public service.</p>
                <p>Immediately after quitting Ireland, General Moore engaged in the memorable
                    expedition to Holland. The result of this enterprise is well known. The Dutch,
                    whom we sought to rescue from the alleged tyranny of the French government, made
                    common cause with the enemy; they received the French as friends and deliverers,
                    because the house of Orange, aided by Prussia, had destroyed their republic,
                    suppressing their constitution and liberties; and hence, after a short struggle,
                    the Duke of York was obliged to capitulate. But the troops displayed their usual
                    gallantry, particularly those under the command of General Moore, who, after
                    being wounded in the hand and thigh, received a musket ball in the face, and was
                    with difficulty brought from the ground. Being carried back to his quarters, a
                    distance of ten miles, he was taken thence to the Helder, as soon as he could be
                    moved, and embarked on board the Amethyst frigate, which arrived at the Nore on
                    the 24th of August. Soon after his return to England, the king conferred on him
                    the command of a second battalion which had just been added to the 52d regiment;
                    and his wounds having closed in the course of five or six weeks, he joined his
                    brigade at Chelmsford on the 24th of December.</p>
                <p>Early in 1800, it had been resolved to send a body of troops to the Mediterranean
                    under the command of Sir Charles Stuart; and General Moore willingly consented
                    to serve under that officer, whom he greatly esteemed. The first intention was,
                    that the expedition should consist of 15,000 men; but it afterwards turned out
                    that the regiments destined for the service, part of which had lately been
                    employed in Holland, mustered only 10,000 effective. About the middle of March,
                    the first division, amounting to 5000 men, embarked under General Pigott. But at
                    this time a change took place in the plan, if not in the destination, of the
                    expedition. Sir Charles Stuart, having some misunderstanding with ministers,
                    resigned his command; and Sir Ralph Abercromby being appointed to succeed him,
                    named, as one of his major-generals, Moore, who, along with Pigott and
                    Hutchinson, sailed about the end of April with the second division of the
                    troops. During this expedition, which a variety of causes conspired to render
                    abortive, General Moore had little opportunity of signalizing his exertions; nor
                    was it until the following year, when his troops were ordered to proceed to
                    Egypt under Sir Ralph Abercromby, that a theatre of action opened for the
                    display of his talents. On his arrival at Malta, he was sent forward to Jaffa to
                    inspect the Turkish army, and judge as to the amount of co-operation which might
                    be expected from it; but his report being unfavourable, Sir Ralph determined to
                    land in the bay of Aboukir, and to march immediately upon Alexandria. This was
                    what is familiarly called taking the bull by the horns. In regard to the
                    operations which followed, it is inconsistent with the object of this article to
                    enter into any details respecting them. It is sufficient to mention, that, in
                    the affair of the landing on the 8th of March 1801, in the combat of the 13th,
                    and again in the battle of the 21st, where he received a wound in the leg,
                    General Moore was actively engaged, and, as usual, greatly distinguished
                    himself. On recovering from his wound, which occasioned him much suffering, he
                    continued to serve with the army in Egypt until after the surrender of
                    Alexandria, when he returned to England, where he received the honour of
                    knighthood and the order of the Bath.</p>
                <p>It appears from the portion of his journal which has been published, that it
                    contains invaluable materials for a history of the campaign in Egypt. The
                    account of the battle of Alexandria, which his brother, Mr James Moore, has had
                    the grace to insert in his book, is in every respect admirable. It is also
                    satisfactory to find him censuring that act of mingled vandalism and cruelty
                    perpetrated by General Hutchinson; we mean the cutting of the dike which
                    excluded the sea from Lake Mareotis, by which the lands of the poor Copts were
                    swallowed up to the extent of about forty miles, without any adequate or
                    compensating military advantage. We should have been still more gratified if his
                    brother had given the fragment which he is stated to have written in defence of
                    Sir Ralph Abercromby’s military conduct, which Sir John ably vindicates, in
                    answer to the impudent observations of General Regnier. There seems to be no
                    good reason why this interesting composition should have been withheld, unless,
                    indeed, something of the kind may be detected in the declaration which it
                    contains, that “English expeditions were seldom successful, and always difficult
                    to conduct, because they were conducted by ministers who were ignorant of
                    military affairs, and too arrogant and self-sufficient to consult military
                    men.”</p>
                <p>Soon after his return to England, we find Sir John Moore actively occupied in the
                    camp at Shorn-Cliff, where his ⅛kill in training troops was proved to be equal
                    to his daring in leading them. Many persons have been led to suppose that he was
                    a harsh and odious disciplinarian; but this calumny has been refuted by the most
                    irrefragable proof. “The officers of the regiments which were formed by his
                    care,” says an able writer in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi>
                    supposed to be Colonel Napier, “were ever after his warmest admirers; his
                    discipline it has been their object to maintain; his maxims have been their
                    guide; his reputation has been by them considered as a part of their own; his
                    memory is cherished in their hearts to this day, and will be as long as those
                    hearts retain an atom of a soldier’s pride and honour.” Such is the testimony of
                    one who knew him thoroughly; and who, besides his pre-eminent qualifications for
                    judging rightly, had the best opportunities of understanding his views and
                    appreciating his real character.</p>
                <p>On the renewal of the war, after the short peace of Amiens, Sir John Moore’s
                    talents and services pointed him out as deserving of some important employment.
                    He was accordingly sent to Sicily, as second in command to Sir John Stuart; and,
                    when that officer had been superseded by General Fox, he virtually acquired the
                    chief command in that island. His superior in command was too infirm to lead an
                    army in the field, but by no means so debilitated as to be unable to conduct the
                    affairs of Sicily. If his talents were not of a high order, they were at least
                    respectable; and he had the merit of not being above taking the advice of wiser
                    men. He generally agreed with, and always yielded to, Sir John Moore’s opinion;
                    and hence the English interests were better supported during his command than
                    they had ever been before. Associated with such a nominal superior, Moore had
                    full scope for the exercise of his ability and sagacity, and, indeed, his whole
                    proceedings showed that his sense and judgment in civil matters were in no
                    degree inferior to his talents in war. But his brother’s account of these
                    transactions is little more than a garbled and impotent abstract, divested of
                    every thing interesting or instructive. We look in vain for Moore’s graphic
                    account of the Queen of Naples, and the final character which he draws of her,
                    confirmed as it has since been by the testimony of Micichiin his Memoirs. We
                    want more information respecting his disputes with Mr Drummond, and also some
                    notice of the vagaries of Sir Sidney Smith. We desire to learn his sentiments
                    upon the state of Sicily, as to the character and wishes of the people of that
                    island; and nothing could have been more instructive than an exposition of his
                    views respecting a descent upon Italy, which he was pressed to invade, but
                    refused until he could offer the Italians something better <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193825098" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5098-0453"/>to fight for than the
                    oppressions and abuses of the Sicilian court. His military criticism upon
                    General Fraser’s expedition to Egypt, in the year 1807, might also have found a
                    place in the life of a general, especially one written by a brother; but this,
                    and much more, which would have thrown light on the events of that time, as well
                    as reflected credit on his character and memory, has been most unaccountably
                    withheld.</p>
                <p>When Sir John Moore arrived in England from Sicily, he was immediately sent with
                    an expedition to Gottenburg, although for what purpose, except .to get him out
                    of the way, whilst troops were sent to Portugal under Sir Arthur Wellesley, it
                    is difficult to conjecture. But however this may be, if the troops had been
                    committed to the charge of a man less able, prompt, and resolute, 10,000 of the
                    finest soldiers of England would have been sacrificed. “The contradictory
                    instructions given by the ministers,” says the able writer already referred to,
                    “and the silence observed by them when Moore represented the real state of
                    affairs, were proofs of their bad intentions, and bad faith, as well as
                    absurdity; and if any doubt could be entertained upon this head, the orders
                    which reached Sir James Saumarez, three days after Moore’s departure from
                    Gottenburg (orders prescribing the employment of the army to bring off the
                    Spaniards under Romana from Holstein), would have set that doubt aside.” This
                    is, no doubt, a strong opinion; but when it is considered, that if the king of
                    Sweden had been only one degree less insane than he actually was, the English
                    ministers would, at the same time, have commenced regular military operations by
                    land against Russia in one extremity of Europe, and Napoleon in the other, it is
                    difficult to account for their conduct upon any principle of sense or rational
                    policy. On his return to England, Sir John Moore was received with something
                    more than coldness by the ministers, who gave him no credit whatever for saving
                    the troops, and seem to have been offended because their designs, whatever these
                    were, had been baffled by his energy and decision.</p>
                <p>We come now to the expedition to Spain, which terminated Sir John Moore’s earthly
                    career. In 1808, he was appointed to the chief command of an army to be employed
                    in Spain; and Gallicia, or the borders of Leon, were fixed upon as the place for
                    assembling the troops. He was ordered to send the cavalry by land, but it was
                    left to his own discretion to transport the infantry and artillery either by sea
                    or land; and being at the same time informed that 15,000 men were ordered to
                    Coruña under General Sir David Baird, he was directed to give such instructions
                    to that officer as should facilitate the junction of the whole force. Before he
                    commenced his advance from Portugal, he was assured that his entry into Spain
                    would be covered by from 60,000 or 70,000 men; and Burgos was the place fixed on
                    for the junction of the different divisions. But he soon discovered that these
                    assurances were fallacious, that little or no reliance could be placed upon the
                    Spaniards, and that the patriotic enthusiasm which he had been taught to expect
                    in the people had either never existed at all, or had entirely evaporated. Not
                    only Burgos, but Valladolid, was in possession of the enemy; and he found
                    himself with an advanced corps, in an open town, at the distance of only three
                    marches from the French army, without even a Spanish piquet to cover his front.
                    At this time, he had only three brigades of infantry, without a single gun in
                    Salamanca; and although the remainder were coming up in succession, the whole
                    could not be assembled in less than ten days. At this critical moment, the
                    Spanish armies, instead of concentrating or uniting in a common effort with the
                    British, were disseminated all over the peninsula; Blake had been defeated, and
                    his army totally dispersed; Romana, equally weak and obstinate, proved incapable
                    of undertaking any thing; and Sir David Baird, informed that the</p>
                <p>French were advancing upon him in two directions, was preparing to retreat upon
                    Coruña, a movement which was countermanded by Sir John Moore, upon learning that
                    the report was unfounded. For an account of what followed, we must refer to the
                    first volume of Colonel Napier’s History of the Peninsular War. Never was a
                    general commanding an army placed in a more critical position than Sir John
                    Moore; for, whilst he received information that there was now no army remaining
                    in the field except his own, which was thus exposed to be attacked upon all
                    sides by overwhelming numbers, he was called upon to repel the most irritating
                    interference, to guard against open treachery, and to counteract folly, equal in
                    its effects to treachery. Yet, even in these circumstances, he was willing to
                    attempt something for the cause, and even to risk the danger of an advance on
                    the capital. With this view he commenced a forward movement from Salamanca on
                    the 12th of December, intending to attack Soult on the Carrion, draw the mass of
                    the French force towards the north of Spain, and thus afford the Spanish armies
                    time to rally and adopt some new plan of operations. This movement, in a
                    strategical point of view, was ably conceived and well timed, hardy, and
                    successful; but Sir John Moore, with 23,000 men, could not maintain himself
                    against the whole French army; and as Napoleon, having secured the capital, was
                    now rapidly advancing at the head of from 60,000 to 70,000 men, a retreat became
                    inevitable. In what manner this retreat was conducted, and how gloriously it
                    terminated, we shall leave Colonel Napier to describe.</p>
                <p>“Lord Bacon observes, that ‘ honourable retreats are noways inferior to brave
                    charges, as having less of fortune, more of discipline, and as much of valour.’
                    That is an honourable retreat in which the retiring general loses no trophies in
                    fight, sustains every charge without being broken, and finally, after a severe
                    action, re-embarks his army in the face of a superior enemy without being
                    seriously molested. It would be honourable to effect this before a foe only
                    formidable from numbers, but it is infinitely more creditable, when the
                    commander, while struggling with bad weather and worse fortune, has to oppose
                    veterans with inexperienced troops, and to contend against an antagonist of
                    eminent ability, who scarcely suffers a single advantage to escape him during
                    his long and vigorous pursuit. All this Sir John Moore did, and finished his
                    work by a death as firm and glorious as any that antiquity can boast of.</p>
                <p>“Put to Lord Bacon’s test, in what shall the retreat to Coruña be found
                    deficient? Something in discipline, perhaps, but that fault does not attach to
                    the general. Those commanders who have been celebrated for making fine retreats
                    were in most instances well acquainted with their armies; and Hannibal, speaking
                    of the elder Scipio, derided him, although a brave and skilful man, for that,
                    being unknown to his own soldiers, he should presume to oppose himself to a
                    general who could call to each man under his command by name: thus inculcating,
                    that, unless troops be trained in the peculiar method of a commander, the latter
                    can scarcely achieve any thing great. Now Sir John Moore had a young army
                    suddenly placed under his guidance; and it was scarcely united when the superior
                    numbers of the enemy forced it to a retrograde movement under very harassing
                    circumstances: he had not time, therefore, to establish a system of discipline;
                    and it is in the leading events, not the minor details, that the just criterion
                    of his merits is to be sought for.</p>
                <p>“Was the retreat uncalled for? Was it unnecessarily precipitate? Was any
                    opportunity of crippling the enemy lost? Was any weakness to be discovered in
                    the personal character of the general? These are the questions that sensible men
                    will ask: the first has been already examined; the second is a matter of simple
                    calculation. The rear guard quitted Astorga on the 1st of January; on the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193825111" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5111-0454"/> 3d it repulsed
                    the enemy in a sharp skirmish at Calcabe-los; the 6th it rejoined the main body
                    at Lugo, having three times checked the pursuers during the march. It was
                    unbroken, and lost no gun, suffered no misfortune; the whole army offered battle
                    at Lugo for two successive days; it was not accepted; and the retreat
                    recommencing, the troops reached Betanzos on the morning of the 10th, and Coruña
                    on the 11th: thus, in eleven days, three of which were days of rest, a small
                    army passed over a hundred and fifty miles of good road. Now Napoleon, with
                    fifty thousand men, left Madrid on the 22d of December, the 28th he was at
                    Villapando, having performed a march, on bad roads, of a hundred and sixty-four
                    miles in seven days. The retreat to Coruña was consequently not precipitate,
                    unless it can be shown that it was unnecessary to retreat at all beyond Villa
                    Franca; neither can it be asserted that any opportunity of crippling the enemy
                    was lost. To fight a battle was the game of the French marshal; and if any
                    censure will apply to his able campaign, it is that he delayed to attack at
                    Lugo; victorious or beaten, the embarrassments of his adversary must have been
                    increased; Sir John Moore must have continued his retreat encumbered with the
                    wounded, or the latter must have been abandoned without succour in the midst of
                    winter.</p>
                <p>“At Coruña the absence of the fleet necessarily brought on a battle. That it was
                    honourable to the British troops is clear from the fact that they embarked
                    without loss after the action; and that it was absolutely necessary to embark
                    notwithstanding the success, is as certain a proof how little advantage could
                    have been derived from any battle fought farther inland, and how prudently Sir
                    John Moore acted in declining an action the moment he had rallied his army at
                    Lugo, and restored that discipline which the previous movements had shaken; but,
                    notwithstanding the clamour with which this campaign has been assailed, as if no
                    army had ever yet suffered such misfortunes, it is certain that the nominal loss
                    was small, the real loss smaller, and that it sinks into nothing when compared
                    with the advantages gained. An army which, after marching in advance or retreat
                    above five hundred miles before an enemy of immensely superior force, has only
                    lost, including those killed in battle, four thousand men, or a sixth part of
                    its numbers, cannot be said to have suffered severely; nor would the loss have
                    been so great, but for the intervention of the accidental occurrences mentioned
                    in the narrative. Night marches are seldom happy; that from Lugo to Betanzos
                    cost the army in stragglers more than double the number of men lost in all the
                    preceding operations; nevertheless, the reserve in that, as in all the other
                    movements, suffered little; and it is a fact, that the light brigades detached
                    by the Vigo road, which were not pursued, made no forced marches, slept under
                    cover, and were well supplied, left, in proportion to their strength, as many
                    men behind as any other part of the army; thus accumulating proof upon proof
                    that inexperience was the primary and principal cause of the disorders which
                    attended the retreat. Those disorders were sufficiently great; but many
                    circumstances contributed to produce an appearance of suffering and
                    disorganization which was not real. The intention of Sir John Moore was to have
                    proceeded to Vigo, in order to restore order before he sailed for England;
                    instead of which, the fleet steered home directly from Coruña; a terrible storm
                    scattered it; many ships were wrecked, and the remainder, driving up the
                    channel, were glad to put into any port. The soldiers, thus thrown on shore,
                    were spread from the Land’s End to Dover. Their haggard appearance, ragged
                    clothing, and dirty accoutrements, things common enough in war, struck a people
                    only used to the daintiness of parade, with surprise; the usual exaggerations of
                    men just escaped from perils and distresses were increased by the uncertainty in
                    which all were as to the fate of their comrades; a deadly fever, the result of
                    anxiety, and of the sudden change from fatigue to the confinement of a ship,
                    filled the hospitals at every port with officers and soldiers; and thus the
                    miserable state of Sir John Moore’s army became the topic of every letter, and a
                    theme for every country newspaper along the coast. The nation, at that time
                    unused to great operations, forgot that war is not a harmless game, and, judging
                    of the loss positively, instead of comparatively, was thus disposed to believe
                    the calumnies of interested men, who were eager to cast a shade over one of the
                    brightest characters that ever adorned the country. Those calumnies triumphed
                    for a moment; but Moore’s last appeal to his country for justice will be
                    successful. Posterity, revering and cherishing his name, will visit such of his
                    odious calumniators as are not too contemptible to be remembered, with a just
                    and severe retribution; for thus it is that time freshens the beauty of virtue
                    and withers the efforts of baseness; and if authority be sought for in a case
                    where reason speaks so plainly, future historians will not fail to remark, that
                    the man whose talents exacted the praises of Soult, of Wellington, and of
                    Napoleon, could be no ordinary soldier.</p>
                <p>“ ‘ Sir John Moore,’ says the first, ‘ took every advantage that the country
                    afforded to oppose an active and vigorous resistance, and he finished by dying
                    in a combat that must do credit to his memory.’</p>
                <p>“Napoleon more than once affirmed, that if he committed a few trifling errors,
                    they were to be attributed to his peculiar situation, for that his talents and
                    firmness alone had saved the English army from destruction.</p>
                <p>“‘In Sir John Moore’s campaign,’ said the Duke of Wellington, ‘ I can see but one
                    error; when he advanced to Sahagun he should have considered it as a movement of
                    retreat, and sent officers to the rear to mark and prepare the halting-places
                    for every brigade; but this opinion I have formed after long experience of war,
                    and especially of the peculiarities of a Spanish war, which must have been seen
                    to be understood; finally, it is an opinion formed after the event.’"<note

                <p>The fall of Sir John Moore is thus described by Captain, now Sir Henry, Hardinge:
                    “I had been ordered by the commander-in-chief to desire a battalion of the
                    guards to advance; which battalion was at one time intended to have dislodged a
                    corps of the enemy from a house and garden on the opposite side of the valley;
                    and I was pointing out to the general the situation of the battalion, and our
                    horses were touching, at the moment that a cannon-shot from the enemy’s battery
                    carried away his left shoulder, and part of the collar-bone, leaving the arm
                    hanging by the flesh. The violence of the stroke threw him off his horse on his
                    back. Not a muscle of his face altered, nor did a sigh betray the least
                    sensation of pain. I dismounted, and, taking his hand, he pressed mine forcibly,
                    casting his eyes anxiously towards the 42d regiment, which was hotly engaged;
                    and his countenance expressed satisfaction when I informed him that the regiment
                    was advancing. Assisted by a soldier of the 42d, he was removed a few yards
                    behind the shelter of a wall. Colonel Graham of Balgowan (Lord Lyndoch) and
                    Captain (now Sir John) Woodford, about this time came up, and, perceiving the
                    state of Sir John’s wound, instantly rode off for a surgeon. The blood flowed
                    fast, but the attempt to stop it with my sash was useless, from the size of the
                    wound. Sir John assented to being removed in a blanket to the rear. In raising
                    him for that purpose, his sword, hanging on the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193825124" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5124-0455"/>wounded side, touched his
                    arm, and became entangled between his legs. I perceived the inconvenience, and
                    was in the act of unbuckling it from his waist, when he said, in his usual tone
                    and manner, and in a very distinct voice, ‘ It is as well as it is; I had rather
                    it should go out of the field with me.’” When the surgeons arrived, he said to
                    them, “you can be of no service to me; go to the soldiers, to whom you may be
                    useful.” As he was carried slowly along in the blanket, he made the soldiers by
                    whom he was borne frequently turn him round to view the field of battle, and
                    listen to the firing, and he seemed pleased when the sound grew fainter. On
                    arriving at his lodgings, he suffered great pain, and could speak but little; at
                    length, however, he said to Colonel Anderson, who, for more than twenty years,
                    had been his friend and companion in arms, “Anderson, you know that I always
                    wished to die in this way.” He frequently asked, “Are the French beaten ?” and
                    when he was told that they had been defeated at every point, he said, “It is a
                    great satisfaction for me to know that we have beaten the French adding, “I hope
                    the people of England will be satisfied; I hope my country will do me justice.”
                    To Major Stanhope he said, “Stanhope, remember me to your sister ;” and having
                    mentioned the name of his venerable mother, for whom he seemed anxious to offer
                    up his last prayers, he lost all power of utterance, and in a few minutes
                    afterwards expired without a struggle.</p>
                <p>Thus fell, on the 16th of January 1809, in the forty-seventh year of his age,
                    after gaining a victory which saved the remainder of the army from destruction,
                    and which, in all’its circumstances, was perhaps unparalleled in the annals of
                    war, Lieutenant-general Sir John Moore, a perfect model of a British soldier at
                    a time when such models were few, and a hero cast in the true classical mould,
                    being equally a stranger to fear and reproach, yet one whom the rancorous
                    malignity of faction basely attempted to deprive of his just fame, whilst venal
                    pens were hired to depreciate his achievements, and servile poets vainly sought
                    to exclude his name from the list of the brave who had fought and fallen in the
                    same struggle. But his country was well disposed to acknowledge his merits, and
                    history has already placed his character and actions beyond the reach of ever
                    being affected by contemporary injustice. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
