                <p><label type="entry">MIRACLE</label>, in its original sense, is a word of the same
                    import with <hi rend="italic">woĭider;</hi> but in its usual and more
                    appropriate signification it denotes “an effect contrary to the established
                    constitution and course of things, or a sensible deviation from the known laws
                    of nature.”</p>
                <p>That the visible world is governed by stated general rules, or that there is an
                    order of causes and effects established in every part of the system of nature
                    which falls under our observation, is a fact which cannot be controverted. If
                    the Supreme Being, as some have supposed, be the only real agent in the
                    universe, we have the evidence of experience, that, in the particular system to
                    which we belong, he acts by stated rules. If he employs inferior agents to
                    conduct the various motions from which the phenomena result, we have the same
                    evidence that he· has subjected those agents to certain fixed laws, commonly
                    called the laws of nature. Upon either hypothesis, effects which are produced by
                    the regular operation of these laws, or which are conformable to the established
                    course of events, are properly called <hi rend="italic">natural</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and every contradiction to this constitution of the natural
                    system, and the corresponding course of events in it, is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">miracle.</hi></p>
                <p>If this definition of a miracle be just, no event can be deemed miraculous merely
                    because it is strange, or even to us unaccountable; since it may be nothing more
                    than a regular effect of some unknown law of nature. In th⅛ country earthquakes
                    are rare; and for monstrous births perhaps no particular and satisfactory
                    account can be given; yet an earthquake is as regular an effect of the
                    established laws of nature as any of those with which we are most intimately
                    acquainted; and, under circumstances in which there would always be the same
                    kind of production, tire monster is nature’s genuine issue. It is therefore
                    necessary, before we can pronounce any effect to be a true miracle, that the
                    circumstances under which it is produced be known, and that the common course of
                    nature be in some degree understood; for in all those cases in which we are
                    totally ignorant of nature, it is impossible to determine what is, or what is
                    not, a deviation from its course. Miracles, therefore, are not, as some have
                    represented them, appeals to our ignorance. They suppose some antecedent
                    knowledge of the course of nature, without which a proper judgment cannot be
                    formed concerning them, though with it their reality may be so apparent as to
                    prevent all possibility of a dispute.</p>
                <p>Thus, were a physician to cure a blind man of a cataract by anointing his eyes
                    with a chemical preparation which we had never before seen, and to the nature
                    and effects of which we were absolute strangers, the cure would undoubtedly be
                    wonderful; but we could not pronounce it miraculous, because, for any thing
                    known to us, it might be the natural effect of the operation of the unguent upon
                    the eye. But were he to recover his patient merely by commanding him to see, or
                    by anointing his eyes with spittle, we should with the utmost confidence
                    pronounce the cure to be a miracle, because we know perfectly that neither the
                    human voice nor human spittle have, by the established constitution of things,
                    any such power over the diseases of the eye. No one is now ignorant, that
                    persons apparently dead are often restored to their families and friends by
                    being treated in the manner recommended by the Humane Society. To the vulgar,
                    and sometimes even to men of science, these effects appear very wonderful; but
                    as they are known to be produced by physical agency, they can never be
                    considered as miraculous deviations from the laws of nature. On the other hand,
                    no one could doubt of his having witnessed a real miracle who had seen a person
                    that had been four days dead come alive out of his grave at the call of another,
                    or who had even beheld a person exhibiting all the symptoms of death instantly
                    resuscitated merely by being desired to live. So easy is it, in all cases in
                    which the course of nature is understood, to determine whether any particular
                    event be really a miracle; whilst in circumstances where we know nothing of
                    nature and its course, even a true miracle, were it performed, could not be
                    admitted as such, nor carry any conviction to the mind of a philosopher.</p>
                <p>If miracles be effects contrary to the established constitution of things, we are
                    certain that they will never be performed on trivial occasions. The constitution
                    of things was established by the creator and governor of the universe, and is
                    undoubtedly the offspring of infinite wisdom pursuing a plan for the best of
                    purposes. From this plan no deviation can be made but by God himself, or by some
                    powerful being acting with his permission. The plans devised by wisdom are
                    steady in proportion to their perfection, and the plans of infinite wisdom must
                    be absolutely perfect. From this consideration some men have ventured to
                    conclude that no miracle was ever wrought, nor can rationally be expected; but
                    maturer reflection must soon satisfy us that all such conclusions are hasty.</p>
                <p>Man is unquestionably the principal creature in this world, and apparently the
                    only one in it who is capable of being made acquainted with the relation in
                    which he stands to his Creator. We cannot, therefore, doubt but that such of the
                    laws of nature as extend not their operation beyond the limits of this earth
                    were established chiefly, if not solely, for the good of mankind; and if, in any
                    particular circumstances, that good can be more effectually promoted by an
                    occasional deviation from those laws, such a deviation may reasonably be
                    expected. Were man, in the exercise of his mental and corporeal powers,
                    subjected to the laws of physical necessity, the circumstances supposed would
                    indeed never occur, and of course no miracle could be admitted. But such is not
                    the nature of man.</p>
                <p>Without repeating what has been said elsewhere (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Metaphysics,</hi> part iii. chap. 5) of necessity and liberty, we shall here
                    take it for granted that the relation between motives and actions is different
                    from that between cause and effect in physics; and that mankind have such a
                    command over themselves as that by their voluntary conduct they can make
                    themselves in a great degree either happy or miserable. We know likewise from
                    history, that, by some means or other, almost all mankind were once sunk in the
                    grossest ignorance of the most important truths; that they knew not the Being by
                    whom they were created and supported; that they paid divine adoration to stocks,
                    stones, and the vilest reptiles; and that they were slaves to the most impious,
                    cruel, and degrading superstitions.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823031" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3031-0294"/>
                <p>From this depraved state it was surely not unworthy of the common Father of all
                    to rescue his helpless creatures, to enlighten their understandings that they
                    might perceive what is right, and to present to them motives of sufficient force
                    to engage them in the practice of it. But the understandings of ignorant
                    barbarians cannot be enlightened by arguments, because of the force of such
                    arguments as regard moral science they are not qualified to judge. The
                    philosophers of Athens and Rome inculcated, indeed, many excellent moral
                    precepts, and they sometimes ventured to expose the absurdities of the reigning
                    superstition; but their lectures had no influence upon the multitude; and they
                    had themselves imbibed such erroneous notions respecting the attributes of the
                    Supreme Being, and the nature of the human soul, and converted these notions
                    into first principles, of which they would not permit an examination, that even
                    amongst them a thorough reformation was not to be expected from the powers of
                    reasoning. It is likewise to be observed, that there are many truths of the
                    utmost importance to mankind which unassisted reason could never have
                    discovered. Amongst these we may confidently reckon the immortality of the soul,
                    the terms upon which God will be reconciled to sinners, and the manner in which
                    that all-perfect Being may be acceptably worshipped; about all of which
                    philosophers were in such uncertainty, that, according to Plato, “whatever is
                    set right, and as it should be, in the present evil state of the world, can be
                    so only by the particular interposition of God.”</p>
                <p>An immediate revelation from heaven seemed, therefore, the only method by which
                    infinite wisdom and perfect goodness could reform a bewildered and vicious race.
                    But this revelation, at whatever time we suppose it given, must have been made
                    directly either to some chosen individuals commissioned to instruct others, or
                    to every man and woman for whose benefit it was ultimately intended. Were every
                    person instructed in the knowledge of his duty by immediate inspiration, and
                    were the motives to practise it brought home to his mind by God himself, human
                    nature would be wholly changed: Men would not be masters of their own actions;
                    they would not be moral agents, nor by consequence be capable either of reward
                    or of punishment. It remains, therefore, that if God has been graciously pleased
                    to enlighten and reform mankind, without destroying.that moral nature which is
                    essential to virtue, he can have done it only by revealing his truth to certain
                    chosen instruments, who were the immediate instructors of their contemporaries,
                    and through them have been the instructors of succeeding ages.</p>
                <p>Let us suppose this to have been actually the case, and consider how those
                    inspired teachers could communicate to others every truth which had been
                    revealed to themselves. They might easily, if it was part of their duty, deliver
                    a sublime system of natural and moral science, and establish it upon the common
                    basis of experiment and demonstration; but what foundation could they lay for
                    those truths which unassisted reason cannot discover, and which, when they are
                    revealed, appear to have no necessary relation to any thing previously known? To
                    a bare affirmation that they had been immediately received from God, no rational
                    being could be expected to assent. The teachers might be men of known veracity,
                    whose simple assertion would be admitted as sufficient evidence for any fact in
                    conformity with the laws of nature; but as every man has the evidence of his own
                    consciousness and experience that revelations from heaven are deviations from
                    these laws, an assertion so apparently extravagant would be rejected as false,
                    unless supported by some better proof than the mere affirmation of the teacher.
                    In this state of things, we cannot conceive any evidence sufficient to make such
                    doctrines be received as the truths of God, except the power of working miracles
                    committed to him who taught them. This would, indeed, be fully adequate to the
                    purpose. For if there were nothing in the doctrines themselves impious, immoral,
                    or contrary to the truths already known, the only thing which could render the
                    teacher’s assertion incredible, would be its implying such an intimate communion
                    with God as is contrary to the established course of things, by which men are
                    left to acquire all their knowledge by the exercise of their own faculties. Let
                    us now suppose one of those inspired teachers to tell his countrymen that he did
                    not desire them, upon his <hi rend="italic">ipse dixit,</hi> to believe that he
                    had any preternatural communion with the Deity, but that for the truth of his
                    assertion he would give them the evidence of their own senses; and after this
                    declaration, let us suppose him immediately to raise a person from the dead in
                    their presence, merely by calling upon him to come forth out of his grave. Would
                    not the only possible objection to the man’s veracity be removed by this
                    miracle? and would not his assertions that he had received such and such
                    doctrines from God be as fully credited as if it had related to the most common
                    occurrence? Undoubtedly it would; for when so much preternatural power was
                    visibly communicated to this person, no one could possibly have reason to
                    question his having received an equal portion of preternatural knowledge. A
                    palpable deviation from the known laws of nature in one instance, is a sensible
                    proof that such a deviation is possible in another; and in such a case as this,
                    it is the witness of God to the truth of a man.</p>
                <p>Miracles, then, under which we also include prophecy, are the only direct
                    evidence which can be given of divine inspiration. When a religion, or any
                    religious truth, is to be revealed from heaven, they appear to be absolutely
                    necessary to enforce its reception amongst men; and this is the only case in
                    which we can suppose them necessary, or believe for a moment that they ever have
                    been or will be performed.</p>
                <p>The history of almost every religion abounds with relations of prodigies and
                    wonders, and of the intercourse of men with the gods; but we know of no
                    religious system, those of the Jews and the Christians excepted, which appealed
                    to miracles as the sole evidence of its truth and divinity. The pretended
                    miracles mentioned by Pagan historians and poets are not said to have been
                    publicly wrought in order to enforce the truth of a new religion contrary to the
                    reigning idolatry. Many of them may be clearly shown to have been mere natural
                    events; others of them are represented as having been performed in secret, upon
                    the most trivial occasions, and in obscure and fabulous ages long prior to the
                    era of the writers by whom they are recorded; and such of them as at first view
                    appear to be best attested, are evidently tricks contrived for interested
                    purposes, to flatter power, or to promote the prevailing superstitions. For
                    these reasons, as well as on account of the immoral character of the divinities
                    by whom they are said to have been wrought, they are altogether unworthy of
                    examination, and carry in the very nature of them the completest proofs of
                    falsehood and imposture.</p>
                <p>But the miracles recorded of Moses and of Christ bear a very different character.
                    None of them is represented as wrought upon trivial occasions. The writers who
                    mention them were eye-witnesses of the facts, which they affirm to have been
                    performed publicly, in attestation of the truth of their respective systems.
                    They are, indeed, so incorporated with these systems, that the miracles cannot
                    be separated from the doctrines; and if the miracles were not really performed,
                    the doctrines cannot possibly be true. Besides all this, they were wrought in
                    support of revelations which opposed all the religious systems, superstitions,
                    and prejudices of the age in which they were given; a circumstance which of
                    itself sets them, in point of authority, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823044"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-3044-0295"/>infinitely above the Pagan prodigies, as well as
                    the pretended miracles of the church of Rome.</p>
                <p>It is indeed, we believe, universally admitted, that the miracles mentioned in
                    the book of Exodus and in the four Gospels might, to those who saw them
                    performed, be sufficient evidence of the divine inspiration of Moses and of
                    Christ; but to us it may be thought that they are no evidence whatever, as we
                    must believe in the miracles themselves, if we believe in them at all, upon the
                    bare authority of human testimony. Why, it has been sometimes asked, are not
                    miracles wrought in all ages and countries? If the religion of Christ was to be
                    of perpetual duration, every generation of men ought to have complete evidence
                    of its truth and divinity.</p>
                <p>To the performance of miracles in every age and in every country, perhaps the
                    same objections would lie as to the immediate inspiration of every individual.
                    Were those miracles universally received as such, men would be so overwhelmed
                    with the <hi rend="italic">number</hi> rather than with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >force</hi> their authority, as hardly to remain masters of their own conduct;
                    and in that case the very end of all miracles would be defeated by their
                    frequency. The truth, however, seems to be, that miracles so frequently repeated
                    would not be received as such, and of course would have <hi rend="italic"
                    >no</hi> authority; because it would be difficult, and in many cases impossible,
                    to distinguish them from natural events. If they recurred regularly at certain
                    intervals, we could not prove them to be deviations from the known laws of
                    nature, because we should have the same experience for the one series of events
                    as we have for the other; for the regular succession of preternatural effects,
                    as for the established constitution and course of things.</p>
                <p>Be this, however, as it may, we shall take the liberty to affirm, that, for the
                    reality of the Gospel miracles, we have evidence as convincing to the reflecting
                    mind, though not so striking to vulgar apprehension, as those had who were
                    contemporary with Christ and his apostles, and actually saw the mighty works
                    which he performed. To the admirers of Mr Hume’s philosophy this assertion will
                    appear an extravagant paradox; but we hope to demonstrate its truths from
                    principles which, consistently with himself, that author could not have denied.
                    He has indeed endeavoured to prove,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Essay on Miracles.</p></note> that “no testimony is
                    sufficient to establish a miracle ;” and the reasoning employed for this purpose
                    is, that “a miracle being a violation of the laws of nature which a firm and
                    unalterable experience has established, the proof against a miracle, from the
                    very nature of the fact, is as entire as any argument from experience can be;
                    whereas our experience of human veracity, which (according to him) is the sole
                    foundation of the evidence of testimony, is far from being uniform, and can
                    therefore never preponderate against that experience which admits of no
                    exception.” This boasted and plausible argument has been examined by Dr
                    Campbell,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dissertation
                    on Miracles.</p></note> who justly observes, that so far is experience from
                    being the sole foundation of the evidence of testimony, that, on the contrary,
                    testimony is the sole foundation of by far the greater part of what Mr Hume
                    calls firm and unalterable experience; and that if in certain circumstances we
                    did not give an implicit faith to testimony, our knowledge of events would be
                    confined to those which had fallen under the immediate observation of our own
                    senses.</p>
                <p>But although Dr Campbell has exposed the sophistry of his opponent’s reasoning,
                    and overturned the principles from which he reasons, we are persuaded that he
                    might safely have joined issue with him upon those very principles. To us, at
                    least, it appears that the testimony upon which we receive the Gospel miracles
                    is precisely of that kind which Mr Hume has acknowledged sufficient to establish
                    even a miracle. “No testimony,” says he, “is sufficient to establish a miracle,
                    unless the testimony be of such a kind that its falsehood would be more
                    miraculous than the fact which it endeavours to establish. When one tells me
                    that he saw a dead man restored to life, I immediately consider with myself
                    whether it be more probable that this person should either deceive or be
                    deceived, or that the fact which he relates should really have happened. 1 weigh
                    the one miracle against the other; and according to the superiority which I
                    discover, I pronounce my decision, and always reject the greater miracle.” In
                    this passage every reader may remark, what did not escape the perspicacious eye
                    of Dr Campbell, a strange confusion of terms; but as all miracles are equally
                    easy to the Almighty, and as Mr Hume has elsewhere observed, that “the raising
                    of a feather, when the wind wants ever so little of a force requisite for that
                    purpose, is as real a miracle as the raising of a house or a ship into the air,”
                    candour obliges us to suppose, that by talking of greater and less miracles, and
                    of always rejecting the greater, he meant nothing more but that, of two
                    deviations from the known laws of nature, he always rejects that which in itself
                    is least probable.</p>
                <p>If, then, it can be shown that the testimony given by the apostles and other
                    first preachers of Christianity to the miracles of their Master, would, upon
                    their supposition that those miracles were not really performed, have been as
                    great a deviation from the known laws of nature as the miracles themselves, the
                    balance must be considered as equally poised by opposite miracles; and whilst it
                    continues so, the judgment must remain in a state of suspense. But if it shall
                    appear, that in this case the false testimony would have been a deviation from
                    the laws of nature less probable in itself than the miracles recorded in the
                    Gospels, the balance will instantly be destroyed; and, by Mr Hume’s maxim, we
                    shall be obliged to reject the supposition of falsehood in the testimony of the
                    apostles, and admit the miracles of Christ to have been really performed.</p>
                <p>In this argument we need not waste time in proving that those miracles, as they
                    are represented in the writings of the New Testament, were of such a nature, and
                    performed before so many witnesses, that no imposition could possibly be
                    practised upon the senses of those who affirm that they were present. From every
                    page of the Gospels this is so evident, that the philosophical adversaries of
                    the Christian faith never suppose the apostles to have been themselves deceived,
                    but boldly accuse them of bearing false witness. But if this accusation be well
                    founded, their testimony itself is as great a miracle as any which they record
                    of themselves or of their Master.</p>
                <p>It has been shown elsewhere (see the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Metaphysics),</hi> that by the law of association, which is one of the laws of
                    nature, mankind, in the very process of learning to speak, necessarily learn to
                    speak the truth; that ideas and relations are in the mind of every man so
                    closely associated with the words by which they are expressed in his native
                    tongue, and in every other language of which he is master, that the one cannot
                    be entirely separated from the other; that therefore no man can on any occasion
                    speak falsehood without some <hi rend="italic">effort</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> that by no effort can a man give consistency to an unpremeditated detail
                    of falsehood, if it be of any length, and include a number of particulars; and
                    that it is still less possible for several men to agree in such a detail, when
                    at a distance from each other, and cross-questioned by their enemies.</p>
                <p>This being the case, it follows, if the testimony of the apostles to their own
                    and their Master’s miracles be false, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823057"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-3057-0296"/>either that they must have concerted a consistent
                    scheme of falsehood, and agreed to publish it at every hazard; or that God, or
                    some powerful agent appointed by him, must have dissolved all the associations
                    formed in their minds between ideas of sense and the words of language, and
                    arbitrarily formed new associations, all in exact conformity to each other, but
                    all, at the same time, in direct contradiction to truth. One or other of these
                    events must have taken place, because, upon the supposition of falsehood, there
                    is no other alternative. But such a dissolution and formation of associations as
                    the latter implies must, to every man who shall attentively consider it, appear
                    to be as real a miracle, and to require as great an exertion of power, as the
                    resurrection of the dead. Nor is the supposed voluntary agreement of the
                    apostles in a scheme of falsehood an event less miraculous. When they sat down
                    to fabricate their pretended revelation, and to contrive a series of miracles to
                    which they were unanimously to appeal for its truth, it is plain, since they
                    proved successful in their daring enterprise, that they must have clearly
                    foreseen every possible circumstance in which they could be placed, and have
                    prepared consistent answers to every question which could be put to them by
                    their most inveterate and most enlightened enemies; by the statesman, the
                    lawyer, the philosopher, and the priest. That such foreknowledge as this would
                    have been miraculous, will not surely be denied; since it forms the very
                    attribute which we find it most difficult to allow even to God himself. It is
                    not, however, the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> miracle which this supposition
                    would compel us to swallow. The very <hi rend="italic">resolution</hi> of the
                    apostles to propagate the belief of false miracles in support of such a religion
                    as that which is taught in the New Testament, is about as great a miracle as
                    human imagination can easily conceive.</p>
                <p>When they formed this design, either they must have hoped to succeed, or they
                    must have foreseen that they would fail in their undertaking; and, in either
                    case, they chose evil for its own sake. They could not, if they foresaw that
                    they would fail, look for any thing but that contempt, disgrace, and
                    persecution, which were then the inevitable consequences of an unsuccessful
                    endeavour to overthrow the established religion. Nor could their prospects be
                    brighter upon the supposition of their success. As they knew themselves to be
                    false witnesses and impious deceivers, they could have no hopes beyond the
                    grave; and by determining to oppose all the religious systems, superstitions,
                    and prejudices of the age in which they lived, they wilfully exposed themselves
                    to inevitable misery in the present life, to insult and imprisonment, to stripes
                    and death. Nor can it be said that they might look forward to power and
                    affluence when they should, through sufferings, have converted their countrymen;
                    for so desirous were they of obtaining nothing but <hi rend="italic">misery</hi>
                    as the end of their mission, that they made their own persecution a test of the
                    truth of their doctrines. They introduced the Master from whom they pretended to
                    have received these doctrines, as telling them, “that they were sent forth as
                    sheep in the midst of wolves; that they should be×delivered up to councils, and
                    scourged in synagogues; that they should be hated of all men for his name’s
                    sake; that the brother should deliver up the brother to death, and the father
                    the child; and that he who took not up his cross and followed after him was not
                    worthy of him.” The very system of religion, therefore, which they invented and
                    resolved to impose upon mankind, was so contrived, that the worldly prosperity
                    of its first preachers, and even their exemption from persecution, was
                    incompatible with its success. Had these clear predictions of the Author of that
                    religion, under whom the apostles acted only as ministers, not been verified,
                    all mankind must have instantly perceived that their pretence to inspiration was
                    false, and that Christianity was a scandalous and impudent imposture. All this
                    the apostles could not but foresee when they formed their plan for deluding the
                    world. Hence it follows, that when they had resolved to support their pretended
                    revelation by an appeal to forged miracles, they wilfully, and with their eyes
                    open, exposed themselves to inevitable misery, whether they should succeed or
                    fail in their enterprise; and that they concerted their measures so as not to
                    admit of a possibility of recompense to themselves, either in this life or in
                    that which is to come. But if there be a law of nature, for the reality of which
                    we have better evidence than we have for that of others, it is, that “no man can
                    choose misery for its <hi rend="italic">own sake,”</hi> or make the acquisition
                    of it the ultimate end of his pursuit. The existence of other laws of nature we
                    know by testimony and our own observation of the regularity of their effects.
                    The existence of this law is made known to us not only by these means, but also
                    by the still clearer and more conclusive evidence of our own consciousness.</p>
                <p>Thus, then, do miracles force themselves upon our assent in every possible view
                    which we can take of this interesting subject. If the testimony of the first
                    preachers of Christianity was true, the miracles recorded in the Gospel were
                    certainly performed, and the doctrines of our religion are derived from heaven.
                    On the other hand, if that testimony was false, either God must have
                    miraculously effaced from the minds of those by whom it was given all the
                    associations formed between their sensible ideas and the words of language, or
                    he must have endowed those men with the gift of prescience, and have impelled
                    them to fabricate a pretended revelation for the purpose of deceiving the world,
                    and involving themselves in certain and foreseen destruction.</p>
                <p>The power necessary to perform the one series of these miracles may, for any
                    thing known to us, be as great as that which would be requisite for the
                    performance of the other; and, considered merely as exertions of preternatural
                    power, they may seem to balance each other, and to hold the mind in a state of
                    suspense. But when we take into consideration the different purposes for which
                    these opposite and contending miracles were wrought, the balance is instantly
                    destroyed. The miracles recorded in the Gospels, if real, were wrought in
                    support of a revelation which, in the opinion of all by whom it is received, has
                    brought to light many important truths which could not otherwise have been made
                    known to men; and which, by the confession of its adversaries, contains the
                    purest moral precepts by which the conduct of mankind was ever directed. The
                    opposite series of miracles, if real, was performed to enable, and even to
                    compel, a company of Jews, of the lowest rank and of the narrowest education, to
                    fabricate, with the view of inevitable destruction to themselves, a consistent
                    scheme of falsehood, and, by an appeal to forged miracles, to impose it upon the
                    world as a revelation from heaven. The object of the former miracles is worthy
                    of a God of infinite wisdom, goodness, and power. The object of the. latter is
                    absolutely inconsistent with wisdom and goodness, which are demonstrably the
                    attributes of that Being by whom alone miracles can be performed. Hence it
                    follows, that the supposition of the apostles bearing false testimony to the
                    miracles of their Master, implies a series of deviations from the laws of nature
                    infinitely less probable in themselves than those miracles; and therefore, by Mr
                    Hume’s maxim, we must necessarily reject the supposition of falsehood in the
                    testimony, and admit the reality of the miracles. So true it is, that for the
                    reality of the Gospel miracles we have evidence as convincing to the reflecting
                    mind, as those had who were contemporary with Christ and his apostles, and
                    witnesses to their mighty works. <hi rend="smallcaps">(h h. ii h.)</hi></p>
