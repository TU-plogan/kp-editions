                <p><label type="entry">MOZART, <hi rend="smallcaps">John
                    Chrysostom-Wolfgang-Theophilus</hi></label>, the illustrious musical composer,
                    was born at Salzburg, on the 27th of January 1756. He was the son of Leopold
                    Mozart, a musician in the employment of the Prince-archbishop of Salzburg, and
                    Anna Maria Perth Both parents were noted for their uncommon beauty. Mozart was
                    scarcely three years old when he manifested the most astonishing disposition for
                    music. With an instinctive perception of beauty, his great delight was to seek
                    for <hi rend="italic">thirds</hi> on the piano, and nothing could equal his joy
                    when he found this harmonious chord. At the age of four his father taught him
                    some minuets, and other pieces of music. Mozart would learn a minuet in half an
                    hour, and a longer piece in less than twice that time; and immediately
                    afterwards, he played them with remarkable clearness, and perfectly in time.
                    Before he was six, he had invented several small pieces himself, and even
                    attempted compositions of some extent and intricacy. The vivacity of his mind
                    led him to attach himself easily to every new object that was presented to him.
                    He pursued the usual tasks of childhood with ardour; and when learning
                    arithmetic, covered the tables, chairs, and walls with figures which he had
                    chalked upon them. Music, however, soon became his favourite study, and in his
                    juvenile efforts in composition, he showed a consistency of thought and a
                    symmetry of design which promised a maturity of the highest genius.</p>
                <p>One day, his father returning from church with a friend, found his son busy
                    writing. “What are you doing there, my little fellow ?” he asked. “I am
                    composing a concerto for the harpsichord, and have almost got to the end of the
                    first part.” “Let us see this fine scrawl.” “No, I have not yet finished it.”
                    The father, however, took the paper, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826827"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-6827-0586"/>and showed his friend a sheet full of notes, which
                    could scarcely be deciphered for the blots of ink. The two friends at first
                    laughed at this heap of scribbling; but after regarding it a little more
                    seriously, the father’s eyes overflowed with tears of joy and wonder. “Look, my
                    friend,” said he, with a smile of delight, “every thing is composed according to
                    rule. It is a pity the piece cannot be made any use of; but it is too difficult;
                    nobody would be able to play it.” “It is a concerto,” replied the son, “and must
                    be studied till it can be properly played. This is the style in which it ought
                    to be executed.” He accordingly began to play, but succeeded only so far as to
                    give them an idea of what he intended.</p>
                <p>The extraordinary precocity of his son’s genius induced Leopold Mozart to exhibit
                    him at the different courts in Germany. As soon therefore as Wolfgang had
                    attained his sixth year, the Mozart family, consisting of the father, mother, a
                    young daughter who had made very considerable proficiency on the harpsichord,
                    and Wolfgang, took a journey to Munich. This expedition succeeded in every
                    respect. The young artists, delighted at the reception which they had met with,
                    redoubled their application, and acquired a degree of execution on the piano,
                    which no longer required the consideration of their youth to render it
                    remarkable. During the autumn of the year 1762, the whole family repaired to
                    Vienna, where the children performed before the court. Here they met with the
                    celebrated Wagenseil. When Mozart, who knew already how to esteem the
                    approbation of a great master, sat down to play before the Emperor Francis, he
                    asked his majesty, “Is not Μ. Wagenseil here? we must send for him; he
                    understands these things.” The emperor sent for Wagenseil, and gave up his place
                    to him at the side of the piano. “Sir,” said Mozart to the composer, “I am going
                    to play one of your concertos; you must turn over the leaves for me.”</p>
                <p>Hitherto the young Mozart had only played upon the harpsichord. On his return
                    from Vienna to Salzburg, he brought with him a small violin, and amused himself
                    with it. Wenzl, a skilful violin player, came to consult Leopold Mozart about
                    some trios he had written. It was proposed to try the music. The father played
                    the bass, Wenzl the first violin, and Schachtncr, the archbishop’s trumpeter,
                    was to have played the second; but Wolfang insisted so much en being allowed to
                    take this part, that his father at last consented to his playing it on his
                    little violin. It was the first time he had heard his son seriously attempt this
                    instrument, which, to the astonishment and delight of the party, he played with
                    marvellous precision.</p>
                <p>Every day afforded fresh proofs of Mozart’s exquisite organization for music. He
                    could distinguish and point out the slightest differences of sound; and every
                    false or even rough note, not softened by some chord, was a torture to him. It
                    was from this cause that, during the early part of his childhood, and even till
                    he had attained his tenth year, he had an insurmountable horror for the trumpet
                    when it was not used merely as an accompaniment. The sight of this instrument
                    produced upon him much the same impression as that of a loaded pistol does upon
                    other children when pointed at them in sport. His father thought he could cure
                    him of this fear by causing the trumpet to be blown in his presence,
                    notwithstanding his son’s entreaties to be spared that torment; but at the first
                    blast the boy turned pale, fell upon the floor, and would probably have been in
                    convulsions if they had not immediately ceased.</p>
                <p>In 1763, when Mozart was in his seventh year, his family set out upon their first
                    expedition beyond the boundaries of Germany; and it is from this period that the
                    celebrity of the name of Mozart in Europe is to be dated. They visited Paris and
                    many other cities on the Continent; and in the year 1764 came to London, where
                    the children played before the king. Mozart also played the organ at the Chapel
                    Royal; and with this the king was even more pleased than with his performance on
                    the harpsichord. During this visit, he composed six sonatas, which he dedicated
                    to the queen. He afterwards returned to France, whence he proceeded to Holland
                    and Switzerland; and on his arrival at his native place in 1766, he composed, at
                    the request of the Emperor Joseph, the music of an opera-buffa called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Finta</hi><hi rend="italic">Semplice,</hi> which was approved of
                    by Hasse and Metastasio. At the dedication of the Church of the Orphans he
                    composed the music of the mass, and directed this solemn service, in the
                    presence of the imperial court, although he was at that period only twelve years
                    old.</p>
                <p>In the month of December 1769, his father took him to Italy, and in every city
                    met with an enthusiastic reception. Young Mozart had not as yet ventured out of
                    the beaten track of composers; but, preserving the old forms of melody and
                    harmony, he wrote in a style which was particularly learned and correct. His
                    operas at this period were thought to have an air of stiffness, from the
                    cen-trapuntal knowledge which they exhibited. What principally distinguished him
                    from other composers, was the facility with which he scored, and the
                    extraordinary fluency of his ideas. It was probably, too, from reading
                    Metastasio at this period that Mozart’s taste in lyric poetry was formed; for in
                    maturer life he was fastidious in the choice of the words he set to music, and
                    the uninterrupted flow of melody and versification distinguished his airs from
                    those of any other composer. Another circumstance of the Italian tour, which
                    proved influential upon the after life of Mozart, was the daily hearing of the
                    highest and most pathetic style of church music, Italy having in the latter part
                    of the last century produced some of her greatest ecclesiastical works. In the
                    celebrated <hi rend="italic">Requiem,</hi> which was composed purely from love
                    of the <hi rend="italic">expressive</hi> in sacred music, we may discover the
                    result of the author’s young devotion to this branch of the art, the consequence
                    of listening to choral effects in the cathedrals of Italy.</p>
                <p>Mozart having engaged to produce the first opera for the carnival of Milan, our
                    travellers proceeded to Bologna, where Wolfgang found an enthusiastic admirer in
                    Padre Martini, who was astonished to find a boy of fourteen years old capable of
                    giving answers instantly in the <hi rend="italic">rigore</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >modi,</hi> to any subject of fugue laid before him. In Rome Mozart gave a
                    miraculous attestation of his quickness of ear and extensive memory, by bringing
                    away from the Sistine Chapel the <hi rend="italic">Miserere</hi> of Allegri, a
                    work full of imitation and repercussion, mostly for a double choir, and
                    continually changing in the combination and relation of the parts. He drew out a
                    sketch of this celebrated composition upon the first hearing, and filled it up
                    from recollection at home. He then repaired to the second and last performance
                    with his manuscript in his hat, and corrected it. He afterwards produced his
                    copy at a concert in Rome, and one of the singers who sang at the performance of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Miserere</hi> pronounced it perfect. Mozart thus became
                    famous in Rome, a city where it was most difficult to excite attention in any
                    thing relating to the fine arts, on account of the numerous productions of art
                    which were then every day presented, and formed subjects of constant and
                    familiar contemplation.</p>
                <p>In December 1770, the first representation of his opera, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mitridate Re di Ponto,</hi> took place at Milan. It met with remarkable favour,
                    and was performed twenty nights in succession. He afterwards wrote several other
                    operas, one of which, entitled <hi rend="italic">Lucio Silla,</hi> was likewise
                    represented twenty times. But the epoch at which Mozart’s genius ripened may be
                    dated from his twentieth year. Constant study and practice had given him ease in
                    composition, and ideas came thicker with his early manhood. The fire, the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193826840" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6840-0587"/> melodiousness,
                    the boldness of harmony, the inexhaustible invention, which characterize his
                    works, were at this time apparent. He began to think in a manner entirely
                    independent, and to perform what he had promised as a regenerator of the musical
                    art.</p>
                <p>Mozart produced his first great opera, <hi rend="italic">Idomeneo,</hi> in his
                    twenty-fifth year. He was then enamoured of Mademoiselle Constance Weber, a
                    celebrated actress, whom he afterwards married. The family of his mistress
                    having opposed the match, on account of his unsettled habits and situation, he
                    was desirous of showing them that, although he had no recognised rank in
                    society, he nevertheless possessed the means of obtaining consideration; and his
                    attachment to Constance supplied him with the subjects of the impassioned airs
                    which his work required. The love and vanity of the young composer, thus
                    stimulated to the highest pitch, enabled him to produce the opera of <hi
                    rend="italic">Idomeneo,</hi> which he always regarded as one of his best, and
                    from which he has frequently borrowed ideas for his subsequent works.</p>
                <p>Mozart being now happily married and settled, gave himself up to his profession.
                    In 1787 he produced <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Nozze di
                    Figaro,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">II Don Giovanni,</hi> and afterwards his <hi
                    rend="italic">Cosi fan</hi><hi rend="italic">Tutte,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >La Clemenza di Tito,</hi> an opera of Metastasio, which was performed for the
                    first time in 1792. He wrote only three German operas, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Zauber-flöte,</hi><hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Entführung aus dem Serail,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Der
                    Schauspiel-director.</hi></p>
                <p>His works composed for the stage consist altogether of twelve operas. He left
                    seventeen symphonies and instrumental pieces of all kinds, besides masses and
                    other church compositions. He was one of the first piano-forte performers in
                    Europe. He played with extraordinary rapidity, and the execution of his left
                    hand was especially admired. Haydn said, “I never can forget Mozart’s playing;
                    it went to the heart.”</p>
                <p>Entirely absorbed in music, this great man was a child in almost every other
                    respect. His hands were so wedded to the piano, that he could use them for
                    nothing else. At table his wife carved for him; and in every thing relating to
                    money, or to the management of his domestic affairs, or even the choice and
                    arrangement of his amusements, he was entirely under her guidance. But, seated
                    at the piano-forte, he appeared a being of another order. His mind then took
                    wing, and his whole attention was directed to the development of his art. His
                    health was very delicate, and during the latter part of his too short life it
                    declined rapidly. At times he laboured under a profound melancholy, and in this
                    state he wrote <hi rend="italic">Die Zauberflote,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clemenza di Tito,</hi> and his celebrated mass in D minor, commonly known by
                    the name of his <hi rend="italic">Requiem.</hi> The circumstances which attended
                    the composition of the last of these works are too remarkable to be omitted in
                    any notice of the life of Mozart.</p>
                <p>One day, when his spirits were unusually oppressed, a stranger, of a tall
                    dignified appearance, was introduced. The manners of this stranger were grave
                    and impressive, and he told Mozart that he came from a person who did not wish
                    to be known, to request he would compose a solemn mass, as a requiem for the
                    soul of a friend whom he had recently lost, and whose memory he was desirous of
                    commemorating by this solemn service. Mozart undertook the task, and engaged to
                    have it completed in a month. The stranger begged to know what price he set upon
                    his work, and having immediately paid him a hundred ducats, took his leave. The
                    mystery of this visit seemed to have a very strong effect upon the mind of the
                    musician. He brooded over it for some time, and then suddenly calling for
                    writing materials, began to compose with extraordinary ardour. This application,
                    however, was more than his strength could support; it brought on fainting fits,
                    and his increasing ill ness obliged him to suspend his work. “I am writing this
                    Requiem for myself,” said he abruptly to his wife one day; “it will serve for my
                    own funeral service;” and this impression never afterwards left him. At the
                    expiration of the month, the mysterious stranger appeared, and demanded the
                    Requiem. “I have found it impossible,” said Mozart, “to keep my word; the work
                    has interested me more than I expected, and I have extended it beyond my first
                    design. I shall require another month to finish it.” The stranger made no
                    objection; but observing, that for this additional trouble it was but just to
                    increase the premium, laid down fifty ducats more, and promised to return at the
                    time appointed. Astonished at the whole proceedings, Mozart ordered a servant to
                    follow this singular personage, and if possible find out who he was; the man,
                    however, lost sight of him, and was obliged to return as he went. Mozart, now
                    more than ever persuaded that he was a messenger from the other world sent to
                    warm him that his end was approaching, applied with fresh zeal to the Requiem,
                    and, in spite of the exhausted state both of his mind and body, completed it
                    before the end of the month. At the appointed day the stranger returned; but
                    Mozart was no more. He died on the 5th of December 1791, before he had completed
                    his thirty-sixth year.</p>
                <p>The distinguishing characteristic of the music of Mozart is its power of touching
                    the deepest feelings of the soul. He has been justly styled the Raffaelle of
                    music. He had many of the fine qualities and modest perfections of the great
                    painter, whom he also resembled in the fertility and variety of his genius.
                    Mozart embraced his art in its whole extent, and excelled in all its
                    departments. When, indeed, we bring into view all his qualifications as a
                    composer and a practical musician, the result is astonishing. The same man,
                    under the age of thirty-six, was at the head of dramatic, sinfonia, and
                    piano-forte music; he was eminent in the sacred style, and equally at his ease
                    in every variety, from the elaborate concerto to the simplest pieces of music.
                    He put forth about eight hundred compositions, including masses, motetts,
                    operas, and fragments of different kinds; at the same time supporting himself by
                    teaching and giving public performances, at which he executed concertos on the
                    piano-forte, the violin, the organ, or played extempore.</p>
                <p>Of his operas, he esteemed most highly <hi rend="italic">II Don Giovanni</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Idomeneo.</hi> He seldom spoke of his own works; but of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Don Giovanni</hi> he one day observed, “This opera was not
                    composed for the public of Vienna; it is better suited to Prague: but, to say
                    the truth, I wrote it only for myself and my friends.” In this extraordinary
                    production, so remarkable for exquisite melodies and profound harmonies, the
                    playful, the tender, the pathetic, the mysterious, the sublime, and the
                    terrible, may be distinctly traced. The composer exhibits throughout the work
                    the most romantic imagination; and in the awful accompaniment to the reply of
                    the statue, we have a specimen of composition replete with terrific expression,
                    but at the same time perfectly free from inflation or bombast. The ghost scene
                    in the last act maybe considered as the greatest effort of dramatic composition.
                    Well has the style of Mozart been described as that of Shakspeare in music. The
                    fear of Leporello is painted with true comic spirit; a thing rather unusual with
                    Mozart. But melancholy is the prevailing passion in this masterpiece; and so
                    strong, so distinct, so real, is the imagery in which it is presented to the
                    soul, that minds possessed of the least enthusiasm are sure to be moved.</p>
                <p>We have already seen that the <hi rend="italic">Idomeneo</hi> was the firstwork
                    produced by Mozart that raised his name to celebrity as a dramatic composer.
                    This opera, and the <hi rend="italic">Clemenza di Tito,</hi> are, in the opinion
                    of judges, considered as the two best serious operas extant. His opera of <hi
                    rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Nozze di Fi-</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193826853" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6853-0588"/><hi rend="italic">garo</hi>
                    is also much admired. In this piece, it must be admitted that Mozart has changed
                    the picture of Beaumarchais. The spirit of the original is preserved only in the
                    situations; all the characters are altered to the tender and impassioned. But
                    although the brilliant wit of the French author has not been conveyed, yet, as a
                    work of pure tenderness and melancholy, entirely divested of any unsuitable
                    admixture of the majestic and the tragical, the <hi rend="italic">Nozze di
                    Figaro</hi> is unrivalled. It is difficult to form any idea of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Zauberflote,</hi> without having seen it. The story, which is like
                    the wandering of a delirious imagination, harmonizes admirably with the genius
                    of the musician. The subject of <hi rend="italic">Cosi fan</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Tutte</hi> is unsuitable to Mozart, who could not trifle with love. The tender
                    parts of the characters in this opera are the best.</p>
                <p>The sacred compositions of Mozart are celebrated all over Europe, and frequently
                    performed in the Catholic churches. Of these works the most sublime is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Requiem</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but several of his other
                    masses and motetts are noted for their grandeur and beauty. His symphonies,
                    quartetts, and other works for the orchestra and stringed instruments, rank in
                    estimation with those of Haydn and Beethoven. His piano-forte writings are also
                    justly esteemed. Mozart’s sympathy was most extensive; he participated with
                    Sebastian Bach in the beauty of the fugue, with Handel in the grandeur of church
                    music, with Gluck in the serious opera, with Haydn in instrumental music, and in
                    the universality of his genius surpassed them all.</p>
                <p>In the exterior of Mozart there was nothing remarkable; he was diminutive in
                    person, and had a very agreeable countenance, which, however, did not at the
                    first glance discover the greatness of his genius. His eyes were tolerably large
                    and well shaped, more heavy than fiery in the expression; and when he was thin
                    they were rather prominent. His sight was quick and strong; but he had an
                    unsteady, abstracted look, except when seated at the piano-forte, and then the
                    whole form of his visage changed. His hands were small and beautiful, and he
                    used them so softly and naturally upon the piano-forte, that the eye was no less
                    delighted than the ear. His head was rather large in proportion to his body, but
                    his hands and feet were in perfect symmetry. The stunted growth of Mozart’s body
                    may have arisen from the efforts of his mind. He was always good humoured, but
                    very absent, and in answering questions seemed to be thinking of something else.
                    Mozart had six children, but two sons only survived him. His widow married Μ.

                    account of the composer. (z. z.)</p>
