                    type="authorial"><p>This Treatise seems to have been compiled for the second
                    edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica; and, with the addition of a short
                    preliminary view of the History of Ethics, which it received in the third, it
                    has been reprinted in all the subsequent editions. To have republished this
                    historical portion, after the extensive dissertation on the same subject,
                    prefixed to the present edition, would have been worse than useless; but, though
                    that dissertation touches upon almost all the principal doctrines of Ethics, it
                    seemed advisable to reprint the rest; because a sample, at least, of Systematic
                    Ethics, was evidently required in a work of this kind, and the present treatise
                    may be useful in that view, though not in all respects what we could have wished
                    to offer to our readers.</p></note><hi rend="smallcaps">Moral Philosophy</hi> is
                    the science of <hi rend="italic">manners or duty,</hi> which it traces from
                    man’s nature and condition, and shows to terminate in his happiness; in other
                    words, it is the knowledge of our <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">felicity</hi> or the art of being <hi rend="italic">virtuous</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">happy.</hi></p>
                <p>It is denominated an art, as it contains a system of rules for becoming virtuous
                    and happy; and whoever practises these rules, attains an habitual power or
                    facility of becoming virtuous and happy. It is likewise called a science, as it
                    deduces those rules from the principles and connections of our nature, and
                    proves that the observance of them is productive of our happiness. It is an art
                    and a science of the highest dignity, importance, and use. Its object is man’s
                    duty, or his conduct in the several moral capacities and connections which he
                    sustains. Its office is to direct our conduct; to show whence our obligations
                    arise, and where they terminate. Its use, or end, is the attainment of
                    happiness; and the means it employs are rules for the right conduct of our moral
                    powers.</p>
                <p>Moral Philosophy has this in common with Natural Philosophy, that it appeals to
                    nature or fact; it depends on observation, and it builds its reasonings on plain
                    uncontrovertible experiments, or upon the fullest induction of particulars of
                    which the subject will admit. We must observe, in both these sciences, how
                    nature is affected, and what her conduct is in such and such circumstances. In
                    other words, we must collect the appearances of nature in any given instance;
                    trace them to some general principles or laws of operation; and then apply these
                    principles or laws to the explanation of other phenomena.</p>
                <p>The history of this branch of Philosophy having been largely discussed in the
                    Preliminary Dissertations, we shall here proceed to consider it in a systematic
                    form.</p>
                <p>PART I.</p>
                <p>CHAP. I.—OF MAN AND HIS CONNECTIONS.</p>
                <p>Man is born a weak, helpless, delicate creature, unprovided with food, clothing,
                    and whatever else is necessary for subsistence or defence. And yet, exposed as
                    the infant is to numberless wants and dangers, he is utterly incapable of
                    supplying the one, or securing himself against the other. But, though thus
                    feeble and exposed, he finds immediate and sure resources in the affection and
                    care of his parents, who refuse no labours, and forego no dangers, to nurse and
                    rear up the tender babe. By these powerful instincts, as by some mighty chain,
                    does nature link the parent to the child, and form the strongest moral
                    connection on his part, before the child has the least apprehension of its
                    nature. Hunger and thirst, with all the sensations which accompany or are
                    connected with them, explain themselves by a language strongly expressive, and
                    irresistibly moving. As the several senses furnish notices and informations of
                    surrounding objects, we may perceive in the young spectator early signs of a
                    growing wonder and admiration. Bright objects and striking sounds are beheld
                    -and heard with a sort of commotion and surprise. But, without resting on any,
                    he eagerly passes on from object to object, still pleased with whatever is
                    newest. Thus the love of novelty is formed, and the passion of wonder kept
                    awake. By degrees he becomes acquainted with the most familiar objects, his
                    parents, his brethren, and those of the family who are most conversant with him.
                    He contracts a fondness for them, is uneasy when they are gone, and charmed to
                    see them again. These feelings become the foundation of a moral attachment on
                    his side; and by this reciprocal sympathy he forms the domestic alliance with
                    his parents, brethren, and other members of the family. Hence he becomes
                    interested in their concerns, and feels joy or grief, hope or fear, on their
                    account, as well as his own. As his affections now point beyond himself to
                    others, he is denominated a good or ill creature, as he stands well or ill
                    affected towards them. These, then, are the first links of the moral chain; the
                    early rudiments, or outlines, of his character, and his first rude essays
                    towards agency, freedom, manhood.</p>
                <p>When he begins to make excursions from the nursery, and extends his acquaintance
                    abroad, he forms a little circle of companions, engages with them in play, or in
                    quest of adventures; and leads, or is led by them, as his genius is more or less
                    aspiring. Although this is properly the season in which appetite and passion
                    have the ascendant, yet his imagination and intellectual powers open apace; and
                    as the various images of things pass before the mental eye, he forms variety of
                    tastes, relishes some things, and dislikes others, as his parents and
                    companions, whilst a thousand other circumstances lead him to combine agreeable
                    or disagreeable sets of ideas, or represent to him objects in alluring or odious
                    lights.</p>
                <p>As his views are enlarged, his active and social powers expand themselves in
                    proportion; the love of action, of imitation, and of praise; emulation,
                    curiosity, docility, a passion for command, and fondness of change. His passions
                    are quick, variable, and pliant to every impression; his attachments and
                    disgusts quickly succeed each other. He compares things, distinguishes actions,
                    judges of characters, and loves or hates them, as they appear well or ill
                    affected to himself, or to those he holds dear. Meanwhile he soon grows sensible
                    of the consequences of his own actions, as they attract applause, or bring
                    contempt; he triumphs in the former, and is ashamed of the latter, wants to hide
                    them, and blushes when they are discovered. By means of these powers he becomes
                    a fit subject of culture, the moral tie is drawn closer, he feels that he is
                    accountable for his conduct to others as well as to himself, and thus is
                    gradually ripening for society and action.</p>
                <p>As man advances from childhood to youth, his passions as well as perceptions take
                    a more extensive range. New senses of pleasure invite him to new pursuits; he
                    grows sensible to the attractions of beauty, feels a peculiar sympathy with the
                    sex, and forms a more tender kind of attachment than he has yet experienced.
                    This becomes the cement of a new moral relation, and gives a softer turn to his
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825150" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5150-0457"/>passions and
                    behaviour. In this turbulent period he enters more deeply into a relish of
                    friendship, company, exercises, and diversions; the love of truth, of imitation,
                    and of design, grows upon him; and as his connections spread amongst his
                    neighbours, fellow-citizens, and countrymen, his thirst of praise, emulation,
                    and social affections grows more intense and active. Meanwhile, it is impossible
                    for him to have lived thus long without having become sensible of those more
                    august impressions of order, wisdom, and goodness, which are stamped on the
                    visible creation, and of those strong suggestions within himself of a parent
                    mind, the source of all intelligence and beauty; an object as well as source of
                    that activity and those aspirations which sometimes rouse his inmost frame, and
                    carry him out of himself to an almighty and all-governing power. Hence arise
                    those sentiments of reverence, and those affections of gratitude, resignation,
                    and love, which link the soul with the Author of Nature, and form that most
                    sublime and godlike of all connections.</p>
                <p>Man having now reached his prime, either new passions succeed, or the former set
                    are wound up to a higher pitch. For, growing more sensible of his connections
                    with the public, and that particular community to which he more immediately
                    belongs, and taking withal a larger prospect of human life, and its various
                    wants and enjoyments, he forms more intimate friendships, grasps at power,
                    courts honour, lays down cooler plans of interest, and becomes more attentive to
                    the concerns of society; he enters into family connections, and indulges those
                    charities which arise therefrom. The reigning passions of this period powerfully
                    prompt him to provide for the decays of life; whilst compassion and gratitude
                    exert their influence in urging the man, now in full vigour, to requite the
                    affection and care of his parents, by supplying their wants and alleviating
                    their infirmities.</p>
                <p>At length human life verges downwards, and old age creeps on apace, with its
                    anxiety, love of ease, interestedness, fearfulness, foresight, and love of
                    offspring. The experience of the aged is formed to direct, and their coolness to
                    temper, the heat of youth; the former teaches them to look back on past follies,
                    and the latter to look forward into the consequences of things, and provide
                    against the worst. Thus every age has its peculiar genius and set of passions
                    corresponding to that period, and most conducive to the prosperity of the rest;
                    and thus are the wants of one period supplied by the capacities of another, and
                    the weaknesses of one age tally with the passions of another.</p>
                <p>Besides these, there are other passions and affections of a less ambulatory
                    nature, not peculiar to one period, but belonging to every age, and acting more
                    or less in every breast throughout life. Such are self-love, benevolence, love
                    of life, honour, shame, hope, fear, desire, aversion, joy, sorrow, anger, and
                    the like. The two first are affections of a cooler strain; one pointing to the
                    good of the individual, the other to that of the species: joy and sorrow, hope
                    and fear, seem to be only modifications, or different exertions, of the same
                    original affections of love and hatred, desire and aversion, arising from the
                    different circumstances or position of the object desired or abhorred, as it is
                    present or absent. From these likewise arise other secondary or occasional
                    passions, which, as far as regards their existence and several degrees, depend
                    upon the original affections being gratified or disappointed; as anger,
                    complacence, confidence, jealousy, love, hatred, dejection, exultation,
                    contentment, disgust, which do not form leading passions, but rather hold of
                    them.</p>
                <p>By these simple but powerful springs, whether periodical or fixed, the life of
                    man, weak and indigent as he is, is preserved and secured, and the creature is
                    prompted to a constant round of action, even to supply his own numerous and
                    ever-returning wants, and to guard against the various dangers and evils to
                    which he is obnoxious. By these links men are connected with each other, formed
                    into families, drawn into particular communities, and all united as if by a
                    common league into one system or body, the members of which feel and sympathise
                    one with another. By this admirable adjustment of the constitution of man to his
                    actual state, and the gradual evolution of his powers, order is maintained,
                    society upheld, and human life filled with that variety of passion and action
                    which at once enlivens and diversifies it.</p>
                <p>This is a short sketch of the principal movements of the human mind. Yet these
                    movements are not the whole of man; they impel to action, but do not direct it;
                    they need a regulator to guide their motions, to measure and apply their forces;
                    and accordingly they have one which naturally superintends and directs their
                    action. We are conscious of a principle within us, which examines, and compares,
                    and weighs things; notes the differences, observes the forces, and foresees the
                    consequences, of affections and actions. By this power we look back on past
                    times, and forward into futurity; gather experiences; estimate the real aryl
                    comparative value of objects; layout schemes; contrive means to execute them;
                    and settle the whole order and economy of life. This power we commonly
                    distinguish by the name of <hi rend="italic">reason</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >reflection,</hi> the business of which is not to suggest any original notices
                    or sensations, but to canvass, range, and make deductions from them.</p>
                <p>We are also intimately conscious of a principle within us, which approves of
                    certain sentiments, passions, and actions,, and disapproves of their contraries.
                    In consequence of the decisions of this inward judge, we denominate some actions
                    and principles of conduct right, honest, good; and others wrong, dishonest,
                    evil. The former of these excite our esteem, moral complacence, and affection,
                    immediately and originally of themselves, without regard to their consequences,
                    and whether they affect our interest or not; and the latter do as naturally and
                    necessarily call forth our contempt, scorn, and aversion. That power by which we
                    perceive this difference in affections and actions, and feel a consequent relish
                    or dislike, is commonly called <hi rend="italic">conscience,</hi> or the <hi
                    rend="italic">moral sense.</hi></p>
                <p>That there is such a power as this in the mind of every man of sound
                    understanding, is a fact which cannot be controverted; but whether it be an
                    instinctive power, or the result of early and deep-rooted associations, has been
                    long and ably debated. The question is of importance in the science of human
                    nature, as well as in ascertaining the standard of practical virtue; but to us
                    it appears that the contending parties have carried their respective opinions to
                    dangerous extremes.</p>
                <p>When it is affirmed, as it sometimes has been, that reason has nothing to do in
                    ethical science, but that in every possible situation our duty is pointed out
                    and the performance of it enforced by mere sentiment, the consequence seems to
                    be, that virtue and vice are nothing permanent in themselves, but change their
                    nature according to local circumstances. Certain it is, that sentiment has in
                    similar situations approved of very different practices in different ages and
                    different nations. At present this sentiment in Europe approves of the universal
                    practice of justice, and of parents protecting their children, whether well or
                    ill formed, whether strong or weak; but in Sparta we know that theft, if
                    dexterously practised, was approved, and not unfrequently rewarded; and that the
                    exposition of lame and deformed children was not only permitted, but abso lutely
                    enjoined. There is nothing which our conscience or moral sense condemns with
                    greater severity, or views as a crime of a deeper dye, than the unkind treatment
                    by children of their aged parents; yet there are savages, amongst whom instincts
                    of all kinds ought to prevail in greater purity than in civilized nations, whose
                    moral sense permits them to put their aged and decrepid parents to <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193825163" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5163-0458"/> death. If this
                    sense be instinctive, and the sole judge of right and wrong, how comes it to
                    decide so differently on the same line of conduct in different ages and in
                    distant countries? The instinct of brutes, in similar circumstances, prompts
                    uniformly to-similar actions in every age and in every region where the species
                    is found; and the external senses of man afford in all nations the same unvaried
                    evidence concerning their respective objects. To these observations we may add,
                    that instincts must be calculated for the state of nature, whatever that state
                    may be, and therefore cannot be supposed capable of directing our steps
                    throughout all the labyrinths of polished society, in which duties are to be
                    performed which in a state of nature would never have been thought of.</p>
                <p>But although for these reasons it is apparent that mere sentiment, whether called
                    conscience or the moral sense, would alone be a very unsafe guide to virtue in
                    every individual case that may occur, we think that those who resolve all such
                    sentiment into habit and the effect of education, without giving any part of it
                    to nature, advance an opinion which is equally ill founded and not less
                    dangerous. There are, indeed, men who affirm that all benevolence is hypocrisy,
                    friendship a cheat, public spirit a farce, fidelity a snare to procure trust and
                    confidence; and that whilst all of us at bottom pursue only our private
                    interest, we wear those fair disguises in order to put those off their guard
                    with whom we have to deal, and to expose them the more to our wiles and
                    machinations. Others, again, too virtuous to accuse themselves and the rest of
                    mankind of direct knavery, yet insist, that whatever affection one may feel, or
                    imagine he feels, for others, no passion is or can be disinterested; that the
                    most generous friendship, however sincere, is only a modification of self-love;
                    and that, even unknown to ourselves, we seek our own gratification, whilst we
                    appear the most deeply engaged in schemes for the liberty and the happiness of
                    mankind.</p>
                <p>Surely the mildest of these representations is an exaggerated picture of the
                    selfishness of man. Self-love is indeed a very powerful as well as an essential
                    principle in human nature; but that we have likewise an instinctive principle of
                    benevolence, which, without any particular regard to our own interest, makes us
                    feel pleasure in the happiness of other men, is a fact which we think admits of
                    very complete proof. For, as Mr Hume well argues, “when a man grieves for a
                    friend who could be of no service to him, but, on the contrary, stood in need of
                    his constant patronage and protection, how is it possible to suppose that such
                    passionate tenderness arises from self-interest, which has no foundation in
                    nature? What interest,”asks the same profound thinker, “can a fond mother have
                    in view, who loses her health by her assiduous attendance on her sick child, and
                    afterwards languishes and dies of grief when freed by its death from the slavery
                    of attendance? Have we no. satisfaction,” continues he, “in one man’s company
                    above another’s, and no desire of the welfare of our friend, even though absence
                    or death should prevent us from all participation in it? Or what is it commonly
                    that gives us any participation in it, even while alive and present, but our
                    affection and regard to him?” Nor is it to contemporaries and individuals alone,
                    that, independently of all interest, we feel a benevolent attachment. We
                    constantly bestow praise upon actions calculated to promote the good of mankind,
                    though performed in ages very distant and in countries the most remote; and he
                    who was the author of such actions is the object of our esteem and affection.
                    There is not perhaps a man alive, however selfish in his disposition, who does
                    not applaud the sentiment of that emperor who, recollecting at supper that he
                    had done nothing in that day for any one, exclaimed with regret, that the day
                    had been lost; yet the utmost subtilty of imagination can discover no appearance
                    of interest that we can have in the genero sity of Titus, or find any connection
                    of our present happiness with a character removed so far from us both in time
                    and in place. But, as Mr Hume justly observes, if we even feign a character
                    consisting of all the most generous and beneficent qualities, and give instances
                    in which these display themselves, after an eminent and most extraordinary
                    manner, for the good of mankind, we shall instantly engage the esteem and
                    approbation of all our audience, who will never so much as inquire in what age
                    or country the accomplished person lived.</p>
                <p>These are facts which cannot be controverted; and they are wholly unaccountable,
                    if there be not in human nature an instinctive sentimentof benevolence or
                    sympathy which feels a disinterested pleasure in the happiness of mankind. But
                    an end in which we feel such pleasure we are naturally prompted to pursue; and
                    therefore the same sentiment impels every man, with greater or less force, to
                    promote the happiness of other men, which by means of it becomes in reality his
                    own good, and is afterwards pursued from the combined motives of benevolence and
                    self-enjoyment For in obeying this sentiment we all feel an inward complacency,
                    self-approbation, or consciousness of worth or merit; and in disobeying it,
                    which cannot be done but with reluctance, we feel remorse, or a consciousness of
                    unworthiness or demerit. It appears, however, from history, that the sentiment,
                    as it is instinctive, points only to the good of mankind, without informing us
                    how that good is to be promoted. The means proper for this purpose must be
                    discovered by reason; and when they are brought into view, the sentiment called
                    conscience or moral sense instantly shows us that it is our duty to pursue
                    them.</p>
                <p>Hence we see how different lines of conduct may in similar circumstances be
                    approved of as virtuous in different nations. When the Spartan exposed his
                    sickly and deformed child, and when the savage put his aged parents to death,
                    neither the one nor the other erred from want of sentiment, or from having
                    sentiments originally different from ours. Their errors resulted from a defect
                    in reasoning. They both imagined that they were obeying the law of benevolence
                    by preventing misery; for a weak and deformed person was very ill qualified to
                    exist with any degree of comfort under the military constitution of Sparta,
                    where all were soldiers, and under the necessity of enduring the greatest
                    hardships; and in a state where the people have no fixed habitations, and where
                    the precarious chase supplies the necessaries of life, an aged and infirm person
                    is in danger of perishing through hunger, by one of the most cruel and lingering
                    of deaths. The theft allowed in Sparta, if theft it may be called, was still
                    less a deviation from the instinctive law of benevolence. Boys were taught to
                    slip as cunningly as they could into the gardens and public halls, in order to
                    steal away herbs or meat; and if they were caught in the fact, they were
                    punished for their want of dexterity. This kind of theft, since it was
                    authorized by the law and the consent of the citizens, was no robbery; and the
                    intention of the legislator in allowing it, was to inspire the Spartan youth,
                    who were all designed for war, with the greater boldness, subtlety, and address;
                    to inure them betimes to the life of a soldier; and to teach them to shift for
                    themselves, and to live upon little. That the Spartan legislator did wrong in
                    giving his countrymen a constitution, of which successful war was the ultimate
                    object; and that savages, rather than kill their aged parents, or suffer them to
                    die of hunger, ought to cultivate the ground, and abandon the chase, is readily
                    granted; but the faults of the one as well as of the other arose not from any
                    improper decision of the moral sense, but from a defect in their reasoning
                    powers, which were not able to estimate the advantages and disadvantages of
                    different modes of life. In moral decisions, therefore, conscience and reason
                    mutually aid each other. The former principle, when <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193825176" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5176-0459"/>separated from the latter, is
                    defective, enjoining only the good of mankind, but unable to point out the means
                    by which it can be most effectually promoted; and the latter principle, when
                    separated from the former, only directs a man to do what is most prudent, but
                    cannot give him a conception of duty.</p>
                <p>These two powers of reason and conscience, then, are evidently principles
                    different in nature and kind from the passions and affections. For the passions
                    are mere force or power, blind impulses acting violently and without choice, and
                    ultimately tending each to their respective objects, without regard to the
                    interest of the others, or of the whole system. Whereas the directing and
                    judging powers distinguish and ascertain the different forces, mutual
                    proportions and relations, which the passions bear to each other, and to the
                    whole, recognise their several degrees of merit, and judge of the whole temper
                    and conduct, as they respect either the individual or the species, and are
                    capable of directing or restraining the blind impulses of passion in a due
                    consistency one with the other, and a regular subordination to the whole
                    system.</p>
                <p>This is some account of the constituent principles of our nature, which,
                    according to their different mixtures, degrees, and proportions, mould our
                    character and sway our conduct in life. In reviewing that large train of
                    affections which fills up the different stages of human life, we perceive this
                    obvious distinction amongst them, that some of them respect the good of the
                    individual, and others carry us beyond ourselves to promote the good of the
                    species or kind. The former have therefore been called <hi rend="italic"
                    >private,</hi> and the latter <hi rend="italic">public</hi> affections. Of the
                    former sort are love of life, of pleasure, of power, and the like. Of the latter
                    are compassion, gratitude, friendship, natural affection, and the like. Of the
                    private passions, some respect merely the security and defence of the creature,
                    such as resentment and fear; whereas others aim at some positive advantage or
                    good, as wealth, ease, and fame. The former sort, therefore, because of this
                    difference of objects, may be termed defensive passions; they answer to our
                    dangers, and prompt us to avoid them if we can, or boldly to encounter them when
                    we cannot.</p>
                <p>The other class of private passions, which pursue private and positive good, may
                    be called <hi rend="italic">appetitive</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but we
                    shall, nevertheless, retain the name of private in contradistinction to the
                    defensive passions. Man has a great variety of wants to supply, and is capable
                    of many enjoyments, according to the several periods of his life, and the
                    different situations in which he is placed. To these, therefore, correspond a
                    suitable train of private passions, which engage him in the pursuit of whatever
                    is necessary for his subsistence or welfare.</p>
                <p>Our public or social affections are adapted to the several social connections and
                    relations which we bear to others, by making us sensible of their dangers, and
                    interesting us in their wants, and so prompting us to secure them against the
                    one and to supply the other.</p>
                <p>This is the first step, then, to discover the duty and destination of man; the
                    having analysed the principles of which he is composed. It is necessary, in the
                    next place, to consider in what order, proportion, and measure, of those inward
                    principles, virtue, or a sound moral temper and right conduct, consists, that we
                    may discover whence moral obligation arises.</p>
                <p>CHAP. II OF DUTY, OR MORAL OBLIGATION.</p>
                <p>It is by the end or the design of any power or movement that we must direct its
                    motions, and estimate the degree of force necessary to its just action. If it
                    want the force requisite for the obtaining of its end, we reckon it defective;
                    if it has too much, so as to be carried beyond it, we say it is overcharged; and
                    in either case it is imperfect and ill contrived. If it has just enough to reach
                    the scope aimed at, we esteem it right and as it should be. Let us apply this
                    reasoning to the passions.</p>
                <p>The defence and security of the individual being the great aim of the defensive
                    passions, that security and defence must be the measure of their strength or
                    indulgence. If they are so weak as to prove insufficient for that end, or if
                    they carry us beyond it, that is, raise unnecessary commotions, or continue
                    longer than is needful, they are unfit to answer their original design, and
                    therefore are in an unsound and unnatural state. The exercise of fear or of
                    resentment has nothing desirable in it, nor can we give way to either without
                    painful sensations. Without a certain degree of them, we remain naked and
                    exposed; with too high a proportion of them, we are miserable, and often
                    injurious to others. Thus cowardice or timidity, which is the excess of fear,
                    instead of saving us amidst danger, gives it too formidable an appearance, makes
                    us incapable of attending to the best means of preservation, and disarms us of
                    courage, our natural armour. Foolhardiness, which is the want of a due measure
                    of fear, leads us heedlessly into danger, and lulls us into a pernicious
                    security. Revenge, or excessive resentment, by the violence of its commotion,
                    robs us of that presence of mind which is often the best safeguard against
                    injury, and inclines us to pursue the aggressor with more severity than
                    self-defence requires. Pusillanimity, or the want of a just indignation against
                    wrong, leaves us quite unguarded, and tends to sink the mind into a passive
                    enervated tameness. Therefore, to keep the defensive passions duly proportioned
                    to our dangers, is their natural pitch and tenor.</p>
                <p>The private passions naturally lead us to pursue some positive species of private
                    good; that good, therefore, which is the object and end of each, must be the
                    measure of their respective force, and direct their operation. If they are too
                    weak or sluggish to engage us in the pursuit of their several objects, they are
                    evidently deficient; but if they defeat their end by their impetuosity, then are
                    they strained beyond the just tone of nature. Thus vanity, or an excessive
                    passion for applause, betrays us into such meannesses and little arts of
                    popularity, as make us forfeit the honour which we so anxiously court. On the
                    other hand, a total indifference about the esteem of mankind removes a strong
                    guard and spur to virtue, and lays the mind open to the most abandoned
                    prostitutions. Therefore, to keep our private passions and desires proportioned
                    to our wants, is the just measure and pitch of this class of affections.</p>
                <p>The defensive and private passions do all agree in general, in their tendency or
                    conduciveness to the interest or the good of the individual. Therefore, when
                    there is a collision of interest, as may sometimes happen, that aggregate of
                    good or happiness which is composed of the particular goods to which they
                    respectively tend, must be the common standard by which their comparative
                    degrees of strength are to be measured; that is to say, if any of them, in the
                    degree in which they prevail, are incompatible with the greatest aggregate of
                    good or most extensive interest of the individual, then are they unequal and
                    disproportionate. For in judging of a particular system or constitution of
                    powers, we call that the supreme or principal end, in which the aims of the
                    several parts or powers coincide, and to which théy are subordinate; and reckon
                    them in due proportion to each other, and right with regard to the whole, when
                    they maintain that subordination of subserviency. Therefore, to proportion our
                    defensive and private passions in such measure to our dangers and wants as best
                    to secure the individual, and obtain the greatest aggregate of private good or
                    happiness, is their just balance or comparative standard in case of
                    competition.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825189" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5189-0460"/>
                <p>In like manner, as the public or social affections point at the good of others,
                    that good must be the measure of their force. When a particular social
                    affection, as gratitude, or . friendship, which belongs to a particular social
                    connection, as that of a benefactor, or of a friend, is too feeble to make us
                    act the grateful or friendly part, that affection, being insufficient to answer
                    its end, is defective and unsound. If, on the other hand, a particular passion
                    of this class counteract or defeat the interest it is designed to promote, by
                    its violence or disproportion, then is that passion excessive and irregular.
                    Thus natural affection, if it degenerate into a passionate fondness, not only
                    hinders the parents from judging coolly of the interest of their offspring, but
                    often leads them into a most partial and pernicious indulgence.</p>
                <p>As every kind affection points at the good of its particular object, it is
                    possible there may sometimes be a collision of interests or goods. Thus the
                    regard due to a friend may interfere with that which we owe to a community. In
                    such a competition of interests, it is evident that the greatest is to be
                    chosen; and that is the greatest interest which contains the greatest sum or
                    aggregate of public good, greatest in quantity as well as in duration. This,
                    then, is the common standard by which the respective forces and subordinations
                    of the social affections must be adjusted. Therefore we conclude that this class
                    of affections are sound and regular when they prompt us to pursue the interest
                    of individuals in“an entire consistency with the public good; or, in other
                    words, when they are duly proportioned to the dangers and wants of others, and
                    to the various relations in which we stand to individuals or to society.</p>
                <p>Thus we have found, by an induction of particulars, the natural pitch or tenor of
                    the different orders of affection, considered apart by themselves. Now, as the
                    virtue or perfection of every creature lies in following its nature, or in
                    acting suitably to the just proportion and harmony of its several powers,
                    therefore the <hi rend="italic">virtue</hi> of a creature endowed with such
                    affections as man must consist in observing or acting agreeably to their natural
                    pitch and tenor.</p>
                <p>But as there are no independent affections in the fabric of the mind, no passion
                    that stands by itself without some relation to the rest, we cannot pronounce of
                    any one, considered apart, that it is either too strong or too weak. Its
                    strength and just proportion must be measured not only by its subserviency to
                    its own immediate end, but by the respect it bears to the whole system of
                    affections. Therefore we say a passion is too strong, not only when it defeats
                    its own end, but when it impairs the force of other passions, which are equally
                    necessary to form a temper of mind suited to a certain economy or state; and too
                    weak, not merely on account of its insufficiency to answer its end, but because
                    it cannot sustain its part or office in the balance of the whole system. Thus
                    the love of life may be too strong when it takes from the regard due to one’s
                    country, and will not allow one bravely to encounter dangers, or even death, on
                    its account. Again, the love of fame may be too weak when it throws down the
                    fences which render virtue more secure, or weakens the incentives which make it
                    more active and public spirited.</p>
                <p>If it be asked, how far may the affections towards private good or happiness be
                    indulged? One limit was before fixed for the particular indulgence of each,
                    namely, their subordination to the common aggregate of good to the private
                    system. In these, therefore, a due regard is always supposed to be had to
                    health, reputation, fortune, the freedom of action, the unimpaired exercise of
                    reason, and the calm enjoyment of one’s self, which are all private goods.
                    Another limit now results from the balance of affection just named, namely, the
                    security and happiness of others; or, to express it more generally, a private
                    affection may be safely indulged, when, by that indulgence, we do not violate
                    the obligations which result from our higher relations or public connections. A
                    just respect, therefore, being had to these boundaries which nature has fixed in
                    the breast of every man, what should limit our pursuits of private happiness? Is
                    nature sullen and penurious? or, does the God of nature envy the happiness of
                    his offspring?</p>
                <p>Whether there is ever a real collision of interests between the public and
                    private system of affections, or the ends which each class has in view, will be
                    afterwards considered; but where there is no collision, there is little or no
                    danger of carrying either, but especially the public affections, to excess,
                    provided both kinds are kept subordinate to a discreet and cool self-love, and
                    to a calm and universal benevolence, principles which stand as guards at the
                    head of each system.</p>
                <p>This, then, is the conduct of the passions, considered as particular and separate
                    forces, carrying us out to their respective ends; and this is their balance or
                    economy, considered as compound powers, or powers mutually related, acting in
                    conjunction towards a common end, and consequently as forming a system or
                    whole.</p>
                <p>Now, whatever adjusts or maintains this balance, whatever in the human
                    constitution is formed for directing the passions so as to keep them from
                    defeating their own end or interfering with each other, must be a principle of a
                    superior nature to them, and ought to direct their measures and govern their
                    proportions. But it was found that reason or reflection is such a principle,
                    which points out the tendency of our passions, weighs their influence upon
                    private and public happiness, and shows the best meansof attaining either. It
                    having been likewise found that there is another directing or controlling
                    principle, denominated <hi rend="italic">conscience</hi> or the <hi
                    rend="italic">moral sense,</hi> which, by a native kind of authority, judges of
                    affections and actions, pronouncing some just and good, and others unjust and
                    evil; it follows that the passions, which are mere impulse or blind forces, are
                    principles inferior and subordinate to this judging faculty. Therefore, if we
                    would follow the order of nature, that is, observe the mutual respects and the
                    subordination which the different parts of the human constitution bear one to
                    another, the passions ought to be subjected to the direction and authority of
                    the leading or controlling principles. We conclude, therefore, from this
                    induction, that the constitution or just economy of human nature consists in a
                    regular subordination of the passions and affections to the authority of
                    conscience and the direction of reason.</p>
                <p>That subordination is regular, when the proportion formerly mentioned is
                    maintained; that is to say, when the defensive passions are kept proportioned to
                    our dangers; when the private passions are proportioned to our wants; and when
                    the public affections are adapted to our public connections, and proportioned to
                    the wants and dangers of others.</p>
                <p>But the natural state, or the sound and vigorous constitution of any creature, or
                    the just economy of its powers, we consider its health and perfection; and the
                    acting agreeably to these, its virtue or goodness. Therefore, the health and
                    perfection of man must lie in the aforesaid supremacy of conscience and reason,
                    and in the subordination of the passions to their authority and direction; and
                    his virtue or goodness must consist in acting agreeably to that order or
                    economy. That such an ornament of the mind, and such a conduct of its powefs and
                    passions, will stand the test of reason, cannot admit of any dispute. For, upon
                    a fair examination into the consequences of things, or the relations and
                    aptitudes of means to ends, reason evidently demonstrates, and experience
                    confirms it, that, to have our defensive passions duly proportioned to our
                    dangers, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825202" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5202-0461"/>is
                    the surest way to avoid or get clear of them, and obtain the security we seek
                    after. To proportion our private passions to our wants is the best means to
                    supply them; and to adapt our public affections to our social relations and the
                    good of others, is the most effectual method of fulfilling the one and procuring
                    the other. In this sense, therefore, virtue may be said to be a conduct
                    conformable to reason, as reason discovers an apparent aptitude, in such an
                    order and economy of powers and passions, to answer the end for which they are
                    naturally formed.</p>
                <p>If the idea of moral obligation is to be deduced merely from this aptitude or
                    connection between certain passions, or a certain order and balance of passions,
                    and certain ends obtained or to be obtained by them, then is reason or
                    reflection, which perceives that aptitude or connection, the proper judge of
                    moral obligation; and on this supposition it may be defined, as has been done by
                    some, the connection between the affection and the end, or, which is the same
                    thing, between the action and the motive; for the end is the motive or the final
                    cause, and the affection is the action, or its immediate natural cause. A man,
                    from mere self-love, may be induced to fulfil that obligation which is founded
                    on the connection between the defensive passions and their ends, or that of the
                    private passions and their ends; because in that case his own interest will
                    prompt him to indulge them in the due proportion required. But if he has no
                    affections which point beyond himself, no principle but self-love, or some
                    subtile modification of it, what shall interest him in the happiness of others,
                    where there is no connection between it and his own? or what sense can he have
                    of moral obligation to promote it? Upon this scheme, therefore, without public
                    or social affection, there could be no motive, and consequently no moral
                    obligation, to a beneficent disinterested conduct.</p>
                <p>But if the mere connection between certain passions or a certain order of
                    passions, and certain ends, is what constitutes or gives us the idea of moral
                    obligation, then why may not the appositeness of any temper or conduct, nay, of
                    any piece of machinery, to obtain its end, form an equally strict moral
                    obligation? for the connection and aptitude are as strong and invariable in the
                    latter instances as in the former. But as this is confounding the most obvious
                    differences of things, we must trace the idea of moral obligation to another and
                    a more natural source.</p>
                <p>Let us appeal, therefore, to our inmost sense and experience, how we stand
                    affected to those different sets of passions, in the just measure and balance of
                    which we found a right temper to consist. For this is entirely a matter of
                    experience, in which we must examine, as in any other natural inquiry, what are
                    the genuine feelings and operations of nature, and what affections or symptoms
                    of them appear in the given instance.</p>
                <p>The defensive passions, as anger and fear, give us pain radier than pleasure, yet
                    we cannot help feeling them when provoked by injury, or exposed to harm. We
                    account the creature imperfect that wants them, because they are necessary to
                    his defence. Nay, we should in some measure condemn ourselves, did we want the
                    necessary degree of resentment and caution. But if our resentment exceeds the
                    wrong received, or our caution the evil dreaded, we then blame ourselves for
                    having overacted our part. Therefore, whilst we are in danger, to be totally
                    destitute of them we reckon a blameable defect, and to feel them in a just, that
                    is, necessary measure, we approve, as suited to the nature and the condition of
                    such a creature as man. But our security obtained, to continue to indulge them,
                    we not only disapprove as hurtful, but condemn as unmanly, unbecoming, and mean
                    spirited. Nor will such a conduct afford any self-approving joy when we coolly
                    reflect upon it.</p>
                <p>With regard to the private passions, such as love of life, pleasure, ease, and
                    the like, as these aim at private good, and are necessary to the perfection and
                    the happiness of the individual, we should reckon any creature defective, and
                    even blameable, that was destitute of them. Thus, we condemn the man who
                    imprudently ruins his fortune, impairs his health, or exposes his life; we not
                    only pity him as an unfortunate creature, but feel a kind of moral indignation
                    and contempt of him, for having made himself such. On the other hand, though a
                    discreet self-regard does not attract our esteem and veneration, yet we approve
                    of it in some degree, in a higher and different degree from what we would regard
                    a well-contrived machine, as necessary to constitute a finished creature, nay,
                    to complete the virtuous character, as exactly suited to our present indigent
                    state. There are some passions respecting private good, towards which we feel
                    higher degrees of approbation, as the love of knowledge, of action, of honour,
                    and the like. We esteem them as marks of an ingenuous mind; and cannot help
                    thinking the character in which they are wanting remarkably stupid, and in some
                    degree immoral.</p>
                <p>With regard to the social affections, as compassion, natural affection,
                    friendship, benevolence, and the like, we· approve, admire, and love them in
                    ourselves, and, in all in whom we discover them, with an esteem and approbation,
                    if not different in kind, yet surely far superior in degree, to that which we
                    feel towards the other passions. These we reckon necessary, just, and
                    excellently fitted to our structure and state; and the creature which wants them
                    we consider defective and ill constituted, a kind of abortion. But the public
                    affections we esteem self-worthy, as originally and eternally amiable.</p>
                <p>But amongst the social affections we make an obvious and constant distinction,
                    viz. between those particular passions which urge us with a sudden violence, and
                    uneasy kind of sensation, to pursue the good of their respective objects, as
                    pity, natural affection, and the like, and those calm dispassionate affections
                    and desires which prompt us more steadily and uniformly to promote the happiness
                    of others. The former we generally call passions, to distinguish them from the
                    other sort, which go more commonly by the name of affections or calm desires.
                    The one kind we approve, indeed, and delight in; but we feel still higher
                    degrees of approbation and moral complacence towards the other, and towards all
                    limitation of the particular instincts, by the principle of universal
                    benevolence. The more objects the calm affections take in, and the worthier
                    these objects are, their dignity rises in proportion, and with this our
                    approbation keeps an exact pace. A character, on the other hand, which is quite
                    divested of these public affections, and which feels no love for the species,
                    but instead of it entertains malice, rancour, and ill will, we reckon totally
                    immoral and unnatural.</p>
                <p>Such, then, are the sentiments and dispositions which we feel when these several
                    orders of affections pass before the mental eye. 'Therefore, that state in which
                    we feel ourselves moved, in the manner above described, towards those affections
                    and passions, as they come under the mind’s review, and in which we are,
                    instantaneously and independently of our choice or volition, prompted to a
                    correspondent conduct, we call a state of moral obligation. Let us suppose, for
                    instance, a parent, a friend, a benefactor, reduced to a condition of the utmost
                    indigence and distress, and that it is in our power to give them immediate
                    relief. To what conduct are we obliged? what duty does nature dictate and
                    require in such a case? Attend to nature, and nature will tell, with a voice
                    irresistibly audible and commanding to the human heart, with an authority which
                    no man can silence without being self-condemned, and which no man can elude
                    except at his peril, that immediate relief ought to be given. Again, let a
                    friend, a neighbour, or even a stranger, have lodged a deposit in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193825215" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5215-0462"/>our hands, and after some
                    time reclaim it; no sooner do these ideas of the confidence reposed in us, and
                    of property not transferred, but deposited, occur, than we immediately and
                    unavoidably feel and recognise the obligation to restore it. In both these cases
                    we should condemn and even loathe ourselves if we acted otherwise, as having
                    done, or omitted doing, what we ought not, as having acted beneath the dignity
                    of our nature, and contrary to our most intimate sense of right and wrong; we
                    should accuse ourselves as guilty of ingratitude, injustice, and inhumanity, and
                    be conscious of deserving the censure, and therefore dread the resentment, of
                    all rational beings. But in complying with the obligation, we feel joy and
                    self-approbation, are conscious of an inviolable harmony between our nature and
                    duty, and think ourselves entitled to the applause of every impartial spectator
                    of our conduct.</p>
                <p>To describe, therefore, what we cannot perhaps define, a state of moral
                    obligation is that state in which a creature, endued with such senses, powers,
                    and affections as man, would condemn himself, and think he deserved the
                    condemnation of all others, should he refuse to fulfil it; but would approve
                    himself, and expect the approbation of all others, upon complying with it.</p>
                <p>And we call him a <hi rend="italic">moral agent</hi> who is in such a state, or
                    who is subject to moral obligation. Therefore, as man’s structure and
                    connections often subject him to such a state of moral obligation, we conclude
                    that he is a moral agent. But as man may sometimes act without knowing what he
                    does, as in cases of frenzy or disease, or in many natural functions; or,
                    knowing what he does, he may act without choice or affection, as in cases of
                    necessity or compulsion; therefore, to denominate an action moral, namely,
                    approveable or blameable, it must be done knowingly and willingly, or from
                    affection and choice. A morally good action, then, consists in fulfilling a
                    moral obligation knowingly and willingly; and a morally bad action, or an
                    immoral action, is to violate a moral obligation knowingly and willingly. . . .
                    . í</p>
                <p>As not an action, but a series of actions, constitute a character; as not an
                    affection, but a series of affections, constitute a temper; and as we denominate
                    things by the gross, <hi rend="italic">a fortiori,</hi> or by the qualities
                    which chiefly prevail in them; therefore we call that a morally good character
                    in which a series of morally good actions prevail, and that a morally good
                    temper in which a series of morally good affections have the ascendant. A bad
                    character and bad temper are the reverse. But where the above-mentioned order or
                    proportion of passions is maintained, there a series of morally good affections
                    and actions will prevail. Therefore, to maintain that order and proportion, is
                    to have a morally good temper and character. But a morally good temper and
                    character is moral rectitude, integrity, virtue, or the completion of duty.</p>
                <p>If it be asked, after all, how we come by the idea of moral obligation or duty,
                    we may answer, that we come by it in the same way as by our other original and
                    primary perceptions. We receive them all from nature, or the great Author of
                    nature. For this idea of moral obligation is not a creature of the mind, nor
                    dependent on any previous act of volition, but arises on certain occasions, or
                    when certain other ideas are presented to the mind, as necessarily,
                    instantaneously, and unavoidably, as pain does upon too near approach to the
                    fire, or pleasure from the fruition of any good. It does not, for instance,
                    depend upon our choice whether we shall feel the obligation to succour a
                    distressed parent, or to restore a deposit intrusted to us when it is recalled.
                    We cannot denominate this a compound idea, made up of one ormore simple ideas.
                    We may, indeed, nay we must, have some ideas antecedent to it, as, for instance,
                    that of a parent in distress, of a child able to relieve, of the relation of the
                    one to the other, of a trust, of right, and the like. But none of these ideas
                    constitute the perception of obligation. This is an idea quite distinct from,
                    and something supperadded to, the ideas of the correlatives, or the relation
                    subsisting between them. These, indeed, by a law of our nature, are the occasion
                    of suggesting it; but they are as totally different from it as colours are from
                    sounds. By sense of reflection we perceive the correlatives; our memory recalls
                    the favoursor deposit which we received; the various circumstances of the case
                    are matters of fact or experience; but some delicate inward organ or power, or
                    call it what we please, does, by certain instantaneous sympathy, antecedent to
                    the cool deductions of reason, and independently of previous instruction or
                    volition, perceive the moral harmony, the living, irresistible charms, of moral
                    obligation, which immediately interests the correspondent passions, and prompts
                    us to fulfil its lawful dictates.</p>
                <p>We need not apprehend any danger from the quickness of its decisions, nor be
                    frightened because it looks like instinct, and has been called so. Would we
                    approve one for deliberating long, or reasoning the matter much at leisure,
                    whether he should relieve a distressed parent, feed a starving neighbour, or
                    restore the trust committed to him? should we not suspect the reasoner of
                    knavery, or of very weak affections towards virtue? We employ reason, and
                    worthily employ it, in examining the condition, relations, and other
                    circumstances of the agent or patient, or of those with whom either of them is
                    connected, that is, in other words, the state of the case; and in complicated
                    cases, where the circumstances are many, it may require no small attention to
                    find the true state of the case; but when the relations of the agent or patient,
                    and the circumstances of the action, are obvious, or come out such after a fair
                    trial, we should scarcely approve him who demurs on the obligation to that
                    conduct which the case suggests.</p>
                <p>From what has been said, it is evident that it is not the pleasure or agreeable
                    sensations which accompany the exercise of the several affections, nor those
                    consequent on the actions, that constitute moral obligation, or excite in us the
                    idea of it. That pleasure is posterior to the idea of obligation; and we are
                    frequently obliged, and acknowledge ourselves under an obligation, to such
                    affections and actions as. are attended with pain; as in the trials of virtue,
                    where we are obliged to sacrifice private to public good, or a present pleasure
                    to a future interest. We have pleasure in serving an aged parent, but it is
                    neither the perception nor prospect of that pleasure which gives us the idea of
                    obligation to that conduct.</p>
                <p>CHAP. III. THE FINAL CAUSES OF OUR MORAL FACULTIES OF PERCEPTION AND
                    AFFECTION.</p>
                <p>We have now taken a general prospect of <hi rend="italic">man,</hi> and of his
                    moral powers and connections, and on these erected a scheme of duty or moral
                    obligation, which seems to be confirmed by experience, consonant to reason, and
                    approved by his most inward and most sacred senses. It may be proper, in the
                    next place, to take a more particular view of the final causes of those delicate
                    springs by which he is impelled to action, and of those clogs by which he is
                    restrained from it. By this detail we shall be able to judge of their aptitude
                    to answer their end, in a creature endowed with his capacities, subject to his
                    wants, exposed to his dangers, and susceptible of his enjoyments; and from
                    thence we shall be in a condition to pronounce concerning the end of his whole
                    structure, its harmony with its state, and consequently its subserviency to
                    answer the great and benevolent intentions of its Author.</p>
                <p>The Supreme Being has seen fit to blend in the whole <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193825228" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5228-0463"/>of things a prodigious
                    variety of discordant and contrary principles, light and darkness, pleasure and
                    pain, good and evil. There are multifarious natures, higher and lower, and many
                    intermediate ones between the widely-distant extremes. These are differently
                    situated, variously adjusted, and subjected to each other, and all of them
                    subordinate to the order and perfection of the whole. We may suppose man placed
                    as in a centre amidst those innumerable orders of beings, by his outward frame
                    drawing to the material system, and by his inward connected with the
                    intellectual or moral, and <hi rend="italic">of</hi> course affected by the laws
                    which govern both, or affected by that good and that ill which result from those
                    laws. In this infinite variety of relations with which he is surrounded, and of
                    contingencies to which he is liable, he feels strong attractions to the good,
                    and violent repulsions or aversions to the ill. But as good and ill are often
                    blended, and wonderfully complicated one with the other; as they sometimes
                    immediately produce and run up into each other, and at other times lie at great
                    distances, yet by means of intervening links introduce one another; and as these
                    effects are often brought about in consequence of hidden relations and general
                    laws, of the energy of which he is an incompetent judge; it is easy for him to
                    mistake good for evil, and evil for good, and consequently he may be frequently
                    attracted by such things as are destructive, or repel such as are salutary.
                    Thus, by the tender and complicated frame of his body, he is subjected to a
                    great variety of ills, to sickness, cold, heat, fatigue, and innumerable wants.
                    Yet his knowledge is so narrow withal, and his reason so weak, that in many
                    cases he cannot judge, in the way of investigation or reasoning, of the
                    connections of those effects with their respective causes, or of the various
                    latent energies of natural things, ∏e is therefore informed of this connection
                    by the experience of certain senses or organs of perception, which, by a
                    mechanical instantaneous motion, feel the good and the ill, receiving pleasure
                    from the one and pain from the other. By these, without any reasoning, he is
                    taught to attract or choose what tends to his welfare, and to repel and avoid
                    what tends to his ruin. Thus, by his senses of taste and smell, or by the
                    pleasure he receives from certain kinds of food, he is admonished which kind
                    agrees with his constitution; and by an opposite sense of pain he is informed
                    which sort disagrees, or is destructive of it; but he is not by means of this
                    instructed in the inward nature and constitution of things.</p>
                <p>. Some of those senses are armed with strong degrees of uneasiness or pain, in
                    order to urge him to seek after such objects as are suited to them; and these
                    respect his more immediate and pressing wants, as the sense of hunger, thirst,
                    cold, and the like; which, by their painful importunities, compel him to provide
                    food, drink, raiment, shelter. Those instincts by which we are thus prompted
                    with some kind of commotion or violence to attract and pursue good, or to repel
                    and avoid evil, we call appetites and passions. By our senses, then, we are
                    informed of what is good or ill to the private system, or the individual; and by
                    our private appetites and passions we are impelled to the one, and restrained
                    from the other.</p>
                <p>In consequence of this machinery, and the great train of wants to which our
                    nature subjects us, we are engaged in a continued series of occupations, which
                    often require much application of thought, or great bodily labour, or both. The
                    necessaries of life, food, clothes, shelter, and the like, must be provided;
                    conveniences must be acquired to render life still more easy and comfortable. In
                    order to obtain these, arts, industry, manufactures, and trade are necessary;
                    and to secure to us the peaceable enjoyment of their fruits, civil government,
                    policy, and laws must be contrived, and the various business of public life
                    carried on. Thus, whilst man is concerned and busied in making provision or
                    obtaining security for himself, he· is by degrees engaged in connections with a
                    family, friends, neighbours, a community, or a commonwealth. Hence arise new
                    wants, new interests, new cares, and new employments. The passions of one man
                    interfere with those of another; interests are opposed; competitions arise,
                    contrary courses are taken; disappointments happen, distinctions are made, and
                    parties formed. This opens a vast scene of distraction and embarrassment, and
                    introduces a mighty train of good and ill, both public and private. Yet, amidst
                    all this confusion and hurry, plans of action must be laid, consequences
                    foreseen or guarded against, inconveniences provided for; and frequently
                    particular resolutions must be taken, and schemes executed, without reasoning or
                    delay. Now what provision has the Author of our nature made for this necessitous
                    condition? how has he fitted the actor, man, for playing his part in this
                    perplexed and busy scene? Our Supreme Parent, watchful of the whole, has not
                    left himself without a witness here neither, and has made nothing imperfect, but
                    all things are double one against the other. He has not left man to be informed
                    only by the cold notices of reason, of the good or evil, the happiness or
                    misery, of his fellow-creatures. He has made him sensible of their good and
                    happiness, but especially of their ill and misery, by an immediate sympathy, or
                    quick feeling of pleasure and of pain.</p>
                <p>The latter we denominate <hi rend="italic">pity</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >compassion.</hi> For the: former, though every one who is not quite divested of
                    humanity feels it in some degree, we have not got a name, unless we call it <hi
                    rend="italic">congratulation</hi> or joyful <hi rend="italic">sympathy,</hi> or
                    that good humour which arises on seeing others pleased or happy. Both these
                    feelings have been called in general the public or common sense, <hi
                    rend="italic">κοινη</hi><hi rend="italic">μνημοσύνη,</hi> by which we feel for
                    others, and are interested in their concerns as really as, though perhaps less
                    sensibly than, in our own.</p>
                <p>When we see our fellow-creatures unhappy through the fault or injury of others,
                    we feel resentment or indignation against those who have unjustly caused that
                    misery. If we are conscious that it has happened through our fault or injurious
                    conduct, we feel shame; and both these classes of senses and passions, regarding
                    misery and wrong, are armed with such sharp sensations of pain, as not only
                    prove a powerful guard and security to the species, or public system, against
                    those evils it may, but serve also to lessen or remove those evils it does,
                    suffer. Compassion draws us out of ourselves to bear a part of the misfortunes
                    of others, powerfully solicits us in their favour, melts us at the sight of
                    their distress, and makes us in some degree unhappy till they are relieved from
                    it. It is peculiarly well adapted to the condition of human life, because it is
                    much more and oftener in our power to do mischief than good, and to prevent or
                    lessen misery than to communicate positive happiness; and therefore it is an
                    admirable restraint upon the more selfish passions, or those violent impulses
                    which carry us to the hurt of others.</p>
                <p>There are other particular instincts or passions which interest us in the
                    concerns of others, even whilst we are most busy about our own, and which are
                    strongly attractive of good, and repulsive of evil to them. Such are natural
                    affection, friendship, love, gratitude, desire of fame, love of society, of
                    one’s country, and others that might be named. Now as the private appetites and
                    passions were found to be armed with strong sensations of desire and uneasiness,
                    to prompt man the more effectually to sustain labours, and to encounter dangers
                    in pursuit of those goods which are necessary to the preservation and welfare of
                    the individual, and to avoid those evils which tend to his destruction; in like
                    manner, it was necessary that this other class of desires and affections should
                    be prompted with as quick sensations of pain, not only to counteract the
                    strength of their antagonists, but to engage us in a virtuous activity<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193825241" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5241-0464"/> for our
                    relations, families, friends, neighbours, country. Indeed our sense of right and
                    wrong will admonish us that it is our duty, and reason and experience further
                    assure us that it is both our interest and best security, to promote the
                    happiness of others; but that sense, that reason, and that experience, would
                    frequently prove very weak and ineffectual prompters to such a conduct,
                    especially in cases of danger and hardship, and amidst all the importunities of
                    nature, and that constant hurry in which the private £ assions involve us,
                    without the aid of those particular ind affections which mark out to us
                    particular spheres of duty, and engage and fix us down to them as it were with
                    an agreeable violence.</p>
                <p>It is evident, therefore, that those two classes of affection, the private and
                    public, are set one against the other, and designed to control and limit each
                    other’s influence, and thereby to produce a just balance in the whole.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Vide Hutcheson’s Conduct of
                    the Passions, treat, i. sect. 2.</p></note> In general, the violent sensations
                    of pain and uneasiness which accompany hunger, thirst, and the other private
                    appetites, or too great fatigue of mind as well as of body, prevent the
                    individual from running to great excesses in the exercise of the higher
                    functions of the mind, as too intense thought in the search of truth, violent
                    application to business of any kind, and different degrees of romantic heroism.
                    On the other hand, the finer senses of perception, and those generous desires
                    and affections which are connected with them, the love of action, of imitation,
                    of truth, honour, public virtue, and the like, are wisely placed in the Opposite
                    scale, in order to prevent us from sinking into the dregs of the animal life,
                    and debasing the dignity of man below the condition of brutes. So that, by the
                    mutual reaction of those opposite powers, the bad effects are prevented that
                    would naturally result from their acting singly and apart, and the good effects
                    are produced which each are severally formed to produce.</p>
                <p>The same wholesome opposition appears likewise in the particular counter-workings
                    of the private and public affections one against the other. Thus compassion is
                    adapted to counterpoise the love of ease, of pleasure, and of life, and to
                    disarm or to set bounds to resentment; and resentment of injury done to
                    ourselves, or to our friends who are dearer than ourselves, prevents an
                    effeminate compassion or consternation, and gives us a noble contempt of labour,
                    pain, and death. Natural affection, friendship, love of one’s country, nay zeal
                    for any particular virtue, are frequently more than a match for the whole train
                    of selfish passions. On the other hand, without that intimate overruling passion
                    of self-love, and those private desires which are connected with it, the social
                    and the tender instincts of the human heart would degenerate into the wildest
                    dotage, the most torturing anxiety, and downright frenzy.</p>
                <p>But not only are the different orders or classes of affection checks upon one
                    another, but passions of the same classes are mutual clogs. Thus, how many are
                    withheld from the violent outrages of resentment by fear; and how easily is fear
                    controlled in its turn, whilst mighty wrongs awaken a mighty resentment. The
                    private passions often interfere, and therefore moderate the violence of each
                    other; and a calm self-love is placed at their head, to direct, to influence,
                    and to control their particular attractions and repulsions. The public
                    affections likewise restrain one another; and all of them are put under the
                    control of a calm dispassionate benevolence, which ought in like manner to
                    direct and limit their particular motions. Thus most part, if not all the
                    passions, have a twofold aspect, and serve a twofold end. In one view they may
                    be considered as powers, impelling mankind to a certain course, with a force
                    proportioned to the apprehended amount of the good they aim at. In another view
                    they appear as weights, balancing the action of the powers, and controlling the
                    violence of their impulses. By means of these powers and weights a natural
                    equipoise is settled in the human breast by its all-wise Author, by which the
                    creature is kept tolerably steady and regular in his course, amidst that variety
                    of stages through which he must pass.</p>
                <p>But this is not all the provision which God has made for the hurry and perplexity
                    of the scene in which man is destined to act. Amidst those infinite attractions
                    and repulsions towards private and public good and evil, mankind either cannot
                    often foresee the consequences or tendencies of all their actions towards one or
                    other of these, especially where those tendencies are intricate and point
                    different ways, or those consequences remote and complicated; or, though, by
                    careful and cool inquiry, and a due improvement of their rational powers, they
                    might find them out, yet, distracted as they are with business, amused with
                    trifles, dissipated by pleasure, and disturbed by passion, they neither have
                    found nor can find any leisure to attend to those consequences, or to examine
                    how far this or that conduct is productive of private or public good on the
                    whole. Therefore, were it left entirely to the slow and sober deductions of
                    reason to trace those tendencies, and make out those consequences, it is
                    evident, that in many particular instances the business of life must stand
                    still, and many important occasions of action be lost, or perhaps the grossest
                    blunders be committed. On this account, the Deity, besides that general
                    approbation which we bestow on every degree of kind affection, has moreover
                    implanted in man many particular perceptions or determinations to approve of
                    certain qualities or actions, which, in effect, tend to the advantage of
                    society, and are connected with private good, though he does not always see that
                    tendency, nor mind that connection. And these perceptions or determinations do,
                    without reasoning, point out, and, antecedent to views of interest, prompt to a
                    conduct beneficial to the public, and useful to the private system. Such is that
                    sense of candour and veracity, that abhorrence of fraud and falsehood, that
                    sense of fidelityjustice, gratitude, greatness of mind, fortitude, clemency,
                    decorum, and that disapprobation of knavery, injustice, ingratitude, meanness of
                    spirit, cowardice, cruelty, and indecorum, which are natural to the human mind.
                    The former of those dispositions, and the actions flowing from them, are
                    approved, and those of the latter kind disapproved, by us, even abstracted from
                    the view of their tendency or conduciveness to the happiness or misery of others
                    or of ourselves. In one we discern a beauty, a superior excellency, a congruity
                    to the dignity of man; in the other a deformity, a littleness, a debasement, of
                    human nature.</p>
                <p>There are other principles also connected with the good of society, or the
                    happiness and perfection of the individual, though that connection is not
                    immediately apparent, which we behold with real complacency and approbation,
                    though perhaps inferior in degree, if not in kind, such as gravity, modesty,
                    simplicity of deportment, temperance, prudent economy; and we feel some degree
                    of contempt and dislike where they are wanting, or where the opposite qualities
                    prevail. These and the like perceptions or feelings are either different
                    modifications of the moral sense, or subordinate to it, and plainly serve the
                    same important purpose, being, in the several emergencies of a various and
                    distracted life, expeditious monitors of what is right, what is wrong, what is
                    to be pursued, and what avoided; and, by the pleasant or painful consequences
                    which attend them, exerting their influence as powerful prompters to a suitable
                    conduct.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825254" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5254-0465"/>
                <p>From a slight inspection of the above-named principles, it is evident that they
                    all carry a friendly aspect to society and the individual, and have a more
                    immediate or a more remote tendency to promote the perfection or good of both.
                    This tendency cannot be always foreseen, and would be often mistaken or seldom
                    attended to by a weak, busy, short-sighted creature like man, both rash and
                    variable in his opinions, a dupe to his own passions or to the designs of
                    others, and liable to sickness, to want, and to error. Principles, therefore,
                    which are so nearly linked with private security and public good, by directing
                    him, without operose reasoning, where to find the one, and how to promote the
                    other, and by prompting him to a conduct conducive to both, are admirably
                    adapted to the exigencies of his present state, and wisely calculated to obtain
                    the ends of universal benevolence.</p>
                <p>It were easy, by considering the subject in another light, to show, in a curious
                    detail of particulars, how wonderfully the inner part of man, or that
                    astonishing train of moral powers and affections with which he is endowed, is
                    fitted to the several stages of that progressive and probationary state through
                    which he is destined to pass. As our faculties are narrow and limited, and rise
                    from very small and imperfect beginnings, they must be improved by exercise, by
                    attention, and by repeated trials. And this holds true, not only of our
                    intellectual, but also of our moral and active powers. The former are liable to
                    errors in speculation, the latter to blunders in practice, and both often
                    terminate in misfortunes and pains; and those errors and blunders are generally
                    owing to our passions, or to our too forward and warm admiration of those
                    partial goods they naturally pursue, or to our fear of those partial evils they
                    naturally repel. Those misfortunes, therefore, lead us back to consider where
                    our misconduct lay, and whence our errors flowed; and consequently they are
                    salutary pieces of trial, which tend to enlarge our views, to correct and refine
                    our passions, and consequently to improve both our intellectual and moral
                    powers. Our passions, then, are the rude materials of our virtue, which Heaven
                    has given us to work up, and to refine and polish into a harmonious and divine
                    piece of workmanship. They furnish out the whole machinery, the calms and
                    storms, the lights and shadows, of human life. They show mankind in every
                    attitude and variety of character, and give to virtue both its struggles and its
                    triumphs. To conduct them well in every state, is merit; to abuse or misapply
                    them, is demerit.</p>
                <p>The different sets of senses, powers, and passions, which unfold themselves in
                    these successive stages, are both necessary and adapted to that rising and
                    progressive state. Enlarging views and growing connections require new passions
                    and new habits; and thus the mind, by these continually expanding and finding a
                    progressive exercise, rises to higher improvements, and pushes forward towards
                    maturity and perfection.</p>
                <p>In this beautiful economy and harmony of our structure, both outward and inward,
                    with that state, we may at once discern the great lines of our duty traced out
                    in the fairest and brightest characters, and contemplate with admiration a more
                    august and marvellous scene of divine wisdom and goodness laid in the human
                    breast, than we shall perhaps find in the whole compass of nature.</p>
                <p>From this detail, then, it appears that man, by his original frame, is made for a
                    temperate, compassionate, benevolent, active, and progressive state. He is
                    strongly attractive of the good and repulsive of the evils which befall others
                    as well as himself. He feels the highest approbation and moral complacence in
                    those affections, and in those actions, which immediately and directly respect
                    the good of others, and the highest disapprobation and abhorrence of the
                    contrary. Besides these, he has many particular perceptions or instincts of
                    approbation, which, though perhaps not of the same kind with the others, yet are
                    accompanied with correspondent degrees of affection, proportioned to their
                    respective tendencies to the public good. Therefore, by acting agreeably to
                    these principles, man acts agreeably to his structure, and fulfils the
                    benevolent intentions of its Author. But we call a thing good when it answers
                    its end, and a creature good when he acts in a conformity to his constitution;
                    consequently man must be denominated good or virtuous when he acts suitably to
                    the principles and destination of his nature.</p>
                <p>PART II.</p>
                <p>CHAP. I.—THE PRINCIPAL DISTINCTIONS OF DUTY OR VIRTUE.</p>
                <p>We have now considered the constitution and the connections of man, and upon
                    these erected a general system of duty or moral obligation, consonant to reason,
                    approved by his most sacred and intimate sense, suitable to his mixed condition,
                    and confirmed by the experience of mankind. We have also traced the final causes
                    of his moral faculties and affections to those noble purposes they serve, with
                    regard both to the private and the public system. From this induction it is
                    evident, that there is one order or class of duties which man owes to himself;
                    another to society; and a third to God.</p>
                <p>The duties he owes to himself are founded chiefly upon the defensive and private
                    passions, which prompt him to pursue whatever tends to private good or
                    happiness, and to avoid or ward off whatever tends to private evil or misery.
                    Amongst the various goods which allure and solicit him, and the various evils
                    which attack or threaten him, to be intelligent and accurate in selecting the
                    one and rejecting the other, or in preferring the most excellent goods, and
                    avoiding the most terrible evils, when there is a competition amongst either,
                    and to be discreet in using the best means to attain the goods and to avoid the
                    evils, is what we call <hi rend="italic">prudence.</hi> This, in our inward
                    frame, corresponds to sagacity, or quickness of sense, in our outward. To
                    proportion our defensive passions to our dangers, we call <hi rend="italic"
                    >fortitude;</hi> which always implies a just mixture of calm resentment or
                    animosity, and well-governed caution; and this firmness of mind answers to the
                    strength and muscular energy of the body. And duly to adjust our private
                    passions to our wants, or to the respective importance of the good we affect or
                    pursue, we call <hi rend="italic">temperance</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> which
                    does therefore always imply, in this large sense of the word, a just balance or
                    command of the passions.</p>
                <p>The second class of duties arises from the public or social affections, the just
                    harmony or proportion of which to the dangers and wants of others, and to the
                    several relations we bear, commonly goes by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >justice.</hi> This includes the whole of our duty to society, to our parents,
                    and to the general polity of nature, particularly gratitude, friendship,
                    sincerity, natural affection, benevolence, and the other social virtues; which
                    being the noblest temper and fairest complexion of the soul, corresponds to the
                    beauty and fine proportion of the person. The virtues comprehended under the
                    former class, especially prudence and fortitude, may likewise be transferred to
                    this; and, according to the various circumstances in which the are placed, and
                    the more confined or more extensive sphere in which they operate, may be
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">private, economical,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >civil prudence, fortitude,</hi> &amp;c. These direct our <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193825267" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5267-0466"/>conduct with regard to the
                    wants and dangers of those lesser or greater circles with which they are
                    connected.</p>
                <p>The third class of duties respects the Deity, and arises from the public
                    affections, and the several glorious relations which he sustains to us as our
                    Creator, Benefactor, Lawgiver, Judge, &amp;c. We choose to consider this set of
                    duties in the last place; because, though prior in dignity and excellency, they
                    seem to be last in order of time, it being the most simple and easy method to
                    follow the gradual progress of nature, as it takes its rise from individuals,
                    and spreads through the social system, and still ascends upwards, until at
                    length it stretches to its almighty Parent and Head, and so terminates in those
                    duties which are highest and best.</p>
                <p>. The duties resulting from these relations are, reverence, gratitude, love,
                    resignation, dependence, obedience, worship, praise; which, according to the
                    model of our fine capacities, must maintain some sort of proportion to the
                    grandeur and perfection of the object whom we venerate, love, and obey. This
                    proportion or harmony is expressed by the general name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >piety</hi> or <hi rend="italic">devotion,</hi> which is always stronger or
                    weaker, according to the greater or less apprehended excellency of its object.
                    This sublime principle of virtue is the enlivening soul which animates the moral
                    system, and that cement which binds and sustains the other duties which man owes
                    to himself or to society.</p>
                <p>This, then, is the general temper and constitution of virtue, and these are the
                    principal lines or divisions of duty. To those good dispositions which respect
                    the several objects of our duty, and to all actions which flow from such
                    dispositions, the mind gives its sanction or testimony; and this sanction or
                    judgment concerning the moral quality, or the goodness of actions or
                    dispositions, moralists call <hi rend="italic">conscience.</hi> When it judges
                    of an action which is to be performed, it is called an antecedent conscience;
                    and when it passes sentence on an action which is performed, it is called a
                    subsequent conscience. The tendency of an action to produce happiness, or its
                    external conformity to a law, is termed its material goodness; but the good
                    dispositions from which an action proceeds, or its conformity to law in every
                    respect, constitutes its formal goodness.</p>
                <p>When the mind is ignorant or uncertain about the character of an action, or its
                    tendency to private or public good; or when there are several circumstances in
                    the case, some of which, being doubtful, render the mind dubious concerning the
                    morality of the action, that is called a doubtful or scrupulous conscience; if
                    it mistakes concerning these, it is called an erroneous conscience. If the error
                    or ignorance be involuntary or invincible, the action proceeding from that
                    error, or from that ignorance, is reckoned innocent, or not imputable. If the
                    error or ignorance be supine or affected, that is, the effect of negligence, or
                    of affectation and wilful inadvertence, the conduct flowing from such error, or
                    such ignorance, is criminal and imputable. Not to follow one’s conscience,
                    though erroneous and ill informed, is criminal, as it is the guide of life; and
                    to counteract it, shows a depraved and incorrigible spirit. Yet to follow an
                    erroneous conscience is likewise criminal, if that error which misled the
                    conscience was the effect of inattention, or any criminal passion.<note

                <p>If it be asked, how an erroneous conscience shall be rectified, since it is
                    supposed to be the only guide of life, and judge of morals; we answer, in the
                    very same way that we would rectify reason if at anv time it should judge wrong,
                    as it often does, viz. by giving it proper and sufficient materials for judging
                    right, that is, by inquiring into the whole state of the case, the relations,
                    connections, and several obligations of the actor, the consequences and other
                    circumstances of the action, or the surplusage of private or public good which
                    results, or is likely to result, from the action, or from the omission of it. If
                    those circumstances, are fairly and fully stated, the conscience will be just
                    and impartial in its decision; for, by a necessary law of our nature, it
                    approves and is well affected towards the moral form; and if it seems to approve
                    of vice or immorality, it is always under the notion or mask of some virtue.” So
                    that, strictly speaking, it is not conscience which errs; for its sentence is
                    always conformable to the view of the case which lies before it, and is just,
                    upon the supposition that the case is truly such as it is represented to be. All
                    the fault is to be imputed to the agent, who neglects to be better informed, or
                    who, through weakness or wickedness, hastens to pass sentence from imperfect
                    evidence.</p>

                    GOOD, AND THE CHIEF GOOD.</p>
                <p>Every creature, by the constitution of his nature, is determined to love himself;
                    to pursue whatever tends to his preservation and happiness, and to avoid
                    whatever tends to his hurt and misery. Being endowed with sense and perception,
                    he must necessarily receive pleasure from some objects, and pain from others.
                    Those objects which give pleasure are called good; and those which give pain,
                    evil. To the former he feels that attraction or motion which we call <hi
                    rend="italic">desire</hi> or <hi rend="italic">love</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    to the latter, that impulse which we call <hi rend="italic">aversion</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">hatred.</hi> To objects which suggest neither pleasure nor pain,
                    and are conceived to be of no use to procure the one or ward off the other, we
                    feel neither desire noraver-sion; and such objects are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >indifferent.</hi> Those objects which do not of themselves produce pleasure or
                    pain, but are the means of procuring either, we call <hi rend="italic"
                    >useful</hi> or <hi rend="italic">noxious.</hi> Towards them we are affected in
                    a subordinate manner, or with an indirect and reflective rather than a direct
                    and immediate affection. All the original and particular affections of our
                    nature lead us out to and ultimately rest in the first kind of objects, viz.
                    those which give immediate pleasure, and which we therefore consider as directly
                    good. The calm affection of self-love alone is conversant about such objects as
                    are only consequentially good, or merely useful to ourselves.</p>
                <p>But, besides those sorts of objects which we call <hi rend="italic">good;</hi>
                    merely and solely as they give pleasure, or are the means of procuring it, there
                    is a higher and nobler species of good, towards which we feel that peculiar
                    movement we call <hi rend="italic">approbation</hi> or <hi rend="italic">moral
                    complacency</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and which we therefore denominate <hi
                    rend="italic">moral good.</hi> Such are our affections, and the actions
                    consequent on them. The perception of this is, as has been already observed,
                    quite distinct in kind from the perception of other species; and though it may
                    be connected with pleasure or advantage by the benevolent constitution of
                    nature, yet it constitutes a good independent of that pleasure and that
                    advantage, and far superior, not only in degree, but in dignity, to both. The
                    other, viz. the <hi rend="italic">natural good,</hi> consists in obtaining those
                    pleasures which are adapted to the peculiar senses and passions susceptible of
                    them, and is as various as are those senses and passions. This moral good
                    consists in the right conduct of the several senses and passions, or their just
                    proportion and accommodation to their respective objects and relations, and is
                    of a more simple and invariable kind.</p>
                <p>By our several senses we are capable of a great variety of pleasing sensations.
                    These constitute distinct ends or objects ultimately pursuable for their own
                    sake. To these ends, or ultimate objects, correspond peculiar appetites or <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193825280" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5280-0467"/> affections, which
                    prompt the mind to pursue them. When these ends are attained, there it rests,
                    and looks no farther. Whatever therefore is pursuable, not on its own account,
                    but as subservient or necessary to the attainment of something else which is
                    intrinsically valuable for its own sake, be that value ever so great or ever so
                    small, we call a <hi rend="italic">mean,</hi> and not an <hi rend="italic"
                    >end</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">so</hi> that ends and means
                    constitute the materials or the very essence <hi rend="italic">of our</hi>
                    happiness. Consequently happiness, that is, human happiness, cannot be one
                    simple uniform thing in creatures constituted as we are, with such various
                    senses of pleasure, and such different capacities of enjoyment. Now the same
                    principle or law of our nature which determines us to pursue any one end or
                    species of good, prompts us to pursue every other end or species of good of
                    which we are susceptible, or to which our Maker has adapted an original
                    propensity. But, amidst the great multiplicity of ends or goods which form the
                    various ingredients of our happiness, we perceive an evident gradation, or
                    subordination suited to that gradation, of senses, powers, and passions, which
                    prevails in our mixed and various constitution, and to that ascending series of
                    connections which open upon us in the different stages of our progressive
                    state.</p>
                <p>Thus the goods of the body, or of the external senses, seem to hold the lowest
                    rank in this gradation or scale of goods. These we have in common with the
                    brutes; and though many men are grovelling enough to pursue the goods of the
                    body with a more than brutal fury, yet, when at any time they come in
                    competition with goods of an higher order, the unanimous verdict of mankind, by
                    giving the last the preference, condemns the first to the meanest place. Goods
                    consisting in exterior social connections, as fame, fortune, power, civil
                    authority, seem to succeed next, and are chiefly valuable as the means of
                    procuring natural or moral good, but principally the latter. Goods of the
                    intellect are still superior, as taste, knowledge, memory, judgment, and so
                    forth. The highest are moral goods of the mind, directly and ultimately
                    regarding ourselves, as command of the appetites and passions, prudence,
                    fortitude, benevolence, and the like. These are the great objects of our
                    pursuit, and the principal ingredients of our happiness. Let us consider each of
                    them as they rise one above the other in this natural series or scale, and then
                    touch briefly upon our obligations to pursue them.</p>
                <p>Those of the body are health, strength, agility, hardiness, and patience of
                    change, neatness, and decency.</p>
                <p>Good health, and a regular easy flow of spirits, arc in themselves sweet natural
                    enjoyments, a great fund of pleasure, and indeed the proper seasoning which
                    gives a flavour and poignancy to every other pleasure. The want of health unfits
                    us for most duties of life, and is especially an enemy to the social and humane
                    affections, as it generally renders the unhappy sufferer peevish and sullen,
                    disgusted with the allotments of Providence, and consequently apt to entertain
                    suspicious and gloomy sentiments of its author. It obstructs the free exercise
                    and full improvement of our reason, and makes us a burden to our friends, and
                    useless to society; whereas the uninterrupted enjoyment of good health is a
                    constant source of good humour, and good humour is a great friend to openness
                    and benignity of heart; enabling us to encounter the various evils and
                    disappointments of life with more courage, or to sustain them with more
                    patience, and conducing much, if we are otherwise duly qualified, to our acting
                    our part in every exigency of life with more firmness, consistency, and dignity.
                    It therefore imports us much to preserve and improve a habit or enjoyment,
                    without which every other external entertainment is tasteless, and most other
                    advantages of little avail; and this is best done by a strict temperance in diet
                    and regimen, by regular exercise, and by keeping the mind serene and unruffled
                    by violent passions, and unsubdued by intense and constant labours, which
                    greatly impair and gradually destroy the strongest constitutions.</p>
                <p>Strength, agility, hardiness, and patience of change, suppose health, and are
                    unattainable without it; but they imply something more, and are necessary to
                    guard it, to give us the perfect use of our lives and limbs, and to secure us
                    against many otherwise unavoidable evils. The exercise of the necessary manual,
                    and of most of the elegant arts of life, depends on strength and agility of
                    body; personal dangers, private and public dangers, the demands of our friends,
                    our families, and country, require them; they are necessary in war, and
                    ornamental in peace; fit for the employment of a country and a town life, and
                    they exalt the entertainments and diversions of both. They are chiefly obtained
                    by moderate and regular exercise.</p>
                <p>Few are so much raised above want and dependence, or so exempted from business
                    and care, as not to be often exposed to inequalities and changes of diet,
                    exercise, air, climate, and other irregularities. Now, what can be so effectual
                    to secure one against the mischiefs arising from such unavoidable alterations,
                    as hardiness, and a certain versatility of constitution which can bear
                    extraordinary labours, and submit to great changes, without any sensible
                    uneasiness or bad consequences. This is best attained, not by an over great
                    delicacy and minute attention to forms, or by an invariable regularity in diet,
                    hours, and way of living, but rather by a bold and discreet latitude of regimen.
                    Besides, deviations from established rules and forms <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    living, if kept within the bounds of sobriety and reason, are friendly to
                    thought and original sentiments, animate the dull scene of ordinary life and
                    business, and agreeably stir the passions, which stagnate or breed ill humour in
                    the calms of life.</p>
                <p>Neatness, cleanliness, and decency, to which we may add dignity of countenance
                    and demeanour, sectn to have something refined and moral in them, at least we
                    generally esteem them indications of an orderly, genteel, and well-governed
                    mind, conscious of an inward worth, and the respect due to one’s nature; whereas
                    nastiness, slovenliness, awkwardness, and indecency, are shrewd symptoms of
                    something mean, careless, and deficient, and betray a mind untaught, illiberal,
                    and unconscious of what is due to one’s self or to others. How much cleanliness
                    conduces to health needs hardly to be mentioned; and how necessary it is to
                    maintain one’s character and rank in life, and to render us agreeable to others
                    as well as to ourselves, is as evident. There are certain motions, airs, and
                    gestures, which become the human countenance and form, in which we perceive a
                    comeliness, openness, simplicity, and gracefulness; and there are others which,
                    to our sense of decorum, appear uncomely, affected, disingenuous, and awkward,
                    quite unsuitable to the native dignity of our face and form. The first are in
                    themselves the most easy, natural, and commodious, give one boldness and
                    presence of mind, a modest assurance, an address both dignified and alluring;
                    they bespeak candour and greatness of mind, raise the most agreeable prejudices
                    in one’s favour, render society engaging, command respect and often love, and
                    give weight and authority both in conversation and business; in fine, they are
                    the colouring of virtue, which show it to the greatest advantage in whomsoever
                    it exists, and not only imitate, but in some measure supply it where it is
                    wanting. Whereas the last, viz. rudeness, affectation, indecorum, and the like,
                    have all the contrary effects; they are burdensome to one’s self, a dishonour to
                    our nature, and a nuisance in society. The former qualities or goods are best
                    attained by a liberal education, by preserving a just sense of the dignity of
                    our nature, by keeping the best and politest company, and, above all, by
                    acquiring those virtuous and ennobling habits of mind which are decency in per
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825293" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5293-0468"/>fection, which
                    give an air of unaffected grandeur, and spread a lustre truly engaging over the
                    whole form and deportment.</p>
                <p>We are next to consider those goods which consist in exterior social connections,
                    as fame, fortune, civil <hi rend="subscript"> k</hi> authority, and power.</p>
                <p>The first has a twofold aspect, as a good pleasant in itself, or gratifying to an
                    original passion, and then as expedient or useful towards a further end. Honour
                    from the wise and good, on account of virtuous conduct, is regaling to a good
                    man, for then his heart re-echoes to the grateful sound. There are few persons
                    quite indifferent even to the commendation of the vulgar. Though we cannot
                    approve that conduct which proceeds from this principle, and not from good
                    affection or love of the conduct itself, yet, as it is often a guard and
                    additional motive to virtue in creatures imperfect as we are, and often
                    distracted by interfering passions, it might be dangerous to suppress it
                    altogether, however wise it may be to restrain it within due bounds, and however
                    laudable to use it only as a scaffolding to our virtue, which may be taken down
                    when that glorious structure is finished, but hardly till then. To pursue fame
                    for itself, is innocent; to regard it only as an auxiliary to virtue, is noble;
                    to seek it chiefly as an engine of public usefulness, is still more noble, and
                    highly praiseworthy. For though the opinion and breath of men are transient and
                    fading things, often obtained without merit, and lost without cause, yet as our
                    business is with men, and as our capacity of serving them is generally increased
                    in proportion to their esteem of us, therefore sound and well-established moral
                    applause may and will be modestly, not ostentatiously, sought after by the good;
                    not indeed as a solitary refined sort of luxury, but as a public and proper
                    instrument to serve and bless mankind. At the same time they will learn to
                    despise that reputation which is founded on rank, fortune, and any other
                    circumstances or accomplishments which are foreign to real merit, or to useful
                    services done to others, and think that praise of little avail which is
                    purchased without desert, and bestowed without judgment.</p>
                <p>Fortune, power, and civil authority, or whatever is called influence and weight
                    amongst mankind, are goods of the second division, that is, valuable and
                    pursuable only as they are useful, or as means to a further end, namely,
                    procuring or preserving the immediate objects of enjoyment or happiness to
                    ourselves or others. Therefore to love such goods on their own account, and to
                    pursue them as the ends, not the means, of enjoyment, must be highly
                    preposterous and absurd. There can be no measure, no limit, to such pursuit; all
                    must be whim, caprice, extravagance. Accordingly, such appetites, unlike all the
                    natural ones, are increased by possession, and whetted by enjoyment. They are
                    always precarious, and never without fears, because the objects lie without
                    one’s self; they are seldom without sorrow and vexation, because no accession of
                    wealth or of power can satisfy them. But if those goods are considered only as
                    the materials or means of private or public happiness, then the same obligations
                    which bind us to pursue the latter, bind us likewise to pursue the former. We
                    may, and no doubt we ought to, seek such a measure of wealth as is necessary to
                    supply all our real wants, to raise us above servile dependence, and to provide
                    us with such conveniences as are suited to our rank and condition in life. To be
                    regardless of this measure of wealth, is to expose ourselves to all the
                    temptations of poverty and corruption, to forfeit our natural independence and
                    freedom, to degrade, and consequently to render the rank we hold, and the
                    character we sustain, in society, useless, if not contemptible. When these
                    important ends are secured, we ought not to murmur or repine that we possess not
                    more; yet we are not secluded by any obligation, moral or divine, from seeking
                    more, in order to give us that happiest and most godlike of all powers, the
                    power of doing good. A supine indolence in this respect is both absurd and
                    criminal; absurd, as it robs us of an inexhaustible fund of the most refined and
                    durable enjoyments; and criminal, as it renders us so far useless to the society
                    to which we belong. That pursuit of wealth which goes beyond the former end,
                    viz. the obtaining the necessaries, or such conveniences, of life, as, in the
                    estimation of reason, not of vanity or passion, are suited to our rank and
                    condition, and yet is not directed to the latter, namely, the doing good, is
                    what we call <hi rend="italic">avarice.</hi> And that pursuit of power which,
                    after securing one’s self, that is, having attained the proper independence and
                    liberty of a rational social creature, is not directed to the good of others, is
                    what we call <hi rend="italic">ambition,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">lust of
                    power.·</hi> To what extent the strict measures of virtue will allow us to
                    pursue either wealth or power, and civil authority, it is not perhaps possible
                    precisely to determine. That must be left to prudence, and the peculiar
                    character, condition, and other circumstances, of each man. Only thus far a
                    limit may be set, that the pursuit of either must not encroach upon any other
                    duty or obligation which we owe to ourselves, to society, or to its parent and
                    head. The same reasoning is to be applied to power as to wealth. It is only
                    valuable as an instrument of our own security, and of the free enjoyment of
                    those original goods it may, and often does, administer to us, and as an engine
                    of more extensive happiness to our friends, our country, and mankind.</p>
                <p>Now the best, and indeed the only way to obtain a solid and lasting fame, is an
                    uniform inflexible course of virtue; the employing one’s ability and wealth in
                    supplying the wants, and using one’s power in promoting or securing the
                    happiness, the rights and liberties, of mankind, jolned to an universal
                    affability and politeness of manners. And surely one will not mistake the matter
                    much, who thinks the same course conducive to the acquiring greater accessions
                    both of wealth and power; especially if he add to those qualifications a
                    vigorous industry, a constant attention to the characters and wants of men, to
                    the conjunctures of times, and continually varying genius of affairs; and a
                    steady, intrepid honesty, that will neither yield to the allurements, nor be
                    overawed with the terrors, of that corrupt and corrupting scene in which we
                    live. We have sometimes heard indeed of other ways and means, as fraud,
                    dissimulation, servility, and prostitution, and the like ignoble arts, by which
                    the men of the world (as they are called), shrewd politicians, and persons of
                    address, amass wealth and procure power; but as we want rather to form a man of
                    virtue, an honest, contented, happy man, we leave to the men of the world their
                    own ways, and permit them, unenvied and unimitated by us, to reap the fruit of
                    their doings.</p>
                <p>The next species of objects in the scale of good, are the goods of the intellect,
                    as knowledge, memory, judgment, taste, sagacity, docility, and whatever else we
                    call intellectual virtues. Let us consider them a little, and the means as well
                    as obligations to improve them.</p>
                <p>As man is a rational creature, capable of knowing the differences of things and
                    actions; as he not only sees and feels what is present, but remembers what is
                    past, and often foresees what is future; as he advances from small beginnings by
                    slow degrees, and with much labour and difficulty, towards knowledge and
                    experience; as his opinions sway his passions, as his passions influence his
                    conduct, and as his conduct draws consequences after it which extend not only to
                    the present, but to the future time, and is therefore the principal source of
                    his happiness or misery; it is evident that he is formed for intellectual
                    improvements, and that it must be of the utmost consequence for him to imnrove
                    and cultivate his intellectual powers, on <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825306"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-5306-0469"/>which these opinions, those passions, and that
                    conduct, entirely depend.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Philo t. Sinic. Confuc.</hi> lib. i. sect. 3, 4,
                    &amp;c.</p></note></p>
                <p>But besides the future consequences and importance of improving our intellectual
                    powers, their immediate exercise on their proper objects yields the most
                    rational and refined pleasures. Knowledge, and a right taste in the arts of
                    imitation and design, as poetry, painting, sculpture, music, architecture,
                    afford not only an innocent, but a most sensible and sublime entertainment. By
                    these the understanding is instructed in ancient and modern life, the history of
                    men and things, the energies and effects of the passions, the consequences of
                    virtue and vice; by these the imagination is at once entertained and nourished
                    with the beauties of nature and art, lighted up and spread out with the novelty,
                    grandeur, and harmony of the universe; and, in fine, the passions are agreeably
                    roused, and suitably engaged, by the greatest and most interesting objects which
                    can fill the human mind. He who has a taste formed for those ingenious delights,
                    and plenty of materials to gratify it, can never want the most agreeable
                    exercise and entertainment, nor once have reason to make that fashionable
                    complaint of the tediousness of time. Nor can he want a proper subject for the
                    discipline and improvement of his heart. For, being daily conversant with
                    beauty, order, and design, in inferior subjects, he bids fair for growing in due
                    time an admirer of that which is fair and well-proportioned in the conduct of
                    life and the order of society, the latter being only order and design exerted in
                    their highest subject. He will learn to transfer the numbers of poetry to the
                    harmony of the mind and of well-governed passions; and, from admiring the
                    virtues of others in moral paintings, come to approve and imitate them himself.
                    To cultivate a true and correct taste, therefore, must be both our interest and
                    our duty, when the circumstances of our station give leisure and opportunity for
                    it, and when the doing of it is not inconsistent with our higher obligations or
                    engagements to society and mankind.</p>
                <p>It is best attained by reading the best books, where good sense has more the
                    ascendant than learning, and which pertain more to practice than to speculation;
                    by studying the best models, or those which profess to imitate nature most, and
                    approach the nearest to it; and by conversing with men of the most refined
                    taste, and the greatest experience in life.</p>
                <p>As to the other intellectual goods, what a fund of entertainment must it be to
                    investigate the truth and various relations of things, to trace the operations
                    of nature to general laws, to explain by these its manifold phenomena, to
                    understand that order by which the universe is upheld, and that economy by which
                    it is governed; to be acquainted with the human mind, the connections,
                    subordinations, and uses of its powers, and to mark their energy in life: how
                    agreeable to the ingenious inquirer, to observe the manifold relations and
                    combinations of individual minds in society, to discern the causes why they
                    flourish or decay, and thence to ascend, through the vast scale of beings, to
                    that general Mind which presides over all, and operates unseen in every system
                    and in every age, throughout the whole compass and progression of nature.
                    Devoted to such entertainments as these, the contemplative have abandoned every
                    other pleasure, retired from the body, so to speak, and sequestered themselves
                    from social intercourse; for these, the busy have often preferred to the hurry
                    and the din of life the calm retreats of contemplation; for these, when once
                    they came to taste them, even the gay and voluptuous have thrown up the lawless
                    pursuits of sense and appetite, and acknowledged these mental enjoyments to be
                    the most refined, and indeed the only luxury. Besides, by a just and enlarged
                    knowledge of nature, we recognise the perfections of its Author; and thus piety,
                    and all those pious affections which depend on just sentiments of his character,
                    are awakened and confirmed; whilst a thousand superstitious fears, which arise
                    from partial views of his nature and works, will of course be excluded. An
                    extensive prospect of human life, and of the periods and revolutions of human
                    things, will conduce much to impart a certain greatness of mind, and a noble
                    contempt of those little competitions about power, honour, and wealth, which
                    disturb and divide the bulk of mankind; and promote a calm endurance of those
                    inconveniences and evils which are the common appendages of humanity. Add to all
                    this, that a just knowledge of human nature, and of those hinges upon which the
                    business and fortunes of men turn, will prevent our thinking either too highly
                    or too meanly of our fellow-creatures; give no small scope to the exercise of
                    friendship, confidence, and good will; and at the same time brace the mind with
                    a proper caution and distrust (those nerves of prudence), and give a greater
                    mastery in the conduct of private as well as public life. By cultivating our
                    intellectual abilities, therefore, we shall best promote and secure our
                    interest, and be qualified for acting our part in society with more honour to
                    ourselves, as well as advantage to mankind. It is consequently our duty to
                    improve them to the utmost of our power; they are talents committed to us by the
                    Almighty Head of society, and we are accountable to him for the use of them.</p>
                <p>The intellectual virtues are best improved by accurate and impartial observation,
                    extensive reading, and unconfined converse with men of all characters,
                    especially with those who to private study have joined the widest acquaintance
                    with the world, and the greatest practice in affairs; but, above all, by being
                    much in the world, and having large dealings with mankind. Such opportunities
                    contribute much to divest one of prejudices and a servile attachment to crude
                    systems, to open one’s views, and to give that experience upon which the most
                    useful because the most practical knowledge is built, and from which the surest
                    maxims for the conduct of life are deduced.</p>
                <p>The highest goods which enter into the composition of human happiness are moral
                    goods of the mind, directly and ultimately regarding ourselves; such as command
                    of the appetites and passions, prudence and caution, magnanimity, fortitude,
                    humility, love of virtue, love of God, resignation, and the like. These sublime
                    goods are goods by way of eminence, goods recommended and enforced by the most
                    intimate and awful sense and consciousness of our nature; goods which constitute
                    the quintessence, the very temper, of happiness, and form that complexion of
                    soul which renders us approveable and lovely in the sight of God; goods, in
                    fine, which are the elements of all our future perfection and felicity.</p>
                <p>Most of the other goods which we have considered depend partly upon ourselves,
                    and partly on accidents which we can neither foresee nor prevent, and result
                    from causes which we cannot influence or alter. They are such goods as we may
                    possess to-day and lose to-morrow, and which require a felicity of constitution
                    and talents to attain them in full vigour and perfection, and a felicity of
                    conjunctures to secure the possession of them. Therefore, did our happiness
                    depend altogether or chiefly on such transitory and precarious possessions, it
                    were itself most precarious, and the highest folly, to be anxious about it. But
                    although creatures constituted as we are cannot be indifferent about such goods,
                    and must even suffer in some degree, and consequently have our happiness
                    incomplete, without them, yet <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825319"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-5319-0470"/>they weigh but little in the scale when compared
                    with moral goods. By the benevolent constitution of our nature, the latter are
                    placed within the sphere of our activity, so that no man can be destitute of
                    them unless he is first wanting to himself. Some of the wisest and best of
                    mankind have wanted most of the former goods, and all the external kind, and
                    felt most of the opposite evils, such at least as arise from without; yet, by
                    possessing the latter, viz. the moral goods, have declared they were happy, and
                    to the conviction of the most impartial observers have appeared to be happy. The
                    worst of men have been surrounded with every outward good and advantage of
                    fortune, and have possessed great parts; yet, from vyant of moral rectitude,
                    have been, and have confessed themselves to be, notoriously and exquisitely
                    miserable. The exercise of virtue has supported its votaries, and made them
                    exult in the midst of tortures almost intolerable; nay, how often has some false
                    form or shadow of it sustained even the greatest villains and bigots under the
                    same exigencies.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As
                    Ravaillac, who assassinated Henry IV. of France; and Balthasar Gerard, who
                    murdered William I. prince of Orange.</p></note> But no external goods, no goods
                    of fortune, have been able to alleviate the agonies or expel the fears of a
                    guilty mind, conscious of the deserved hatred and reproach of mankind, and the
                    just displeasure of Almighty God.</p>
                <p>As the present condition of human life is wonderfully chequered with good and
                    evil, and as no height of station, no affluence of fortune, can absolutely
                    insure the good, or secure against the evil, it is evident that <hi
                    rend="italic">a great</hi> part of the comfort and serenity of life must lie in
                    having our minds duly affected with regard to both, that is, rightly attempered
                    to the loss of one and the sufferance of the other. For it is certain that
                    outward calamities derive their chief malignity and pressure from the inward
                    dispositions with which we receive them. By managing these rightly, we may
                    greatly abate that malignity and pressure, and consequently diminish the number
                    and weaken the force of the evils of life, if we should not have it in our power
                    to obtain a large share of its goods. There are particularly three virtues which
                    go to the forming of this right temper towards evil, and which are of singular
                    efficacy, if not totally to remove, yet wonderfully to alleviate, the calamities
                    of life. These are fortitude or patience, humility, and resignation.</p>
                <p>Fortitude is that calm and steady habit of mind which either moderates our fears,
                    and enables us bravely to encounter the prospect of evil, or renders the mind
                    serene and invincible under its immediate pressure. It lies equally distant from
                    rashness and cowardice; and, though it does not hinder us from feeling, yet it
                    prevents our complaining or shrinking under the stroke. It always includes a
                    generous contempt of, or at least a noble superiority to, those precarious goods
                    of which we can insure neither the possession nor the continuance. The man,
                    therefore, who possesses this virtue in this ample sense of it, stands upon an
                    eminence, and sees human things below him; the tempest indeed may reach him, but
                    he stands secure and collected against it, upon the basis of conscious virtue,
                    which the severest storms can seldom shake, and never overthrow.</p>
                <p>Humility is another virtue of high rank and dignity, although often mistaken by
                    proud mortals for meanness and pusillanimity. It is opposed to pride, which
                    commonly includes in it a false or exaggerated estimation of our own merit, an
                    ascription of it to ourselves as its only and original cause, an undue
                    comparison of ourselves with others, and, in consequence of that supposed
                    superiority, an arrogant preference of ourselves, and a supercilious contempt of
                    them. Humility, on the other hand, seems to denote that modest and ingenuous
                    temper of mind, which arises from a just and equal estimate of our own
                    advantages compared with those of others, and from a sense of our deriving all
                    originally from, the Author of our being. Its ordinary attendants are mildness,
                    a gentle forbearance, and an easy unassuming humanity with regard to the
                    imperfections and faults of others; virtues rare, indeed, but of the fairest
                    complexion, the proper offspring of so lovely a parent, the best ornaments of
                    such imperfect creatures as we are, precious in the sight of God, and
                    all-powerful over the hearts of men.</p>
                <p>Resignation is that mild and heroic temper of mind which arises from a sense of
                    an infinitely wise and good providence, and enables us to acquiesce with cordial
                    affection in its just appointments. This virtue has something very particular in
                    its nature, as well as sublime in its efficacy; for it teaches us to bear evil,
                    not only with patience, and as being unavoidable, but it transforms, as it were,
                    evil into good, by leading us to consider it, and every event which has the
                    least appearance of evil, as a divine dispensation, a wise and benevolent
                    temperament of things, subservient to universal good, and of course including
                    that of every individual, especially of such as calmly stoop to it. In this
                    light, the administration itself, nay every act of it, becomes an object of
                    affection, and the evil disappears, or is converted into a balm which both heals
                    and nourishes the mind. For although the first unexpected access of evil may
                    surprise the soul into grief, yet that grief, when the mind calmly reviews its
                    object, changes into contentment, and is by degrees exalted into veneration and
                    a divine composure. Our private will is lost in that of the Almighty, and our
                    security against every real evil rests on the same bottom as the throne of him
                    who lives and reigns for ever.</p>
                <p>Before we finish this section, it may be fit to observe, that as the Deity is the
                    supreme and inexhaustible source of good, on whom the happiness of the whole
                    creation depends; as he is the highest object in nature, and the only object who
                    is fully proportioned to the intellectual and moral powers of the mind, in whom
                    they ultimately rest, and find their most perfect exercise and completion; he is
                    therefore termed the chief good of man, objectively considered. And virtue, or
                    the proportioned and vigorous exercise of the several powers and affections
                    towards their respective objects, as above described, is, in the schools, termed
                    the chief good, formally considered, or its formal idea, being the inward temper
                    and native constitution of human happiness.</p>
                <p>From the detail which we have thus gone through, the following important
                    corollaries may be deduced :—1. It is evident that the happiness of such a
                    progressive creature as man can never be at a stand, or continue a fixed
                    invariable thing. His finite nature, let it rise ever so high, admits still
                    higher degrees of improvement and perfection; and his progression in improvement
                    or virtue always makes way for a progression in happiness: so that no possible
                    point can be assigned in any period of his existence in which he is perfectly
                    happy, that is, so happy as to exclude higher degrees of happiness. All his
                    perfectionis only comparative. 2. It appears that many things must conspire to
                    complete the happiness of so various a creature as man, subject to so many
                    wants, and susceptible of such different pleasures. 3. As his capacities of
                    pleasure cannot be all gratified at the same time, and must often interfere with
                    each other in such a precarious and fleeting state as human life, or be
                    frequently disappointed, perfect happiness, that is, the undisturbed enjoyment
                    of the several pleasures of which we are capable, is unattainable in our present
                    state. 4. That state is most to be sought after, in which the fewest
                    competitions and disappointments can happen, which least of all impairs any
                    sense of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825332" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5332-0471"
                    />pleasure, and which opens an inexhaustible source of the most refined and
                    lasting enjoyments. 5. That state which is attended with all these advantages,
                    is a state or course of virtue; and therefore, a state of virtue, in which the
                    moral goods of the mind are attained, is the happiest state.</p>
                <p>CHAP. III. DUTIES OF SOCIETY.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">Filial and Fraternal
                    Duty.</hi></p>
                <p>As we have followed the order of nature in tracing the history of man, and those
                    duties which he owes to himself, it seems reasonable to observe the same method
                    respecting those he owes to society, which constitute the second class of his
                    obligations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> His parents are amongst the earliest objects of his
                    attention; he becomes soonest acquainted with them, reposes a peculiar
                    confidence in them, and seems to regard them with a fond affection, the early
                    prognostics of his future piety and gratitude. Thus does nature dictate the
                    first lines of filial duty, even before a just sense of the connection is
                    formed. But when the child is grown up, and has attained to such a degree of
                    understanding as to comprehend the moral tie, and be sensible of the obligations
                    he is under to his parents; when he looks back on their tender and disinterested
                    affection, their incessant cares and labours in nursing, educating, and
                    providing for him, during that state in which he had neither prudence nor
                    strength to care and provide for himself; he must be conscious that he owes to
                    them these peculiar duties.</p>
                <p>To reverence and honour them, as the instruments of nature in introducing him to
                    life, and to that state of comfort and happiness which he enjoys; and therefore
                    to esteem and imitate their good qualities, to alleviate and bear with, and
                    spread, as much as possible, a decent veil over their faults and weaknesses. To
                    be highly grateful to them for those favours which it can hardly ever be in his
                    power fully to repay: to show this gratitude by a strict attention to their
                    wants, and a solicitous care to supply them; by a submissive deference to their
                    authority and advice, especially by paying great regard to it in the choice of a
                    wife, and of an occupation; by yielding to, rather than peevishly contending
                    with, their humours, as remembering how often they have been persecuted by his;
                    and, in fine, by soothing their cares, lightening their sorrows, supporting the
                    infirmities of age, and making the remainder of their life as comfortable and
                    joyful as possible.</p>
                <p>As his brethren and sisters are the next with whom the creature forms a social
                    and moral connection, to them he .owes a fraternal regard; and with them ought
                    he to enter into a strict league of friendship, mutual sympathy, advice,
                    assistance, and a generous intercourse of kind offices, remembering their
                    relation to common parents, and that brotherhood of nature which unites them
                    into a closer community of interest and affection.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Concerning
                    Marriage.</hi></p>
                <p>When man arrives at a certain age, he becomes sensible of a peculiar sympathy and
                    tenderness towards the other sex; the charms of beauty engage his attention, and
                    call forth new and softer dispositions than he has yet felt. The many amiable
                    qualities exhibited by a fair outside, or by the mild allurement of female
                    manners, or which the prejudiced spectator without much reasoning supposes those
                    to include, with several other circumstances both natural and accidental, point
                    his view and affection to a particular object, and of course contract that
                    general rambling regard, which was lost and useless amongst the undistinguished
                    crowd, into a peculiar and permanent attachment to one woman, which ordinarily
                    terminates in the most important, venerable, and delightful connection in
                    life.</p>
                <p>The state of the brute creation is very different from that of human creatures.
                    The former are clothed and generally armed by their structure, easily find what
                    is necessary to their subsistence, and soon attain their vigour and maturity; so
                    that they need the care and aid of their parents but for a short while, and
                    therefore we see that nature has assigned to them vagrant and transient amours.
                    The connection being purely natural, and merely for propagating and rearing
                    their offspring, no sooner is that end answered, than the connection dissolves
                    of course. But the human race are of a more tender and defenceless constitution;
                    their infancy and nonage continue longer; they advance slowly to strength of
                    body and maturity of reason; they need constant attention, and a long series of
                    cares and labours, in order to train them up to decency, virtue, and the various
                    arts of life. Nature has, therefore, provided them with the most affectionate
                    and anxious tutors, to aid their weakness, to supply their wants, and to
                    accomplish them in those necessary arts, even their own parents, upon whom she
                    has devolved this mighty charge, rendered agreeable by the most alluring and
                    powerful of all ties, parental affection. But unless both concur in this
                    grateful task, and continue their joint labours until they have reared up and
                    planted out their young colony, it must become a prey to every rude invader, and
                    the purpose of nature in the original union of the human pair must be defeated.
                    Therefore our structure as well as condition is an evident indication that the
                    human sexes are destined for a more intimate, that is, for a moral and lasting
                    union. It appears, likewise, that the principal end of marriage is not to
                    propagate and nurse up an offspring, but to educate and form minds for the great
                    duties and extensive destinations of life. Society must be supplied from this
                    original nursery with useful members, and its fairest ornaments and
                    supports.</p>
                <p>The mind is apt to be dissipated in its views· and acts of friendship and
                    humanity, unless the former be directed to a particular object, and the latter
                    employed in a particular province. When men once indulge in this dissipation,
                    there is no stopping their career; they grow insensible to moral attractions;
                    and, by obstructing or impairing the decent and regular exercise of the tender
                    and generous feelings of the human heart, they in time become unqualified for,
                    or averse to, the forming a moral union of souls, which is the cement of
                    society, and the source of the purest domestic joys. But a rational and
                    undepraved love, and its fair companion, marriage, collect a man’s views, guide
                    his heart to its proper object, and, by con fining his affection to that object,
                    do really enlarge its influence and use. Besides, it is but too evident, from
                    the conduct of mankind, that the common ties of humanity are too feeble to
                    engage and interest the passions of the generality in the affairs of society.
                    The connections of neighbourhood, acquaintance, and general intercourse, arc too
                    wide a field of action for many, and those of a public or community are so for
                    more; a field in which they either care not or know not how to exert themselves.
                    Therefore nature, ever wise and benevolent, by implanting that strong sympathy
                    which reigns between the individuals of each sex, and by urging them to form a
                    particular moral connection, the spring of many domestic endearments, has
                    measured out to each pair a particular sphere of action, proportioned to their
                    views, and adapted to their respective capacities. Besides, by interesting them
                    deeply in the concerns of their own little circle, she has connected them more
                    closely with society, which is composed of particular families, and bound them
                    down to their good behaviour in that particular community to which they
                    belong.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825345" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5345-0472"/>
                <p>This moral connection is marriage, and this sphere of action is a family.</p>
                <p>Of the conjugal alliance the following are the natural laws. First, mutual
                    fidelity to the marriage-bed. Disloyalty defeats the very end of marriage;
                    dissolves the natural cement of the relation; weakens the moral tie, the chief
                    strength of which consists in the reciprocation of affection; and, by making the
                    offspring uncertain, diminishes the care and attachment necessary to their
                    education. Secondly, a conspiration of counsels and endeavours to promote the
                    common interest of the family, and to educate their common offspring. In order
                    to observe these laws, it is necessary to cultivate, both before and during the
                    married state, the strictest decency and chastity of manners, and a just sense
                    of what becomes their respective characters. Thirdly, the union must be
                    inviolable, and for life. The nature of friendship, and particularly of this
                    species of it, the education of their offspring, and the order of society and of
                    successions, which would otherwise be extremely perplexed, all equally require
                    this. To preserve the union in question, and render the matrimonial state more
                    harmonious and comfortable, a mutual esteem and tenderness, a mutual deference
                    and forbearance, a communication of advice, and assistance, and authority, are
                    absolutely necessary. If both parties keep within their proper departments,
                    there need be no disputes about power or superiority, and there will be none.
                    They have no opposite, no separate interests, and therefore there can be no just
                    ground for opposition of conduct.</p>
                <p>From this detail, and the present state of things, in which there is pretty
                    nearly a parity of numbers of both sexes, it is evident that polygamy is an
                    unnatural state; and though it should be granted to be more fruitful of
                    children, which, however, it is not found to be, yet it is by no means so fit
                    for rearing minds; which seems to be as much, if not more, the intention of
                    nature than the propagation of bodies.</p>
                <p>*</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III.— <hi rend="italic">Of Parental
                    Duty.</hi></p>
                <p>The connection of parents with their children is a natural consequence of the
                    matrimonial connection; and the duties which the parents owe them result as
                    naturally from that connection. The feeble state of children, subject to so many
                    wants and dangers, requires their incessant care and attention; their ignorant
                    and uncultivated minds demand continual instruction and culture. Had human
                    creatures come into the world with the full strength of men, but the weakness of
                    reason and the vehemence of passions which prevail in children, they would have
                    been too strong or too stubborn to submit to the government and instruction of
                    their parents. But as they were designed for a progression in knowledge and
                    virtue, it was proper that the growth of their bodies should keep pace with that
                    of their minds, lest the purposes of this progression should have been defeated.
                    Amongst other admirable purposes which this gradual expansion of their outward
                    as well as inward structure serves, this is one: that it affords ample scope for
                    the exercise of many tender and generous affections, which fill up the domestic
                    life with a beautiful variety of duties and enjoyments, and are of course a
                    noble discipline for the heart, and a hardy kind of education for the more
                    honourable and important duties of public life.</p>
                <p>The above-mentioned weak and ignorant state of children seems plainly to invest
                    their parents with such authority and power as is necessary to their support,
                    protection, and education; but such authority and power cannot be construed to
                    extend farther than is necessary to answer those ends, nor to last longer than
                    that weakness and ignorance continue; wherefore, the foundation or reason of the
                    authority and power having ceased, they cease of course. Whatever power or
                    authority, then, it may be necessary or lawful for parents to exercise during
                    the nonage of their children, to assume or usurp the same when they have
                    attained the maturity or full exercise of their strength and reason would be
                    tyrannical and unjust. Hence it is evident, that parents have no right to punish
                    the persons of their children more severely than the nature of their wardship
                    requires, much less to invade their lives, to encroach upon their liberty, or to
                    transfer them as their property to any master whatsoever.</p>
                <p>The first class of duties which parents owe to their children respect their
                    natural life; and these comprehend protection, nurture, provision, introducing
                    them into the world in a manner suitable to their rank and fortune, and the
                    like. The second order of duties regards the intellectual and moral life of
                    their children, or their education in such arts and accomplishments as are
                    necessary to qualify them for performing the duties they owe to themselves and
                    to others. As this was found to be the principal design of the matrimonial
                    alliance, so the fulfilling that design is the most important and dignified of
                    all the parental duties. In order, therefore, to fit the child for acting his
                    part wisely and worthily as a man, as a citizen, and as a creature of God, both
                    parents ought to combine their joint wisdom, authority, and power, and each
                    apart should employ those talents which are the peculiar excellency and ornament
                    of their respective sex. The father ought to lay out and superintend their
                    education, the mother should execute and manage the detail of which she is
                    capable. The former should direct the manly exertion of the intellectual and the
                    moral powers of his child. His imagination, and the manner of those exertions,
                    are the peculiar province of the latter. The former should advise, protect,
                    command, and, by his experience, masculine vigour, and that superior authority
                    which is commonly ascribed to his sex, brace and strengthen his pupil for active
                    life, for gravity, integrity, and firmness in suffering. The business of the
                    latter is to bend and soften her male pupil, by the charms of her conversation,
                    and the softness and decency of her manners, for social life, for politeness of
                    taste, and the elegant decorums and enjoyments of humanity; and to improve and
                    refine the tenderness and modesty of her female pupil, and form her for all
                    those mild domestic virtues which are the peculiar characteristics and ornaments
                    of her sex. To conduct the opening minds of their sweet charge through the
                    several periods of their progress; to assist them in each period, in throwing
                    out the latent seeds of reason and ingenuity, and in gaining fresh accessions of
                    light and virtue; and at length, with all these advantages, to produce the young
                    adventurers upon the great theatre of human life, to play their several parts in
                    the sight of their friends, of society, and mankind; are equally incumbent on
                    both <hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV— <hi rend="italic">Herile</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">and Servile Duty.</hi></p>
                <p>In the natural course of human affairs, it must necessarily happen that some of
                    mankind will live in plenty and opulence, and others be reduced to a state of
                    indigence and poverty. The former need the labours of the latter, and the latter
                    provision and support from the former. This mutual necessity is the foundation
                    of that connection, whether we call it <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">civil,</hi> which subsists between masters and servants. He who
                    feeds another has a right to some equivalent, viz. the labour of him whom he
                    maintains, and the fruits of it; and he who labours for another has a right to
                    expect that he should support him. But as the labours of a man of ordinary
                    strength are certainly of greater value than mere food and clothing, because
                    they would actually produce more, even the maintenance of a family, were the
                    labourer to employ them in his own be <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825358"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-5358-0473"/>half, therefore he has an undoubted right to rate
                    and dispose of his service for certain wages above mere maintenance; and if he
                    have incautiously disposed of it for the latter only, yet the contract being of
                    the onerous kind, he may equitably claim a supply of that deficiency. If the
                    service be specified, the servant is bound to that only; if not, then he is to
                    be construed as bound only to such services as are consistent with the laws of
                    justice and humanity. By the voluntary servitude to which he subjects himself,
                    he forfeits no rights but such as are necessarily included in that servitude,
                    and is obnoxious to no punishment but such as a voluntary failure in the service
                    may be supposed reasonably to require. The offspring of such servants have a
                    right to that liberty which neither they nor their parents have forfeited.</p>
                <p>As to those who, by reason of some heinous offence, or for some notorious damage,
                    which they cannot otherwise compensate, are condemned to perpetual service, they
                    do not, on that account, forfeit all the rights of men, but only those the loss
                    of which is necessary to secure society against the like offences for the
                    future, or to repair the damage which they have done.</p>
                <p>With regard to captives taken in war, it is barbarous and inhuman to reduce them
                    to perpetual slavery, unless some peculiar and aggravated circumstances of guilt
                    have attended their hostility. The bulk of the subjects of any government
                    engaged in war may be fairly esteemed innocent enemies, and therefore they have
                    a right to that clemency which is consistent with the common safety of mankind,
                    and the particular security of that society against which they are engaged.
                    Though ordinary captives have a grant of their lives, yet to pay their liberty
                    as an equivalent is much too high a price. There are other ways of acknowledging
                    or returning the favour than by surrendering that which is far dearer than life
                    itself.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hutcheson, Mor.

                    servitude and misery, we may address the words of a fine writer: “Let avarice

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V.— <hi rend="italic">Social Duties of the
                    Private Kind.</hi></p>
                <p>Hitherto we have considered only the domestic economical duties, because these
                    are first in the progress of nature. But as man passes beyond the little circle
                    of a family, he forms connections with relations, friends, neighbours, and
                    others; whence results a new train of duties of the more private social kind, as
                    friendship, chastity, courtesy, good neighbourhood, charity, forgiveness,
                    hospitality.</p>
                <p>Man is admirably formed for particular social attachments and duties. There is a
                    peculiar and strong propensity in his nature to be affected with the sentiments
                    and dispositions of others. Men, like certain musical instruments, are set to
                    each other, so that the vibrations or notes excited in one raise correspondent
                    notes and vibrations in the others. The impulses of pleasure or pain, joy or
                    sorrow, made upon one mind, are by an instantaneous sympathy of nature
                    communicated in some degree to all, especially when hearts are, as a humane
                    writer expresses it, in unison of kindness; the joy that vibrates in one
                    communicates to the other also. We may add, that although joy thus imparted
                    swells the harmony, yet grief vibrated to the heart of a friend, and rebounding
                    from thence in sympathetic notes, melts, as it were, and almost dies away. All
                    the passions, but especially those of the social kind, are contagious; and when
                    the passions of one man mingle with those of another, they increase and multiply
                    prodigiously. There is a most moving eloquence in the human countenance, air,
                    voice, and gesture, wonderfully expressive of the most latent feelings and
                    passions of the soul, which darts them like a subtile flame into the hearts of
                    others, and there raises correspondent feelings. Friendship, love, good humour,
                    joy, spread through every feature, and particularly shoot from the eyes their
                    softer and fiercer fires with an irresistible energy; and, in like manner, the
                    opposite passions of hatred, enmity, ill humour, melancholy, diffuse a sullen
                    and saddening air over the face, and, flashing from eye to eye, kindle a train
                    of similar passions. By these, and other admirable pieces of machinery, men are
                    formed for society and the delightful interchange of friendly sentiments and
                    duties, to increase the happiness of others by participation, and their own by
                    rebound; and to diminish, by dividing, the common stock of their misery.</p>
                <p>The first emanations of the social principle beyond the bounds of a family lead
                    us to form a nearer conjunction of friendship or good will with those who are
                    anywise connected with us by blood or domestic alliance. To them our affection
                    does commonly exert itself in a greater or less degree, according to the
                    nearness or distance of the relation. And this proportion is admirably suited to
                    the extent of our powers and the indigence of our state; for it is only within
                    those lesser circles of consanguinity or alliance that the generality of mankind
                    are able to display their abilities or benevolence, and consequently to uphold
                    their connection with society, and subserviency to a public interest. Therefore
                    it is our duty to regard these closer connections as the next department to that
                    of a family, in which nature has marked out for us a sphere of activity and
                    usefulness; and to cultivate the kind affections which are the cement of these
                    endearing alliances.</p>
                <p>Frequently the view of distinguishing moral qualities in some of our acquaintance
                    may give birth to that more nobleconnection which we call <hi rend="italic"
                    >friendship,</hi> which is far superior to the alliances of consanguinity. For
                    these are of a superficial, and often of a transitory nature, of which, as they
                    hold more of instinct than of reason, we cannot give such a rational account.
                    But friendship derives all its strength and beauty, and the only existence which
                    is durable, from the qualities of the heart, or from virtuous and lovely
                    dispositions; or should these be wanting, they or some shadow of them must be
                    supposed present. Therefore friendship may be described to be the union of two
                    souls by means of virtue, the common object and cement of their mutual
                    affection. Without virtue, or the supposition of it, friendship is only a
                    mercenary league, an alliance of interest, which must dissolve of course when
                    that interest decays or subsists no longer. It is not so much any particular
                    passion, as a composition of some of the noblest feelings and passions of the
                    mind. Good sense, a just taste and love of virtue, a thorough candour and
                    benignity of heart, or what we usually call a good temper, and a generous
                    sympathy of sentiments and affections, are the necessary ingredients of this
                    virtuous connection. When it is grafted on esteem, strengthened by habit, and
                    mellowed by time, it yields infinite pleasure, ever new and ever growing; is a
                    noble support amidst the various trials and vicissitudes of life; and
                    constitutes a high seasoning to most of our other enjoyments. To form and
                    cultivate virtuous friendship, must be very improving to the temper, as its
                    principal object is virtue, set off with all the allurement of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193825371" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5371-0474"/>countenance, air, and
                    manners, shining forth in the native graces of manly honest sentiments and
                    affections, and rendered visible as it were to the friendly spectator in a
                    conduct unaffectedly great and good; and as its principal exercises are the very
                    energies of virtue, or its effect and emanations, so, wherever this amiable
                    attachment prevails, it will exalt our admiration and attachment to virtue, and,
                    unless impeded in its course by unnatural prejudices, will run out into a
                    friendship to the human race. For as no one can merit, and no one ought to
                    usurp, the sacred name of friend, who hates mankind; so, whoever trulyloves
                    them, possesses the most essential quality of a true friend.</p>
                <p>The duties of friendship are a mutual esteem of each other, unbribed by interest,
                    and independent of it; a generous confidence, as far distant from suspicion as
                    from reserve; an inviolable harmony of sentiments and dispositions, of designs
                    and interests; a fidelity unshaken by the changes of fortune; a constancy
                    unalterable by distance of time or place; a resignation of one’s personal
                    interest to those of one’s friend; and a reciprocal, unenvious, unreserved
                    exchange of kind offices. But, amidst all the exertions of this moral
                    connection, humane and generous as it is, we must remember that it operates
                    within a narrow sphere, and its immediate operations respect only the
                    individual; and therefore its particular impulses must still be subordinate to a
                    more public interest, or be always directed and controlled by the more extensive
                    connections of our nature.</p>
                <p>When our friendship terminates on any of the other sex, in whom beauty or
                    agreeableness of person and external gracefulness of manners conspire to express
                    and heighten the moral charm of a tender honest heart, and sweet, ingenuous,
                    modest temper, lighted up by good sense, it generally grows into a more soft and
                    endearing attachment. When this attachment is improved by a growing acquaintance
                    with the worth of its object, is conducted by discretion, and issues at length,
                    as it ought to do, in the moral connection formerly mentioned, it becomes the
                    source of many amiable duties, of a communication of passions and interests, of
                    the most refined decencies, and of a thousand nameless, deep-felt joys of
                    reciprocal tenderness and love, flowing from every look, word, and action. Here
                    friendship acts with double energy, and the natural conspire with the moral
                    charms to strengthen and secure the love of virtue. As the delicate nature of
                    female honour and decorum, and the inexpressible grace of a chaste and modest
                    behaviour, are the surest and indeed the only means of kindling at first, and
                    ever afterwards keeping alive, this tender and elegant flame, and accomplishing
                    the excellent ends designed by it; to attempt by fraud to violate the one, or,
                    under pretence of passion, to sully and corrupt the other, and, by so doing, to
                    expose the too often credulous and unguarded object, with a wanton cruelty, to
                    the hatred of her own sex and the scorn of ours, and to the lowest infamy of
                    both, is a conduct not only base and criminal, but inconsistent with that truly
                    rational and refined enjoyment, the spirit and quintessence of which are derived
                    from the bashful and sacred charms of virtue kept untainted, and therefore ever
                    alluring to the lover’s heart.</p>
                <p>Courtesy, good neighbourhood, affability, and the like duties, which are founded
                    upon our private social connections, are no less necessary and obligatory on
                    creatures united to society, and supporting and supported by each other in a
                    chain of mutual want and dependence. They do not consist in a smooth address, an
                    artificial or obsequious air, fawning adulations, or a polite servility of
                    manners, but in a just and modest sense of our own dignity and that of others,
                    and of the reverence due to mankind, especially to those who hold the higher
                    links of the social chain; in a discreet and manly accommodation of ourselves to
                    the foibles and humours of others; in a strict observance of the rules of
                    decorum and civility; but, above all, in a frank obliging carriage, and a
                    generous interchange of good deeds rather than words. Such a conduct is of great
                    use and advantage, as it is an excellent security against injury, and the best
                    claim and recommendation to the esteem, civility, and universal respect of
                    mankind. This inferior order of virtues unites the particular members of society
                    more closely, and forms the lesser pillars of the civil fabric; which, in many
                    instances, supply the unavoidable defects of laws, and maintain the harmony and
                    decorum of social intercourse, where the more important and essential lines of
                    virtue are wanting.</p>
                <p>Charity and forgiveness are truly amiable and useful duties of the social kind.
                    There is a twofold distinction of rights commonly taken notice of by moral
                    writers, namely, perfect and imperfect. To fulfil the former is necessary to the
                    being and support of society; to fulfil the latter is a duty equally sacred and
                    obligatory, and tends to the improvement and prosperity of society; but as the
                    violation of them is not equally prejudicial to the public good, the fulfilling
                    of them is not subjected to the cognizance of law, but left to the candour,
                    humanity, and gratitude of individuals. By this means ample scope is afforded to
                    exercise all the generosity, and display the genuine merit and lustre, of
                    virtue. Thus the wants and misfortunes of others call for our charitable
                    assistance and seasonable supplies. And the good man, unconstrained by law, and
                    uncontrolled by human authority, will cheerfully acknowledge and generously
                    satisfy this mournful and moving claim; a claim supported by the sanction of
                    heaven, of whose bounties he is honoured to be the grateful trustee. If his own
                    perfect rights are invaded by the injustice of others, he will not therefore
                    reject their imperfect right to pity and forgiveness, unless his grant of these
                    should be inconsistent with the more extensive rights of society, or the public
                    good. In that case he will have recourse to public justice and the laws; and
                    even then he will prosecute the injury with no unnecessary severity, but rather
                    with mildness and humanity. When the injury is merely personal, and of such a
                    nature as to admit of alleviations, and the forgiveness of which would be
                    attended with no worse consequences, especially of a public kind, the good man
                    will generously forgive his offending brother; and it is his duty to do so,
                    rather than to take private revenge, or to retaliate evil for evil. For though
                    resentment of injury is a natural passion, and implanted, as was observed
                    above,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See part i. chap.
                    2 and 4.</p></note> for wise and good ends, yet, considering the manifold
                    partialities which most men have for themselves, were every one to act as judge
                    in his own cause, and to execute the sentence dictated by his own resentment, it
                    is but too evident that mankind would pass all bounds in their fury, and the
                    last sufferer would be provoked in his turn to make full reprisals; so that
                    evil, thus encountering with evil, would produce one continued series of
                    violence and misery, and render society intolerable, if not impracticable.
                    Therefore, where the security of the individual, or the good of the public, does
                    not require a proportional retaliation, it is agreeable to the general law of
                    benevolence, and to the particular end of the passion, which is to prevent
                    injury and the misery occasioned by it, to forgive personal injuries, or not to
                    return evil for evil. This duty is indeed one of the noble refinements which
                    Christianity has made upon the general maxims and practice of mankind, and
                    enforced, with a peculiar strength and beauty, by sanctions no less alluring
                    than awful. And indeed<pb break="no" facs="nls:193825384"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-5384-0475"/> the practice of it is generally its own reward;
                    by expelling from the mind the most dreadful intruders upon its repose, those
                    rancorous passions which are begotten and nursed by resentment; and by disarming
                    and even subduing every enemy one has, except such as have nothing left of men
                    but the outward form.</p>
                <p>The most enlarged and humane connection of the private kind seems to be the
                    hospitable alliance, from which flow the amiable and disinterested duties we owe
                    to strangers. If th’e exercise of passions of the most private and instinctive
                    kind is beheld with moral approbation and delight, how lovely and venerable must
                    those appear which result from a calm philanthropy, are founded in the common
                    rights and connections of society, and embrace men, not of a particular sect,
                    party, or nation, but all in general, without distinction, and without any of
                    the little partialities of self-love.</p>

                    Commercial Kind.</hi></p>
                <p>The next order or class of connections are those which arise from the wants and
                    weakness of mankind, and from the various circumstances in which their different
                    situations place them. These we may call <hi rend="italic">commercial</hi>
                    connections, and the duties which result from them <hi rend="italic"
                    >commercial</hi> duties; as justice, fair-dealing, sincerity, fidelity to
                    compacts, and the like.</p>
                <p>Although nature is perfect in all her works, yet she has observed a manifest and
                    eminent distinction amongst them. To all such as lie beyond the reach of human
                    skill and power, and are properly of her own department, she has given the
                    finishing hand. These man may afterwards design and imitate; but he can never
                    rival them, nor add to their beauty or perfection. Such are the forms and
                    structure of vegetables, animals, and many of their productions, as the
                    honey-comb, the spider’s web, and the like. There are others ofher works which
                    she has intentionally left unfinished, as it were, in order to exercise the
                    ingenuity and power of man. She has presented to him a rich profusion of
                    materials of every kind for his convenience and use; but they are rude and
                    unpolished, or not to be come at without art and labour. These therefore he must
                    needs apply, in order to adapt them to his use, and to enjoy them in perfection.
                    Thus nature has given him an infinite variety of herbs, grains, fossils,
                    minerals, woods, water, earth, air, and a thousand other crude materials, to
                    supply his numerous wants; but he must sow, plant, dig, refine, polish, build,
                    and, in short, manufacture the various produce of nature, in order to obtain
                    even the necessaries, and much more the conveniencies and elegancies, of life.
                    These, then, are the price of his labour and industry, and without that nature
                    will sell him nothing. But as the wants of mankind are many, and the single
                    strength of individuals small, they could hardly find the necessaries, and much
                    less the conveniencies, of life, without uniting their ingenuity and their
                    strength in acquiring these, and without a mutual intercourse of good offices.
                    Some men are better formed for some kinds of ingenuity and labour, and others
                    for other kinds; and different soils and climates are enriched with different
                    productions; so that men, by exchanging the produce of their respective labours,
                    and supplying the wants of one country with the superfluities of another, do in
                    effect diminish the labours of each, and increase the abundance of all. This is
                    the foundation of all commerce, or exchange of commodities and goods, one with
                    another; in order to facilitate which, men have contrived different species of
                    coin, or money, as a common standard by which to estimate the comparative values
                    of their respective goods. But to render commerce sure and effectual, justice,
                    fair-dealing, sincerity, and fidelity to compacts, are absolutely necessary.</p>
                <p>Justice, or fair-dealing, or, in other words, a disposition to treat others as we
                    would be treated by them, is a virtue of the first importance, and inseparable
                    from the virtuous character. It is the cement of society, or that pervading
                    spirit which connects its members, inspires its various relations, and maintains
                    the order and subordination of each part of the whole. Without it society would
                    become a den of thieves and banditti, hating and hated, devouring and devoured,
                    by one another.</p>
                <p>And here it may be proper to take a view of Mr Hume’s supposed case of the
                    sensible knave and the worthless miser, and consider what would be the duty of
                    the former according to the theory of those moralists who hold the will of God
                    to be the criterion or rule, and everlasting happiness the motive, of human
                    virtue.</p>
                <p>It has already been observed, and the truth of the observation cannot be
                    controverted, that, by secretly purloining from the coffers of a miser, part of
                    that gold which there lies useless, a man might in particular circumstances
                    promote the good of society, without doing any injury to <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> single individual; and it was hence inferred, that, in such
                    circumstances, it would be no duty to abstain from theft, were local utility,
                    arising from particular consequences, the real criterion or standard of justice.
                    Very different, however, is the conclusion which must be drawn by those who
                    consider the natural tendency of actions, if universally performed, as the
                    criterion of their merit or demerit in the sight of God. Such philosophers
                    attend, not to the particular consequences of a single action in any given case,
                    but to the general consequences of the principle from which it flows, if that
                    principle were universally adopted. You cannot, say they, permit one action and
                    prohibit another, without showing a difference between them. The same sort of
                    actions, therefore, must be generally permitted or generally forbidden. But were
                    every man allowed to ascertain for himself the circumstances in which the good
                    of society would be promoted, by secretly abstracting the superfluous wealth of
                    a worthless miser, it is plain that no property could be secure; that all
                    incitements to industry would be at once removed; and that, whatever might be
                    the immediate consequences of any particular theft, the general and necessary
                    consequences of the principle by which it was authorized must soon prove fatal.
                    Were one man to purloin part of the riches of areal miser, and to consider his
                    conduct as vindicated by his intention to employ those riches in acts of
                    generosity, another might, by the same sort of casuistry, think himself
                    authorized to appropriate to himself part of his wealth; and thus theft would
                    spread through all orders of men, till society were resolved into separate,
                    hostile, and savage families, mutually dreading and shunning each other. The
                    general consequences, therefore, of encroaching upon private property tend
                    evidently and violently to universal misery.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, indeed, the particular and immediate consequences of that
                    principle which considers every man’s property as sacred, may in some cases,
                    such as that supposed, be in a small degree injurious to a few families in the
                    neighbourhood of the miser and the knave. But that injury can never be of long
                    duration; and it is infinitely more than counterbalanced by the general good
                    consequences of the principle from which it accidentally results, since these
                    consequences extend to all nations and to all ages. Without a sacred regard to
                    property, there could neither be arts nor industry nor confidence amongst men,
                    and happiness would be for ever banished from this world. But the communication
                    of happiness being the end which God had in view when he created the world, and
                    all men standing in the same relation to him, it is impossible to suppose that
                    he does not approve, and will not ultimately reward, those voluntary actions of
                    which the natural tendency<pb break="no" facs="nls:193825397"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-5397-0476"/> is to increase the sum of human happiness; or
                    that he does not disapprove, and will not ultimately punish, those which
                    naturally tend to aggravate human misery. The conclusion is, that a strict
                    adherence to the principle of justice is universally, and in all possible
                    circumstances, a duty from which we cannot deviate without offending our
                    Creator, and ultimately bringing misery upon ourselves.</p>
                <p>Sincerity, or veracity, in our words and actions, is another virtue or duty of
                    great importance to society, being one of the great bands of mutual intercourse,
                    and the foundation of mutual trust. Without it society would be the dominion of
                    mistrust, jealousy, and fraud, and conversation a traffic of lies and
                    dissimulation. It includes in it a conformity of our words with our sentiments,
                    a correspondence between our actions and dispositions, a strict regard to truth,
                    and an irreconcilable abhorrence of falsehood. It does not indeed require that
                    we should expose our sentiments indiscreetly, or tell all the truth in every
                    case; but certainly it does not and cannot admit the least violation of truth,
                    or contradiction to our sentiments. For if these bounds are once passed, no
                    possible limit can be assigned where the violation shall stop, and no pretence
                    of private or public good can possibly counterbalance the ill consequences of
                    such a violation.</p>
                <p>Fidelity to promises, and compacts, and engagements, is likewise a duty of such
                    importance to the security of commerce and interchange of benevolence amongst
                    mankind, that society would soon grow intolerable without the strict observance
                    of it. Hobbes, and others who follow the same track, have taken a wonderful deal
                    of pains to puzzle this subject, and to make all the virtues of this sort merely
                    artificial, and not at all obligatory, antecedent to human conventions. No doubt
                    compacts suppose people who make them, and promises persons to whom they are
                    made; and therefore both suppose some society, more or less, between those who
                    enter into such mutual engagements. But is not a compact or promise binding,
                    till men have agreed that they shall be binding? or are they only binding
                    because it is our interest to be bound by them, or to fulfil them? Do not we
                    highly approve the man who fulfils them, even though they should prove to be
                    against his interest? and do not we condemn him as a knave who violates them on
                    that account? A promise is a voluntary declaration by words, or by an action
                    equally significant, of our resolution to do something in behalf of another, or
                    for his service. When it is made, the person who makes it is by all supposed
                    under an obligation to perform it; and he to whom it is made may demand the
                    performance as his right. That perception of obligation is a simple idea, and is
                    on the same footing as our other moral perceptions, which may be described by
                    instances, but cannot be defined. Whether we have a perception of such
                    obligation quite distinct from the interest, either public or private, that may
                    accompany the fulfilment of it, must be referred to the conscience of every
                    individual; and whether the mere sense of that obligation, apart from its
                    concomitants, is not a sufficient inducement or motive to keep one’s promise,
                    without having recourse to any selfish principle of our nature, must likewise be
                    appealed to the conscience of every honest man.</p>
                <p>It may, however, be not improper to remark, that in this, as in all other
                    instances, our chief good is combined with our duty. Men act from expectation.
                    Expectation is in most cases determined by the assurances and engagements which
                    we receive from others. If no dependence could be placed upon these assurances,
                    it would be altogether impossible to know what judgment to form of many future
                    events, or how to regulate our conduct with respect to them. Confidence,
                    therefore, in promises is essential to the intercourse of human life, because
                    without it the greatest part of our conduct would proceed upon chance. But there
                    could be no confidence in promises, if men were not obliged to perform them.
                    Those, therefore, who allow not to the perceptions of the moral sense all that
                    authority which we attribute to them, must still admit the obligation to perform
                    promises, because such performance may be shown to be agreeable to the will of
                    God, in the very same manner in which, upon their principles, we have shown the
                    uniform practice of justice to be so.</p>
                <p>Fair-dealing and fidelity to compacts require that we should take no advantage of
                    the ignorance, passion, or incapacity of others, from whatever cause these
                    defects may arise; that we should be explicit and candid in making bargains,
                    just and faithful in fulfilling our part of them. And if the other party
                    violates his engagements, redress is to be sought from the laws, or from those
                    who are intrusted with the execution of them. In fine, the commercial virtues
                    and duties require that we not only do not invade, but maintain the rights of
                    others; that we be fair and impartial in transferring, bartering, or exchanging
                    property, whether in goods or service; and be inviolably faithful to our word
                    and our engagements, where the matter of them is not criminal, and where they
                    are not extorted by force.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VII.— <hi rend="italic">Social Duties of the
                    Political Kind</hi></p>
                <p>We have now arrived at the last and highest order of duties respecting society,
                    which result from the exercise of the most generous and heroic affections, and
                    are founded on our most enlarged connections.</p>
                <p>The social principle in man is of such an expansive nature, that it cannot be
                    confined within the circuit of a family, of friends, or of a neighbourhood; it
                    spreads into wider systems, and draws men into larger confederacies,
                    communities, and commonwealths. It is in those only that the higher powers of
                    our nature attain the greatest improvement and perfection of which they are
                    capable. These principles hardly find objects in the solitary state of nature.
                    There the principle of action rises no higher than natural affection towards
                    one’s offspring. There personal or family wants entirely engross the creature’s
                    attention and labour, and allow no leisure, or, if they do, no exercise, for
                    views and affections of a more enlarged kind. In solitude all are employed in
                    the same way, in providing for the animal life. And even after their utmost
                    labour and care, single and unaided by the industry of others, they find but a
                    sorry supply of their wants, and a feeble, precarious security against dangers
                    from wild beasts; from inclement skies and seasons; from the mistakes or
                    petulant passions of their fellow-creatures; from their preference of themselves
                    to their neighbours; and from all the little exorbitances of self-love. But in
                    society, the mutual aids which men give and receive shorten the labours of each,
                    and the combined strength and reason of individuals give security and protection
                    to the whole body. There is both a variety and subordination of genius amongst
                    mankind. Some are formed to lead and direct others; to contrive plans of
                    happiness for individuals, and of government for communities; to take in a
                    public interest, invent laws and arts, and superintend their execution; and, in
                    short, to refine and civilize human life. Others, who have not such good heads,
                    may have as honest hearts, a truly public spirit, love of liberty, hatred of
                    corruption and tyranny, a generous submission to law’s, order, and public
                    institutions, and an extensive philanthropy; and others, who have none of those
                    capacities either of heart or head, may be well formed for manual exercise and
                    bodily labour. The former of these principles have no scope in solitude, where a
                    man’s thoughts and concerns do all either centre in himself or extend no farther
                    than a family, into which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825410"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-5410-0477"/>little circle all the duty and virtue of the
                    solitary mortal is crowded. But society finds proper objects and exercises for
                    every genius, and the noblest objects and exercises for the noblest geniuses,
                    and for the highest principles in the human constitution; particularly for that
                    warmest and most divine passion which God has kindled in our bosoms, the
                    inclination of doing good, and reverencing our nature, which may find here both
                    employment and the most exquisite satisfaction. In society, a man has not only
                    more leisure, but better opportunities of applying his talents with much greater
                    perfection and success, especially as he is furnished with the joint advice and
                    assistance of his fellow-creatures, who are now more closely united one with the
                    other, and sustain a common relation to the same moral system or community.
                    This, then, is an object proportioned to his most enlarged social affections;
                    and in serving it he finds scope for the exercise and refinement of his highest
                    intellectual and moral powers. Therefore society, or a state of civil
                    government, rests on these two principal pillars, that in it we find security
                    against those evils which are unavoidable in solitude; and obtain those goods,
                    some of which cannot be obtained at all, and others not so well, in that state
                    where men depend solely on their individual sagacity and industry.</p>
                <p>From this short detail it appears, that man is a social creature, and formed for
                    a social state; and that society, being adapted to the higher principles and
                    destinations of his nature, must of necessity be his natural state.</p>
                <p>The duties suited to that state, and resulting from those principles and
                    destinations, or, in other words, from our social passions and social
                    connections, or relation to a public system, are, love of our country,
                    resignation and obedience to the laws, public spirit, love of liberty, sacrifice
                    of life and all to the public, and the like.</p>
                <p>Love of our country is one of the noblest passions that can warm and animate the
                    human breast. It includes all the limited and particular affections to our
                    parents, friends, neighbours, fellow-citizens, countrymen. It ought to direct
                    and limit our more confined and partial actions within their proper and natural
                    bounds, and never let them encroach upon those sacred and first regards we owe
                    to the great public to which we belong. Were we solitary creatures, detached
                    from the rest of mankind, and without any capacity of comprehending a public
                    interest, or without affections leading us to desire and pursue it, it would not
                    be our duty to mind it, nor criminal to neglect it. But as we are <hi
                    rend="italic">parts</hi> of the public system, and are not only capable of
                    taking in large views of its interests, but by the strongest affections
                    connected with it, and prompted to take a share of its concerns, we are under
                    the most sacred ties to prosecute its security and welfare with the utmost
                    ardour, especially in times of public trial. This love of our country does not
                    import an attachment to any particular soil, climate, or spot of earth, where
                    perhaps we first drew our breath, though those natural ideas are often
                    associated with the fnoral ones, and, like external signs or symbols, help to
                    ascertain and bind them; but it imports an affection to that moral system or
                    community, which is governed by the same laws and magistrates, and whose several
                    parts are variously connected one with the other, and all united upon the
                    foundation of a common interest. Perhaps indeed every member of the community
                    cannot comprehend so large an object, especially if it extends through large
                    provinces, and over vast tracts of land; and still less can he form such an
                    idea, if there is no public, that is, if all are subject to the caprice and
                    unlimited will of one man; but the preference i the generality show to their
                    native country, the concern and longing after it which they express when they
                    have been long absent from it; thelaboursthey undertake and the sufferings they
                    endure to save or serve it, and the peculiar attachment they have to their
                    countrymen; evidently de monstrate that the passion is natural, and never fails
                    to exert itself when it is fairly disengaged from foreign clogs, and is directed
                    to its proper object. Wherever it prevails in its genuine vigour and extent, it
                    swallows up all sordid and selfish regards; it conquers the love of ease, power,
                    pleasure, and wealth; nay, when the amiable partialities of friendship,
                    gratitude, private affection, or regards to a family, come in competition with
                    it, it will teach us bravely to sacrifice all, in order to maintain the rights,
                    and promote or defend the honour and happiness, of our country.</p>
                <p>Resignation and obedience to the laws and orders of the society to which we
                    belong are political duties necessary to its very being and security, without
                    which it must soon degenerate into a state of licentiousness and anarchy. The
                    welfare, nay, the nature of civil society, requires that there should be a
                    subordination of orders, or diversity of ranks and conditions in it; that
                    certain men, or orders of men, should be appointed to superintend and manage
                    such affairs as concern the public safety and happiness; that all have their
                    particular provinces assigned them; that such a subordination be settled among
                    them as that none of them may interfere with another; and finally, that certain
                    rules or common measures of action be agreed on, by which each is bound to
                    discharge his respective duty to govern or be governed, and all may concur in
                    securing the order, and promoting the felicity, of the whole political body.
                    Those rules of action are the laws of the community; and those different orders
                    are the several officers or magistrates appointed by the public to explain them,
                    and superintend or assist in their execution. In consequence of this settlement
                    of things, it is the duty of each individual to obey the laws enacted; to submit
                    to the executors of them with all due deference and homage, according to their
                    respective ranks and dignity, as to the keepers of the public peace, and the
                    guardians of public liberty; to maintain his own rank, and perform the functions
                    of his own station, with diligence, fidelity, and incorruption. The superiority
                    of the higher orders, or the authority with which the state has invested them,
                    entitle them, especially if they employ their authority well, to the obedience
                    and submission of the lower, and to a proportional honour and respect from all.
                    The subordination of the lower ranks claims protection, defence, and security
                    from the higher; and the laws, being superior to all, require the obedience and
                    submission of all, being the last resort, beyond which there is no decision or
                    appeal.</p>
                <p>Public spirit, heroic zeal, love of liberty, and the other political duties, do,
                    above all others, recommend those who practise them to the admiration and homage
                    of mankind; because, as they are the offspring of the noblest minds, so are they
                    the parents of the greatest blessing to society. Yet, exalted as they are, it is
                    only in equal and free governments where they can be exercised and have their
                    due effect; for there only does a true public spirit prevail, and there only is
                    the public good made the standard of the civil constitution. As the end of
                    society is the common interest and welfare of the people associated, this end
                    must of necessity be the supreme law or common standard by which the particular
                    rules of action of the several members of the society towards each other are to
                    be regulated. But a common interest can be no other than that which is the
                    result of the common reason or common feelings of all. Private men, or a
                    particular order of men, have interests and feelings peculiar to themselves, and
                    of which they may be good judges; but these may be separate from, and often
                    contrary to, the interests and feelings of the rest of the society, and
                    therefore they can have no right to make, and much less to impose, laws on their
                    fellow-citizens, inconsistent with, and opposite to, those interests and those
                    feelings. Therefore, a society, a government, or real public, truly worthy the
                    name, and not a confederacy of banditti, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825423"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-5423-0478"/>a clan of lawless savages, or a band of slaves
                    under the whip of a master, must be such a one as consists of freemen, choosing
                    or consenting to laws themselves; or, since it often happens that they cannot
                    assemble and act in a collective body, delegating a sufficient number of
                    representatives, that is, such a number as shall most fully comprehend, and most
                    equally represent, their common feelings and common interests, to digest and
                    vote laws for the conduct and control of the whole body, the most agreeable to
                    those common feelings and common interests.</p>
                <p>A society which is thus constituted by common reason, and formed on the plan of a
                    common interest, becomes immediately an object of public attention, public
                    veneration, public obedience, a public and inviolable attachment, which ought
                    neither to be seduced by bribes, nor awed by terrors; an object, in fine, of all
                    those extensive and important duties which arise from so glorious a confederacy.
                    To watch over such a system; to contribute all he can to promote its good, by
                    his reason, his ingenuity, his strength, and every other ability, whether
                    natural or acquired; to resist, and, to the utmost of his power, to defeat every
                    encroachment upon it, whether carried on by a secret corruption or open
                    violence; and to sacrifice his ease, his wealth, his power, nay, life itself,
                    and, what is dearer still, his family and friends, to defend or save it, is the
                    duty, the honour, the interest, and the happiness of every citizen. It will make
                    him venerable and beloved whilst he lives, be lamented and honoured if he falls
                    in so glorious a cause, and transmit his name with immortal renown to the latest
                    posterity.</p>
                <p>As the <hi rend="italic">people</hi> are the fountain of all power and authority,
                    the original seat of majesty, the authors of laws, and the creators of officers
                    to execute them; if they shall find the power they have conferred abused by
                    their trustees, their majesty violated by tyranny or by usurpation, their
                    authority prostituted to support violence or screen corruption, the laws grown
                    pernicious through accidents unforeseen or unavoidable, or rendered ineffectual
                    through the infidelity and corruption of the executors of them; then it is their
                    right, and what is their right is their duty, to resume that delegated power,
                    and call their trustees to an account; to resist the usurpation, and extirpate
                    the tyranny; to restore their sullied majesty and prostituted authority; to
                    suspend, alter, or abrogate those laws, and to punish their unfaithful and
                    corrupt officers. Nor is this the duty only of the united body; but every member
                    of it ought, according to his respective rank, power, and weight in the
                    community, to concur in advancing and supporting these glorious designs.</p>
                <p>Resistance, therefore, being undoubtedly lawful in extraordinary emergencies, the
                    question, amongst good reasoners, can only be with regard to the degree of
                    necessity which can justify resistance, and render it expedient or commendable.
                    And here we must acknowledge, that, with Mr Hume, we shall always incline to
                    their side who draw the bond of allegiance very close, and who consider an
                    infringement of it as the last refuge in desperate cases, when the public is in
                    the highest danger from violence and tyranny. “For, besides the mischiefs of a
                    civil war, which commonly attends insurrection, it is certain, that where a
                    disposition to rebellion appears among any people, it is one chief cause of
                    tyranny in the rulers, and forces them into many violent measures, which, had
                    every one been inclined to submission and obedience, they would never have
                    embraced. Thus the <hi rend="italic">tyrannicide,</hi> or assassination approved
                    of by ancient maxims, instead of keeping tyrants and usurpers in awe, made them
                    ten times more fierce and unrelenting; and is now justly abolished on that
                    account by the laws of nations, and universally condemned, as a base and
                    treacherous method of bringing to justice those disturbers of society.”</p>
                <p>CHAP. IV.—DUTY TO GOD.</p>
                <p>Of all the relations which the human mind sustains, that which subsists between
                    the Creator and his creatures, the Supreme Lawgiver and his subjects, is the
                    highest and the best. This relation arises from the nature of a creature in
                    general, and the constitution of the human mind in particular; the noblest
                    powers and affections of which point to an universal mind, and would be
                    imperfect and abortive without such a direction. How lame, then, must that
                    system of morals be, which leaves a Deity out of the question; how disconsolate,
                    and how destitute of its firmest support.</p>
                <p>It does not appear, from the history or experience of the mind’s progress, that
                    any man, by any formal deduction of his discursive power, ever reasoned himself
                    into the belief of a God. Whether such a belief is only some natural
                    anticipation of soul, or is derived from father to son, and from one man to
                    another, in the way of tradition, or is suggested to us in consequence of an
                    immutable law of nature, on beholding the august aspect and beautiful order of
                    the universe, we shall not pretend to determine. What seems most agreeable to
                    experience is, that a sense of its beauty and grandeur, and the admirable
                    fitness of one thing to another in its vast apparatus, leads the mind
                    necessarily and unavoidably to a perception of a design, or of a designing
                    cause, the origin of all, by a progress as simple and natural as that by which a
                    beautiful picture or a fine building suggests to us the idea of an excellent
                    artist. For it seems to hold universally true, that wherever we discern a
                    tendency or co-operation of things towards a certain end, or producing a common
                    effect, there, by a necessary law of association, we apprehend design, and a
                    designing energy or cause. No matter whether the objects are natural or
                    artificial, still that suggestion is unavoidable, and the connection between the
                    effect and its adequate cause obtrudes itself on the mind, and it requires no
                    nice search or elaborate deduction of reason to trace or prove that connection.
                    We are particularly satisfied of its truth in the subject before us by a kind of
                    direct intuition; and we do not seem to attend to the maxim we learn in schools,
                    that there cannot be an infinite series of causes and effects, producing and
                    produced by one another. That maxim is familiar only to metaphysicians; but all
                    men of sound understanding are led to believe the existence of a God. We are
                    conscious of our existence, of thought, sentiment, and passion, and sensible
                    withal that these came not of ourselves; therefore we immediately recognise a
                    parent mind, an original intelligence, from whom we borrowed those little
                    portions of thought and activity. And whilst we not only feel kind affections in
                    ourselves, and discover them in others, but likewise behold around us such a
                    number and variety of creatures, endowed with natures nicely adjusted to their
                    several stations and economies, supporting and supported by each other, and all
                    sustained by a common order of things, and sharing different degrees of
                    happiness according to their respective capacities, we are naturally and
                    necessarily led up to the Father of such a numerous offspring, the fountain of
                    such wide-spread happiness. As we conceive this Being before all, above all, and
                    greater than all, we naturally, and without reasoning, ascribe to him every kind
                    of perfection, wisdom, power, and goodness without bounds, existing through all
                    time, and pervading all space. We apply to him those glorious epithets of our
                    Creator, Preserver, Benefactor, the Supreme Lord and Lawgiver of the whole
                    society of rational and intelligent creatures. Not only the imperfections and
                    wants of our being and condition, but some of the noblest instincts and
                    affections of our minds, connect us with this great and universal nature. The
                    mind, in its progress from object to object, from one character and prospect of
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825436" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5436-0479"/>beauty to
                    another, finds some blemish or deficiency in each, and soon exhausts or grows
                    weary and dissatisfied with its subject; it sees no character of excellence
                    amongst men equal to that pitch of esteem which it is capable of exerting; no
                    object within the compass of human things adequate to the strength of its
                    affection; nor can it stay anywhere in this self-expansive progress, or find
                    repose after its highest flights, till it arrives at a Being of unbounded
                    greatness and worth, on whom it may employ its most sublime powers without
                    exhausting the subject, and give scope to the utmost force and fulness of its
                    love without satiety or disgust. It follows that the nature of this Being
                    corresponds to the nature of man; nor can his intelligent and moral powers
                    obtain their entire end, but on the supposition of such a Being, and without a
                    real sympathy and communication with him. The native propensity of the mind to
                    reverence whatever is great and wonderful in nature, finds a proper object of
                    homage in him who spread out the heavens and the earth, and who sustains and
                    governs the whole. The admiration of beauty, the love of order, and the
                    complacency we feel in goodness, must rise to the highest pitch, and attain the
                    full vigour and joy of their operations, when they unite in him who is the sum
                    and source of all perfection.</p>
                <p>It is evident, from the slightest survey of morals, that how punctual soever one
                    maybe in performing the duties which result from our relations to mankind, yet
                    to be quite deficient in performing those which arise from our relation to the
                    Almighty, must argue a strange perversion of reason or depravity of heart. If
                    imperfect degrees of worth attract our veneration, and if the want of it would
                    imply an insensibility, or, which is worse, an aversion to merit, what lameness
                    of affection or immorality of character must it be to be unaffected with, and,
                    much more, to be ill affected to, a Being of superlative worth. To love society,
                    or particular members of it, and yet to have no sense of our connection with its
                    Head, no affection to our common Parent and Benefactor; to be concerned about
                    the approbation or censure of our fellow-creatures, and yet to feel nothing of
                    this kind towards him who sees and weighs our actions with unerring wisdom and
                    justice, and can fully reward or punish them, betrays equal madness and
                    partiality of mind. It is plain, therefore, beyond all doubt, that some regards
                    are due to the great Father of all, in whom every lovely and adorable quality
                    combines to inspire veneration and homage.</p>
                <p>As it has been observed already that our affections depend on our opinions of
                    their objects, and generally keep pace with them, it must be of the highest
                    importance, and seems to be amongst the first duties we owe to the Author of our
                    being, to form the least imperfect, since we cannot form perfect, conceptions of
                    his character and administration. For such conceptions, thoroughly imbibed, will
                    render our religion rational, and our dispositions refined. If our opinions are
                    diminutive and distorted, our religion will be superstitious, and our temper
                    abject. Thus, if we ascribe to the Deity that false majesty which consists in
                    the unbenevolent and sullen exercise of mere will or power, or suppose him to
                    delight in the prostrations of servile fear, or as servile praise, he will be
                    worshipped with mean adulation and a profusion of compliments. Again, if he be
                    looked upon as a stern and implacable Being, delighting in vengeance, he will be
                    adored with pompous offerings, sacrifices, or whatever else may be thought
                    proper to soothe and mollify him. But if we believe perfect goodness to be the
                    character of the Supreme Being, and that he loves those most who resemble him
                    most, the worship paid him will be rational and sublime, and his worshipperswill
                    seek to please him by imitating that goodness which they adore. The foundation,
                    then, of all true religion is a rational faith, and of a rational faith these
                    seem to be the chief articles: to believe that an infinite, all-perfect Mind
                    exists, who has no opposite nor any separate interest from that of his
                    creatures; that he superintends and governs all creatures and things; that his
                    goodness extends to all his creatures, in different degrees, indeed, according
                    to their respective natures, but without any partiality or envy; that he does
                    every thing for the best, or in a subserviency to the perfection and happiness
                    of the whole, particularly that he directs and governs the affairs of men,
                    inspects their actions, distinguishes the good from the bad, loves and befriends
                    the former, is displeased with and pities the latter in this world, and will,
                    according to their respective deserts, reward one and punish the other in the
                    next; that, in fine, he is always carrying on a scheme of virtue and happiness
                    through an unlimited duration, and is ever guiding the universe, through its
                    Successive stages and periods, to higher degrees of perfection and felicity.
                    This is true <hi rend="italic">Theism,</hi> the glorious scheme of divine faith;
                    a scheme exhibited in all the works of God, and executed throughout his whole
                    administration.</p>
                <p>This faith, well founded and deeply felt, is nearly connected with a true moral
                    taste, and has a powerful efficacy on the temper and manners of the theist. He
                    who admires goodness in others, and delights in the practice of it, must be
                    conscious of a reigning order within, a rectitude and candour of heart, which
                    disposes him to entertain favourable apprehensions of men, and, from an
                    impartial survey of things, to presume that good order and good meaning prevail
                    in the universe; and if good meaning and good order, then an ordering, an
                    intending mind, who is no enemy, no tyrant to his creatures, but a friend, a
                    benefactor, an indulgent sovereign. On the other hand, a bad man, having nothing
                    goodly or generous to contemplate within, no right intentions nor honesty of
                    heart, suspects every person and every thing; and, beholding nature through the
                    gloom of a selfish and guilty mind, is either averse to the belief of a reigning
                    order, or, if he cannot suppress the unconquerable anticipations of a governing
                    mind, he is prone to tarnish the beauty of nature, and to impute malevolence, or
                    blindness and impotence at least, to the Sovereign Ruler. He turns the universe
                    into a forlorn and horrid waste, and transfers his own character to the Deity,
                    by ascribing to him that uncommunicative grandeur, that arbitrary or revengeful
                    spirit, which he affects or admires in himself. As such a temper of mind
                    naturally leads to atheism, or to a superstition fully as bad, therefore, as far
                    as that temper depends on the unhappy creature on whom it prevails, the
                    propensity to atheism, or superstition consequent thereto, must be immoral.
                    Further, if it be true that the belief or sense of a Deity is natural to the
                    mind, and the evidence of his existence reflected from his works so full as to
                    strike even the most superficial observer with conviction, then the supplanting
                    or corrupting that sense, or the want of due attention to that evidence, and, in
                    consequence of both, a supine ignorance or affected unbelief of a Deity, must
                    argue a bad temper or an immoral turn of mind. In the case of invincible
                    ignorance, or a very bad education, although nothing can be concluded directly
                    against the character, yet whenever ill passions and habits pervert the
                    judgment, and by perverting thejudgment terminate in atheism, then the case
                    becomes plainly criminal.</p>
                <p>But let casuists determine this as they will, a true faith in the divine
                    character and administration is generally the consequence of a virtuous state of
                    mind. The man who is truly and habitually good, feels the love of order, of
                    beauty, and goodness, in the strongest degree; and therefore cannot be
                    insensible to those emanations of them which appear in all the works of God, nor
                    help loving their supreme source and model. He cannot but think, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193825449" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5449-0480"/>that he who has poured such
                    beauty and goodness over all his works, must himself delight in beauty and
                    goodness, and what he delights in must be both amiable and happy. Some indeed
                    there are, and it is pity there should be any such, who, through the unhappy
                    influence of a wrong education, have entertained dark and unfriendly thoughts of
                    the Deity and his administration, though otherwise of a virtuous temper
                    themselves. However, it must be acknowledged that such sentiments have, for the
                    most part, a bad effect on the temper; and when they have not, it is because the
                    undepraved affections of an honest heart are more powerful in their operation
                    than the speculative opinions of an ill-informed head.</p>
                <p>But wherever right conceptions of the Deity and his providence prevail, when he
                    is considered as the inexhaustible source of light, and love, and joy, as acting
                    in the joint character of a Father and Governor, imparting an endless variety of
                    capacities to his creatures, and supplying them with every thing necessary to
                    their full completion and happiness, what veneration and gratitude must such
                    conceptions, thoroughly believed, excite in the mind. How natural and delightful
                    must it be to one whose heart is open to the perception of truth, and of every
                    thing fair, great, and wonderful in nature, to contemplate and to adore him who
                    is the first fair, the first great, and first wonderful; in whom wisdom, power,
                    and goodness dwell vitally, essentially, originally, and act in perfect concert.
                    What grandeur is here to fill the most enlarged capacity, what beauty to engage
                    the most ardent love, what a mass of wonders in such exuberance of perfection to
                    astonish and delight the human mind through an unfailing duration.</p>
                <p>If the Deity be considered as our Supreme Guardian and Benefactor, as the Father
                    of Mercies, who loves his creatures with infinite tenderness, and in a
                    particular manner all good men, nay all who delight in goodness, even in its
                    most imperfect degrees; what resignation, what dependence, what generous
                    confidence, what hope in God and his all-wise providence, must arise in the soul
                    that is possessed of such amiable views of Him. All those exercises of piety,
                    and, above all, a superlative esteem and love, are directed to God as to their
                    natural, their ultimate, and indeed their only adequate object; and though the
                    immense obligations we have received from him may excite in us more lively
                    feelings of divine goodness than a general and abstracted contemplation of it,
                    yet the affections of gratitude and love are of themselves of the generous,
                    disinterested kind, not the result of self-interest, or views of reward. A
                    perfect character, in which we always suppose infinite goodness, guided by
                    unerring wisdom, and supported by almighty power, is the proper object of
                    perfect love; which, as such, we are forcibly drawn to pursue and to aspire
                    after. In the contemplation of the divine nature and attributes, we find at last
                    what the ancient philosophers sought in vain, the supreme and sovereign good,
                    from which all other goods arise, and in which they are all contained. The
                    Deity, therefore, challenges our supreme and sovereign love, a sentiment which,
                    whosoever indulges, must be confirmed in the love of virtue, in a desire to
                    imitate its all-perfect pattern, and in a cheerful security that all his great
                    concerns, those of his friends and of the universe, shall be absolutely safe
                    under the conduct of unerring wisdom and unbounded goodness. It is in his care
                    and providence alone that the good man, who is anxious for the happiness of all,
                    finds perfect serenity; a serenity neither ruffled by partial ill, nor soured by
                    private disappointment.</p>
                <p>When we consider the unstained purity and the absolute perfection of the divine
                    nature, and reflect withal on the imperfection and various blemishes of our own,
                    we must sink, or be convinced we ought to sink, into the deepest humility and
                    prostration of soul before him who is so won derfully great and holy. When,
                    further, we call to mind what low and languid feelings we have of the divine
                    presence and majesty, what insensibility of his fatherly and universal goodness,
                    nay, what ungrateful returns we have made to it, how far we come short of the
                    perfection of his law, and the dignity of our own nature, how much we have
                    indulged in selfish passions, and how little we have cherished the benevolent
                    ones, we must be conscious that it is our duty to repent of a temper and conduct
                    so unworthy our nature, and unbecoming our obligations to its Author, and to
                    resolve and endeavour to act a wiser and better part for the future.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, from the character which his works exhibit of him, from those
                    delays or alleviations of punishment which offenders often experience, and from
                    the merciful tenor of his administration in many other instances, the sincere
                    penitent may entertain good hopes that his Parent and Judge will not be strict
                    to mark iniquity, but will be propitious and favourable to him, if he honestly
                    endeavour to avoid his former practices, and subdue his former habits, and to
                    live in a greater conformity to the divine will for the future. If any doubts or
                    fears should still remain, how far it may be consistent with the rectitude and
                    equity of the divine government to let his iniquities pass unpunished, yet he
                    cannot think it unsuitable to his paternal clemency and wisdom to contrive a
                    method of retrieving the penitent offender, which shall unite and reconcile the
                    majesty and mercy of his government. If reason cannot of itself suggest such a
                    scheme, it gives at least some ground to expect it. But although natural
                    religion cannot let in moral light and assurance on so interesting a subject,
                    yet it will teach the humble theist to wait with great submission for any
                    further intimations it may please the Supreme Governor to give of his will; to
                    examine with candour and impartiality whatever evidence shall be proposed to him
                    of a divine revelation, whether that evidence is natural or supernatural; to
                    embrace it with veneration and cheerfulness, if the evidence be clear and
                    convincing; and, finally, if it bring to light any new relations or connections,
                    natural religion will persuade its sincere votary faithfully to comply with the
                    obligations and perform the duties which result from those relations and
                    connections. This is theism, piety, the completion of morality.</p>
                <p>We must further observe, that all those affections which we supposed to regard
                    the Deity as their immediate and primary object, are vital energies of the soul,
                    and consequently exert themselves in action, and, like all other energies, gain
                    strength or greater activity by that exertion. It is therefore our duty, as well
                    as highest interest, often, at stated times, and by decent and solemn acts, to
                    contemplate and adore the great Original of our existence, the Parent of all
                    beauty and of all good; to express our veneration and love by an awful and
                    devout recognition of his perfections; and to evidence our gratitude by
                    celebrating his goodness, and thankfully acknowledging all his benefits. It is
                    likewise our duty, by proper exercises of sorrow and humiliation, to confess our
                    ingratitude and folly; to signify our dependence on God, and our confidence in
                    his goodness, by imploring his blessing and gracious concurrence in assisting
                    the weakness and curing the corruptions of our nature; and, finally, to testify
                    our sense of his authority, and our faith in his government, by devoting
                    ourselves to do his will, and resigning ourselves to his disposal. These duties
                    are not therefore obligatory because the Deity needs or can be profited by them;
                    but as they are apparently decent and moral, suitable to the relations he
                    sustains of our Creator, Benefactor, Lawgiver, and Judge; expressive of our
                    state and obligations; and improving to our tempers, by making us more rational,
                    social, god-like, and consequently more happy.</p>
                <p>We have now considered <hi rend="italic">internal</hi> piety, or the worship <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193825462" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5462-0481"/> of the mind, that
                    which is in spirit and in truth; we shall conclude the section with a short
                    account of that which is <hi rend="italic">external.</hi> External worship is
                    founded on the same principles as internal, and is of as strict moral
                    obligation. It is either private or public. Devotion that is inward, or purely
                    intellectual, is too spiritual and abstracted an operation for the bulk of
                    mankind. The operations of their minds, such especially as are employed on the
                    most sublime, immaterial objects, must be assisted by their outward organs, or
                    by some help from the imagination; otherwise they will soon be dissipated by
                    sensible impressions, or grow tiresome if too long continued. Ideas are such
                    fleeting things, that they must be fixed; and so subtile, that they must be
                    expressed and delineated, as it were, by sensible marks and images; otherwise we
                    cannot attend to them, nor be much affected by them. Therefore, verbal
                    adoration, prayer, praise, thanksgiving, and confession, are admirable aids to
                    inward devotion; they fix our attention, compose and enliven our thoughts,
                    impress us more deeply with a sense of the awful presence in which we are, and,
                    by a natural and mechanical sort of influence, tend to heighten those devout
                    feelings and affections which we ought to entertain, and after this manner
                    reduce into formal and explicit acts.</p>
                <p>This holds true in a higher degree in the case of public worship, where the
                    presence of our fellow-creatures, and the powerful contagion of the social
                    affections, conspire to kindle and spread the devout flame with greater warmth
                    and energy. In fine, as God is the parent and head of the social system, as he
                    has formed us for a social state, as by the one we find the best security
                    against the ills of life, and in the other enjoy its greatest comforts, and as,
                    by means of both, our nature attains its highest improvement and perfection;
                    and, moreover, as there are public blessings and crimes in which we all in some
                    degree share, and public wants and dangers to which all are exposed; it is
                    therefore evident, that the various and solemn offices of public religion are
                    duties of indispensable moral obligation, amongst the best cements of society,
                    the firmest prop of government, and the fairest ornament of both.</p>
                <p>PART III.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">chap.</hi> i.— <hi rend="smallcaps">of “practical ethics, or
                    the culture of</hi> THE MIND.</p>
                <p>We have now gone through a particular detail of the several duties which we owe
                    to <hi rend="italic">ourselves,</hi> to <hi rend="italic">society,</hi> and to
                    <hi rend="italic">God.</hi> In considering the first order of duties, we just
                    touched on the methods of acquiring the different kinds of goods which we are
                    led by nature to pursue; only we left the consideration of the methods of
                    acquiring the moral goods of the mind to a chapter by itself, because of its
                    singular importance. This chapter, then, will contain a brief enumeration of the
                    arts of acquiring virtuous habits, and of eradicating vicious ones, as far as is
                    consistent with the brevity of such a work; a subject of the utmost difficulty
                    as well as importance in morals, to which, nevertheless, the least attention has
                    been generally given by moral writers. This will properly follow a detail of
                    duty, as it will direct us to such means or helps as are most necessary and
                    conducive to the practice of it.</p>
                <p>In the first part of this inquiry we traced the order in which the passions shoot
                    up in the different periods of human life. That order is not accidental or
                    dependent upon the caprice of men, or the influence of custom and education, but
                    arises from the original constitution and laws of our nature; of which this is
                    one, viz. that sensible objects make the first and strongest impressions on the
                    mind. These, by means of our outward organs, being conveyed to the mind, become
                    objects of its attention, on which it reflects when the outward objects are no
                    longer present, or, in other words, when the impressions upon the outward organs
                    cease. These objects of the mind’s reflection are called ideas or notions.
                    Towards these, by another law of our nature, we are not altogether indifferent;
                    but correspondent movements of desire or aversion, love or hatred, arise,
                    according as the objects which they denote made an agreeable or disagreeable
                    impression on our organs. Those ideas and affections which we experience in the
                    first period of life, we refer to the body, or to sense; the <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> taste which is formed towards them, we call a sensible,
                    or a merely natural taste, and the objects corresponding to them we in general
                    call good or pleasant.</p>
                <p>But as the mind moves forward in its course, it extends its views, and receives a
                    new and more complex set of ideas, in which it observes uniformity, variety,
                    similitude, symmetry of parts, reference to an end, novelty, grandeur. These
                    compose a vast train and diversity of imagery, which the mind compounds,
                    divides, and moulds into a thousand forms, in the absence of those objects which
                    first introduced it. And this more complicated imagery suggests a new train of
                    desires and affections, fully as sprightly and engaging as any which have yet
                    appeared. This whole class of perceptions or impressions is referred to the
                    imagination, and forms a higher taste than the sensible, and which has an
                    immediate and mighty influence on the finer passions of our nature, and is
                    commonly termed a <hi rend="italic">fine taste.</hi> The objects which
                    correspond to this taste we usually call beautiful, great, harmonious, or
                    wonderful, or in general by the name of beauty.</p>
                <p>The mind, still pushing onwards and increasing its stock of ideas, ascends from
                    these to a higher species of objects, viz. the order and mutual relations of
                    minds to each other, their reciprocal affections, characters, actions, and
                    various aspects. In these it discovers a beauty, a grandeur, a decorum, more
                    interesting and alluring than in any of the former kinds. These objects, or the
                    notions of them, passing in review before the mind, do, by a necessary law of
                    our nature, call forth another and nobler set of affections, as admiration,
                    esteem, love, honour, gratitude, benevolence, and others of the like tribe. This
                    class of perfections, and their correspondent affections, we refer, because of
                    their objects (manners), to a moral sense, and call the taste or temper they
                    excite <hi rend="italic">moral</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the objects
                    which are agreeable to this taste or temper we denominate by the general name of
                    moral beauty, in order to distinguish it from the other, which is termed
                    natural.</p>
                <p>These different sets of ideas or notions are the materials about which the mind
                    employs itself, which it blends, ranges, and diversifies in ten thousand
                    different ways. It feels a strong propension to connect and associate those
                    ideas amongst which it observes any similitude or any aptitude, whether original
                    and natural, or customary and artificial, to suggest each other. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Metaphysics.)</hi></p>
                <p>But whatever the reasons are, whether similitude, coexistence, causality, or any
                    other aptitude or relation, why any two or more ideas are connected by the mind
                    at first, it is an established law of our nature, that when two or more ideas
                    have often started in company, they form so strong an union, that it is very
                    difficult ever after to separate them. Thus the lover cannot separate the idea
                    of merit from his mistress; the courtier that of dignity from his title or
                    ribbon; the miser that of happiness from his bags. It is these associations of
                    worth or happiness with any of the different sets of objects or images before
                    specified that form our taste or complex idea of good. By an <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193825475" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5475-0482"/>other law of our nature, our
                    affections follow and are governed by this taste. And to these· affections our
                    character and conduct are similar and proportioned, on the general tenor of
                    which our happiness principally depends.</p>
                <p>As all our leading passions, then, depend on the direction which our taste takes,
                    and as it is always of the same strain with our leading associations, it is
                    worth while to inquire a little more particularly how these are: formed, in
                    order to detect the secret sources whence our passions derive their principal
                    strength, their various rises and falls. For this will give us the true key to
                    their management, and let us into the right method of correcting the bad and
                    improving the good.</p>
                <p>No kind of objects make so powerful an impression upon us as those which are
                    immediately impressed upon our senses, or strongly painted upon our
                    imaginations. Whatever is purely intellectual, as abstracted or scientific
                    truths, the subtile relations and differences of things, has a fainter sort of
                    existence in the mind, and, though it may exercise and whet the memory, the
                    judgment, or the rea- ' soning power, gives hardly any impulse at all to the
                    active powers, the passions, which are the mainsprings of motion. On the other
                    hand, were the mind entirely under the direction of sense, and impressible only
                    by such objects as are present, and strike some of the outward organs, we should
                    then be precisely in the state of the brute creation, and be governed solely by
                    instinct or appetite, and have no power to control whatever impressions are made
                    upon us. Nature has therefore endowed us with a middle faculty, wonderfully
                    adapted to our mixed state, which holds partly of sense and partly of reason;
                    being strongly allied to the former, and the common receptacle in which all the
                    notices that come from that quarter are treasured up, and yet greatly
                    subservient and ministerial to the latter, by giving a body, a coherence, and a
                    beauty to its conceptions. This middle faculty is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >imagination,</hi> one of the most busy and fruitful powers of the mind. Into
                    this common storehouse are likewise carried all those moral forms which are
                    derived from our moral faculties of perception; and there they often undergo new
                    changes and appearances, by being mixed and wrought up with the ideas and forms
                    of sensible or natural things. By this coalition of imagery, natural beauty is
                    dignified and heightened by moral qualities and perfections, and moral qualities
                    are at once exhibited and set off by natural beauty. The sensible beauty, or
                    good, is refined from its dross by partaking of the moral; and the moral
                    receives a stamp, a visible character and currency, from the sensible.</p>
                <p>As we are first of all accustomed to sensible impressions and sensible
                    enjoyments, we contract early a sensual relish or love of pleasure in the lower
                    sense of the word. In order, however, to justify this relish, the mind, as it
                    becomes open to higher perceptions of beauty and good, borrows from thence a
                    noble set of images, as fine taste, generosity, social affections, friendship,
                    good fellowship, and the like; and, by dressing out the old pursuits with these
                    new ornaments, gives them an additional dignity and lustre. By these ways the
                    desire of a table, love of finery, intrigue, and pleasure, are vastly increased
                    beyond their natural pitch, having an impulse combined of the force of the
                    natural appetites, and of the superadded strength of those passions which tend
                    to the moral species. When the mind becomes more sensible to those objects or
                    appearances in which it perceives beauty, uniformity, grandeur, and harmony, as
                    fine clothes, elegant furniture, plate, pictures, gardens, houses, equipage, the
                    beauty of animals, and particularly the attractions of the sex; to these objects
                    the mind is led by nature or taught by custom, the opinion and example of
                    others, to annex certain ideas of moral character, dignity, decorum, honour,
                    liberality, tenderness, and active or social enjoyment. The consequence of this
                    association is, that the objects to which these are annexed must rise in their
                    value, and be pursued with proportionable ardour; the enjoyment of them is often
                    attended with pleasure; and the mere possession of them, where that is wanting,
                    frequently draws respect from one’s fellow-creatures. This respect is, by many,
                    thought equivalent to the pleasure of enjoyment. Hence it happens that the idea
                    of happiness is connected with the mere possession, which is therefore eagerly
                    sought after, without any regard to the generous use or honourable enjoyment.
                    Thus the passion, resting on the means, not the end, that is, losing sight of
                    its natural object, becomes wild and extravagant.</p>
                <p>In fine, any object, or external denomination, a staff, a garter, a cup, a crown,
                    a title, may become a moral badge or emblem of merit, màgnificence, or honour,
                    according as these distinctions have been found or thought, by the possessors or
                    admirers of them, to accompany them; yet, by the deception formerly mentioned,
                    the merit or the conduct which entitled, or should entitle, to those marks of
                    distinction, shall be forgot or neglected, and the badges themselves be
                    passionately affected or pursued, as including every excellence. If these are
                    attained by any means, all the concomitants which nature, custom, or accidents
                    have joined to them, will be supposed to follow of course. Thus, moral ends,
                    with which the unhappy admirer is apt to colour over his passion and views,
                    will, in his opinion, justify the most immoral means; as prostitution,
                    adulation, fraud, treachery, and every species of knavery, whether more open or
                    more disguised.</p>
                <p>When men are once engaged in active life, and find that wealth and power,
                    generally called <hi rend="italic">interest,</hi> are the great avenues to every
                    kind of enjoyment, they are apt to throw in many engaging moral forms to the
                    object of their pursuit, in order to justify their passion, and varnish over the
                    measures they take to gratify it, as independence on the vices or passions of
                    others, provision and security to themselves and friends, prudent economy or
                    well-placed charity, social communication, superiority to their enemies, who are
                    all villains, honourable service, and many other ingredients of merit. To attain
                    such capacities of usefulness or enjoyment, what arts, nay what meannesses, can
                    be thought blameable by those cool pursuers of their own interest. Nor have they
                    whom the gay World are pleased to indulge with the title of men of pleasure,
                    their imaginations less pregnant with moral images, with which they never fail
                    to ennoble, or, if they cannot do that, to palliate their gross pursuits. Thus
                    admiration of wit, of sentiments and merit, friendship, love, generous sympathy,
                    mutual confidence, giving and receiving pleasure, are the ordinary ingredients
                    with which they season their gallantry and pleasurable entertainments, and by
                    which they impose on themselves, and endeavour to impose on others, that their
                    amours are the joint issue of good sense and virtue.</p>
                <p>These associations, variously combined and proportioned by the imagination, form
                    the leading private passions which govern the lives of the generality, as the
                    love of action, of pleasure, power, wealth, and fame; they influence the
                    defensive, and affect the public passions, and raise joy or sorrow as they arp
                    gratified or disappointed; so that in effect these associations of good and
                    evil, beauty and deformity, and the passions they raise, are the main hinges of
                    life and manners, and the great sources of our happiness or misery. It is very
                    evident, therefore, that the whole of moral culture must depend on giving a
                    right direction to the leading passions, and duly proportioning them to the
                    value of the objects or goods pursued, under what name soever they may
                    appear.</p>
                <p>Now, in order to give them this right direction and due proportion, it appears,
                    from the foregoing detail, that those associations of ideas, upon which the
                    passions depend, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825488"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-5488-0483"/>must be duly regulated: that is to say, as an
                    exorbitant passion for wealth, pleasure, or power, flows from an association or
                    opinion, that more beauty and good, whether natural or moral, enters into the
                    enjoyment or possession of them, than really belongs to either, therefore, in
                    restoring those passions to their just proportion, we must begin with correcting
                    the opinion, or breaking the false association; or, in other words, we must
                    decompound the complex phantom of happiness or good, which we fondly admire;
                    disunite those ideas which have no natural alliance; and separate the original
                    idea of wealth, power, or pleasure, from the foreign mixtures incorporated with
                    it, which enhance its value, or give it its chief power to enchant and seduce
                    the mind. For instance, let it be considered how poor and inconsiderable a thing
                    wealth is, if it be disjoined from real use, or from ideas of capacity in the
                    possessor to do good, from independence, generosity, provision for a family or
                    friends, and social communication with others. By this standard let its true
                    value be fixed, let its misapplication or unbenevolent enjoyment be accounted
                    sordid and infamous, and nothing worthy or estimable be ascribed to the mere
                    possession of it which is not borrowed from its generous use.</p>
                <p>If that complex form of good which is called <hi rend="italic">pleasure</hi>
                    engage us, le,t fit be analysed into its constituent principles, or those
                    allurements it draws from the heart and imagination, in order to heighten the
                    low part of the indulgence; let the separate and comparative import of each be
                    distinctly ascertained and deduced from that gross part, and this remainder of
                    the accumulated enjoyment will dwindle down into a poor, insipid, transitory
                    thing. In proportion as the opinion of the good pursued abates, the admiration
                    must decay, and the passions lose strength of course. One effectual way to lower
                    the opinion, and consequently to weaken the habit founded upon it, is to
                    practise lesser pieces of self-denial, or to abstain, to a certain pitch, from
                    the pursuit or enjoyment of the favourite object; and, that this may be the more
                    easily accomplished, one must avoid those occasions, that company, those places,
                    and the other circumstances, that inflamed the one and endeared the other. And,
                    as a counter-process, let higher or even different enjoyments be brought in
                    view, other passions played upon the former, different places frequented, other
                    exercises tried, company kept with persons of a different or more correct way of
                    thinking both in natural and moral subjects.</p>
                <p>As much depends on our setting out well in life, let the youthful fancy, which is
                    apt to be very florid and luxuriant, be early accustomed, by instruction,
                    example, and significant moral exercises, nay, by looks, gestures, and every
                    other testimony of just approbation or blame, to annex ideas of merit, honour,
                    and happiness, not to birth, dress, rank, beauty, fortune, power, popularity,
                    and the like outward things, but to moral and truly virtuous qualities, and to
                    those enjoyments which spring from a well-informed judgment and a regular
                    conduct of the affections, especially those of the social and disinterested
                    kind. Such dignified forms of beauty and good, often suggested, and by moving
                    pictures and examples warmly recommended to the imagination, enforced by the
                    authority of conscience, and demonstrated by reason to be the surest means of
                    enjoyment, and the only independent, undeprivable, and durable goods, will be
                    the best counterbalance to meaner passions, and the firmest foundation and
                    security of virtue.</p>
                <p>It is of great importance to the forming a just taste, or pure and large
                    conceptions of happiness, to study and understand human nature well, to remember
                    what a complicated system it is, particularly to have deeply imprinted on our
                    mind that <hi rend="italic">gradation</hi> of senses, faculties, and powers of
                    enjoyment formerly mentioned, and the subordination of goods resulting from
                    thence, which nature points out, and the experience of mankind confirms. Who,
                    when they think seriously, and are not under the immediate influence of some
                    violent prejudice or passion, prefer not the pleasures of action, contemplation,
                    society, and most exercises and joys of the moral kind, as friendship, natural
                    affection, and the like, to all sensual gratifications whatsoever? Where the
                    different species of pleasure are blended into one complex form, let them be
                    accurately distinguished, and be referred each to its proper faculty and sense,
                    and examined apart what they have peculiar, what common with others, and what
                    foreign and adventitious. Let wealth, grandeur, luxury, love, fame, and the
                    like, be tried by this test, and their true alloy will be found out. Let it be
                    further considered, whether the mind may not be easy and enjoy itself greatly,
                    though it want many of those elegancies and superfluities of life which some
                    possess, or that load of wealth and power which others eagerly pursue, and under
                    which they groan. Let the difficulty of attaining, the precariousness of
                    possessing, and the many abatements in enjoying, overgrown wealth and envied
                    greatness, <hi rend="italic">of</hi> which the weary possessors so frequently
                    complain, as the hurry of business, the burden of company, of paying attendance
                    to the few, and giving it to many, the cares of keeping, the fears of losing,
                    and the desires of increasing what they have, and the other troubles which
                    accompany this pitiful drudgery and pompous servitude; let these and the like
                    circumstances be often considered, that are conducive to the removing or
                    lessening the opinion of such goods, and the attendant passion or set of
                    passions will decay of course.</p>
                <p>Let the peculiar bent of our nature and character be observed, whether we are
                    most inclined to form associations and relish objects of the sensible,
                    intellectual, or moral kind. Let that which has the ascendant be particularly
                    watched; let it be directed to right objects, be improved by proportioned
                    exercises, and guarded by proper checks from an opposite quarter. Thus the
                    sensible turn may be exalted by the intellectual, and a taste for the beauty of
                    the fine arts, and both may be made subservient to convey and rivet sentiments
                    highly moral and public-spirited. This inward survey must extend to the strength
                    and weaknesses of one’s nature, conditions, connections, habitudes, fortunes,
                    studies, acquaintance, and the other circumstances of life, from which every man
                    will form the justest estimate of his own dispositions and character, and the
                    best rules for correcting and improving them. And in order to do this with more
                    advantage, let those times or critical seasons be watched when the mind is best
                    disposed towards a change; and let them be improved by rigorous resolutions,
                    promises, or whatever else will engage the mind to persevere in virtue. Let the
                    conduct, in fine, be often reviewed, and the causes of its corruption or
                    improvement be carefully observed.</p>
                <p>It will greatly conduce to refine the moral taste and strengthen the virtuous
                    temper, to accustom the mind to the frequent exercise of moral sentiments and
                    determinations, by reading history, poetry, particularly of the picturesque and
                    dramatic kind, the study of the fine arts; by conversing with the most eminent
                    for good sense and virtue; and, above all, by frequent and repeated acts of
                    humanity, compassion, friendship, politeness, and hospitality. It is exercise
                    that gives health and strength. He who reasons most frequently becomes the
                    wisest, and most enjoys the pleasures of wisdom. He who is most often affected
                    by objects of compassion in poetry, history, or real life, will have his soul
                    most open to pity, and its delightful pains and duties. So he also who practises
                    most diligently the offices of kindness and charity, will by it cultivate that
                    disposition whence must arise all his pretensions to personal merit, his present
                    and his future happiness.</p>
                <p>An useful and honourable employment in life will administer a thousand
                    opportunities of this kind, and greatiy <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825501"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-5501-0484"/>strengthen a sense of virtue and good affections,
                    which, as well as our understandings, must be nourished by light training. For
                    such an employment, by enlarging one’s experience, giving a habit of attention
                    and caution, or obliging one, from necessity or interest, to keep a guard over
                    the passions, and to study the outward decencies and appearances of virtue, will
                    by degrees produce a good habit, and at length insinuate the love of virtue and
                    honesty for its own sake.</p>
                <p>It is a great inducement to the exercise of benevolence to view human nature in a
                    favourable light, to observe the characters and circumstances of mankind on the
                    fairest sides, to put the best constructions they will bear on their actions,
                    and to consider them as the result <hi rend="italic">of</hi> partial and
                    mistaken rather than ill affections, or, at worst, as the excesses of a
                    pardonable self-love, seldom or never the effect of pure malice.</p>
                <p>Above all, the nature and consequences of virtue and vice, such consequences
                    being the law of our nature and will of Heaven, the light in which they appear
                    to our Supreme Parent and Lawgiver, and the reception they will meet with from
                    him, must be often attended to. The exercises of piety, as adoration and praise
                    of the divine excellence, invocation of and dependence on his aid, confession,
                    thanksgiving, and resignation, are habitually to be indulged, and frequently
                    performed, not only as medicinal, but highly improving to the temper.</p>
                <p>In fine, it will be of admirable efficacy towards eradicating bad habits, and
                    implanting good ones, frequently to contemplate human life as the great nursery
                    of our future and immortal existence, as that state of probation in which we are
                    to be educated for a divine life; to remember that our virtues or vices will be
                    as immortal as ourselves, and influence our future as well as our present
                    happiness, and therefore, that every disposition and action is to be regarded as
                    pointing beyond the present to an immortal duration. An habitual attention to
                    this wide and important connection will give a vast compass and dignity to our
                    sentiments and actions, a noble superiority to the pleasures and pains of life,
                    and a generous ambition to render our virtue as immortal as our being.</p>
                <p>CHAP. II MOTIVES TO VIRTUE FROM PERSONAL</p>
                <p>HAPPINESS.</p>
                <p>We have already considered our obligations to the practice of virtue, arising
                    from the constitution of our nature, by which we are led to approve a certain
                    order and economy of affections, and a certain course of action correspondent to
                    it. But, besides this, there are several motives which strengthen and secure
                    virtue, though not themselves of a moral kind. These are, its tendency to
                    personal happiness, and the contrary tendency of vice. Personal happiness arises
                    either from the state of a man’s own mind, or from the state and disposition of
                    external causes towards him.</p>
                <p>We shall first examine the tendency of virtue to happiness with respect to the
                    state of a man’s own mind. .This is a point of the utmost consequence in morals,
                    because, unless we can convince ourselves, or show to others, that, by doing our
                    duty, or fulfilling our moral obligations, we consult the greatest satisfaction
                    of our own mind, or our highest interest on the whole, it will raise strong and
                    often unsurmountable prejudices against the practice of virtue, especially
                    whenever there arise any appearances of opposition between our duty and our
                    satisfaction or interest. To creatures so desirous of happiness, and so averse
                    to misery, as we are, and often so oddly situated amidst contending passions and
                    interests, it is necessary that virtue should appear not only in an honourable,
                    but a pleasing and beneficent form; and in order to justify our choice to
                    ourselves as well as to others, we must ourselves feel and be able to avow in
                    the face of the whole world, that her ways are ways of pleasantness, and her
                    paths the paths of peace. This will show, beyond all contradiction, that we not
                    only approve what is good, but can give a sufficient reason for our own
                    conduct.</p>
                <p>Let any man in a cool hour, when he is disengaged from business, and undisturbed
                    by passion (such cool hours will sometimes occur), sit down, and seriously
                    reflect with himself what state or temper of mind he would choose to feel and
                    indulge, in order to be easy and to enjoy himself. Would he choose, for that
                    purpose, to be in a constant dissipation and hurry of thought; to be disturbed
                    in the exercise of his reason; to have various and often interfering phantoms of
                    good playing before his imagination, soliciting and distracting him by turns,
                    now soothing him with amUsing hopes, then torturing him with anxious fears, and
                    to approve this minute what he shall condemn the next? Would he choose to have a
                    strong and painful sense of every petty injury; quick apprehensions of every
                    impending evil; incessant and insatiable desires <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    power, wealth, honour, pleasure; an irreconcilable antipathy against all
                    competitors and rivals; insolent and tyrannical dispositions to all below him;
                    fawning, and at the same time envious, dispositions to all above him, with dark
                    suspicions and jealousies of every mortal? Would he choose neither to love nor
                    be beloved of any; to have no friend in whom to confide, or with whom to
                    interchange his sentiments or designs; no favourite, on whom to bestow his
                    kindness, or vent his passions; and to be conscious of no merit with mankind, no
                    esteem from any creature, no good affection to his Maker, no concern for, nor
                    hopes of, his approbation; but instead of all these, to hate, and know that he
                    is hated, to condemn, and know that he is condemned, by all, by the good because
                    he is so unlike, and by the bad because he is so like, themselves; to hate or to
                    dread the very Being that made him; and, in short, to make his breast the seat
                    of pride and passion, petulance and revenge, deep melancholy, cool malignity,
                    and all the other furies that ever possessed and tortured mankind? Would our
                    calm inquirer after happiness pitch on such a state, and such a temper of mind,
                    as the most likely means to put him in possession of his desired ease and
                    self-enjoyment?</p>
                <p>Or would he rather choose a serene and easy flow of thought; a reason clear and
                    composed; a judgment unbiassed by prejudice, and undistracted bypassion; a sober
                    and well-governed fancy, which presents the images of things true and unmixed
                    with delusive and unnatural charms, and therefore administers no improper or
                    dangerous fuel to the passions, but leaves the mind free to choose or reject, as
                    becomes a reasonable creature; a sweet and sedate temper, not easily ruffled by
                    hopes or fears, prone neither to suspicion nor revenge, apt to view men and
                    things in the fairest lights, and to bend gently to the humours of others rather
                    than obstinately to contend with them? Would he choose such moderation and
                    continence of mind, as neither to be ambitious of power, fond of honours,
                    covetous of wealth, nor a slave to pleasure; a mind of course neither elated
                    with success, nor dejected with disappointment; such a modest and noble spirit
                    as supports power without insolence, wears honour without pride, uses wealth
                    without profusion or parsimony, and rejoices more in giving than in receiving
                    pleasure; such fortitude and equanimity as rises above misfortunes, or turns
                    them into blessings; such integrity and greatness of mind as neither flatters
                    the vices nor triumphs over the follies of men, as equally spurns· servitude and
                    tyranny, and will neither engage in low designs, nor abet them in others? Would
                    he choose, in fine, such mildness and benignity of heart as <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193825514" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5514-0485"/>takes part in all the joys,
                    and refuses none of the sorrows, of others; stands well affected to all mankind;
                    is conscious of meriting the esteem of all, and of being beloved by the best; a
                    mind which delights in doing good without any show, and yet arrogates nothing on
                    that account; rejoices in loving and being beloved by its Maker, acts ever under
                    his eye, resigns itself to his providence, and triumphs in his approbation?
                    Which of these dispositions would be his choice in order to become contented,
                    serene, and happy? The former temper is <hi rend="italic">vice,</hi> the latter
                    <hi rend="italic">virtue.</hi> Where one prevails, there <hi rend="italic"
                    >misery</hi> prevails, and by the generality is acknowledged to prevail. Where
                    the other reigns, there <hi rend="italic">happiness</hi> reigns, and by the
                    confession of mankind is acknowledged to reign. The perfection of either temper
                    is misery or happiness in perfection. Therefore, every approach to either
                    extreme is an approach to misery or to happiness, that is, every degree of vice
                    or virtue is accompanied with a proportional degree of misery or happiness.</p>
                <p>The principal alleviations of a virtuous man’s calamities are these: That though
                    some of them may have been the effect of his imprudence or weakness, yet few of
                    them are sharpened by a sense of guilt, and none of them by a consciousness of
                    wickedness, which surely is their keenest sting; that they are common to him
                    with the best of men; that they seldom or never attack him quite unprepared, but
                    rather guarded with a consciousness of his own sincerity and virtue, with a
                    faith and trust in Providence, and a firm resignation to its perfect orders;
                    that they may be improved as means of correction, or materials to give scope and
                    stability to his virtues; and, to say no more, that they are considerably
                    lessened, and often sweetened to him, by the general sympathy of the wise and
                    good.</p>
                <p>His enjoyments are more numerous, or, if less numerous, yet more intense, than
                    those of the bad man; for he shares in the joys of others by rebound, and every
                    increase of general or particular happiness is a real addition to his own. It is
                    true, his friendly sympathy with others subjects him to some pains which the
                    hard-hearted wretch does not feel; yet to give a loose rein to it, is a kind of
                    agreeable discharge. It is such a sorrow as he loves to indulge; a sort of
                    pleasing anguish, which sweetly melts the mind, and terminates in a
                    self-approving joy. Though the good man may want means to execute, or be
                    disappointed in the success of his benevolent purposes, yet, as was formerly
                    observed, he is still conscious of good affection, and that consciousness is an
                    enjoyment of a more delightful savour than the greatest triumphs if successful
                    vice. If the ambitious, covetous, or voluptuous, are disappointed, their
                    passions recoil upon them with a fury proportioned to their opinion of the value
                    of what they pursue, and their hope of success; whilst they have nothing within
                    to balance the disappointment, unless it be an useless fund of pride, which,
                    however, frequently turns mere accidents into mortifying affronts, and exalts
                    grief into rage and frenzy. But the meek, humble, and benevolent temper is its
                    own reward, and is satisfied from within; as it magnifies greatly the pleasure
                    of success, so it wonderfully alleviates, and in a manner annihilates, all pain
                    for the want of it.</p>
                <p>As the good man is conscious of loving and wishing well to all mankind, he must
                    be sensible of his deserving the esteem and good will of all; and this supposed
                    reciprocation of social feelings is, by the very frame of our nature, made a
                    source of very intense and enlivening joys. By this sympathy of affections and
                    interests, he feels himself intimately united with the human race; and, being
                    sensibly alive over the whole system, his heart receives and becomes responsive
                    to every touch given to any part. Thus, as an eminent philosopher<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Shaftesbury, Inquiry into
                    Virtue, book ii.</p></note> finely expresses it, he gathers contentment and
                    delight from the pleased and happy states of those around him; from accounts and
                    relations of such happiness; from the very countenances, gestures, voices, and
                    sounds, even of creatures foreign to our kind, whose signs of joy and
                    contentment he can any way discern. Nor do those generous affections stop any
                    other natural source of joy whatever, or deaden his sense of any innocent
                    gratification. They rather keep the several senses and powers of enjoyment open
                    and disengaged, intense and uncorrupted by riot or abuse; as is evident to
                    anyone who considers the dissipated, unfeeling state of men of pleasure,
                    ambition, or interest, and compares it with the serene and gentle state of a
                    mind at peace with itself, and friendly to all mankind, unruffled by any violent
                    emotion, and sensible to every good-natured and alluring joy.</p>
                <p>It were easy, by going through the different sets of affections formerly
                    mentioned, to show, that it is only by maintaining the proportion settled there,
                    that the mind arrives at true repose and satisfaction. If fear exceeds that
                    proportion, it sinks into melancholy and dejection. If anger passes just bounds,
                    it ferments into rage and revenge, or subsides into a sullen corroding gloom,
                    which embitters every good, and renders one exquisitely sensible to every ill.
                    The private passions, the love of honour especially, the impulses of which are
                    more generous, as itseffects are more diffusive, are instruments of private
                    pleasure; but if they are disproportioned to our wants, or to the value of their
                    several objects, or to the balance of other passions equally necessary and more
                    amiable, they become instruments <hi rend="italic">of</hi> intense pain and
                    misery. For, being now destitute of that counterpoise which held them at a due
                    pitch, they grow turbulent, peevish, and revengeful, the cause of constant
                    restlessness and torment, sometimes flying out into a wild delirious joy, at
                    other times settling in a deep splenetic grief. The concert between reason and
                    passion is then broken; all is dissonance and distraction within. The mind is
                    out of frame, and feels an agony proportioned to the violence of the reigning
                    passion.</p>
                <p>The case is much the same, or rather worse, when any of the particular kind
                    affections are out of their natural order and proportion; as happens in the case
                    of effeminate pity, exorbitant love, parental dotage, or any party passion,
                    where the just regards to society are supplanted. The more social and
                    disinterested the passion is, it breaks out into the wilder excesses, and makes
                    the more dreadful havoc both within and abroad; as is but too apparent in those
                    cases where a false species of religion, honour, zeal, or party rage, has seized
                    on the natural enthusiasm of the mind, and worked it up to madness. It breaks
                    through all ties natural and civil, disregards the most sacred and solemn
                    obligations, silences every other affection whether public or private, and
                    transforms the most gentle natures into the most savage and inhuman.</p>
                <p>But the man who keeps the balance of affection even, is easy and serene in his
                    motions, mild and yet affectionate, uniform and consistent with himself; he is
                    not liable to disagreeable collisions of interests and passions; ^ives always
                    place to the most friendly and humane affections, and never to dispositions or
                    acts of resentment, but on high occasions, when the security of the private, or
                    welfare of the public system, or the great interests of mankind, necessarily
                    require a noble indignation, and even then he observes a just measure in wrath;
                    and, last of all, he proportions every passion to the value of the object he
                    affects, or to the importance of the end he pursues.</p>
                <p>To sum up this part of the argument, the honest and good man has eminently the
                    advantage of the knavish and selfish wretch in every respect. The pleasures
                    which the last enjoys flow chiefly from external advantages and gratifications;
                    they are superficial and transitory, dashed with <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193825527" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5527-0486"/>long intervals of satiety,
                    and frequent returns of remorse and fear, dependent on favourable accidents and
                    conjunctures, and subjected to the humours of men. But the good man is satisfied
                    with himself; his principal possessions lie within, and therefore beyond the
                    reach of the caprice of men or fortune; his enjoyments are exquisite and
                    permanent, accompanied with no inward checks to damp them, and always with ideas
                    of dignity and self-approbation, and they may be tasted at any time, and in any
                    place. The gratifications of vice are turbulent and unnatural, generally arising
                    from the relief of passions in themselves intolerable, and issuing in tormenting
                    reflection; often irritated by disappointment, always inflamed by enjoyment, and
                    yet ever cloyed with repetition. The pleasures of virtue are calm and natural,
                    flowing from the exercise of kind affections, or delightful reflections in
                    consequence of them; not only agreeable in the prospect, but in the present
                    feeling, they never satiate nor lose their relish, nay, rather the admiration of
                    virtue grows stronger every day; not only is the desire, but the enjoyment,
                    heightened by every new gratification, and, unlike to most others, it is
                    increased, not diminished, by sympathy and communication. In fine, the
                    satisfactions of virtue maybe purchased without a bribe, and possessed in the
                    humblest as well as in the most triumphant fortune; they can bear the strictest
                    review, and do not change with circumstances, nor grow old with time. Force
                    cannot rob, nor fraud cheat us of them; and, to crown all, instead of abating,
                    they enhance every other pleasure.</p>
                <p>But the happy consequences of virtue are seen not only in the internal enjoyments
                    it affords a man, but in the favourable disposition of external causes towards
                    him, to which it contributes. As virtue gives the sober possession of one’s
                    self, and the command of one’s passions, the consequence must be heart’s ease,
                    and a fine natural flow of spirits, which conduce more than any thing else to
                    health and long life. Violent passions, and the excesses they occasion,
                    gradually impair and wear down the machine. But the calm, placid state of a
                    temperate mind, and the healthful exercises in which virtue engages her faithful
                    votaries, preserve the natural functions in full vigour and harmony, and
                    exhilarate the spirits, which are the chief instruments of action.</p>
                <p>It may be thought odd by some to assert that virtue is no enemy to a man’s
                    fortune in the present state of things. But if by fortune be meant a moderate or
                    competent share of wealth, power, or credit, not overgrown degrees of them, what
                    should hinder the virtuous man from obtaining that? He cannot cringe nor fawn,
                    it is true, but he can be civil and obliging as well as the knave; and surely
                    his civility is more alluring, because it has more manliness and grace in it
                    than the mean adulation of the other. He cannot cheat nor undermine, but he may
                    be cautious, provident, watchful of occasions, and equally prompt with the rogue
                    in improving them. He scorns to prostitute himself as a pander to the passions
                    or as a tool to the vices of mankind, but he may have as sound an understanding
                    and as good capacities for promoting their real interests as the veriest court
                    slave; and then he is more faithful and true to those who employ him. In the
                    common course of business, he has the same chances with the knave of acquiring a
                    fortune, and rising in the world. He may have equal abilities, equal industry,
                    equal attention to business, and in other respects he has greatly the advantage
                    of him. People love better to deal with him; they can trust him more; they know
                    he will not impose upon them, nor take advantage of them, and they can depend
                    more on his word than on the oath or strongest securities of others. But what is
                    commonly called <hi rend="italic">cunning·,</hi> which is the offspring of
                    ignorance, and the constant companion of knavery, is not only a mean-spirited,
                    but a very short-sighted talent, and a fundamental obstacle in the road of
                    business. It may, indeed, procure immediate and petty gains; but it is attended
                    with dreadful abatements, which do more than overbalance them, both as it sinks
                    a man’s credit when discovered, and cramps that largeness of mind which extends
                    to the remotest as well as the nearest interest, and takes in the most durable
                    equally with the most transient gains. It is therefore easy to see how much a
                    man’s credit and reputation, and consequently his success, depend upon his
                    honesty and virtue.</p>
                <p>With regard to security and peace with his neighbours, it may be thought perhaps
                    that the man of a quiet forgiving temper, and an overflowing benevolence and
                    courtesy, is much exposed to injury and affronts from every proud or peevish
                    mortal who has the power or will to do mischief. If we suppose, indeed, this
                    quietness and gentleness of nature accompanied with cowardice and pusillanimity,
                    this may often be the case; but in reality the good man is as bold as a lion,
                    and so much the bolder for being the calmer. Such a person will hardly become a
                    butt to mankind. The ill natured will be afraid to provoke him, and the good
                    natured will not incline to do it. Besides, true virtue, which is conducted by
                    reason, and exerted gracefully and without parade, is a most insinuating and
                    commanding thing; if it cannot disarm malice and resentment at once, it will
                    wear them out by degrees, and subdue them at length. How many have, by favours
                    and by prudently yielding, triumphed over an enemy, who would have been inflamed
                    into tenfold rage by the fiercest opposition. In fine, goodness is the most
                    universally popular thing that can be imagined.</p>
                <p>In a word, the good man may have some enemies, but he will have more friends;
                    and, having given so many marks of private friendship and public virtue, he can
                    hardly be destitute of a patron to protect, or a sanctuary to entertain him, or
                    to protect or entertain his children when he is gone. Though he should have
                    little else to leave them, he bequeaths them the fairest, and generally the most
                    unenvied inheritance of a good name, which, like good seed sown in the field of
                    futurity, will often raise up unsolicited friends, and yield a benevolent
                    harvest of unexpected charities. But should the fragrance of the parent’s virtue
                    prove offensive to a perverse or envious age, or even draw persecution on the
                    friendless orphans, there is One in heaven who will be more than a father to
                    them, and recompense their parent’s virtues by showering down blessings on
                    them.</p>
                <p>CHAP. in. MOTIVES TO VIRTUE FROM THE BEING ANO</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">providence of god.</hi></p>
                <p>Besides the interesting incentive mentioned in the last chapter, there are two
                    great motives to virtue strictly connected with human life, and resulting from
                    the very constitution of the human mind. The first is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >being and providence of God;</hi> the second is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >immortality of the soul,</hi> with future rewards and punishments.</p>
                <p>It appears (from chap. iv. of part ii.) that man, by the constitution of his
                    nature, is designed to be a <hi rend="italic">religious creature.</hi> He is
                    intimately connected with the Deity, and necessarily dependent on him. From that
                    connection and necessary dependence result various obligations and duties,
                    without fulfilling which some of his most sublime powers and affections would be
                    incomplete and abortive. If he be likewise an <hi rend="italic">immortal</hi>
                    creature, and if his present conduct shall affect his future happiness in
                    another state as well as in the present, it is evident that we take only a
                    partial view of the creature if we leave out this important property of bis
                    nature, and make a partial estimate of human life if we strike out of the
                    account, or overlook, that part of his duration which runs out into
                    eternity.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825540" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5540-0487"/>
                <p>It is evident, from the above-mentioned chapter, that to have a respect to the
                    Deity in our temper and conduct, to venerate and love his character, to adore
                    his goodness, to depend upon and resign ourselves to his providence, to seek his
                    approbation, and act under a sense of his authority, is a fundamental part of
                    moral virtue, and the completion of the highest destination of our nature. But
                    as piety is an essential part of virtue, so likewise it is a great support and
                    enforcement to the practice of it. To contemplate and admire a being of such
                    transcendent dignity and perfection as God, must naturally and necessarily open
                    and enlarge the mind, give a freedom and ampleness to its powers, and a grandeur
                    and elevation to its aims. For, as an excellent divine observes, the greatness
                    of an object, and the excellency of the act of any <hi rend="italic">agent</hi>
                    about a transcendent object, doth mightily tend to the enlargement and
                    improvement of his faculties. Little objects, mean company, mean cares, and mean
                    business, cramp the mind, contract its views, and give it a creeping air and
                    deportment. But when it soars above mortal cares and mortal pursuits, into the
                    regions of divinity, and converses with the greatest and best of beings, it
                    spreads itself into a wider compass, takes higher flights in reason and
                    goodness, and becomes godlike in its air and manners. Virtue is, if one may say
                    so, both the effect and the cause of enlargement of mind. It requires that one
                    should think freely, and act nobly. Now what can conduce more to freedom of
                    thought and dignity of action than to conceive worthily of God, to reverence and
                    adore his unrivalled excellence. to imitate and transcribe that excellence into
                    our own nature, to remember our relation to him, and that we are the images and
                    representatives of his glory to the rest of the creation? Such feelings and
                    exercises must and will make us scorn all actions which are base, unhandsome, or
                    unworthy our state; and the relation we stand in to God will irradiate the mind
                    with the light of wisdom, and ennoble it with the liberty and dominion of
                    virtue.</p>
                <p>The influence and efficacy of religion may be consider-! ed in another light. We
                    all know that the presence of a friend, a neighbour, or any number of
                    spectators, but especially an august assembly of them, operates as a
                    considerable check upon the conduct of one who is not lost to all sense of
                    honour and shame, and contributes to restrain many irregular sallies of passion.
                    In the same manner, we may imagine, that the awe of some superior mind, who is
                    supposed to be privy to our secret conduct, and armed with full power to reward
                    or punish it, will impose a restraint on us in such actions as fall not under
                    the control or animadversion of others. If we go still higher, and suppose our
                    inmost thoughts and darkest designs, as well as our most secret actions, to lie
                    open to the notice of the Supreme and Universal Mind, who is both the spectator
                    and judge of human actions, it is evident that the belief of so august a
                    presence, and such awful inspection, must carry a restraint and weight with it
                    proportioned to the strength of that belief, and be an additional motive to the
                    practice of many duties which would not have been performed without it.</p>
                <p>It may be observed further, that to live under an habitual sense of the Deity and
                    his great administration, is to be conversant with wisdom, order, and beauty, in
                    the highest subjects, and to receive the delightful reflections and benign
                    feelings which these excite whilst they radiate upon him from every scene of
                    nature and providence. How improving must such views be to the mind, in dilating
                    and exalting it above those puny interests and competitions which agitate and
                    inflame the bulk of mankind against each other.</p>
                <p>CHAP. IV.—MOTIVE TO VIRTUE FROM THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL.</p>
                <p>The other motive mentioned was the immortality of the soul, with future rewards
                    and punishments. The metaphysical proofs of the soul’s immortality are commonly
                    drawn from its simple, uncompounded, and indivisible nature, whence it is
                    concluded that it cannot be corrupted or extinguished by a dissolution or
                    destruction of its parts; from its having a beginning of motion within itself,
                    whence it is inferred that it cannot discontinue and lose its motion; from the
                    different properties of matter and mind, the sluggishness and inactivity of the
                    one, and the immense activity of the other, its prodigious flight of thought and
                    imagination, its penetration, memory, foresight, and anticipations of futurity,
                    whence it is concluded that a being of so divine a nature cannot be
                    extinguished. But as these metaphysical proofs depend upon intricate reasonings
                    concerning the nature, properties, and distinctions of body and mind, with which
                    we are not very well acquainted, they are not obvious to ordinary
                    understandings, and are seldom so convincing even to those of higher reach, as
                    not to leave some doubts behind them. Therefore perhaps it is not so safe to
                    rest the proof of such an important article upon what many may call the
                    subtilties of school learning. Those proofs which are brought from analogy, from
                    the moral constitution and phenomena of the human mind, the moral attributes of
                    God, and the present course of things, and which therefore are called the moral
                    arguments, are the plainest and generally the most satisfying. We shall select
                    only one or two from the rest.</p>
                <p>In tracing the nature and destination of any being, we form the surest judgment
                    from his powers of action, and the scope and limits of these, compared with his
                    state, or with that field in which they are exercised. If this being passes
                    through different states, or fields of action, and we find a succession of
                    powers adapted to the different periods of his progress, we conclude that he was
                    destined for those successive states, and reckon his nature progressive. If,
                    besides the immediate set of powers which fit him for action in his present
                    state, we observe another set which appear superfluous if he were to be confined
                    to it, and which point to another or higher one, we naturally conclude, that he
                    is not designed to remain in his present state, but to advance to that for which
                    those supernumerary powers are adapted. Thus we argue, that the insect, which
                    has wings forming or formed, and all the apparatus proper for flight, is not
                    destined always to creep upon the ground, or to continue in the torpid state of
                    adhering to a wall, but is designed in its season to take its flight in air.
                    Without this fur∣ther destination, the admirable mechanism of wings and the
                    other apparatus would be useless and absurd. The same kind of reasoning may be
                    applied to man, whilst he lives only a sort of vegetative life in the womb. He
                    is furnished even there with a beautiful apparatus of organs, eyes, ears, and
                    other delicate senses, which receive nourishment, indeed, but are in a manner
                    folded up, and have no proper exercise or use in their present confinement.<note

                    spectator, who never had any connection with man, nor the least acquaintance
                    with human affairs, to see this odd phenomenon, a creature formed after such a
                    manner, and placed in a situation apparently unsuitable to such various
                    machinery: must he not be strangely puzzled about the use of his complicated
                    structure, and reckon such a profusion of art and admirable workmanship lost on
                    the subject; or reason by way of anticipation, that a creature endowed with such
                    various yet unexerted capacities, was destined for a more enlarged <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193825553" xml:id="kp-eb0715-5553-0488"/>sphere of action,
                    in which those latent capacities shall have full play? The vast variety and yet
                    beautiful symmetry and proportions of the several parts and organs with which
                    the creature is endowed, and their apt cohesion with, and dependence on, the
                    curious receptacle of their life and nourishment, would forbid his concluding
                    the whole to be the birth of chance, or the bungling effort of an unskilful
                    artist; at-least would make him demur a while at so harsh a sentence. But if,
                    whilst he is in this state of uncertainty, we suppose him to see the babe, after
                    a few successful struggles, throwing off his fetters, breaking loose from his
                    little dark prison, and emerging into open day, then unfolding his recluse and
                    dormant powers, breathing air, gazing at light, admiring colours, sounds, and
                    all the fair variety of nature, immediately his doubts clear up, the propriety
                    and excellency of the workmanship dawn upon him with full lustre, and the whole
                    mystery of the first period is unravelled by the opening of this new scene.
                    Though in this second period the creature lives chiefly a kind of animal life,
                    that is, a life of sense and appetite, yet by various trials and observations he
                    gains experience, and by the gradual evolution of the powers of imagination he
                    ripens apace for a higher life, for exercising the arts of design and imitation,
                    and of those in which strength or dexterity are more requisite than acuteness or
                    reach of judgment. In the succeeding rational or intellectual period, his
                    understanding, which formerly crept in a lower, mounts into a higher sphere,
                    canvasses the nature and judges of the relations of things, forms schemes,
                    deduces consequences from what is past, and from present as well as past
                    collects future events. By this succession of states, and of correspondent
                    culture, he grows up at length into a moral, a social, and a political creature.
                    This is the last period at which we perceive him to arrive in this his mortal
                    career. Each period is introductory to the next succeeding one; each life is a
                    field of exercise and improvement for the next higher one; the life of the
                    foetus for that of the infant, the life of the infant for that of the child, and
                    all the lower for the highest and best.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Butler’s Analogy, part i.</p></note> But is this the last
                    period of nature’s progression? Is this the utmost extent of her plot, where she
                    winds up the drama, and dismisses the actor into eternal oblivion? Or does he
                    appear to be invested with supernumerary powers, which have not full exercise
                    and scope even in the last scene, and reach not that maturity and perfection of
                    which they are capable; and therefore point to some higher scene, where he is to
                    sustain another and more important character than he has yet sustained? If any
                    such there are, may we not conclude by analogy, or in the same way of
                    anticipation as before, that he is destined for that after part, and is to be
                    produced upon a more august and solemn stage, where his sublimer powers shall
                    have proportioned action, and his nature attain its completion?</p>
                <p>If we attend to that curiosity, or prodigious thirst of knowledge, which is
                    natural to the mind in every period of its progress, and consider withal the
                    endless round of business and care, and the various hardships, to which the bulk
                    of mankind are chained down, it is evident, that in this present state it is
                    impossible to expect the gratificà-tion of an appetite at once so insatiable and
                    so noble. Our senses, the ordinary organs by which knowledge is let into the
                    mind, are always imperfect, and often fallacious; the advantages of assisting or
                    correcting them are possessed by few; the difficulties of finding out truth
                    amidst the various and contradictory opinions, interests, and passions of
                    mankind, are many; and the wants of the creature, and of those with whom he is
                    connected, numerous and urgent; so that it may be said of most men, that their
                    intellectual organs are as much shut up and secluded from proper nourishment and
                    exercise in that little circle to which they are confined, as the bodily organs
                    are in the womb. Nay, those who to an aspiring genius have added all the
                    assistances of art, leisure, and the most liberal education, what narrow
                    prospects can even they take of this unbounded scene of things from that little
                    eminence on which they stand? and how eagerly do they still grasp at new
                    discoveries, without any satisfaction or limit to their ambition?</p>
                <p>But should it be said that man is made for action, and not for speculation, or
                    fruitless searches after knowledge, we ask, for what kind of action? Is it only
                    for bodily exercises, or for moral, political, and religious ones? Of all these
                    he is capable; yet, by the unavoidable circumstances of his lot, he is tied down
                    to the former, and has hardly any leisure to think of the latter, or, if he has,
                    wants the proper instruments of exerting them. The love of virtue, of one’s
                    friends and country, the generous sympathy with mankind, and heroic zeal of
                    doing good, which are all so natural to great and good minds, and some traces of
                    which are found in the lowest, are seldom united with proportional means or
                    opportunities of exercising them; so that the moral spring, the noble energies •
                    and impulses of the mind, can hardly find proper scope even in the most
                    fortunate condition, but are much depressed in some, and almost entirely
                    restrained in the generality, by the numerous clogs of an indigent, sickly, or
                    embarrassed life. Were such mighty powers, such godlike affections, planted in
                    the human breast to be folded up in the narrow womb of our present existence,
                    never to be produced into a more perfect life, nor to expatiate in the ample
                    career of immortality?</p>
                <p>Let it be considered, at the same time, that no possession, no enjoyment, within
                    the round of mortal things, is commensurate to the desires or adequate to the
                    capacities of the mind. The most exalted condition has its abatements; the
                    happiest conjuncture of fortune leaves many wishes behind; and, after the
                    highest gratifications, the mind is carried forward in the pursuit of new ones
                    without end. Add to all, the fond desire of immortality, the secret dread of
                    non-existence, and the high unremitting pulse of the soul beating for
                    perfection, joined to the improbability or the impossibility of attaining it
                    here; and then judge whether this elaborate structure, this magnificent
                    apparatus of inward powers and organs, does not plainly point out an hereafter,
                    and intimate eternity to man. Does nature give the finishing touches to the
                    lesser and ignoble instances of her skill, and raise every other creature to the
                    maturity and perfection of his being; and shall she leave her principal
                    workmanship unfinished? Does she carry the vegetative and animal life in man to
                    their full vigour and highest destination; and shall she suffer the
                    intellectual, moral, and divine life of man to fade away, and be for ever
                    extinguished? Would such abortions in the moral world be congruous to that
                    perfection of wisdom and goodness which upholds and adorns' the natural?</p>
                <p>We must therefore conclude from this detail, that the present state, even at its
                    best, is only the <hi rend="italic">womb</hi> of man’s being, in which the
                    noblest principles of his nature are in a manner fettered, or secluded from a
                    correspondent sphere of action, and therefore destined for a future and
                    unbounded state, where they shall emancipate themselves, and exert the fulness
                    of their strength. The most accomplished mortal in this low and dark apartment
                    of nature is only the rudiments of what he shall be when he takes his ethereal
                    flight, and puts on immortality. Without a reference to that state, man were a
                    mere abortion, a rude unfinished <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825566"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-5566-0489"/>embryo, a monster in nature. But this being once
                    supposed, he still maintains his rank as the masterpiece of the creation; his
                    latent powers are all suitable to the harmony and progression of nature; his
                    noble aspirations, and the pains of his dissolution, are his efforts towards a
                    second birth, the pangs of his delivery into light, liberty, and perfection; and
                    death, his discharge from gaol, his separation from his fellow-prisoners, and
                    introduction into the assembly of those heroic spirits who are gone before him,
                    and the presence of their great eternal Parent. The fetters of his mortal coil
                    being loosened, and his prison walls broken down, he will be bare and open on
                    every side to the admission of truth and virtue, and their fair attendant,
                    happiness; every vital and intellectual spring will evolve itself with a divine
                    elasticity in the free air of heaven. He will not then peep at the universe and
                    its glorious Author through a dark grating or a gross medium, nor receive the
                    reflections of his glory through the strait openings of sensible organs, but
                    will be all eye, all ear, all ethereal and divine feeling.<note anchored="true"

                    9.</p></note> Let one part, however, of the analogy be attended to. As in the
                    womb we receive our original constitution, form, and the essential stamina of
                    our being, which we carry along with us into the light, and which greatly affect
                    the succeeding periods of our life; so our temper and condition in the future
                    life will depend on the conduct we have observed, and the character we have
                    formed, in the present state. We are here in miniature what we shall be at full
                    length hereafter. The first rude sketch or outline of reason and virtue must be
                    drawn at present, to be afterwards enlarged to the stature and beauty of
                    angels.</p>
                <p>This, if duly attended to, must prove not only a guard, but an admirable
                    incentive, to virtue. For he who faithfully and ardently follows the light of
                    knowledge, and pants after higher improvements in virtue, will be wonderfully
                    animated and inflamed in that pursuit by a full conviction that the scene does
                    not close with life; that his struggles, arising from the weakness of nature and
                    the strength of habit, will be turned into triumphs; that his career in the
                    track of wisdom and goodness will be both swifter and smoother; and those
                    generous ardours with which he glows towards heaven, or the perfection and
                    immortality of virtue, will find their adequate object and exercise in a sphere
                    proportionally enlarged, incorruptible, immortal. On the other hand, what an
                    inexpressible damp must it be to the good man to dread the total extinction of
                    that light and virtue, without which life, nay, immortality itself, were not
                    worth a single wish?</p>
                <p>Many writers draw their proofs of the immortality of the soul, and of a future
                    state of rewards and punishments, from the unequal distribution of these here.
                    It cannot be dissembled that wicked men often escape the outward punishment due
                    to their crimes, and do not feel the inward in that measure which their demerit
                    seems to require, partly from the callousness induced upon their nature by the
                    habits of vice, and partly from the dissipation of their minds abroad by
                    pleasure or business; and sometimes good men do not reap all the natural and
                    genuine fruits of their virtue, through the many unforeseen or unavoidable
                    calamities in which they are involved. To the smallest reflection, however, it
                    is obvious that the natural tendency of virtue is to produce happiness; that if
                    it were universally practised, it would, in fact, produce the greatest sum of
                    happiness of which human nature is capable; and that this tendency is defeated
                    only by numerous individuals, who, forsaking the laws of virtue, injure and
                    oppress those who steadily adhere to them. But the natural tendency of virtue is
                    the result of that constitution of things which was established by God at the
                    creation of the world. This being the case, we must either conclude, that there
                    will be a future state, in which all the moral obliquities of the present shall
                    be made straight; or else admit, that the designs of infinite wisdom, goodness,
                    and power, can be finally defeated by the perverse conduct of human weakness.
                    But this last supposition is so extravagantly absurd, that the reality of a
                    future state, the only other possible alternative, may be pronounced to have the
                    evidence of perfect demonstration.</p>
                <p>Virtue has present rewards, and vice present punishments, annexed to them—such
                    rewards and punishments as make virtue, in most cases that occur, far more
                    eligible than vice; but, in the infinite variety of human contingencies, it may
                    sometimes happen, that the inflexible practice of virtue shall deprive a man of
                    considerable advantages to himself, his family, or friends, which he might gain
                    by a well-timed piece of roguery; suppose by betraying his trust, voting against
                    his conscience, selling his country, or any other crime where the security
                    against discovery shall heighten the temptation. Or, it may happen, that a
                    strict adherence to his honour, to his religion, to the cause of liberty and
                    virtue,' shall expose him or his family to the loss of every thing, nay, to
                    poverty, slavery, death itself, or to torments far more intolerable. Now, what
                    shall secure a man’s virtue in circumstances of such trial? What shall enforce
                    the obligations of conscience against the allurements of so many interests, the
                    dread of so many and so terrible evils, and the almost unsurmountable aversion
                    of human nature to excessive pain? The conflict is .the greater when the
                    circumstances of the crime are such as easily admit a variety of alleviations
                    from necessity, natural affection, love to one’s family or friends, perhaps in
                    indigence; these will give it even the air of virtue. Add to all, that the crime
                    may be thought to have few bad consequences, may be easily concealed, or
                    imagined possible to be retrieved in a good measure by future good conduct. It
                    is obvious to which side most men will lean in such a case; and how much need
                    there is of a balance in the opposite scale, from the consideration of a God, of
                    a Providence, and of an immortal state of retribution, to keep the mind firm and
                    uncorrupted in those or similar instances of singular trial or distress.</p>
                <p>But without supposing such peculiar instances, a sense of a governing Mind, and a
                    persuasion that virtue is not only befriended by him here, but will be crowned
                    by him hereafter with rewards suitable to its nature, vast in themselves, and
                    immortal in their duration, must be not only a mighty support and incentive to
                    the practice of virtue, but a strong barrier against vice. The thoughts of an
                    Almighty Judge, and of an impartial future reckoning, are often alarming, indeed
                    inexpressibly so, even to the stoutest offenders. On the other hand, how
                    supporting must it be to the good man, to think that he acts under the eye of
                    his friend, as well as judge. How improving, to consider the present state as
                    connected with a future one, and every relation in which he stands as a school
                    of discipline for his affections; every trial as the exercise of some virtue;
                    and the virtuous deeds which result from both, as introductory to higher scenes
                    of action and enjoymeut. Finally, how transporting is it to view death as his
                    discharge from the warfare of mortality, and a triumphant entry into a state of
                    freedom, and security, and perfection, in which knowledge and wisdom shall break
                    in upon him from every quarter; where each faculty shall have its proper object;
                    and where his virtue, which was often damped or defeated here, shall be
                    enthroned in undisturbed and eternal empire.</p>
