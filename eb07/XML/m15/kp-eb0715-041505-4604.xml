                <p><label type="entry">MONK</label> anciently denoted a person who had retired from
                    the world to give himself up wholly to God, and to live in solitude and
                    abstinence. The word is derived from the Latin <hi rend="italic">monachus,</hi>
                    and that from the Greek <hi rend="italic">μοναχος,</hi> solitary.</p>
                <p>The origin of monks seems pretty well ascertained. The persecutions which
                    attended the first ages of the Gospel forced some Christians to retire from the
                    world, and live in deserts and places the most private and unfrequented, in
                    hopes of finding that peace and comfort amongst beasts which were denied them
                    amongst men; and this being the case of some very extraordinary persons, their
                    example gave so much reputation to retirement, that the practice was continued
                    when the reason for its commencement had ceased. After the empire became
                    Christian, instances of this kind were numerous; and those whose security had
                    obliged them to live separately and apart, became afterwards united into
                    societies. We may also add, that the mystic theology, which gained ground
                    towards the close of the third century, contributed to produce the same effect,
                    and to drive men into solitude for the purposes of enthusiastic devotion.</p>
                <p>The monks, at least the ancient ones, were distinguished into <hi rend="italic"
                    >solitaries, coenobites,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sarabaites.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">solitary</hi> were those who lived alone, in places remote from
                    all towns and habitations of men. The <hi rend="italic">coenobites</hi> were
                    those who lived in community with several others in the same house, and under
                    the same superiors. The <hi rend="italic">sarabaites</hi> were strolling monks,
                    who had no fixed rule nor residence.</p>
                <p>The houses of monks were of two kinds, viz. <hi rend="italic">monasteries</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">laurae.</hi> Those whom we call monks now-a-days are
                    coenobites, who live together in a convent or monastery, make vows of living
                    according to a certain rule established by the founder, and wear a habit which
                    distinguishes their order. Those who are endowed, or have a fixed revenue, are
                    most properly called monks, <hi rend="italic">monachi;</hi> as the Chartreux,
                    Benedictines, Bernardines, and others. The Mendicants, or those who beg, as the
                    Capucins and Franciscans, are more properly called <hi rend="italic"
                    >religious</hi> and <hi rend="italic">friars;</hi> though the names are
                    frequently confounded.</p>
                <p>The first monks were those of St Anthony, who, towards the close of the fourth
                    century, formed them into a regular body, engaged them to live in society with
                    each other, and prescribed to them fixed rules for the direction of their
                    conduct. These regulations, which St Anthony had framed in Egypt, were soon
                    introduced into Palestine and Syria by his disciple Hilarion. About the same
                    time, Aones and Eugenius, with their companions Gaddanas and Azyzas, instituted
                    the monastic order in Mesopotamia and the adjacent countries; and their example
                    was followed with such rapid success, that in a short time the whole of the East
                    was filled with men, who, abandoning all human connections, advantages,
                    pleasures, and concerns, wore out their lives amidst the hardships of want, and
                    various kinds <pb break="no" facs="nls:193824617" xml:id="kp-eb0715-4617-0416"
                    />of suffering, in order to arrive at a more close and rapturous communication
                    with God and the angels.</p>
                <p>From the East this institution passed into the West, and first into Italy and its
                    neighbouring islands; though it is uncertain who transplanted it thither. St
                    Martin, the celebrated bishop of Tours, erected the first monasteries in Gaul,
                    and recommended religious solitude with such power and efficacy, both by his
                    instructions and his example, that his funeral is said to have been attended by
                    no less than two thousand monks. From Gaul the monastic discipline extended
                    itself gradually throughout the other provinces and countries of Europe. Besides
                    the monks of St Basil and those of St Jerome, there were the hermits of St
                    Augustin, and afterwards those of St Benedict and St Bernard, and at length came
                    those of St Francis and St Dominie, with a legion of others.</p>
                <p>Towards the close of the fifth century, the monks, who had formerly lived only
                    for themselves in solitary retreats, and had never thought of assuming any rank
                    amongst the sacerdotal order, were now gradually distinguished from the
                    populace, and endowed with such honourable privileges that they found themselves
                    in a condition to claim an eminent station amongst the supporters and pillars of
                    the Christian community. The fame of their piety and sanctity was so great, that
                    bishops and presbyters were often chosen out of their order; and the passion for
                    erecting edifices and convents, in which the monks and holy virgins might serve
                    God in the most commodious manner, was at this time carried beyond all bounds.
                    The monastic orders were at first under the immediate jurisdiction of the
                    bishops, from which they were exempted by the Roman pontiff about the end of the
                    seventh century; and the monks, in return, devoted themselves wholly to advance
                    the interests and to maintain the dignity of the Bishop of Rome. This immunity
                    which they obtained was a fruitful source of licentiousness and disorder, and
                    occasioned the greater part of the vices with which they were afterwards
                    charged. In the eighth century the monastic discipline was extremely relaxed
                    both in the eastern and western provinces, and all efforts to restore it were
                    ineffectual. Nevertheless, this kind of institution was in the highest esteem,
                    and nothing could equal the veneration which was paid about the close of the
                    ninth century to such as devoted themselves to the monastic or conventual life.
                    This veneration induced several kings and emperors to call them to their courts,
                    and to employ them in civil affairs of the greatest moment. Their reformation
                    was attempted by Louis the Meck, but the effect was of short duration. In the
                    eleventh century they were exempted by the popes from the authority of their
                    sovereigns, and new orders of monks were continually established; insomuch that
                    in the Council of Lateran which was held in the year 1215, a decree was passed,
                    by the advice of Innocent III. to prevent the establishment of any new monastic
                    institutions; and several were entirely suppressed. In the fifteenth and
                    sixteenth centuries, it appears, from the testimonies of Protestant writers,
                    that the monks were generally indolent, illiterate, profligate, and licentious
                    epicures, whose views in life were confined to opulence, idleness, and pleasure.
                    However, the Reformation had a manifest influence in restraining their excesses,
                    and rendering them more circumspect and cautious in their external conduct.</p>
                <p>Monks are distinguished by the colour of their habits, into black, white, gray,
                    &amp;c. Amongst the monks, some are called <hi rend="italic">monks of the
                    choir,</hi> others <hi rend="italic">professed monks,</hi> and others <hi
                    rend="italic">lay monks,</hi> the last being destined for the service of the
                    convent, and having neither clericate nor literature.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cloistered</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Monks</hi> are
                    those who actually reside in the house, in opposition to extra-monks, who
                    possess benefices depending on the monastery.</p>
                <p>Monks are also distinguished into <hi rend="italic">reformed,</hi> whom the civil
                    and ecclesiastical authority have made masters of ancient convents, and put it
                    in their power to retrieve the ancient discipline, which had been relaxed; and
                    <hi rend="italic">ancient,</hi> who remain in the convent, to live in it
                    according to its establishment at the time when they made their vows, without
                    obliging themselves to submit to any new reform.</p>
                <p>Anciently the monks were all laymen, and were only distinguished from the rest of
                    the people by a particular habit and an extraordinary devotion. Not only were
                    the monks excluded from the priesthood, but even priests were expressly
                    prohibited from becoming monks, as appears from the letters of St Gregory. Pope
                    Syricius was the first who called them to the clericate, on occasion of the
                    great scarcity of priests under which the church was then supposed to labour;
                    and since that time the priesthood has been usually united to the monastical
                    profession.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monk,</hi><hi rend="italic">George,</hi> Duke of Albemarle,
                    a personage memorable for having been the principal agent in restoring Charles
                    II. to his crown, was descended from an ancient family, and born in Devonshire
                    in 1608. Being an unprovided younger son, he dedicated himself to arms from his
                    youth, and obtained a pair of colours in the expedition to the Isle of Rhé; he
                    afterwards served with reputation in the Low Countries, as well as in both King
                    Charles’s northern expeditions, and did such service in quelling the Irish
                    rebellion, that he was appointed governor of Dublin, but was superseded by
                    parliamentary authority. Being appointed major-general of the Irish brigade
                    employed in the siege of Nantwich in Cheshire, he was taken prisoner by Sir
                    Thomas Fairfax, and remained confined in the Tower of London until the year
                    1646, when, as the means of obtaining liberty, he took the covenant, and
                    accepted a command in the Irish service under the parliament. He obtained the
                    chief command of all the parliamentary forces in the north of Ireland, where he
                    did signal services, until he was called to account for a treaty made with the
                    Irish rebels; a circumstance which was only obliterated by his future good
                    fortune. He served in Scotland under Oliver Cromwell, with such success, that he
                    was left there as commander-in-chief; and he was one of the commissioners for
                    uniting that kingdom with the newly-erected commonwealth. He also served at sea
                    against the Dutch, and was treated so kindly on his return that Oliver is said
                    to have grown jealous of him. He was,, however, again sent to Scotland as
                    commander-in-chief, and continued there five years; when he dissembled so well,
                    and improved circumstances so dexterously, that he restored the king without any
                    disturbance. For this service he was immediately rewarded with both honours and
                    profit. He was created Duke of Albemarle, with an estate worth L.7000 a year,
                    besides other emoluments; and he enjoyed the confidence of his master as a
                    compensation for having forfeited that of the people. After his death in 1670,
                    there was published a treatise composed by him whilst he remained prisoner in
                    the Tower, entitled Observations on Military and Political Affairs, in small
                    folio.</p>
