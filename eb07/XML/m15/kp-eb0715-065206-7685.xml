                    insects. As such they were likewise included by Linnaeus, and the older
                    systematic writers, in the order <hi rend="smallcaps">Aptera.</hi></p>
                <p>The Myriapoda are distinguished from true insects by their greater amount of feet
                    (twenty-four and upwards), by the want of any precise or appreciable division
                    into thorax and abdomen, and by the numerous segments into which their bodies
                    are divided. Each segment, with the exception of the first, is furnished with a
                    pair of legs, terminated for the most part by a single hook. The stigmata, or
                    openings for respiration, are placed on each alternate segment, a circumstance
                    which has induced some observers to regard the latter as only semi-segments, in
                    as far as in true insects each ring has its pair of stigmata. But we see no
                    necessity for the establishment of any strict analogy of form between the
                    subjects of two distinct classes of articulated beings; and indeed, if we do so
                    in regard to the character in question, we produce a greater discordance by the
                    necessity, in that case, of assigning to each so-called (double) segment, a
                    couple of pair of legs. The mandibles are bi-articulate, and are followed by a
                    piece in the form of a labium, quadriful, with articulated divisions resembling
                    little feet, and corresponding in position to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >languette</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> the Crustacea. Then succeed two pair of
                    small feet, of which the second, sometimes hook-shaped, seem to replace the four
                    maxillae of the last-named order, or the two maxillae and the lower lip of
                    insects. They may be regarded as maxillary feet. The antennae are two in number.
                    Their form cannot be easily generalised, because, although they may often be, as
                    Latreille says, “courtes, un peu plus grosses vers le bout, ou presque
                    filiformes yet in some (genus <hi rend="italic">Scutigera)</hi> they are very
                    long, and become much more slender towards the extremity. The number of the
                    articulations also varies greatly. The organs of vision are usually formed by a
                    union of smooth or simple eyes; but in some these parts are analogous to the
                    compound eyes of insects, the facettes, however, being proportionally larger,
                    rounder, and more distinct. All Myriapodes are apterous.</p>
                <p>The subjects of our present notice differ likewise from insects in this
                    remarkable peculiarity, that the number of their segments, and consequently of
                    the stigmata and legs, increases with the size of the individual. It would even
                    appear, from the observations of Savi the younger,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">» Memorie
                    Scientijiche,</hi> Pisa, 1828.</p></note> that the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >lulus</hi> is born without feet; from which it has been observed, that those
                    Myriapodes are subject, at some early period of their lives, to a regular
                    metamorphosis. Degeer had long before observed, that the number of their parts
                    increased with the general growth of the body.</p>
                <p>The organs of respiration consist of two principal tracheae extending parallel
                    along the body, and receiving air from the lateral spiracles.</p>
                <p>Myriapodes are generally supposed to be longer lived, and of more continuous
                    growth, than insects; and, according to Savi the younger, two years elapse (at
                    least in the genus <hi rend="italic">lulus)</hi> before the development of the
                    generative system; but it must be borne in mind, that many insects exist for a
                    length of time in the larva state (to which the early condition of the
                    Myriapodes so closely corresponds), and are thus of equal longevity with the
                    many-footed subjects of our present inquiry. The Myriapodes in general shun the
                    light. They conceal themselves under stones, beneath the bark of trees, among
                    old timber, and in various other localities. Some inhabit fruits, and others are
                    destructive to culinary vegetables. Many are carnivorous, seizing upon animal
                    substances, both dead and living, with their curved jaws. They are said to
                    infuse a poisonous juice into their wounded victims.</p>
                <p>In our subdivision of the class, as in the preceding generalities, we shall
                    follow the system of Latreille, by whom the Myriapodes are partitioned into two
                    primary groups, which differ from each other both in habits and structure.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Order</hi> L—CHILOGNATHA.</p>
                <p>This primary group corresponds to the genus <hi rend="italic">lulus</hi> of
                    Linnaeus. The body is for the most part cylindrical, and of a crustaceous
                    consistence. The antennae are composed of seven joints, of nearly equal size.
                    The mandibles are thick, without palpi, distinctly divided into two portions by
                    a median articulation, and with teeth implanted in a concavity of their upper
                    extremity. Beneath is a kind of labium or lower lip, divided at its exterior
                    surface, by <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827698" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7698-0653"/>
                    notches and longitudinal sections, into four principal areas, tuberculated on
                    the upper margin, and of which the two intermediate are short and narrow, and
                    placed at the upper extremity of another area, which serves them as a common
                    base. The feet are very short, and always terminate in a single hook; four
                    anterior feet placed immediately beneath the labium, resemble the others in
                    form, but are more approximate at their base, with the radical joint
                    proportionally longer. Most of the other legs are attached by double pairs to a
                    single segment of the body. The male organs are placed beneath the seventh pair
                    of legs, those of the female behind the second pair. The stigmata, as usually
                    described, are very small, and placed on alternate segments outside the origin
                    of the legs.</p>
                <p>The Myriapodes of this division are slow of movement, and advance, as it were, by
                    a gliding motion. They assume in defence a round or spiral form. The first
                    segment of the body, in some the second, is larger than the others, and presents
                    the form of a corselet or buckler. The double pairs of legs do not occur until
                    we reach the fourth, fifth, or sixth pair; the first three or four pair being
                    free from their origin, or adhering to their respective segments only by a
                    median or sternal line. The*two or three terminal segments of the body are
                    usually without feet. On each side of the body there is a series of pores,
                    formerly regarded as stigmata, but which, according to Μ. Savi, merely emit an
                    acid liquor of a disagreeable odour, and probably intended as a means of
                    defence; the true stigmata, or respiratory openings, as described by the Italian
                    naturalist, being placed on the sternal piece of each segment, and communicating
                    internally with a double series of pneumatic pouches, disposed <hi rend="italic"
                    >en chapelet</hi> along the body, and giving out tracheal branches, which ramify
                    over the other organs. These pouches or vesicular tracheae, according to Μ.
                    Straus, are not connected with each other, as among ordinary insects, by a
                    principal trachea.</p>
                <p>The form of the newly-hatched bodies of the lulidae, as observed by Μ. Savi in
                    the vicinity of Pisa, was somewhat kidney-shaped, quite plain, and without
                    appendages. After the lapse of eighteen days they underwent their first moult,
                    and only then assumed the form of the adults; but they were still composed of
                    only twenty-two segments, and the total number of their legs amounted to
                    twenty-six pair. These observations are in some measure inconsistent with the
                    assertion of Degeer, who in the young state of these creatures counted only
                    three pair of legs and eight segments: but is it certain, asks Μ. Latreille,
                    that the moult described by Μ. Savi was actually the first; or ought we not
                    rather to presume that they do not pass suddenly from an apodal state to the
                    possession of twenty-six pair of legs; in other words, that they are subject to
                    certain intermediate changes, which may have escaped the observance of Μ.

                    >Règne</hi><hi rend="italic">Animal,</hi> iv. 332.</p></note> After the second
                    moult, however, the last-named naturalist informs us, the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">lulus</hi> exhibits thirty-six pair of legs, and after the third,
                    forty-three, and the body then consists of thirty segments. In the adult state
                    the number is considerably increased. Two years afterwards another moult takes
                    place, and it is only then that the generative system is developed. From the
                    period of birth, which takes place in March, the renewals of the skin were
                    observed by Μ. Savi to take place almost monthly till November, and the exuviae
                    were seen to contain even the membrane which lines the interior of the
                    alimentary canal and tracheae. The organs of the mouth were the only parts not
                    there observed by Μ. Savi.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    genus <hi rend="italic">Scolopendra</hi> of Linnaeus, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193827711" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7711-0654"/> as the preceding does to the
                    genus <hi rend="italic">lulus</hi> of the Swedish naturalist. The antennae
                    become slender towards the extremity, and are composed of fourteen articulations
                    and upwards. The mouth is composed of two mandibles, each furnished with a small
                    palpiform appendage, and exhibiting in their centre the appearance of a joining,
                    and ending in a spoon-shaped termination, with toothed edges. The labium is
                    quadriful, with the two lateral divisions larger than the others, transversely
                    ringed, and resembling the membranous feet of caterpillars. This labium is
                    analogous to the lower lip of the chilognathous kinds, which represents in
                    Latreille’s opinion the tongue of the crustaceous tribes, but possesses also the
                    functions of maxillae. It is what Savigny names the first auxiliary lip. Besides
                    these parts, there are two palpi or minute feet, united at the base, and
                    unguiculated at the point; a second labium <hi rend="italic">(seconde
                    lèvre</hi><hi rend="italic">auxiliare</hi> of Savigny<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This piece is not attached to the head, but
                    to the anterior extremity of the first semi-segment. The two hooked feet form by
                    the union and dilatation of their first article a plate in the form of a labium
                    or mentum, and the same semi-segment bears the two first ordinary feet, <hi
                    rend="italic">(Règne Animal,</hi> iv. 336.)</p></note>), formed by a second pair
                    of feet dilated and joined at their origin, and terminated by a strong hook,
                    moveable, and pierced at the extremity, for the transmission of a venomous or
                    acrid liquid.</p>
                <p>The body of these unseemly creatures is depressed and membranous. Each ring or
                    segment is covered by a coriaceous plate, and usually bears only a single pair
                    of legs; and the terminal segment is generally thrown backwards, and elongated
                    into a kind of tail. The organs of respiration are composed, either in whole or
                    in part, of tubular tracheae. The sexual parts are interior, and placed at the
                    posterior extremity of the body, as in the generality of insects properly so
                    called. The stigmata are more obvious than in the preceding family, and are
                    either lateral or dorsal.</p>
                <p>The species of this division are of much more nimble habits than those of the
                    preceding; and the peculiar mode in which the limbs act produces an undulating
                    lateral motion. They are of carnivorous habits, and, avoiding strong light,
                    usually conceal themselves under stones or old timber, beneath the bark of
                    trees, &amp;c. They are held in some dread by the inhabitants of tropical
                    countries, where they attain a great size, and are consequently capable of
                    inflicting dangerous wounds. But the majority of travellers seem agreed that,
                    although the bite is more painful than that of a scorpion, it is never attended
                    by fatal consequences. In more northern countries they are quite harmless,
                    though disliked in consequence of their repulsive aspect. Our common centipede
                    <hi rend="italic">(Scolopendra forficata</hi> of Linn.) so frequent in this
                    country under stones, may be mentioned as a familiar example. Lecuwenhoeck, the
                    great Dutch microscopical observer, has described the perforation of the hooks,
                    through which the poison is supposed to flow.</p>
                <p>This order (which corresponds to the <hi rend="smallcaps">Syngnatha</hi> of
                    Latreille’s earlier works, the title adhered to by Dr Leach) is divided into the
                    following genera.</p>
                <p>The first two have only fifteen pair of legs; and their bodies, when viewed from
                    above, seem to present fewer segments than when examined from below.</p>

                    designation, although the title of <hi rend="italic">Ccrmatia</hi> had at a
                    prior period been assigned to tins generic group by liliger. See Rossi’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Fauna</hi><hi rend="italic">Etrusea,</hi> t. ii. p.

                    are two pneumatic pouches or vesicular tracheae, which receive the air, and
                    communicate with lateral and inferior tracheae of a tubular form. The under
                    surface is divided into fifteen semi-segments, each bearing a pair of feet
                    terminated by an extremely long, slender, and minutely articulated tarsus. The
                    terminal legs are long, and seem to increase in extent from the foremost to the
                    hindmost pair. The eyes are comparatively large and reticulated. The antennae
                    are very long and slender, and the palpi projecting and spinous.</p>
                <p>The species keep themselves concealed during the day in barns, or the
                    unfrequented parts of houses, lying between old planks, or sometimes under
                    stones. They are seen at night running on the outside walls with great velocity,
                    feeding on <hi rend="italic">onisci,</hi> and various insects. They seem to
                    pierce their prey with their mouth-hooks, and infuse into them a poisonous
                    fluid, which immediately deprives them of life. These Myriapodes make their
                    appearance in great numbers, chiefly in rainy weather. According to liliger,
                    they are greatly dreaded by the inhabitants of Hungary. The best known European
                    species is the &amp; <hi rend="italic">araneoides</hi> (Plate CCXXXIX. fig. 4).
                    It is the <hi rend="italic">Scolopendra coleoptrata</hi> of Linn, and Fab.
                    Pallas asserts that it was taken by a friend of his among some fuci in the

                    locality, we may infer that it had fallen accidentally from the timbers of a
                    vessel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Lithobius,</hi> Leach. Body divided into an equal
                    number of segments both above and below, each bearing a pair of legs. The dorsal
                    plates are alternately long and short. The stigmatic openings are lateral.</p>
                <p>We have figured our most common species, <hi rend="italic">L.forficata</hi>
                    (Plate CCXXXIX. fig. 6), a familiarly-known Linnaean scolopendra, as an example
                    of the modern genus. It occurs almost everywhere, throughout the summer season,
                    under stones. The anatomical structure of the genus has been described by Μ.

                <p>The remaining generic groups of this order have at least twenty-one pair of legs,
                    and the segments of the body are of nearly equal size, and of similar number,
                    both above and below.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Scolopendra,</hi> properly so called, there are
                    eight distinct eyes, four on each side, and the basal joint of the terminal legs
                    is armed with small spines. We have no British species, but the south of Europe
                    produces <hi rend="italic">Scol. cingulata,</hi> which presents almost as
                    formidable an aspect as some of the exotic kinds. The great foreign species (one
                    of which sometimes measures above a foot in length) have been as yet but ill
                    defined, several kinds being no doubt described under the name of <hi

                    of the wound is allayed by the use of ammonia. Μ. Àmoreux is of opinion that no
