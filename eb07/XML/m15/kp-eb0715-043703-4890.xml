                <p><label type="entry">MONTREAL</label>, a city of Lower Canada, the first in size
                    and commercial importance, and the second in rank, in that district. The island
                    and signiory, on the south side of which the city stands, is about thirty miles
                    in length by from five to ten in breadth, and contains 197 square miles. It is
                    situated on the St Lawrence, at the head of ship navigation, 180 miles above
                    Quebec, and 200 below Lake Ontario. On the north a small stream divides it from
                    the Isle of Jesus, which is also a signiory, and about twenty miles long; and
                    from Isle Bizare, which is four miles in length. Montreal is situated close to
                    the river, upon a belt ofland about two miles in breadth, and at the back of
                    which is the Royal Mountain. The bank of the river upon which it is built has a
                    gradual elevation of from twenty to thirty feet, sloping again at the back of
                    the town, where there is a canal to carry off'any accumulated water. Including
                    the suburbs, it is much more extensive and somewhat more populous than Quebec,
                    but it wants the sublime scenery which characterizes that city. The whole of the
                    lower town has a gloomy and uncomfortable appearance, the streets being narrow
                    and incommodious. It consists of one principal street for shops and trade, which
                    runs parallel to the river, with others which cross it at right angles, and also
                    intersect another street running parallel to it, and dividing the old from the
                    more modern town. This part of Montreal contains several spacious public
                    buildings, with a number of fashionable dwelling-houses, built of stone; and the
                    villas in the neighbourhood have an imposing appearance. It has a respectable
                    esplanade called the Champ de Mars, where the troops are reviewed. To the east
                    extends the Quebec suburb, and to the north and west the suburbs of St Antoine,
                    St Lawrence, and St Recollet. Amongst the public buildings, the first which
                    requires to be mentioned is the new Catholic cathedral, said to be the most
                    splendid temple in America, not excepting that of Mexico which, however, is
                    nearly equal to it. The foundation-stone was laid in 1824, and it was opened for
                    public worship in 1829. This magnificent structure is thus described by Mr
                    M‘Gregor in his work on British America. “It is dedicated to the Virgin Mary.
                    Its length is 255 feet, breadth 234, and the height of the walls 112 feet. The
                    style of architecture is taken from the rich Gothic of the thirteenth and
                    fourteenth centuries. It has six massive high towers; between these, along the
                    roof, is a promenade twenty-five feet wide, elevated 112 feet above the ground.
                    It has one superior altar, and six of less grandeur. It has five public and
                    three private entrances; and from 10,000 to 12,000 people, which it will
                    accommodate, may disperse in five or six minutes. The eastern window, behind the
                    altar, is thirty-three feet broad and seventy high; the other windows are ten
                    feet by thirty-six feet. It is surrounded by a fine terrace. The chime of bells,
                    clocks, altars, and all the interior arrangements, correspond with the
                    magnificence of the exterior. From 7000 to 8000 persons frequently congregate
                    within this edifice.” There are several other Catholic churches besides the
                    cathedral; one of these, large, but plain in appearance, was built in· the
                    suburbs, upon the arrival of a bishop from France, after the termination of the
                    late war, and for whom a palace was built near it. The bells of the Catholic
                    churches are kept constantly ringing, which is a great annoyance, especially to
                    strangers. The whole island of Montreal is comprised in one signiory, and is
                    claimed by the seminary of St Sulpice, which consists of twenty members and four
                    assistants. They discharge the whole parochial duties for the Roman Catholic
                    population of the town and suburbs; and they, maintain, in whole or in part, a
                    college, at which 204 young men are educated in the classics and sciences. They
                    also educate, at various schools which they have established, more than 1300
                    scholars, besides making extensive distributions in charity. In addition to
                    these various duties, the whole management of the farms, and other temporal
                    concerns, is carried on by the members. The revenues of the seminary may be
                    taken at an average of L.8277 currency a year, equal to L.6700 sterling. In
                    exacting the <hi rend="italic">lods</hi><hi rend="italic">et ventes</hi> due to
                    them on the transference of land, they are very liberal, and usually compound
                    for these fines. The improvement of Montreal has been much retarded by
                    sig-norial and feudal exactions. The feelings of the Protestants have been much
                    mortified in being compelled to submit to demands for the support of
                    institutions contrary to their principles; whilst no attention was paid by the
                    British government to the establishment of scholastic institutions for the
                    benefit of the Protestant community. The adjustment, therefore, of the claims of
                    the seminary of St Sulpice is the most important subject in which the
                    inhabitants are interested. The principal English church is a handsome and
                    spacious edifice. The Scotch kirk is a plain unadorned building, but the
                    Methodists have a very fine chapel. The court-house, prison, and
                    governmenthouse, are substantial buildings, but without any pretensions to
                    architectural beauty. There are three nunneries in the city, belonging to which
                    are some beautiful islets, as well as lands on the largest of these islands.
                    There is an English university, where the various branches of a polite and
                    learned education are taught. There is a natural history society, which has been
                    of great use in illustrating the natural history and unfolding the vast
                    resources of America. There are also a mechanics’ institution, a general
                    hospital, and a well-conducted news-room; and twelve newspapers, as well as some
                    other periodicals, are published in Montreal. It enjoys considerable trade, and
                    possesses several manufactures. There is a cast-iron foundery; and machinery for
                    steam engines, stoves, and the like, is made in the town. There are likewise
                    distilleries, breweries, and other manufactures of necessary articles; and also
                    several ship-building establishments. A bank was established in 1817, and there
                    is now a branch of it at Quebec. There is likewise a committee of trade, which
                    regulates various commercial matters and charges. There are no wharfs at
                    Montreal, and the ships and steamers lie quietly in pretty deep water, close to
                    the clayey and generally filthy bank in front of the city. From its position,
                    Montreal will always <pb break="no" facs="nls:193824903"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-4903-0438"/>constitute one of the greatest commercial
                    emporiums of America; and it must increase in magnitude and importance, along
                    with the rapid improvement and increasing population of the upper and
                    surrounding countries. The trade is not suspended in winter, as at Quebec.
                    During that season, thousands of sledges come in from all directions laden with
                    agricultural produce, frozen carcasses of beef and pork, firewood, and other
                    articles. In return these traffickers receive manufactured goods of all kinds,
                    the warehouses and markets being always well supplied. In summer vast rafts of
                    timber pass Montreal for Quebec; and boats of a rude construction bring down the
                    productions of the upper country. This was the headquarters of the fur trade
                    before the North-west and Hudson Companies joined their interests; and there is
                    still a warehouse there. More than three fourths of the population are French;
                    the rest are Britons and Americans. The population in 1825 amounted to 22,357,
                    and in 1831 to 27,297; at present (1837) it is nearly 37,000. The city of
                    Montreal is represented in the provincial legislature by four members; the
                    county by two. The imports and exports, as well as other statistical
                    information, are included in those of Quebec, and will be found under that
                    article. Montreal is situated in long. 73. 25. W. and lat. 45. 30. N.</p>
