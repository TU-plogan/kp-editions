                    de</hi></label>, one of the most eminent propagators of the doctrines of the
                    French Economists in France, was born at Perthuis on the 5th of October 1715. He
                    was the eldest surviving male descendant of a family esteemed ancient and noble
                    even in Provence, and established there for above five centuries. This was the
                    family of Riquetti or Arrighetti, which, having been banished from Florence
                    during the civil commotions which agitated that republic, settled in Provence,
                    and there maintained themselves in the rank of the most noble families of the
                    country. The most famous of them all was Riquetti, the author and engineer of
                    the Languedoc Canal; but the relationship was denied by the preposterous and
                    barbarous pride of the clan. The subject of this notice, like most of the elder
                    branches of French noble families, was placed betimes in the army; he was made a
                    Chevalier de Malte at three years of age, an ensign at fourteen, and soon
                    afterwards a captain; he served with credit and distinction at the sieges of
                    Kehl and Philipsburg, and at the battles of Dettingen and Clusen; and, in the
                    year 1743, he received the cross of St Louis, being then in the twenty-eighth
                    year of his age. The death of his father having some years before placed him in
                    a state of independence, he now quitted the army, and married the Marquise de
                    Saulvebeuf, who, having been betrothed at twelve years of age, had been left a
                    widow before she became a wife. But this marriage did not in the end prove
                    fortunate. The lady was young, rich, and noble, but she was not handsome; and
                    although her virtue was beyond all suspicion, the marquis, not satisfied with
                    this, quarrelled with her, after she had lived with him fifteen years in peace
                    and comfort, and had borne him eleven children; took into his house a
                    fascinating young Swiss lady called Madame de Pailly; lived openly with the
                    latter as his mistress; turned his unfortunate wife out of doors; and then
                    engaged in a course of litigation with her, and of cruel as well as treacherous
                    processes against her, which rendered both wretched, and made them the subject
                    of universal talk, the objects of general censure, without profiting any human
                    being except Madame de Pailly, the lawyers, and the retailers of scandalous
                    gossip in the drawing-rooms of Paris.</p>
                <p>I he chief object of the Marquis de Mirabeau in quitting the profession of arms
                    was to lead a life of literary retirement, and to improve the condition of his
                    rural dependents. 1owards the latter, indeed, his conduct seems to have been
                    uniformly sensible, just, and kind; he was their real father, and they were in
                    fact the only children who ever found in him the virtues of the paternal
                    character. He went to reside in the family chateau in Provence; but neither the
                    distance from Paris nor the state of the country suited his spirit or agreed
                    with his taste. Accordingly, he purchased the estate of Bignon, fifteen miles
                    from Sens and Nemours, and soon afterwards an hotel in Paris. He then entered
                    upon the career of philosophy, which he pursued for half a century, and which
                    terminated only with his life, about the beginning of the French Revolution,
                    when he left the world with a reputation for virtue greatly exaggerated, and for
                    talents much below his real merit. He died at Argenteuil on the 13th of July
                    1789, at a time when his son, the Count de Mirabeau, was rapidly rising to a
                    supremacy of influence and power in the National Assembly <hi rend="superscript"

                <p>The Marquis de Mirabeau was, after Quesnay, the chief patriarch of the sect of
                    Economists; and was also well known and distinguished for his practical
                    attention to economics as a considerable landowner and a patrician of high rank.
                    But his style, which had the faults common to all the writers of the sect, was,
                    besides, uncouth and fantastical in a remarkable degree, being deformed by an
                    unhappy affectation of imitating the manner of Montaigne in an accumulation of
                    trivial redundancies, which he called “his dear native exuberance,” as well as
                    by a certain false heat, and an incredible excess of pride and of dogmatism.
                    That these defects, however, were not the result of any natural cloudiness or
                    obliquity of mind, but of the vicious standard upon which he had formed his
                    taste, is evident from his correspondence published in the Bio∙</p>

                    his more elaborate compositions, being as remarkable for their natural grace,
                    idiomatic elegance, and perfect perspicuity, as the latter are for their .rugged
                    dulness, their pedantic extravagance, and their affected obscurity. Nothing, in
                    truth, can be more entirely unlike than the philosopher and the. man; the
                    enlightened economist and the haughty aristocratic noble; the friend of Quesnay
                    and the father of Mirabeau; the <hi rend="italic">Ami</hi><hi rend="italic">des

                <p>But all this is by no means without example. Such discrepancies between the
                    public and the domestic characters of men are indeed far from being of rare
                    occurrence. The difference here, however, is unfortunately carried farther than
                    in almost any other instance known. The characteristic of the sect to which the
                    Marquis belonged was a rigorous love of the strictest justice; but his treatment
                    of his son exhibits one perpetual scene of all justice grossly outraged. To
                    observe moderation, to regard the useful end of all things, to act as if they
                    were born not for themselves but for all mankind, were the leading maxims of the
                    Economists:</p>

                    <l part="N">Secta fuit, servare modum finemque tenere,</l>

                </lg>
                <p>The predominant passion of the marquis, however, was family pride; moderation
                    neither in this nor in any other feeling was never for an instant the inmate of
                    his mind nor the regulator of his thoughts; he always spoke, wrote, and acted in
                    private life, as one who never doubted that the world was made for the <hi
                    rend="italic">order,</hi> not the <hi rend="italic">sect,</hi> to which he
                    belonged, and that his first and highest duty was to keep the Mirabeau family at
                    the head of the privileged class. To follow the dictates of nature, and devote
                    their lives to the cause of truth, were precepts constantly inculcated by the
                    Economists. The most inveterate prepossession against his first-born; the most
                    refined cruelty of treatment which his ingenuity could devise for that child;
                    even the expedient of leaving him in wretched circumstances, and restoring him
                    to liberty, that he might either terminate his existence in despair or forfeit
                    his life to the law; accompanied with an adulterous connection formed under his
                    own roof, and which drove from his house a wife who had borne him eleven
                    children, and brought an accession to his income of L.2000 a year ;—such, not to
                    mention imputed iniquities of a still darker complexion, are the traits of
                    private character which distinguished the lover of nature and of truth, and
                    which, in the work already referred to, are, for the most part, represented
                    under the infallible testimony of his own hand. To the same authority we are
                    further indebted for proofs of a difference still more marvellous, and of which
                    there is probably no other example. The author of the dullest, and most heavy,
                    uninteresting books, written in the most tiresome, insipid, and almost
                    intolerable style, is the author of the very best, most lively, and most
                    entertaining letters we have ever met with, written in a style which, for
                    originality, raciness, force, and felicity of diction, is almost without a
                    rival. “Les lettres familières,” says the editor of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoires Biographiques,</hi> “que nous avons par milliers, et qui furent
                    toujours remarquables par un naturel abondant et facile, par one aisance
                    spirituelle et gaie, forment le plus inexplicable des contrastes avec ses écrits
                    destinés à la publicité, tracés pour ainsi dire en sa présence, et dans lesquels
                    le fond toujours très-sensé des idées, est décrédité par la couleur particulière
                    de son style obscur, pesant, et baroque, mélangé de tropes bizarres,
                    d’incohérentes métaphores, en un mot, il faut le dire, de galimatias

                    rather ascendency, which he exercised over the French Revolution, was son of the
                    preceding, and was born at Bignon, near Nemours, on the 9th of March 1749. He
                    was endowed by nature with a robust constitution, a quick and vigorous
                    understanding, a lively imagination, passions more vehement than are almost ever
                    found in union with such intellectual powers, and a disposition kindly and
                    humane. His temperament led to the early development both of his bodily and
                    mental faculties; and there are few instances on record of children forming such
                    manly ideas as he appears to have entertained, even during his infancy. The
                    peculiar circumstances in which he was placed, from his boyhood upwards, by the
                    singular opinions, strange prejudices, and unfeeling temper of his father,
                    exercised a powerful influence upon his whole conduct, and must, in every
                    material respect, have deeply affected his character. Yet we may appreciate his
                    merits and faults even through the artificial covering which was thus thrown
                    over his nature; and although impetuosity of feeling, and a corresponding
                    disregard of the obstacles which he should have respected instead of
                    overleaping, form a predominant feature of his mind and habits, we cannot fairly
                    charge him with those faults which go mainly to form the vicious
                    disposition.</p>
                <p>His youth was confided to an able preceptor, the elder <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193822927" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2927-0286"/> Lachabeaussière; but this
                    meritorious individual, being thwarted in his plan, could not turn to advantage
                    the ardour which devoured his pupil. The latter came out of his hands with a
                    slight knowledge of Latin and of the classics, and was at length thrown into a
                    military boarding-house, where he skimmed the surface of different languages, as
                    well as that of the elegant arts, and was initiated into the mathematics by the
                    celebrated Lagrange. He appears to have been early seized with the desire of
                    writing; for whilst his head was only filled with scattered and isolated
                    notions, he yielded to this impulse, and published an eloge of the great Condé,
                    as well as some pieces in verse. √</p>
                <p>At the age of seventeen he entered the cavalry as a volunteer; and, disregarding
                    the ridicule to which those officers exposed themselves who sought to dignify
                    the futile indolence of a garrison life by some useful employment, he read all
                    the works he could procure on the military art. These studious habits, even if
                    they had not been prompted by an insatiable desire of knowledge, would have been
                    rendered necessary by the parsimony of a selfish and haughty father, who,
                    discovering with pain in the heir of his name, a spirit of independence,
                    incapable of bending to the paternal yoke, adopted a cruel system of checking
                    his prodigious activity by means of pecuniary embarrassments. But the niggardly
                    treatment to which his comfort and respectability were all his life sacrificed,
                    and which his father sought to reconcile with a family pride almost without
                    parallel, never made the son forget who and what he was, by descending to any
                    flagrant act of meanness or dishonour; and whilst pressed by the want of the
                    common necessaries of life, and tortured by the sight of those whom he most
                    loved suffering the same privations, his exertions to relieve himself were
                    always confined to the work of honest though obscure industry; nor has any one
                    of his innumerable enemies, domestic, personal, or political, ever charged him
                    with using, for the purpose of solicitation, that pen which soon became his only
                    resource against want.</p>
                <p>About this time a love adventure in which the young count engaged made a great
                    noise; and in virtue of a <hi rend="italic">lettre</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    cachet,</hi> solicited by his father,‘he was sent prisoner to the Isle of Rhé.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Ami</hi><hi rend="italic">des Hommes</hi> even entertained
                    the notion of cutting off his son from society, by banishing him to the
                    Dutch-American colonies; and it was only by the most pressing representations
                    that the philosophical marquis was induced to abandon the humane project of
                    sending his son to perish under the tropical heats and rains of Surinam. At
                    length the count obtained permission to make the campaign of Corsica, and there
                    served with such distinction that paternal pride was for a moment soothed; but
                    when, recompensed with a brevet as captain of dragoons, he solicited his father
                    to purchase him a regiment, he received this strange reply, “That the Bayards
                    and the Duguesclins had not proceeded thus.” After the submission of Corsica,
                    the Count de Mirabeau took up his pen to draw a picture of the oppression which
                    Genoa had exercised over that country. This work had, no doubt, many
                    imperfections; yet, defective as it was, it bore the impress of talent, and,
                    although it displeased the Marquis de Mirabeau, the states of Corsica thought it
                    of sufficient importance to deserve being printed. On his return to France, he
                    succeeded in ingratiating himself with the Friend of Men, and, to please the
                    philanthropist, consented to bury himself for some time in the Limousin, where
                    he occupied himself with improving the lands, and settling some litigations.
                    But, growing weary of these obscure labours, he repaired to Paris in 1771, and
                    perceived that his short-lived favour was about to expire. It was then that he
                    said to the Marquis of Mirabeau, “Mais, mon père, quand vous n’auriez que de
                    l’amour-propre, mes succès seraient encore les vôtres.” His contempt for the
                    empiricism of the Economists, and the manifest opposition which he showed to the
                    despotism of such men as Maupeou and Terray, completed his disfavour with the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ami</hi><hi rend="italic">des Hommes,</hi> who,
                    notwithstanding his aristocratic pride, had been always accustomed to cringe to
                    authority.</p>
                <p>In the same year he went to Provence, ostensibly to look after the family
                    estates, but probably to domesticate himself amongst the people of that country,
                    and also to raise up there enemies to the new parliament. In 1772, he married
                    Marie-Emilie de Covet, only daughter of the Marquis de Marignane, a young and
                    rich heiress, but whose fortune consisted almost wholly in substitutions and
                    successions, which could not be available until they opened in the ordinary
                    course of events. He received from his father-in-law a pension of 3000 francs,
                    and from his own father an allowance of 6000, being about L.360 in all; but
                    before the lapse of two years he had squandered away the double of all his
                    disposable means, and involved himself in difficulties. Arrangements might
                    easily have been made with his creditors; but the stern patron of the Economists
                    preferred to lay hisson under interdict, and confine him by order of the king to
                    Manosque, a small borough on his property. It was in this seclusion that, warmed
                    by the perusal of Tacitus and Rousseau, Mirabeau wrote in haste, under the
                    impulse of the moment, his <hi rend="italic">Essai sur le Despotisme</hi>
                    (published in Holland in 1776); a piece full of fire and rough vigour, but, as a
                    whole, perhaps the most incoherent of all his productions. The old marquis,
                    dreaming only of formulas, and slavish in his adulation of authority, could
                    scarcely be expected to relish the bold heresies of his son; and, unhappily, the
                    latter was soon guilty of another, and, as it was deemed, still graver
                    transgression.</p>
                <p>Having broken his ban for the purpose of challenging some genteel poltroon who
                    had insultedone of his sisters, but who, when called to account, refused <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 4</hi> to fight, a new proceeding was in consequence
                    directed against him, and his father succeeded in having him detained in the
                    castle of If, whence he was transferred to Fort Joux, in the year 1776. But
                    here, as at the Isle of Rhé, he charmed and conquered all who came near him. By
                    the magic of his language and manners he completely subjugated the governor, and
                    in consequence succeeded in having the adjacent town of Pontarlier included
                    within the limits of his prison. It was during his stay there that he first saw
                    Sophie de Ruffey, a young and amiable girl of about eighteen, whom her parents
                    had married to a husband considerably above seventy, the Marquis de Monnier,
                    ex-president of the chamber of accounts at Dole. Inflamed with the most violent
                    love, he soon succeeded in seducing a young and credulous woman; and this affair
                    immediately involved him in fresh troubles. The family of the outraged husband,
                    that of Madame de Monnier, and his own, combined together, although with
                    opposite intentions, to call down upon his head all the rigour of the law. At
                    this time Malesherbes wrote to him in these terms: “I am quitting the ministry,
                    and the last counsel I can give you is to fly, and take foreign service.”
                    Mirabeau acted on this advice, and Sophie proceeded to rejoin him in
                    Switzerland, whence they took refuge in Holland.</p>
                <p>The conduct of Mirabeau in this affair, though it cannot be defended, admits of
                    some palliation; and it would have been well if the influence of disorderly
                    passions had not plunged him into other and still more culpable excesses. A girl
                    of eighteen married to a man of seventy-five, and only nominally married to this
                    keeper, alternately confiding and jealous, now tempting her by indulgence and
                    carelessness, now watching and restraining with tormenting and suspicious
                    rigour; these were the circumstances which first awakened in Mirabeau’s bosom
                    the most irresistible of the passions, and which is only the more dangerous by
                    so often assuming the garb, and uniting itself with the reality, of virtuous
                    propensities. The elopement which fol <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822940"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-2940-0287"/> lowed, and which was caused by a dislike on both
                    parts to play the hypocrite, and Jive with the man whom they were deceiving,
                    proved altogether alien to the habits of French society, and grievously outraged
                    the feelings of those refined profligates, who, reckoning vice itself nothing,
                    held indecorum to be the worst of all enormities; who preferred the semblance to
                    the reality of virtue, and forgave one offence if the more debasing crimes of
                    falsehood and hypocrisy were added to veil it from the public view. An outcry
                    was accordingly raised throughout all society in France, and even re-echoed in
                    Europe, against the unheard-of enormity. A young woman had left her
                    superannuated husband, whom she had, by the customs of society, been compelled
                    to take as her tyrant and tormentor under that name; and had left him for one of
                    an age near her own, who sacrificed himself for her deliverance. They had
                    rebelled against those rules which regulated the vicious intercourse of nobles
                    in France; they had outraged all the habitual feelings of patrician nature, by
                    refusing to lead a life of pretence, and treachery, and secret indulgence; they
                    had even brought into jeopardy the long-established security of illicit
                    intercourse, understood without being avowed; and the veil was thus about to be
                    torn away from all those endearing immoralities which gave occupation and
                    interest to high life, and broke the monotony of an existence which demanded
                    that it should never be ruffled, except by voluntary excitements. Hence all
                    society, that is, all the upper and worthless portion of it, united against the
                    hapless pair. Mirabeau was regarded as a monster; and the conduct of his father,
                    who hunted him over all Europe, and then immured him in a dungeon during the
                    best years of his life, was excused by all, and censured by none; whilst nobody
                    ever thought of visiting with the slightest blame, none ever ventured “to hint a
                    doubt or hesitate dislike” of that very father, who had turned his wife, the
                    mother of his children, out of doors, and had installed an unprincipled strumpet
                    in her room.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Edinburgh

                <p>He had no sooner fled than the parliament of Besançon charged him with abduction
                    and robbery, condemned him in contumacious absence, and caused him to be
                    decapitated in effigy; a proceeding equally ridiculous in itself, and
                    illustrative of the manners and morals of the time. Meanwhile, the count put
                    himself in the pay of the Dutch booksellers, and sought, by indefatigable
                    labour, to provide resources for himself and his companion. During some eight
                    months, he toiled hard, doing endless Gibeonite work, but commonly earning his
                    gold louis a day. The most considerable task he had to perform was the
                    translation of Watson’s <hi rend="italic">History of Philip II.,</hi> which he
                    undertook along with one Durival. At this time, having learned that his father
                    accused him^of havingdishonoured his bed, Mirabeau made cruel reprisals on his
                    unrelenting parent, by disseminating libels in which the marquis was accused of
                    the most shocking crimes and enormities. Finding his means of subsistence
                    inadequate, he contemplated emigrating to America; but he was not allowed time
                    to carry this project into effect. On the 14th of May 1777, he was seized by
                    Brugnière, an inspector of the French police, at Amsterdam, in virtue of an
                    order from the king, which had been sanctioned by the Dutch government; and,
                    along with Sophie, then pregnant, he was carried to Paris, where he was immured
                    in the fortress of Vincennes, and his mistress placed in a <hi rend="italic"
                    >maison de surveillance.</hi></p>
                <p>In this prison Mirabeau underwent a detention of forty-two months. At first he
                    was allowed neither books nor writing materials; and when at length this
                    indulgence was granted him, he was only permitted to correspond with Madame de
                    Monnier, on the condition that his letters should be seen by the governor,
                    Lenoir (whose affections he had, as usual, entirely gained), and afterwards
                    returned to this keeping. This correspondence lay forgotten in Lenoir’s desk
                    until the year ]792, when it was taken away by Manuel, the procureur of the
                    commune, and by him given to the world on a speculation of profiting by the
                    sale. It would have been well if these letters had never seen the light, and
                    been buried in the gulf of oblivion; and much more does the same observation
                    apply to some of the other writings which were the works of his hours of
                    confinement in Vincennes, particularly to a <hi rend="italic">Bibliση
                    Erotico,</hi> and a romance entitled <hi rend="italic">Ma Conversion,</hi> both
                    shameful and flagitious productions, the subsequent publication of which leaves
                    a deep stain on the memory of Mirabeau. Indeed, one of the darkest parts of his
                    conduct relates, not so much to Madame de Monnier, as to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sophie.</hi> When, under that name, he dragged her before the public, and
                    indulged a loose and prurient fancy in catering to the worst appetites of
                    licentious minds, he became justly the object of aversion and disgust; he ranged
                    himself with the base manufacturers <hi rend="italic">of</hi> obscene works, and
                    even took precedence of these in profligacy by making his own amours the theme
                    of his abandoned contemplations. This is the very worst passage in his history,
                    because it is one which admits neither defence nor palliation. It is nothing to
                    the purpose that these flagitious writings <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have been
                    afterwards used from necessity. If that was the cause of giving such shameful
                    effusions publicity, it may well be said that the offence of the composition,
                    disgusting as it was, merits the least grave portion of the blame. “Mirabeau’s
                    correspondence with Madame de Monnier, from his prison at Vincennes,” says
                    Dumont, “evinced more of sensuality than sentiment. Many <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> his letters are so repugnant to modesty, that they degrade the person
                    to whom they are addressed; for no man would presume to adopt so licentious a
                    style in writing to a woman for whom he had the least esteem.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dumont, Souvenirs de
                    Mirabeau»</p></note> Yet, strange as it may seem, much of this obscenity was
                    borrowed from the licentious novels and periodicals of the day; and even the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mercure de France</hi> was put in requisition, when it afforded
                    any thing suited to the purpose of the writer.</p>
                <p>At length, after an imprisonment of three years and a half, Mirabeau was restored
                    to society and to active life; with impaired strength indeed, but with
                    uqdiminished energy of mind. On his liberation, he had an interview with Madame
                    de Monnier, his Sophie, who had been supposed faithless, and he accordingly
                    charged her with the offence; but she defended her conduct, and recriminated
                    upon her lover, who, it may be presumed, could not so easily repel the
                    accusation. They parted in mutual displeasure, and the estrangement was
                    unhappily eternal. Of the voluntary death which she afterwards sought, and which
                    has been repeatedly attributed to Mirabeau, every circumstance conspires to show
                    that he was entirely innocent. Another accusation which, although often
                    repeated, appears to be equally groundless, is, that about this time he sought
                    to gain the favour of his father, by writing memoirs injurious to his mother,
                    who, amidst all the wrongs she suffered from his family, had never been wanting
                    in tenderness to him. There is something so unnatural and revolting in such an
                    imputation, that, in the absence of all direct or sufficieot evidence, it cannot
                    for a moment be entertained; and, besides, with all his faults and his vices,
                    which the malignity of party has not failed to exaggerate to the utmost, there
                    was in his nature so large a fund of generosity and affection, as to render such
                    conduct upon his part in the highest degree improbable.</p>
                <p>There was one subject, however, which Mirabeau had much at heart, namely, to
                    obtain the reversal of the de-créé<pb break="no" facs="nls:193822953"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-2953-0288"/> which had condemned him to lose his head. With
                    this view he constituted himself a prisoner at Pontarlier, in order to purge the
                    sentence by contumacy, which had been pronounced against him; and there he
                    produced in his defence those memoirs or pleadings which terrified his
                    adversaries, who made vain attempts to obtain their suppression. In these
                    productions it is easy to recognise the talent of a great orator, and to
                    discover indications of that power which afterwards secured him an undisputed
                    supremacy in the States-general and in the National Assembly. Of one of them,
                    which he called his philippic, Mirabeau himself observed, “If this is not
                    eloquence unknown to our barbarous age, I know not wherein consists that rare
                    and seducing gift of heaven.” His efforts were crowned with complete success. He
                    dictated the law for Sophie as well as for himself; by a transaction between Μ.
                    de Monnier and him, all the proceedings were annulled; and his adversary paid
                    the expense.</p>
                <p>Having effected this object, he proceeded to Provence, there to attempt another
                    still more important; which was,to re-unite himself with his wife, and thus
                    recover an income of about L.250a year. He neglected nothing which could
                    contribute to his success; mediations, prayers, affectionate entreaties: thelady
                    was moved by his earnestness; but, yielding to the wishes of her family, she
                    refused to resume the chains which had so deeply galled her. Mirabeau then
                    appealed to the tribunals, employed all his eloquence in urging his claim, and
                    drew a most flattering picture of his wife, whom he described as an angel of
                    gentleness and goodness. The answer to this consisted in narrating his youthful
                    indiscretions, in opposing his past follies to his present protestations. This
                    was ticklish and difficult ground; he felt it to be so, but attempted to show
                    that he had acted generously towards his wife, and produced a letter which
                    appeared to contain proof of an infidelity which he had pardoned. This incident
                    proved decisive, but in a way which he had not foreseen. The judges were of
                    opinion, with D’Aguesseau, that a husband who had accused his wife of infidelity
                    could not cohabit with her; and a decree of separation was accordingly
                    pronounced. Mirabeau appealed the cause to the great council, and demanded the
                    annulling of the judgment, but without success; the court of last resort being
                    of the same opinion with the tribunal before which the cause had in the first
                    instance been tried.</p>
                <p>Mirabeau’s life, for the next five years, presents one continued struggle with
                    all kinds of difficulties and privations. Being destitute of the means of
                    subsistence, and suspected by the authorities, he set out for London in 1784,
                    accompanied by a Dutch girl who had succeeded Sophie in his affections; and
                    there published, in French and English, his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Considerations</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">l’</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ordre</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cincinnatus,</hi> which he had commenced· in Paris under the auspices of
                    Franklin. He translated Price’s Observations on the Importance of the American
                    Revolution, with Reflections and Notes, in which he was assisted by Turgot; and,
                    about the same time, he published his <hi rend="italic">Doutes sur la Liberté de
                    l’Escaut,</hi> in opposition to the views of Joseph II., a production which was
                    speedily followed by his <hi rend="italic">Lettre</hi> to the same sovereign
                    upon his prohibiting emigration. He .attacked the <hi rend="italic"
                    >caisse</hi><hi rend="italic">d’</hi><hi rend="italic">escompte,</hi> the bank
                    of Saint-Charles, and the water-company of 'Paris; and having been openly
                    pointed out as the instrument of Panchaud, Claviĕre, and other speculators, he
                    engaged in a furious controversy with Beaumarchais, who had been employed to
                    reply on behalf of the company, and who treated him with a calm disdain, which
                    was rendered still more offensive by ironical commendations. Mirabeau rejoined
                    like a man whom contempt had rendered frantic; and the violent attack which he
                    made on Beaumarchais, though deformed by gross personalities, is perhaps the
                    most eloquent of all his writings. It produced a great effect at Paris, and
                    contributed not a little to his ulterior success. His activity was, in fact,
                    boundless. Having become acquainted with a geographer, whose name Μ. Dumont does
                    not remember, he meditated writing an universal geography; and if any one had
                    offered him the elements of a Chinese grammar, he would no doubt have attempted
                    a treatise on the Chinese language. He studied a subject whilst he was writing
                    upon it, and he only required an assistant to furnish him with matter. “He could
                    contrive,” says Dumont, “to get notes and additions from twenty different hands;
                    and had he been offered a good price, I am confident he would have undertaken to
                    write even an encyclopaedia.” He had the art of finding out men of talent, and
                    of successfully flattering those who could be of use to him. He worked upon them
                    with insinuations of friendship and ideas of public benefit; whilst his
                    interesting and animating conversation was like a hone which he employed to
                    sharpen his tools. Nothing was lost to him; he was a sort of universal
                    plagiarist, who appropriated for his own benefit the fruits of the reading and
                    study of his friends. But he knew how to employ the information thus acquired,
                    so as to appear to have always possessed it; and when he had begun a work, it
                    was seen to make a rapid and daily progress.</p>
                <p>This state of things, however, could not last long. His wants outrun his means;
                    his father yielded him no effectual assistance; and he was obliged to seek other
                    resources. In these circumstances, he solicited employment from Calonne, who
                    then directed the finances, and was by that minister sent on a secret mission to
                    Berlin. This employment was given him for the triple object of getting rid of a
                    troublesome suitor, of sounding by his means the dispositions of the young
                    prince who was about to ascend the throne ofPrus-sia, and of inducing the
                    latter· to consent to advance a considerable loan to France. The equivocal
                    character in which Mirabeau appeared did not prevent him from evincing his usual
                    zeal and activity. Being honoured with a favourable reception by the Duke of
                    Brunswick, he also obtained the suffrage of the Great Frederick himself, whose
                    last moments he witnessed. To the successor of that monarch, on the very day of
                    his accession, he transmitted a letter, in which he ventured to give some
                    advice, with which the young sovereign did not appear to be offended, though he
                    felt himself under no obligation to follow it. Subsequently, being desirous to
                    open the eyes of Frederick-William respecting the reveries of the illuminati,
                    Mirabeau composed a pamphlet, in which he unsparingly ridiculed Lavater and
                    Count Cagliostro. Nor, amidst these various occupations, did he lose sight of
                    the interests of France. His despatches, addressed to Μ. de Calonne and to the
                    Duke de Lauzun, communicated ample diurnal details respecting the cabinet of
                    Berlin; and being always famished for money, as well as devoured by ambition, we
                    find him in each despatch demanding gratifications and advancement. Meanwhile, a
                    secret statistical table of Germany chanced to fall into his hands. He at once
                    perceived its importance, and managed to get it translated by means of a valet
                    who knew only German, and a French secretary who understood no language but his
                    own. At the same time he acquired ample literary materials, and was indebted to
                    Major Mauvillon for some invaluable documents, which, when classed and arranged
                    by himself, formed the elements of his book on the Prussian monarchy <hi
                    rend="italic">(^Monarchie Prussienne.')</hi> But his activity was too great to
                    escape notice, and Frederick-William, not relishing the perspicacity and
                    vigilance of so close an observer, ordered him to quit the Prussian territory,
                    in which he had resided about eight months. He returned to Paris, and soon
                    became deeply involved in fresh agitation and intrigue.</p>
                <p>Μ. de Calonne was then placing his plans of administration under the protection
                    of the first notables, whom he had <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822966"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-2966-0289"/> just convoked. Mirabeau at once plunged into
                    these discussions, in the only way compatible with his precarious existence,
                    namely, by publishing a violent diatribe, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dénonciation</hi><hi rend="italic">de l' Agiotage,</hi> in which personalities
                    were accumulated without reserve against both Calonne and Neckcr. The
                    consequence was an order of the king, which condemned the pamphleteer to
                    imprisonment in the castle of Saumur; but Mirabeau evaded the intended
                    punishment, and, having placed himself in safety, published the <hi
                    rend="italic">Suite</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Dénonciation;</hi> and in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Lettres à</hi><hi rend="italic">M. Lacretelle,</hi> as well as
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Correspondance avec</hi><hi rend="italic">Cerutti,</hi>
                    he scrupled not to assail the reputation of Necker, which was then at its
                    height. These productions appear to have made a considerable impression. In
                    fact, Mirabeau gained much celebrity by his polemical writings. At a time when
                    political subjects had not yet entered into the circulation of common ideas,
                    when the art of pamphleteering was scarcely cultivated, and only a small number
                    of writers ventured to engage in this species of warfare, they were attractive
                    novelties; and their effect was enhanced by his dogmatic and tranchant manner of
                    handling subjects which he had scarcely studied, and especially by the haughty
                    and arrogant tone which he assumed towards his adversaries. But if he had
                    aggrandized his reputation as a writer, his personal character had sunk to the
                    verylowest possible state of degradation. His discreditable employment as a sort
                    of licensed spy at Berlin, his open connection with the enemies of Neck er, and
                    his ingratitude to Calonne, made him be regarded as a dangerous enemy and a
                    slippery friend; whilst his lawsuits with his family, his elopements, his
                    imprisonments, and his morals, could not be overlooked, even in a city so lax as
                    Paris; and hence his name was pronounced with detestation, and his company
                    shunned, os if he had carried about with him some deadly infection. But common
                    fame is almost always in excess either on the one side or the other. He was by
                    no means the abandoned and demoralized monster he was at this time generally
                    thought to be; on the contrary, there were high and redeeming qualities in his
                    nature, which afterwards displayed themselves on a great theatre of action; and,
                    amidst all his excesses, he never lost his respect for virtue, nor his taste for
                    the society of those whose principles and habits formed a perfect contrast to
                    his own.</p>
                <p>In 1788, his <hi rend="italic">Monarchie Prussienne</hi> appeared at Paris, in
                    eight volumes 8vo, with an atlas in folio. This production consisted of a work
                    written for him by Major Mauvillon, and of extracts from different memoirs
                    procured at great expense. No one can for a moment suppose that, during a
                    residence of only eight months at Berlin, Mirabeau could himself have executed a
                    work of such magnitude, in which every possible information had been introduced
                    respecting the geography, productions, manufactures, commerce, and military
                    condition of Prussia, as well as concerning the religion, education,
                    legislation, and administrative system of that country. But he had the merit of
                    employing the talents of an officer who was scarcely known to the government he
                    served; and the Prussian ministers must have been much surprised at finding that
                    a man who had resided so short a time in the country could singly undertake so
                    arduous a task, and succeed in supplying them with more materials than could be
                    found in the united offices of their several departments. “The work,” says
                    Dumont, “is an illustration, by facts, of Adam Smith’s principles of political
                    economy; and it clearly proves that Prussia has always been a sufferer whenever
                    she has departed from these principles.”</p>
                <p>His next publication was one of a much less creditable character. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">Secrete du Cabinet de Berlin</hi>
                    is an indiscreet revelation of the diplomatic manoeuvres of Mirabeau, written in
                    a spirit of bitter criticism, with all the licentious freedom of a libel; and it
                    excited general indignation against the author, who had unscrupulously violated
                    the secrets of hospitality, and the confidence of his friends, as well as that
                    of the government, in order to supply pabulum to public malignity. In this
                    disgraceful production, the Emperor Joseph II., the king of Prussia, and
                    particularly Prince Henry, who was then at Paris, were all equally ill treated.
                    Louis XVI. conceived that some satisfaction was due to the diplomatic corps, who
                    had been so grossly assailed, and accordingly the libel was adjudged by the
                    parliament to be burned by the hands of the common hangman. The worst passage of
                    Mirabeau’s life is the publication of the Letters to Sophie; but that of the
                    Berlin Correspondence is equally ' without justification, although on different
                    grounds. In extenuation of this proceeding, it has been observed, that the whole
                    object of his existence depended upon the supplies which it furnished; that
                    without it his election in Provence would have been hopeless. But this is a
                    sorry topic, even of palliation.</p>
                <p>’ Great events were now near at hand. On the 27th of December 1788, the
                    long-expected royal proclamation appeared, definitively convoking the
                    States-general for May 1789. Need we ask whether Mirabeau now bestirred himself;
                    whether or not he was off to Provence, to the assembly of the noblesse, with al]
                    his faculties screwed to the sticking-place? A prospect had at length opened to
                    him of rising superior to the humiliation of his youth, and the contempt
                    attached to the precarious and degraded life he had led; he seems to have had a
                    presentiment of the part which he was soon destined to perform in a mighty
                    revolution, now about to commence; and he lost no time in taking means to bring
                    about the accomplishment of his destiny. In the list of the popular candidates
                    his name was accordingly proclaimed, in all parts of Provence, beside that of
                    Raynal; and he laboured with unwearied activity in stimulating public feeling,
                    proclaiming the necessity of political regeneration, denouncing abuses, exposing
                    tyranny and misgovernment, agitating and contending by day, writing pamphlets
                    and paragraphs by night, and, in short, straining every nerve to attain the
                    first and grand object of his ambition. Nevertheless, when he presented himself
                    in the assembly of the noblesse to vote with his peers, the latter excluded him,
                    upon the pretence that the possessors of fiefs alone had the right of sitting
                    amongst them. Against this fatal decision, which confirmed the alienation of the
                    most dangerous enemy which the ignorance and insolence of a privileged order
                    raised up for their own overthrow, Mirabeau protested in eloquent and energetic
                    terms, exposing the folly of his order, and prognosticating the doom which it
                    was now preparing for itself. We can only afford room for two paragraphs of this
                    celebrated remonstrance.</p>
                <p>“W <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> hat have I done that was so criminal ?” he
                    exclaimed. “I have wished that my order were wise enough to give to-day what
                    will infallibly be wrested from it to-morrow; that it should receive the merit
                    and glory of sanctioning the assemblage of the three orders, which all Provence
                    loudly demands. This is the crime of your ‘ enemy of peace.’ Or rather, I have
                    ventured to believe that the people might be in the right. Ah, doubtless, a
                    patrician soiled with such a thought deserves vengeance. But I am still guiltier
                    than you think; for it is my belief that the people which complains is always in
                    the right; that its indefatigable patience, invariably waits the uttermost
                    excesses of oppression, before it can determine on resisting; that it never
                    resists long enough to obtain complete redress, and does not sufficiently know,
                    that to strike its enemies into terror and submission, it has only to stand
                    still; that the most innocent as the most invincible of all powers is the power
                    of refusing to act. I believe after this manner; punish the enemy of peace.”</p>
                <p>“In all countries, in all times, aristocrats have implacably<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193822979" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2979-0290"/> persecuted the people’s
                    friends; and if, by some singular combination of fortune, there chanced to arise
                    such an one in their own circle, it was he above all whom they struck at, eager
                    to inspire wider terror by the elevation of their victim. Thus perished the last
                    of the Gracchi by the hands of the patricians; but, being struck with the mortal
                    stab, he flung dust towards heaven, and called on the avenging deities; and from
                    this dust sprang Marius, —Marius, not so illustrious for exterminating the
                    Cimbri as for overturning in Rome the tyranny of the noblesse.”</p>
                <p>. It is admitted by his enemies, that during his sojourn in Provence, Mirabeau
                    gave proofs of equal ability and moderation. Surrounded by seditious movements,
                    he repeatedly acted as mediator between the insurrection and the authorities,
                    who would probably not have been sorry to find an occasion or pretext for
                    proceeding against him. He restrained the violence of the multitude, by whom he
                    was borne along in triumph; and being recommended to the suffrages of the
                    electors of the <hi rend="italic">tiers-etat,</hi> he was proclaimed deputy both
                    at Aix and at Marseilles. He made choice of the former, and immediately set out
                    for Paris, to endeavour to arrange certain prosecutions which he had drawn upon
                    himself by the publication of his despatches from Berlin. On the 4th of May
                    1789, Madame de Staël, looking from a window in the principal street of
                    Versailles, as the deputies walked in procession from the church of Notre Dame
                    to that of Saint Louis to hear high mass and be there constituted
                    States-general, saw and above all distinguished the Count de Mirabeau amongst
                    those nobles who had been deputed to the third estate. “The opinion men had of
                    his genius,” says the celebrated daughter of Necker, “was singularly augmented
                    by the fear entertained of his immorality; and yet it was this very immorality
                    which straitened the influence his astonishing faculties were to secure him. You
                    could not but look long at this man, when once you had noticed him. His immense
                    black head of hair distinguished him amongst them all; you would have said his
                    force depended on it, like that of Samson. His face borrowed new expression from
                    its very ugliness; his whole person gave you the idea of an irregular power, but
                    a power such as you would figure in a tribune of the people.” This description
                    of his personal appearance seems to be as just as it is striking. In regard to
                    character, he was so fully aware that if he had enjoyed personal consideration
                    all France would have been at his fleet, that there were moments when he would
                    have consented to pass seven times through the heated furnace to purify the name
                    of Mirabeau.</p>
                <p>Mirabeau’s history during the remaining twenty-three months of his life falls not
                    to be written here; yet it is an astonishing passage, into which, short as it
                    proved, are crowded the history of the Revolution in its first development, and
                    that of the sudden and undisputed ascendency which he gained over the National
                    Assembly, the Revolution itself, and indeed all France. When he appeared in the
                    hall of the States-general, and his name was first read out, a disapproving
                    murmur arose from the assembly, followed by hooting, instead of the applause
                    with which some other well-known names had been greeted. Insult and contempt
                    showed how low he stood in the estimation of his colleagues. He perceived and
                    felt the disrespect into which he had fallen; yet by his lofty and undaunted
                    bearing he evinced his inherent sense of superiority, and scowled defiance at
                    the murmurers. He was indeed the member of members; the most notable single
                    element in that remarkable assembly; the man who, after a little time, was to
                    become a power in the Revolution, to brave the court, to overawe the factions,
                    and to exercise an undisputed supremacy. In one of those moments which are
                    cardinal, and decisive for centuries, he visibly saved, by his own force and
                    energy, the existence of the Constituent Assembly. On the 23d of June, the royal
                    proclamation was promulgated, ordaining the assembly to dissolve, and to meet
                    again on the morrow as the separate third estate. A military force was at hand;
                    the king’s orders were express; and the Bastille, or even the scaffold itself,
                    might be the penalty of disobedience. Yet Mirabeau disobeyed. When all around
                    him were dismayed and panic-stricken, he raised his commanding voice to restore
                    their faltering courage, and to re-animate that assembly which had but lately
                    murmured at the very sound of his name. De Brézé entered with the king’s renewed
                    order to separate. “Gentlemen,” said he, “you have heard the king’s commands.”
                    “Yes, sir,” replied Mirabeau, “we have heard what the king has been advised to
                    say; and you, who cannot be the interpreter of his meaning to the
                    States-general, you who have neither vote, nor seat, nor right of speech here,
                    you are not the man to remind us of it. Go, sir, tell those who sent you that we
                    are here by the will of the nation, and that nothing but the force of bayonets
                    shall drive us hence.” This was not a mere bravado. It was giving form and
                    expression to feebler but similar sentiments; it was imparting energy to less
                    concentrated and less resolute wills. Mirabeau possessed in a high degree the
                    courage produced by excitement; and he was endowed with wonderful presence of
                    mind. Hence he went through the Revolution like a force, commanding and
                    overruling all. Whilst innumerable theorists and pedants were manufacturing
                    their paper constitution, which “proved but the almanac of a single year,” he
                    looked not at speculations about social contracts, but at men and things;
                    discerning what was to be done, and straightway proceeding to do it. He alone
                    was capable of saving the monarchy on the one hand, and of repelling anarchy on
                    the other. He fascinated, overawed, and subjugated every one. When the court
                    found it necessary to treat with him, even Marie Antoinette was charmed with the
                    tribune of the people, whom she had had so much cause to dread and to hate. In a
                    word, he was the man of the Revolution, the king of that mighty popular
                    movement, whilst he lived; and only with life would he in all probability have
                    lost that command of it, which, by his power, his address, and his presence of
                    mind, he had gained. But, unhappily, his allotted months were fast running out.
                    Never were such wonders, such prodigies, crowded into so short a space of time;
                    but the waste of energy rapidly impaired even his iron frame; and his last hour,
                    a sorrowful one for France, was nigh at hand.</p>
                <p>His health was now rapidly declining. “If I believed in slow poisons,” said he to
                    Dumont, “I should think myself poisoned. I feel that I am dying by inches, that
                    I am consuming in a slow fire.” Dumont observed to him that his mode of life
                    would long ago have destroyed any man less robust than he. Not an instant of
                    rest from seven in the morning until ten or eleven at night; continual
                    conversations, agitations of mind, and excitement of every passion; too high
                    living, in food only, for he was temperate in liquor. “You must be a
                    salamander,” said Dumont, “to live in the fire which is consuming you.” The
                    irritation of his system, at this time, produced ophthalmia, and, whilst he was
                    president of the assembly, he sometimes found it necessary to apply leeches to
                    his eyes, in the interval during the adjournment of the sitting from the morning
                    to the evening; and he attended the assembly with his neck covered with linen,
                    in order to staunch the blood. His parting words to Dumont were memorable. “I
                    shall die at the stake,” said he, “and we shall never perhaps meet again. When I
                    am gone, my value will be appreciated. Misfortunes to which I have put a stop
                    were overwhelming France in every direction; but that base faction whom I now
                    overawe will again be let loose upon <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822992"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-2992-0291"/> the country. I have none but direful
                    anticipations. Ah, my friend, how right were we when, in the beginning, we tried
                    to prevent the commons from being declared a National Assembly. This is the
                    origin of the evil. Since they have gained that point, they have not ceased to
                    show that they are unworthy of confidence. They wanted to govern the king,
                    instead of being governed by him; but neither they nor he will govern; <hi
                    rend="italic">a vile faction will rule the country, and debase it by the most
                    atrocious crimes.”</hi></p>
                <p>In the same prophetic spirit, and with the same instinctive penetration, he
                    observed to Talleyrand, “Itakewith me the last shreds of the monarchy.” The
                    severity of his judgments was, at the time, attributed to hatred or jealousy;
                    but it has been fully confirmed by succeeding events; nor was there a man of any
                    consequence in the assembly, the sum of whose conduct did not correspond with
                    the opinion which Mirabeau had formed of him. His last illness, which was acute
                    enteritis, brought on by excesses, lasted only four or five days, during which
                    he suffered the most excruciating agony; yet, in the intervals of pain, when the
                    dreadfully violent fits were over, he would resume his serenity, his mildness,
                    and his amiable attentions to those around him. He perceived that he was an
                    object of general interest, and he never for a moment ceased to speak and to act
                    as if he were a great and noble personage performing his part. In the extreme
                    agony of convulsions, and covered with a chilly perspiration, there were moments
                    when it required more than the force of a philosopher to support life; yet he
                    preserved to the last his spirit unbroken, and, to use the happy expression of
                    Talleyrand, dramatised his death. This extraordinary man expired in the arms of
                    his friends, on the morning of the 2d of April 1791. No religious aspirations
                    arose to hallow or console his last moments; he died professing the most decided
                    materialism, the blank and cheerless creed of the time.</p>
                <p>Mirabeau had a degree of confidence in his own powers, which supported him in
                    difficulties under which another would have sunk. His imagination loved whatever
                    was great, and his mind possessed extraordinary powers of discrimination. He had
                    natural good taste, which he had cultivated by reading the best authors of
                    several nations. Without any depth of information, he made good use of the
                    little he possessed; but, whether from some natural defect of judgtnent, or from
                    the influence of feeling and passion, he often proved an unsafe guide in
                    speculation, and still more frequently in action. What he possessed beyond other
                    men was an eloquent and impassioned soul, which, the instant it was excited,
                    animated every feature of his countenance; and nothing was more easy than to
                    bring on the requisite degree of excitement. He had been accustomed, from his
                    youth, to consider the two great questions of politics and government; but he
                    was not qualified to enter deeply into them. The work of discussion,
                    examination, and doubt, was beyond his reach; he had too much warmth and
                    effervescence of mind for didactic method or laborious application. His mind
                    proceeded by starts and leaps, but his conceptions were bold and vigorous. He
                    abounded in forcible expressions, of which he made a particular study; and he
                    was peculiarly qualified to shine in a popular assembly, at a stormy period,
                    when force and audacity were the necessary passports to success.</p>
                <p>Of his genius, the best monuments which remain are his speeches, and these were
                    not always, indeed seldom, his own composition. Dumont, Duroverai, Clavière,
                    Reybaz, and other men of distinguished ability, did more than assist him. But
                    some of the finest are known to have been his own; and the greatest passages,
                    those which produced the most magical effects, were the inspiration of the
                    moment. Indeed he never appeared greater than when called to preside over the
                    assembly, and of course thrown entirely upon his own resources. Envy had
                    contributed to his elevation; his enemies had hoped that, in the president’s
                    chair, a portion of his natural fire would be quenched, and that his influence
                    would suffer a corresponding diminution. But they found themselves wofully
                    disappointed in their calculation. Never had this office been so well filled,
                    and he displayed in it a new kind of talent. He introduced order and clearness
                    into the proceedings; he simplified the forms, which were but ill understood; he
                    explained a question or put down a tumult by a single word; he distinguished
                    himself by the precision of his observations, and his answers to the several
                    deputations at the bar, which were always remarkable for dignity and elegance;
                    and by his activity, impartiality, and presence of mind, he increased his
                    reputation, and added splendour to his talents in an office which had proved a
                    quicksand to many of his predecessors. “His enemies, and those jealous of his
                    eloquence,” says Dumont, “who had voted for him, in order thereby to cast him
                    into the shade and reduce him to silence, were bitterly disappointed when they
                    saw him add another wreath to the chaplet of his glory.”</p>
                <p>At the same time, it must be confessed that no inconsiderable portion of his
                    reputation, both as an orator and a writer, was usurped and fictitious. He felt
                    himself absolutely incapable of writing upon any subject, except he was guided
                    and supported by the work of another. His style, naturally strained, degenerated
                    into turgescence, and he was soon disgusted with the emptiness and the
                    incoherence of his own ideas. But when he had materials to work upon, he could
                    prune and connect them, impart to them a greater degree of life and force, and
                    impress upon the whole the stamp of true eloquence. In fact, he gave splendour
                    to whatever he touched, by introducing here and there luminous thoughts,
                    original expressions, and passages full of fire and eloquence. But the most
                    remarkable faculty he possessed was that of discovering obscure talents;
                    applying to each the degree of encouragement necessary to its peculiar
                    character; and animating those who possessed them with his own zeal, so as to
                    make them eagerly co-operate in a work of which he was to reap all the credit.
                    This was the great secret of his success. “When I worked for Mirabeau,” said
                    Dumont, “I seemed to feel the pleasure of an obscure individual who had changed
                    his children at nurse, and introduced them into a great family'. He would be
                    obliged to respect them, although he was not their father.” Indeed Mirabeau
                    attached himself so strongly to his adopted children, that he felt for them the
                    affection of a parent; and, even in his last illness, he gave to Μ. de
                    Talleyrand a speech upon wills, which had been written for him by Reybaz,
                    saying, “There! these are the last thoughts the world shall have of mine; I
                    deposit this manuscript with you; read it when I am no more; it is my legacy to
                    the assembly.” Such was the Count de Mirabeau. On his very deathbed he preserved
                    his thirst for artificial fame, when he had acquired so much personal glory that
                    his reputation required not to be decked out with the laurels of others. He had
                    an insatiable appetite for appropriating the labours of others.</p>
                <p>As a political orator Mirabeau was in some respects superior to all other men. He
                    had a rapid intuition, a quick and sure perception of the feelings of the
                    assembly, and well knew how to apply his entire strength to the point of
                    resistance, without exhausting his means. No orator ever did so much with a
                    single word or phrase, nor hit the mark with so sure an aim; none but Mirabeau
                    ever forced the general opinion by a happy insinuation, or by a strong
                    expression. In the tribune he was immoveable; no agitation in the assembly had
                    the least effect on him; and he retained the command of his temper, even under
                    the severest personal attacks. But one thing was wanting to make him a perfect
                    political orator, namely, the power of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823005"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-3005-0292"/> discussion. His mind could not embrace a chain of
                    reasoning or evidence, nor could he refute methodically; and hence, after a
                    brilliant exordium, he had often no alternative but to abandon the field to his
                    adversaries. He was powerless in reply, because he had not taken the pains to
                    anticipate objections and discuss details. Satisfied with a happy turn of
                    expression, or a striking thought, he never gave himself the trouble of studying
                    a subject sufficiently to be able to discuss it, and maintain the opinion he had
                    advanced. He seized every thing with marvellous facility, but developed nothing.
                    He wanted the practice of refutation; this great art, so indispensable to a
                    political orator, was altogether unknown to him. The triumph of Mr Fox consisted
                    in the possession of that talent which Mirabeau wanted; in reply he was
                    irresistible. He recapitulated all the arguments of the adverse party, put them
                    in a new light, and gave them more force; yet having thus placed himself in the
                    most difficult situation imaginable, he never appeared stronger than when he
                    seemed about to be overthrown. The only speakers in the National Assembly who
                    possessed any share of this faculty were Maury, Clermont-Tonnère, Barnave, and
                    Thouret. Mirabeau’s voice was full, manly, and sonorous; and being always
                    powerful yet flexible, it could be heard as distinctly when he lowered as when
                    he raised it. His ordinary manner of speaking was slow; and, in his impassioned
                    moments, the feeling which made him dwell upon certain words to give them
                    emphasis prevented him from ever speaking rapidly. Amongst his personal
                    advantages he counted his robust frame, his size, and his strongly-marked
                    features seared with the small-pox. His ugliness was so great as almost to
                    become proverbial; but his natural vanity, almost as exaggerated as his
                    deformity, even drew from its excess materials of self-gratification. “Personne,
                    disait-il, ne connait la puissance de ma laideur.” The power of his eye,
                    however, was undeniable; and the spirit and expression which his mind threw into
                    his countenance made it any thing rather than uninteresting or disgusting.<note

                    is well known. Mirabeau was dilating on the qualities required in him who should

                    enumerating qualities notoriously possessed by himself; when the witty statesman
                    added, Et qu’il soit trace' de la petite ve'role, n’est-ce pas ?”
                    </p></note></p>
                <p>After what has been said, it is scarcely necessary to dwell on his personal
                    character. Though not himself a moral man, he had a decided taste for the
                    society of those whose rigidity of principle and severity of morals contrasted
                    with the laxity of his own; and, even in the midst of his excesses, he had
                    preserved a certain dignity and elevation of mind, combined with an energy of
                    character, which distinguished him from the effeminate and exhausted rakes that
                    swarmed in Paris. Slave as he too generally proved himself to the love of
                    indulgence, his courage was above all suspicion; and even his share of a virtue
                    far more rare, fortitude under calamity, surpassed that of most other men. All
                    the hardships he had undergone, all the torments he had suffered from so many
                    forms of ingenious persecution, never for a moment infused any bitterness into
                    his disposition, which was originally kind and benevolent. “I never knew a man,”
                    says Dumont, “more jealous of the esteem of those whom he himself esteemed, or
                    one who could be acted upon more easily, if excited by the sentiment of high
                    honour.” But, unfortunately, there was nothing uniform and permanent in his
                    character. He was the creature of impulse, and obeyed too many impetuous
                    masters. When burning with pride or jealousy, his passions were terrible; he was
                    no longer master of himself, and committed the most dangerous acts of
                    imprudence. In connecting himself with the court, during the last six months of
                    his life, Mirabeau had no other object than to gratify his habits of expensive
                    indulgence, and to become prime minister. He was not a traitor to the popular
                    cause, because he was too able a tactician to commit so great a political error;
                    but it is nevertheless impossible not to agree with Dumont in reprobating the
                    sudden turn which he took, when policy required a suspension of hostilities, and
                    the quick transition from menaced and even boastful destruction, to absolute
                    neutrality. If not sold to the court, he was at least paid by it; and although
                    it might be true that his object was, if possible, to save the monarchy, yet the
                    mode in which he proposed to accomplish this object was neither creditable in
                    itself, nor likely to be attended with success; whilst the “enormous price” paid
                    for his expected services fixes the indelible stain of venality on his memory.
                    Still his death was a great calamity to France. Whilst Mirabeau lived,
                    Robespierre and his satellites durst no more have ventured to show themselves,
                    than bats to fly about in the sunshine of noonday. He was as omnipotent in the
                    Jacobin Club as in the Constituent Assembly.</p>
                <p>Some anecdotes of this extraordinary man may not be altogether out of place here.
                    He was fond of nicknames, and often peculiarly happy in bestowing them. He
                    called the king of Prussia <hi rend="italic">Alaric-Cottin</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> he designated Siéyes by the name of <hi rend="italic">Mahommed;</hi> he
                    called D’Espréménil, a conspirator in a small way, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crispin-Cataline</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> he baptized the rigid Camus by
                    the appellation of the <hi rend="italic">Drapeau Rouge,</hi> because he had a
                    fiery countenance, with a blood-coloured nose; and he painted Lafayette by the
                    sobriquet of <hi rend="italic">Grandisοη-Cromwell.</hi> Of Necker, to whom he
                    was invariably unjust, he observed, “He is like a clock which always goes too
                    slowly and again, “Malebranche saw every thing in God,” said he, “but Necker
                    sees every thing in Necker.” Of the National Assembly he remarked, “It has
                    Hannibals enow, it only wants a Fabius.” Speaking of the illusions which, having
                    once governed men, were for ever destroyed, he said, “We have long been looking
                    through a magic lantern, but the glass is now broken.” “When a pond is full,”
                    said he, “a single mole, by piercing the bank, may cause an inundation.” Dining
                    one day with the Count de Montmorrin, he was asked by the latter what he thought
                    of his brother, who, being a fat and heavy man, was called by the people <hi
                    rend="italic">Mirabeau-Tonneau,</hi> or Barrel-Mirabeau. “He would be a man of
                    wit and a scapegrace in any family but ours,” replied Mirabeau. The viscount,
                    however, was also an epigrammatist in his own way. Being reproached by his
                    friends with having, one evening, attended the assembly almost in a state of
                    inebriation, Barrel-Mirabeau replied, “My brother has left me only that vice.”
                    Mirabeau had very wisely determined to decline every duel during the sittings of
                    the National Assembly; and hence doubts have been entertained of his personal
                    courage, although without the shadow of a foundation, “They can procure as many
                    bullies as they like,” said he, “and thus, by duels, get rid of every one who
                    opposes them. For if a man killed ten of these fellows, he might fall by the
                    eleventh.” All his ambition was centred in the idea of becoming prime minister
                    of France, because he thought, and not without reason, that he could eclipse
                    every minister who had preceded him. He felt himself powerful enough to attract
                    within the sphere of his patronage every man of distinguished abilities, and he
                    conceived he would be able to form a constellation of talents, the brightness of
                    which would dazzle Europe.</p>
