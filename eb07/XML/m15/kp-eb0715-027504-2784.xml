                <p><label type="entry">MINING</label>, the art of working mines, or of extracting
                    minerals and mineral ores from the bowels of the earth.</p>
                <p>This includes the scientific knowledge necessary for opening and working mines,
                    and preparing the ores for use; it requires an intimate acquaintance with
                    mineralogy and geology, as well as the different processes by which mines may be
                    wrought to advantage, useful minerals searched out and brought to the surface,
                    and means employed for mechanically and chemically separating metals from their
                    ores; besides the essential operations of sinking shafts, driving galleries and
                    adit levels, removing all difficulties which occur in the course of the work,
                    propping up the superincumbent earth or rock so as to give security, to the
                    miners, and constructing the machinery necessary either for draining mines or
                    performing the requisite operations in the preparation and reduction of ores.
                    The preparation of ores consists in breaking asunder the larger pieces, and then
                    purifying them by means of water from the earth which adheres to them; in the
                    separation of the coarser substances from the finer, by means of a sieve moved
                    up and down in water; in the crushing of the ore in stamping-mills, by means
                    either of hammers or iron cylinders; and, lastly, in the separation of the
                    metallic substances from the stone or earth with which they are combined, by
                    washing the crushed ore in troughs or on inclined tables crossed by a current of
                    water, so that the heavier ore may remain, whilst the lighter substances are
                    carried away by the stream of waler. Mining further includes the final
                    purification of the ore by amalgamation or otherwise, and its reductions by
                    means of· fusion. In the case where the object of mining is to obtain a mineral
                    substance, as coal, which is fit for immediate use when brought to the surface,
                    that term is employed in a more restricted sense, being limited to the
                    operations which are requisite for the simple extraction and bringing up from
                    the pit or mine the mineral in question.</p>
                <p>I. The application of science to the art of practical mining has hitherto been
                    made only to a limited extent. Yet the theory of the formation of mineral and
                    metallic substances, and the rules which may lead to their discovery, are
                    objects of much greater national importance than is commonly supposed. The
                    circumstance^ under which minerals are usually found, the mode of obtaining
                    them, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822797" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2797-0276"
                    />their probable extent and value, are inquiries which, whilst they must ever be
                    highly interesting to the man of science, who seeks knowledge for its own sake,
                    are altogether essential to the mining proprietor, as affording the only means
                    by which he can form a correct judgment respecting the mode of working adopted
                    by the practical miner.</p>
                <p>The advantage to be derived from a knowledge of well-established facts respecting
                    the arrangement and distribution of mineral substances, will be best illustrated
                    by examples of the errors and oversights committed where this knowledge was
                    wanting. It is generally known that, for some years, lime was exported to New
                    South Wales, where it exists in abundance in its natural state. In Cornwall,
                    ores of silver and cobalt were, until recently, thrown away from a mine which
                    has, since the discovery of their value, returned upwards of L. 10,000 a year
                    from these ores; and in the same country, although celebrated for its tin mines
                    from the earliest periods of history, yet, until last century, the ores of
                    copper were employed only to repair the roads. Wherever the copper appeared in a
                    lode, it was a common expression that the ore came in and “spoiled the vein and,
                    even in the present day, but little attention is paid to whatever is not
                    manifestly either tin or copper, or known to yield these metals. In Derbyshire,
                    although lead has been smelted from the common blue ore ever since the time of
                    the Romans, the other ores of the same metal were never thought of, but left in
                    heaps, as rubbish; yet we have lived to see a public road, made and repaired
                    with these rejected ores, actually taken up and smelted to good account.
                    Instances might also be mentioned of persons who, in the belief that their
                    estates contained valuable mineral veins, engaged in expensive workings, and
                    sometimes ruined their fortunes; when a slight acquaintance with geology would
                    have served to convince them that a successful result, if not impossible, was at
                    least highly improbable. As to the practical miner, he is altogether the
                    creature of habit, holding geology in but little estimation, and smiling at the
                    nice distinctions of the mineralogist. Hence, if any inquiry be made of him
                    respecting the interesting phenomena of veins, he generally prefers the theory
                    of his forefathers to that which has been deduced from the results of more
                    recent and accurate investigations.</p>
                <p>In this country no public means have been employed for removing ignorance and
                    counteracting prejudice in regard to the working of mines. But the case is
                    different on the continent. Both France and Germany possess national
                    institutions for facilitating the study of the sciences applicable to mining
                    operations; and the advantage of such a course of education is sufficiently
                    demonstrated by the fact, that the companies formed for working mines in South
                    America and Brazil have given a decided preference to mining officers trained in
                    the schools of France and of Germany. Besides, of all speculative employments,
                    mining is perhaps the most uncertain. Experience and ingenuity are frequently
                    baffled; the most promising appearances often end in disappointment; whilst from
                    veins which some persons have abandoned in despair, others have frequently
                    derived enormous profits. This very uncertainty, however, only affords another
                    argument for concentrating all the lights of science, in order as far as
                    possible to lessen the risk of disappointment, and to afford the miner some
                    surer guide than chance or caprice in pursuing his exploratory labours.</p>
                <p>It may be observed generally, that the materials which compose the crust, if not
                    the body, of the earth, are variously distributed, yet preserve their relative
                    positions, from the surface downwards to the greatest depths hitherto obtained;
                    those substances which consist of homogeneous matter being collected together
                    and deposited either above or below a similar stratum of other substances in a
                    continued series of depositions. That these deposits were originally parallel
                    with the earth’s surface may be reasonably supposed, and indeed appears to admit
                    of almost no doubt; yet by some great convulsion of nature, some prodigious
                    force acting upwards, the strata have been raised and broken through, whilst the
                    corresponding parts being raised and depressed in different directions, the
                    edges of the whole series have been elevated to the surface in an uniform curve
                    or right line, appearing in the side of a cliff or mountain, or protruding in
                    enormous masses of great extent and altitude; at the same time that the lower
                    stratum still preserves the same relative position which it assumed in its
                    original formation. By attending to this important fact, geologists are enabled
                    to ascertain the order of stratification in any country or district, and thence
                    to form a tolerably correct opinion respecting its mineral contents to a much
                    greater depth than can ever be reached by mining operations.</p>
                <p>If, for instance, the stratum be found to dip at a certain angle, by observing
                    carefully the superincumbent strata, we may at once discover not only the depth
                    at which a shaft proposed to be sunk will cut the stratum sought, but also the
                    nature of the strata to be passed through in its course. The superincumbent
                    strata will sometimes be found to vary in thickness, and a proportional
                    allowance must then be made in the working for this deviation from the previous
                    estimate. When the strata descend in the line of their dip or inclination, the
                    depth to which they reach beneath the surface is unknown; but they are seldom
                    found to continue their descent very far at the same angle, and are either
                    curved in the coal formation, bent in another direction, or altogether
                    dislocated. In the upper series or formation, the strata are not uniform in
                    their construction, but are intersected by fissures resembling the bottom of a
                    muddy pool dried up by the sun; and these cavities, when empty, are sometimes of
                    great extent. Eldon Hole, and the other subterranean wonders of the Peak in
                    Derbyshire, may be cited as remarkable examples of such dislocations. These
                    fissures, however, are commonly filled with mineral substances, or metalliferous
                    ores, in which case they are termed <hi rend="italic">veins</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> their inclination generally ranges from 45° to the
                    vertical, or 90°; and their course downwards, like that of the strata, is seldom
                    terminated within the limits of human labour and research. But some cases have
                    nevertheless occurred where the metallic produce has to all appearance been
                    worked out, or where the vein has branched into filamentous portions at two or
                    three hundred feet below the surface.</p>
                <p>Formerly the richest part of a vein of copper ore was supposed to be situated at
                    a depth of from forty to fifty fathoms, and that of a vein of tin at from twenty
                    to sixty fathoms; but experience derived from the deep workings carried on in
                    Cornwall has proved this idea to be erroneous. When a vein or stratum is
                    terminated abruptly, by the crossing of another vein or stratum in a transverse
                    direction, or by perpendicular fissures filled with alluvial matter, this is not
                    considered as a termination of the vein, which, in fact, is only broken off or
                    disjoined, and may again be discovered by searching in the analogous part on the
                    opposite side of the deranged strata. As to the methods employed in following a
                    metalliferous vein when broken off by faults or dykes, these are necessarily
                    various, according to circumstances; and it is in such cases that the practical
                    knowledge and experience of the miner are of far more avail than all the
                    suggestions of theory. Veins occur in almost every species of rock, and vary in
                    thickness from a mere filament to many fathoms; they are very unequal in the
                    different parts of their course, but they are commonly widest above. Narrow
                    veins are usually short, whilst those of considerable breadth extend to a great
                    distance. The silver vein of Veta Madre, at Guanaxuato, has been work <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193822810" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2810-0277"/>ed to the extent
                    of 14,000 yards, at a depth of more than 570 yards, and from forty-three to
                    fifty yards in thickness; and some other veins in South America have been traced
                    to a distance of not less than eighty miles. A vein consists sometimes of one
                    substance, at other times of many. In the latter case, these substances preserve
                    an uniformity of position, parallel to the sides of the vein, in regular
                    corresponding order, to the centre; so that, when traced downwards, the central
                    seam first disappears, and the layers that enclosed it, being of homogeneous
                    matter, coalesce, forming another central seam, which disappears in its turn,
                    and is succeeded by the next, until a simple vein alone remains, gradually
                    decreasing to its final termination. It has been observed, that veins similar to
                    each other in mineral produce run parallel, or follow very nearly the same
                    course throughout the district in which they are found, although occurring in
                    different strata; and that veins containing other minerals in their immediate
                    neighbourhood, or in the same stratum, always run in another direction. Thus, in
                    Cornwall, when a vein of tin or copper ore, bearing east and west, is crossed by
                    another running north and south, the intersecting vein is sometimes lead or
                    antimony, but never tin or copper.</p>
                <p>The principal metalliferous veins in England take a direction from east to west.
                    When two veins running nearly parallel meet and join, they produce a good body
                    of ore at the point of junction. If the principal vein dip at a less angle than
                    the secondary one, it is usually found to be enriched by the latter; but if it
                    dip at a greater angle, it is impoverished in like proportion. Sometimes a vein
                    is joined by another, which, after falling into its course, and continuing for
                    some distance to run parallel to it, suddenly resumes its original state, and
                    breaks off in a different direction. For the most part, tin and lead lie nearer
                    the surface than copper. Where the latter is met with in large masses, the vein
                    commonly falls off shortly afterwards; but when the lode is found spotted with
                    small portions of copper ore, there is a strong presumption that the produce
                    will be rich and lasting. A large and productive vein is usually accompanied by
                    others which fall into the main lode. The abundance of water in a lode is
                    considered as a promising indication, inasmuch as dry veins are never very rich
                    in ore. Lodes consist of hard solid stone, or less compact, soft, and crumbling
                    materials. If the adjoining strata contain much spar and quartz, then the
                    metalliferous ore in the lode is found in a solid, hard, stony substance; but
                    when nature has been more sparing of her cement, the ore is generally met with
                    in a loose and rub-bly state.</p>
                <p>Experience has shown that certain minerals and metals are more frequently found
                    attached to particular rocks than to other materials, and that some of them are
                    discovered only in particular strata. Metalliferous veins are generally
                    encompassed with some stone or other substance peculiar to the mine, which, from
                    the appearance of the rock, apprises the miner of his approach to the vein. It
                    has been ascertained that the arrangement of the materials of the earth is to a
                    certain extent regular and uniform. Hence, when we know the particular
                    substances near which certain metals and minerals are generally found, together
                    with their usual disposition in the strata; and when, in another situation, we
                    meet with the same materials similarly disposed; we may conclude with tolerable
                    confidence, that the metal or mineral we are in quest of is not far distant, and
                    that the operations may be continued with a reasonable prospect of success.
                    Where a bed of mineral produce exists, it may be expected to extend throughout a
                    considerable tract of country; but, from the curvature of formation, or from
                    dislocation of the strata, it may nevertheless disappear at a particular point,
                    and be lost, until it again rises to the “outcrop,” or is accidentally met with
                    in boring or sinking a shaft at a considerable distance from the original
                    working.</p>
                <p>For the more complete elucidation of what has been stated above, we shall now
                    describe shortly the several formations, with their general characteristics, the
                    minerals which are usually found in them, and the localities in which the most
                    important mines are situated.</p>
                <p>The rocky masses composing the crust of the globe consist either of simple
                    homogeneous bodies, as limestone; or of an aggregation of two or more simple
                    materials, as granite. In some strata no organic remains whatever have been
                    discovered; in others the fossil remains of animal and vegetable matter are of
                    frequent occurrence. This diversity of character is the foundation of an
                    arrangement, according to which rocks are divided into primary and secondary.
                    The rocks belonging to the primitive formation are found under every other
                    stratified mass, and never resting upon nor covering any; they follow a certain
                    invariable order of succession, and exhibit determinate relations with other
                    strata. Thus, granite is never found alternating with sandstone, nor gneiss
                    covering a bed of coal. In mountainous countries, the primitive formation,
                    upheaved in Alpine chains, offers itself to our notice in stupendous masses,
                    having the strata of other formations resting upon and supported by their bases;
                    or, as sometimes happens, without such formations altogether. Primitive rocks
                    contain, either occasionally or exclusively, almost every metal hitherto
                    discovered. They may be classed, in the usual order of their occurrence, under
                    the denominations of granite, gneiss, mica slate, topaz rock, clay slate,
                    porphyry, trap, limestone, serpentine, quartz, gypsum, flint slate, and syenite.
                    Their component minerals are quartz, hornblende, felspar, mica, and
                    limestone.</p>
                <p>Granite is supposed to be the most ancient and most abundant of all substances.
                    It forms the base and sometimes the whole mass of mountains; it constitutes a
                    part of the Alps and the Pyrenees, the mountains of Cornwall, Saxony, and
                    Silesia, the grand chain of the Ural and Altai in Asia, the Atlas in Africa, and
                    the Andes and Cordilleras in South America. It is formed by a concretion of the
                    granular particles of felspar, quartz, and mica, irregularly mingled, strongly
                    adherent, and evidently the effect of simultaneous crystallization. The size,
                    colour, and relative proportions of the particles differ greatly, but felspar
                    with a reddish tint generally predominates. It is one of the hardest and most
                    durable rocks known. Granite is much less metalliferous than any other of the
                    primitive rocks; but it nevertheless yields tin and iron in considerable
                    quantities, rarely gold or silver, and sometimes, in minute veins, molybdena,
                    lead, copper, zinc, manganese, bismuth, galena, and blende.</p>
                <p>Gneiss is immediately incumbent on granite, and is composed of the same
                    substances; but mica, being more abundant, forms a granular slaty mass. This
                    rock is rich in mineral produce; indeed all the useful metals, excepting
                    quicksilver, are found in it, sometimes in beds, but more frequently in veins.
                    The greater part of the mines in Saxony and Bohemia are in gneiss mountains. In
                    the vicinity of Freyberg more than two hundred veins of silver, lead, tin,
                    copper, and cobalt, have been worked in gneiss; and the silver mines of
                    Königsberg are in the same rock. It is abundant in Scotland and the isles
                    adjacent; and also in South America and the United States.</p>
                <p>Mica slate, or schistus, is composed of mica and quartz. It has a slaty
                    structure, mica being the chief ingredient; its colour is gray tinted with green
                    or yellow, sometimes brown; and it differs from gneiss, upon which it rests, by
                    being disposed in leaves rather than in distinct scales. It contains beds of
                    magnetic iron ore; iron, copper, and arsenical pyrites; red iron ore, lead
                    glance, blende, gold, and cobalt; whilst in the veins are found similar ores to
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822823" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2823-0278"/>those
                    discovered in gneiss. The mines of Dalecarlia and Fahlun in Sweden, the gold
                    mines of Monte Rose, some of those in Saltzburg, the silver mines of
                    Johann-Georgenstadt and Bransdorf, and many others, are in this rock. It is also
                    common in Scotland, on the continent, and in many other parts of the globe.</p>
                <p>Topaz rock is of very inconsiderable extent, and is hardly to be considered as a
                    distinct species. It is composed of quartz, tourmaline, topaz, and lithomarge,
                    in granular concretions; but it has hitherto been met with only in Saxony, where
                    it forms a rock which is known by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >schneckeìistein.</hi></p>
                <p>Clay slate is a simple rock, sometimes forming entire mountains; but the cliffs
                    are not so steep and rugged as in granite and gneiss formations; and it is also
                    much more favourable to vegetation. One of the varieties of this stratum is the
                    well-known material for covering roofs of buildings; the rest partake of its
                    general characters. It passes by different gradations into mica slate, acquiring
                    a glistening lustre in its approach to that formation; it is distinctly
                    stratified, and is rich in metal, containing tin, lead, cobalt, silver, pyrites,
                    copper ore, and sometimes gold. The veins in Cornwall often run in <hi
                    rend="italic">killas,</hi> which is a variety of clay slate; and some curious
                    phenomena occur in their passage through the strata. If the vein contain tin ore
                    in the granite, it will frequently change to copper in the killas; and if tin be
                    abundant in the killas, copper will supply its place in the granite. This rock
                    is very widely distributed, and occurs in all parts of the world. In Saxony,
                    Bohemia, Hungary, and in North and South America, mines are worked in it, some
                    er them to a very considerable extent.</p>
                <p>Porphyry consists of crystals of quartz or felspar in a cement of hornstone or
                    claystone; it is not stratified, nor do any mineral beds occur in it; and its
                    colour varies according to the nature of the basis, although red and black are
                    the most common. It is so hard that the art of cutting it for sculpture is now
                    lost; indeed modern tools make no impression on the surface, although huge
                    columns, and many beautiful specimens of chiselling, remain to convince us that
                    it was practised by the ancients in great perfection. Many metalliferous
                    minerals are found in porphyry. The mines of Hungary are worked in enormous
                    rents or fissures in this rock. Porphyry also appears in Cornwall, Sweden,
                    France, Saxony, Carinthia, Hungary, Siberia, Abyssinia, and North and South
                    America.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Mining

                <p>For details as to the mineral deposits contained in the other primitive rocks,
                    the reader is referred to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Mines,</hi> where,
                    under the different heads, ample information will be found on this, as well as
                    on various other matters connected with the present subject.</p>
                <p>II. One of the most important operations of practical mining is that of blasting,
                    of which we shall now proceed to give some account.</p>
                <p>The first part of the process consists in preparing or boring the hole for the
                    reception of gunpowder. This is effected with the sharpened bar and the borer,
                    represented in fig. 1, the length and breadth of both being variable. The shaded
                    portion <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> which is the cutting part, is of tempered
                    steel; and the upper part, which is held by the workman, consists of iron. In
                    the western part of Cornwall, the borer is held in one hand and the hammer in.
                    the other, the operation being performed by one person; but in the central and
                    eastern parts, one person usually holds the borer, whilst another applies the
                    hammer or <hi rend="italic">mallet.</hi> From the borer being kept constantly in
                    motion, the hole is made of a circular form, its depth varying from eight inches
                    to five feet, and its breadth from one to three inches. Water is poured into the
                    hole if none issue from the rock, to facilitate the operation of the borer; and
                    the abraded matter is withdrawn by the <hi rend="italic">scraper,</hi> fig. 2.
                    It is afterwards further cleaned with a piece of wood, called a <hi
                    rend="italic">swab-stick,</hi> one end of which is prepared for the purpose.
                    When the hole is inclined, and intended to be deep, a long borer is used, which
                    one man raises and lets fall, the operation being for the most part performed by
                    the momentum acquired by the instrument in descending from the height to which
                    it is raised. This is called “<hi rend="italic">jumping</hi> If the hole be dry
                    and much inclined, the gunpowder is now poured into it, the quantity requisite
                    being at first guessed; but after a few explosions, it is seen whether the
                    proportion employed be a just one or not, that is, sufficient to fracture the
                    rock without breaking it in pieces and scattering them to a distance. If the
                    latter effect be produced, the quantity of powder is diminished; but if the rock
                    be not fractured, it must be increased. As some of the gunpowder will adhere to
                    the moist sides of the hole, this must be wiped down with the and of the
                    swab-stick. If the <hi rend="italic">rush</hi> be used to convey a spark to the
                    charge, a piece of clay is laid upon it, and through both the needle is inserted
                    until it reaches <hi rend="italic">nearly</hi> to the bottom of the hole.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">nail,</hi> fig. 3, is a metallic rod gradually tapering to
                    a point, and at the other end it is formed into a ring. It was formerly made
                    entirely of iron; but latterly its pointed extremity has been made of copper,
                    because, during its insertion or removal, the iron-pointed nail Sometimes caused
                    ignition, and thus led to fatal consequences. Next to the powder is put some dry
                    substance, and then clay, upon which are put down and gently beaten with the <hi
                    rend="italic">tamping</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ramming bar,</hi> fig. 4, pieces
                    of some stony substance, which readily yields to the hammer without giving a
                    spark, as roofing tile, soft slate, decomposing porphyry, friable granite, coal,
                    or solid copper, which are all occasionally used. At first a little is put in
                    and beaten firmly down; then a second small quantity, a third, a fourth, and so
                    on until the hole be entirely filled. It is desirable that each layer should be
                    very thin, as the confining power of the tamping is considered to be in
                    proportion to the number of layers; but this must be understood within certain
                    limits. The tamping bar is usually made of iron, the lower extremity being shod
                    with copper or brass; Dr Paris found, however, that an alloy of eighty-six parts
                    of copper and fourteen of tin proved the most durable. The next point is the
                    removal of the nail, which is effected by striking it upwards, or by the use of
                    a lever. The rush is then introduced into the hole left by the nail, the pith
                    having been first removed and its place filled with fine gunpowder. When all
                    this has been done, nothing remains but the application of the fire, which is
                    communicated by the ignition of one end of a match, or a piece of coarse paper
                    smeared with grease, the other end being placed in contact with the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193822836" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2836-0279"/> rush, and the
                    slow combustion affording time for the escape of the workmen.</p>
                <p>The ignition of the charge, however, is frequently effected by the train being
                    contained in a rod of quills, or by the use of Bickford’s patent safety-rods.
                    When either of these is employed, it is placed in the hole before the
                    introduction of the charge; and in these cases the nail is not required. The
                    operation of tamping is in every respect conducted as before. The rod of quills
                    is merely a tube of common goose-quills, the smaller end of one being inserted
                    in the larger extremity of another, until the tube be of the length required,
                    that is, equal to the hole bored in the rock. The gunpowder with which the tubes
                    are filled should be bruised to dust, and packed very closely in the tube. It
                    might be thought that the compression to which such tubes are exposed during the
                    process of tamping would prevent their combustion; but this is not the case, for
                    so strong are they, when properly filled, that even the pressure of a smith’s
                    vice would produce no such result. The patent safety-rod is a column of
                    gunpowder enveloped in a series of hempen yarns twisted spirally round it, and
                    perfectly flexible. It is about three eighths or one half of an inch in
                    diameter, consumes slowly, and rarely becomes extinguished until it be entirely
                    burnt. The expense of the quills and the safety-rods is nearly the same, that
                    is, threepence per fathom in length.</p>
                <p>The preceding remarks are intended to apply to an <hi rend="italic">inclined</hi>
                    perforation. But when the aperture is nearly horizontal, which is frequently the
                    case, the introduction of the charge is somewhat more difficult. Some miners
                    make a cartridge or tube of paper, which they cement with grease, and which,
                    being filled with fine gunpowder, is pushed with the swab-stick to the further
                    extremity of the hole; others charge with the <hi rend="italic">fluke,</hi>
                    which may be described as the half of a hollow cylinder divided in the line of
                    its axis, and being attached to the end of an iron rod, fig. 5, resembles a
                    carpenter’s auger, or a marrow-spoon. The tamping is in all cases alike, and the
                    train may be laid in either of the ways already mentioned.</p>
                <p>But when the hole has been moistened by the infiltration of water, the operation
                    is much more difficult, and is accomplished either by claying the hole, or by
                    introducing the charge in a pitched bag or tin-plate cartridge. Claying consists
                    in filling as much of the further extremity of the hole as the charge is
                    intended to occupy, with stiff clay, impervious to water, or at least very
                    nearly so. Through this clay a cylindrical bar, usually made of iron, is pushed
                    nearly to the extremity of the perforation, in order to make a space for the
                    reception of the charge, which is at once introduced, and then the hole is
                    tamped and the train laid in the ordinary manner. This operation requires to be
                    performed with great rapidity, because the clay not being quite impervious to
                    water, may become saturated, and the charge moistened, so as not to ignite when
                    the train is fired. The pitched bag, above mentioned, is made of canvass, and so
                    covered with pitch as to be impenetrable to water; the tin-plate cartridge is
                    simply a tin case in a cylindrical form. When the bag or cartridge is used the
                    charge is placed in it, the train for its ignition being laid through a
                    tin-plate tube about one fourth of an inch in diameter. This receptacle is
                    placed in the further extremity of the hole, sometimes imbedded in clay, and is
                    tamped in the usual manner. The pitched bag is preferred to the cartridge,
                    because the one fits the hole more exactly, whilst the regular figure of the
                    other retains round it a little air, which, in yielding to the compressing
                    force, impedes the full effect of the explosion.</p>
                <p>An apparatus, invented by Captain Chenhalls, of St Just, in the western part of
                    Cornwall, and denominated the <hi rend="italic">shifting cartridge,</hi> has
                    been found useful in charging holes of small depth. Fig. 6 represents a section
                    of this instrument. It consists of a copper cylinder <hi rend="italic">a
                    b,∙</hi> two feet in length, and one inch in diameter, containing a moveable rod
                    c, which is graduated in inches, and has affixed to its extremity a leaden plug
                    <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> whilst the cap <hi rend="italic">g</hi> is made to
                    take off, in order to allow, at any time, the removal of the rod, for cleaning
                    the interior. The manner of using it has been thus described. Draw out the rod
                    as many inches as you require it to deliver of gunpowder, then invert the
                    instrument, fill it, and place a piece of moistened clay at the mouth of the
                    cylinder; it is now to be inserted in the hole, when, by pressing down the
                    sliding-rod, the whole charge is immediately delivered in a mass without any
                    loss; but before the instrument is withdrawn, the rod should be several times
                    rammed down smartly upon the gunpowder. In charging <hi rend="italic">back
                    holes,</hi> that is, holes nearly horizontal, the clay should be stuck upon the
                    end of the plug <hi rend="italic">d</hi> previously to the introduction of the
                    powder into the cylinder. When quills are used for a fuze, it will be found
                    advantageous to affix in the cylinder a smaller tube for their reception, as
                    represented by <hi rend="italic">er.</hi> Much has been said as to the waste of
                    gunpowder in mines in consequence of the ignorance or carelessness of the
                    workmen; and there is probably some ground for censure in this respect. But, on
                    the other hand, whilst it is difficult for any but a practical miner to say
                    where a perforation can be advantageously made, so nothing but experiment can
                    determine the quantity of gunpowder requisite for any given hole, and this must
                    necessarily be left to the workmen.</p>
                <p>It has been frequently asserted that sand is a good and efficient substitute for
                    tamping, as commonly practised; and numerous experiments have been made to
                    establish this point, but hitherto without any very satisfactory results. In
                    many cases the sand has been blown out, whilst, in some instances, effective
                    explosions have ensued. Further experiments are certainly required to set this
                    important point at rest, by determining the circumstances upon which success or
                    failure depend.</p>
                <p>With respect to accidental or premature explosions, by far the larger portion of
                    these either originate from the nail, or are produced in the course of the
                    tamping process. Those which originate through the nail occur only when the rush
                    is used, and although the number of accidents has been considerably diminished
                    since it was pointed with copper, yet even this has not entirely prevented them.
                    They are caused, first, by the nail being driven to the very bottom of the hole,
                    and its there coming in contact with substances which by percussion generate a
                    spark; secondly, the nail, during the tamping, is subject to concussion, which,
                    in certain circumstances, will produce a similar effect; and, thirdly, the
                    removal of the nail may occasion a like result, especially if, when introduced
                    into the hole, it had been so forcibly driven to the bottom as to bend its
                    point, for in this case the curved part will occasion considerable disturbance
                    in the contents of the hole, and the danger will not be materially diminished by
                    the circumstance of the nail being pointed with copper. But by putting a small
                    piece of clay at the bottom of the hole, and by taking care not to force the
                    nail against its lower extremity, the hazard arising from this cause may in a
                    great measure be obviated. The dangers incident to the tamping process spring
                    chiefly from the gunpowder adhering to the sides of the hole; so thaf, if a
                    spark be struck out during the operation, it will communicate to these
                    particles, and ignite the charge. Fire may be struck, first, by the contact of
                    the tamping bar with such portions of the sides of the hole as are calculated to
                    afford a spark from collision; secondly, by the action of this instrument upon
                    portions of the tamping, when the bar is not shod with copper or brass; thirdly,
                    by the friction of such substances in tamping, against similar bodies in the
                    sides of the hole; and, fourthly, by the friction of various parts of the
                    tamping<pb break="no" facs="nls:193822849" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2849-0280"/>
                    against one another. The precautions to be used against the occurrence of
                    accidents of this kind are, first, removing carefully the adhering particles of
                    gunpowder from the sides of the hole; secondly, the use of a tamping bar shod
                    with a substance which does not readily strike fire; and, thirdly, care in
                    selecting substances for tamping which do not readily afford sparks by impact
                    upon one another. Notwithstanding the use of quills and safety-rods, explosions
                    of this class sometimes occur, their causes being apparently beyond the reach of
                    such contrivances. But of the fatal acbidents which have occasionally happened,
                    the greater part are attributable to the carelessness of the workmen, rather
                    than to their ignorance. Many explosions have originated from want of caution in
                    boring a charge which has not ignited owing to the train having somehow been
                    extinguished. In such cases, the tamping is removed by the borer, and, from the
                    indifference of habit, the workmen frequently take no more care than if they
                    were forming, or “beating down,” a new perforation.<note anchored="true"

                <p>III. Humboldt, speaking of the state of the mining art in Mexico strongly
                    censures the method of blasting by powder, as therein employed. The holes for
                    the reception of the cartridges are, he thinks, generally too deep, and the
                    miners are not sufficiently careful in diminishing the mass of rock intended to
                    yield to explosion. <hi rend="italic">A</hi> great waste of gunpowder is
                    consequently occasioned. In the mine of Valenciana, powder to the amount of
                    L.150,000 was consumed from 1794 to 1802; and the mines of New Spain annually
                    require from 12,000 to 14,000 hundredweights. Humboldt thinks it probable that
                    two thirds of this quantity is uselessly employed.</p>
                <p>The timber-work is also, according to him, very carelessly performed, although it
                    ought the more to engage the attention of the proprietors of mines, as wood is
                    every year becoming scarcer on the table-la&lt;ιd of Mexico “The masonry
                    employed in the shafts and levels,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Especially in the mines of Valenciana, Guanaxuato, and Real
                    del Monte.</p></note> and especially the walling with lime, deserves great
                    praise. The arches are formed with great care; and in this respect the mines of
                    Guanaxuato may stand a comparison with whatever is most perfect at Freyberg and
                    Schemnitz. The shafts, and still more the galleries or levels, have generally
                    the defect of being dug of too great dimensions, and of occasioning, by that
                    means, exorbitant expenses. We find levels at Valenciana,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Canon de la Soledad.</p></note> executed with
                    the view of making trial on a poor vein, of a height of twenty-six or
                    twenty-nine feet. It is an erroneous opinion, that this great height facilitates
                    the renovation of the air; the ventilation depends on the equilibrium and
                    difference of temperature between two neighbouring columns of air. They also
                    believe, equally without foundation, that, in order to discover the nature of a
                    powerful vein, very large drifts are requisite, as if, in mineral veins of from
                    six to eight fathoms in width, it were not better to cut from time to time small
                    cross drifts, for the purpose of discovering whether the mass of the vein begins
                    to grow richer. The absurd custom of cutting every evel of such enormous
                    dimensions prevents the proprietors from multiplying the means of trial, so
                    indispensable for the preservation of a mine and the duration of the works. At
                    Guanaxuato the breadth of the oblique shafts dug stairwise is from five to six
                    fathoms; and the perpendicular shafts are generally three, four, or five fathoms
                    in diameter. The enormous quantity of ores extracted from the mines, and the
                    necessity of working in them the ropes attached to six or eight whims,
                    necessarily occasion the shafts of Mexicoto be made of greater dimensions than
                    those of Germany; but the attempt which has been made at Bolanos, to separate by
                    beams the ropes of the whims, has sufficiently proved that the breadth of the
                    shafts may be diminished without any danger of the ropes getting entangled in
                    their oscillatory motion. It would in general be very useful to make use of
                    kibbles instead of leathern bags suspended by ropes for the extraction of the
                    ores.</p>
                <p>“The greatest fault observable in the mines of Néw Spain, and which renders the
                    working of them extremely expensive, is the want of communication between the
                    different works. They resemble ill-constructed buildings, where, to pass from
                    one adjoining room to another, we must go round the whole house. The mine of
                    Valenciana is justly admired on account of its wealth, the magnificence of its
                    walling, and the facility with which it is entered by spacious and commodious
                    stairs; yet it exhibits only a union of small works irregularly conducted; they
                    are as it were <hi rend="italic">cul de sacs,</hi> and without any lateral
                    communication. I mention this mine, not because it is more faulty than the
                    others in the distribution of its labours, but because we might naturally
                    suppose it to be better organized. As subterranean geometry had been entirely
                    neglected in Mexicotill the establishment of the School of Mines, there is no
                    plan in existence of the works already executed. Two works in that labyrinth of
                    cross levels and interior winzes may happen to be very near each other without
                    its being possible to perceive it. Hence the impossibility of introducing, in
                    the actual state of most of the mines of Mexico the wheeling by means of
                    barrows, and an economical disposition of the ore plats.”</p>
                <p>The same distinguished traveller has also animadverted on the defective machinery
                    employed in working and draining the Mexican mines. “We have already spoken of
                    the truly barbarous custom of drawing off the water from the deepest mines, not
                    by means of pump apparatus, but by means of bags attached to ropes which roll on
                    the cage of a whim. The same bags are used in drawing up the water and the ores;
                    they rub against the walls of the shafts, and it is very expensive to keep them
                    in repair. At the Real del Monte, for example, these bags only last seven or
                    eight days; and they commonly cost five, and sometimes seven and eight shillings
                    a piece. A bag full of water, suspended to the cage of a whim with eight horses
                    <hi rend="italic">{malacate doble),</hi> weighs 1250 pounds; it is made of two
                    hides sewed together. The bags used for the whims called <hi rend="italic"
                    >simple,</hi> those with four horses <hi rend="italic">(malacates
                    sencillos'),</hi> are only half the size, and are made of one hide. In general
                    the construction of the whims is extremely imperfect; the bad custom also
                    prevails of forcing the horses, by which they are made to go at far too great a
                    speed. I found this speed at the shafts of San Ramon, at Real del Monte, to be
                    no less than ten feet and a half per second; at Guanaxuato, in the mine of
                    Valenciana, from thirteen to fourteen feet; and everwhere else I found it more
                    than eight feet. Don Salvado Sein, professor of natural philosophy at Mexico has
                    proved, in a very excellent paper on the rotatory motion of machines, that,
                    notwithstanding the extreme lightness of the Mexican horses, they produce only
                    the <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi> of effect on the whims when, exerting a force
                    of 175 pounds, they walk at a pace of from five to six feet in the second.</p>
                <p>“It is to be hoped that pumps, moved either by horseengines of a better
                    construction, or by water-wheels, or by pressure-engines, will at last be
                    introduced in the mines of New Spain. If wood, and coal, which has only yet been
                    discovered in New Mexico should be found sufficiently abundant for employing the
                    steam-engine, the use of it would be of great advantage in the inundated mines
                    of Bolanos, as well as in those of Rayas and Mellado.</p>
                <p>“It is in the draining the mines of water that we particularly<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193822862" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2862-0281"/> feel the indispensable
                    necessity of having plans drawn up by subterranean surveyors <hi rend="italic"
                    >(géomètres).</hi> Instead of stopping the course of the water, and bringing it
                    by the shortest road to the shaft where the machines are placed, they frequently
                    direct it to the bottom of the mine, to be afterwards drawn off at a great
                    expense. In the district of mines of Guanaxuato, nearly two hundred and fifty
                    workmen perished in the space of a few minutes, on the I4th of June 1780,
                    because, not having measured the distance between the works of San Ramon and the
                    old works of Santo Christo de Burgos, they had imprudently approached this last
                    mine while carrying on a drift in that direction. The water, of which the works
                    of Santo Christo were full, flowed with impetuosity through this new gallery of
                    San Ramon into the mine of Valenciana. Many of the workmen perished from the
                    sudden compression of the air, which, in taking vent, threw to great distances
                    pieces of timber and large masses of rock. This accident would hot have happened
                    if, in regulating the operations, they could have consulted a plan of the
                    mines.” <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
