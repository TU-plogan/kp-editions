                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    senior, a celebrated physician and anatomist, was the son of Mr John Monro, who
                    was for some years a surgeon in the army under King William in Flanders, and who
                    afterwards settled in that capacity in Edinburgh. The subject of this
                    biographical sketch was born in London in 1697. He showed an early inclination
                    to the study of physic; and his father, after giving him the best education
                    which Edinburgh then afforded, sent him successively to London, Paris, and
                    Leyden, to improve himself further in his profession. At London he attended the
                    lectures of Hawksbecand Winston on experimental philosophy, and the anatomical
                    demonstrations of Mr Cheselden. At Paris he frequented the hospitals, and the
                    lectures on the different branches of physic and surgery; and, towards the end
                    of autumn 1718, he went to Leyden, and studied under the celebrated Boerhaave.
                    On <pb break="no" facs="nls:193824669" xml:id="kp-eb0715-4669-0420"/>his return
                    to Edinburgh in the autumn of 1719, Drummond and Macgill, who were then conjunct
                    nominal professors and demonstrators of anatomy to the Company of Surgeons,
                    having resigned in his favour, his father prevailed on him to read some public
                    lectures on anatomy, and to illustrate them by showing the curious anatomical
                    preparations which he had made and sent home when abroad. He at the same time
                    persuaded Dr Alston, then a young man, to give some public lectures on botany.
                    Accordingly, in the beginning of the winter 1720, these two young professors
                    began to give regular courses of lectures, the one on the materia medica and
                    botany, the other on anatomy and surgery; and these were the first regular
                    courses of lectures on any of the branches of medicine which had ever been read
                    at Edinburgh, and may be looked upon as the opening of that medical school which
                    has since acquired so great reputation all over Europe.</p>
                <p>In the summers of 1721 and 1722, Dr Monro, by the persuasion of his father, read
                    some lectures on chirurgical subjects, particularly on wounds and tumours, which
                    he never would publish, having written them in a hurry, and before he had much
                    experience; but he inserted from time to time the improvements which he thought
                    might be made in surgery, in the volumes of Medical Essays and Observations, to
                    be hereafter mentioned.</p>
                <p>About the year 1720, his father communicated to the physicians and surgeons at
                    Edinburgh a plan which he had long formed in his own mind, of having the
                    different branches of physic and surgery regularly taught at Edinburgh. This was
                    highly approved <hi rend="italic">of</hi> by them; and through their interest
                    regular professorships of anatomy and medicine were instituted in the
                    university. Such was the foundation of the Medical Faculty of Edinburgh. His
                    son, Dr Monro, was first made university professor of anatomy; and, two or three
                    years afterwards, Drs Sinclair, Rutherford, Innes, and Plummer, were made
                    professors of medicine; the professorship of materia medica and botany, which Dr
                    Alston then held, having been added to the university many years before.
                    Immediately after these gentlemen were elected professors, they began to deliver
                    regular courses of lectures on the different branches of medicine; and they and
                    their successors have uniformly continued to do so every winter since that
                    time.</p>
                <p>But the plan for a medical education at Edinburgh was still incomplete without an
                    hospital, where students could see the practice of physic and surgery, as well
                    as hear the lectures of the professors. A scheme was therefore proposed by Dr
                    Monro’s father, and others, particularly the members of the Royal College of
                    Physicians and Board of Surgeons, for raising by subscription a fund for
                    building and supporting an hospital for the reception of diseased poor; and Dr
                    Monro published a pamphlet setting forth the advantages which would attend such
                    an institution. In a short time a very considerable sum of money was raised; a
                    small house was fitted up; and patients were admitted into it, and regularly
                    attended by many of the physicians and surgeons in town. As the fund for this
                    charity had considerably increased, owing in a great measure to the activity and
                    influence of Mr George Drummond, the foundation was laid of the present large,
                    commodious, and useful hospital, the Royal Infirmary, in the planning of which
                    Dr Monro suggested many useful hints; and, in particular, the elegant room for
                    chirurgical operations was designed and executed under his direction. Provost
                    Drummond and he were nominated the building committee, and the fabric was
                    completed in a short space of time. It has since been so largely endowed, as to
                    be capable of receiving a great number of diseased poor, whose various cases the
                    students of physic and surgery have an opportunity of seeing daily treated with
                    the greatest attention and care by physicians and surgeons eminent in their
                    profession; and a register of the particulars of all the cases which have been
                    received into the house since it was first opened has been kept, in books
                    appropriated to that purpose, for the use of the students.</p>
                <p>In order to render the hospital of still further use to the students, Dr Monro
                    frequently, whilst he continued professor of anatomy, gave lectures on the
                    chirurgical cases; and Dr Rutherford, then professor of the practice of physic,
                    began, in the year 1748, to deliver clinical lectures, to be continued every
                    winter, on the most remarkable cases which occurred in the hospital.</p>
                <p>Dr Monro, though he was elected professor of anatomy in the year 1721, was not
                    received into the university till the year 1725, when he was inducted along with
                    Mr Colin Maclaurin, the celebrated mathematician, with whom he ever lived in the
                    strictest friendship. From this time he regularly every winter gave a course of
                    lectures on anatomy and surgery, from October to May, upon a most judicious and
                    comprehensive plan; a task in which he persevered with the greatest assiduity,
                    and without the least interruption, for nearly forty years; and so great was the
                    reputation he had acquired, that students flocked to him from the most distant
                    corners of his majesty’s dominions.</p>
                <p>In 1759 the professor entirely relinquished the business of the anatomical
                    theatre to his son Dr Alexander Monro, who had returned from abroad, and had
                    assisted him in the course of lectures the preceding year. But after this
                    resignation, he still endeavoured to render his labours useful to mankind, by
                    reading clinical lectures at the hospital for the improvement of the students.
                    Of these, Dr Duncan, who was one of his pupils, has given an interesting
                    account. “There I had myself the happiness of being a pupil, who profited by the
                    judicious conduct of his practice, and was improved by the wisdom and acuteness
                    of his remarks. I have indeed to regret that I attended only the last course of
                    lectures in which he had ever a share, and at a time when he was subjected to a
                    disease which proved at length fatal. Still, however, from what I saw and from
                    what I heard, I can venture to assert, that it is hardly possible to conceive a
                    physician more attentive to practice, or a preceptor more anxious to communicate
                    instructions. His humanity in the former of these characters led him to bestow
                    the most anxious care on his patients while they were alive; and his zeal in the
                    latter induced him to make them the subject of useful lessons when they happened
                    to die. In the different stations of physician, of lecturer, and of manager in
                    the hospital, he took every measure for inquiring into the causes of diseases,
                    by dissection. He personally attended the opening of every body; and he not only
                    dictated to the students an accurate report of the dissection, but with nice
                    discrimination contrasted the diseased and sound state of every organ. Thus, in
                    liis own person he afforded to the students a conspicuous example of the
                    advantages of early anatomical pursuits, as the happiest foundation for a
                    medical superstructure. His being at once engaged in two departments, the
                    anatomical theatre and clinical chair, furnished him with opportunities both on
                    the dead and living body, and placed him in the most favourable situation for
                    the improvement of medicine; and from these opportunities he derived every
                    possible advantage which they could afford.”</p>
                <p>His father, Mr Monro, lived to an advanced age, and enjoyed the unspeakable
                    pleasure of beholding a son, esteemed and regarded by mankind, the principal
                    actor in the execution of his favourite plan, which formed the great object of
                    his life, that of foundinga seminary of medical education in his native country.
                    The son, who survived him nearly thirty years, had the satisfaction to behold
                    this seminary of medical education frequented yearly by three or four hundred
                    students, many of whom came from the most distant corners of his majesty’s
                    dominions, and to ice it <pb break="no" facs="nls:193824682"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-4682-0421"/>arrive at a degree of reputation far beyond his
                    most sanguine hopes. Dr Monro died on the 10th of July 1767, in the 70th year of
                    his age.</p>
                <p>Of his works, the first in order is his Osteology, which was written for the use
                    of students, but is capable also of affording instruction to the oldest and most
                    experienced practitioner; as, besides a minute description of the parts copied
                    from nature, it everywhere abounds with new and important observations
                    immediately applicable to practice. It has been translated into many different
                    languages; has passed through numerous editions; and has been reprinted in
                    foreign countries in the most superb manner, accompanied with elegant and
                    masterly engravings. His description of the Lacteal Sac and Thoracic Duct
                    contains the most accurate account of that important part of the body which has
                    yet been published; and his Anatomy of the Nerves will transmit to posterity an
                    excellent example of accurate dissection, faithful description, and ingenious
                    reasoning. The six volumes of Medical Essays and Observations, published by a
                    society in Edinburgh, are universally known and esteemed. To that society he was
                    appointed secretary; but, after the publication of the first volume, to which he
                    had largely contributed, the members growing remiss in their attendance, he
                    became the sole collector and publisher of the work. To him we are therefore in
                    a great measure indebted for those numerous and important discoveries with which
                    this publication has enriched every department of medical knowledge. In the two
                    first volumes of the Physical and Literary Essays, published by the Physical
                    Society of Edinburgh, in which he had the rank of one of the presidents, we find
                    several papers written by him, which are not the least ornaments of that
                    collection. His account of the Success of Inoculation in Scotland may be
                    considered as his last publication. It demonstrates his extensive correspondence
                    and indefatigable industry, and has had great influence in promoting that
                    salutary practice. Besides these, he was also the author of several other
                    elegant and masterly productions, which were either never published, or were
                    published without his knowledge and from incorrect copies. A collection of his
                    works, properly arranged, corrected, and illustrated with copperplates, was
                    published by Dr Alexander Monro, his son and successor in the anatomical chair,
                    in a splendid quarto volume, printed at Edinburgh in 1781; and to this was
                    prefixed a life of the author, by another of his sons, Dr Donald, physician in
                    London.</p>
