                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">MUSHED, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Mesched</hi></label>, a city
                    of Persia, the capital of the province of Khorassan, surrounded by a wall, and
                    said by some to be twelve miles in circuit, but by Fraser estimated at not more
                    than six miles. The greatest length to which the town extends is not above two
                    miles, and the enclosed space presents a sad picture of desolation; the approach
                    to the centre of the city, where the inhabitants exclusively reside, being
                    through masses of ruins. There are thirty-two divisions in the city, each being
                    nominally governed by its own magistrate; but of these many are totally devoid
                    of either houses or inhabitants, and the greater part of the rest are very
                    thinly tenanted. The city appears to have been built of sun-dried bricks or mud,
                    so that the whole aspect of the place presents the monotonous gray earthy colour
                    common to all Persian towns; and even the houses which remain entire are
                    miserably poor and mean in their outward appearance, nor are they much better
                    furnished within. The approach to these houses harmonizes with all the other
                    details, being for the most part through dark lanes and narrowalleys, extremely
                    inconvenient and filthy. Fraser informs us, that in his walks he occasionally
                    stumbled upon the strangest holes and corners, where houses peered out that were
                    half hid in filth and rubbish. He adds, that the path among such places
                    sometimes burrows under the earth, or beneath a heap of build ings which have
                    been raised over it, upon a floor of beams and mats; and that, after thus
                    descending, as it seemed, into the bowels of the earth, a door was opened into a
                    small parterre, surrounded with various apartments, and fitted up with
                    reservoirs and fountains of water, trees, and flowers. There is only one street
                    worthy of the name, which extends throughout the whole length of the town,
                    running north-west and south-east. In the centre is a canal, which serves as a
                    receptacle for all the filth of the town, and is in a state of great disrepair.
                    A row of shops extends along the pathway on either side; and there is a bazaar
                    in another quarter, which extends from 500 to 600 yards in one direction. The
                    public buildings of Mushed are very splendid, and highly celebrated for their
                    sanctity. The tomb in which repose the ashes of the Imam Reza and of the Kaliph
                    Haroun Al Raschid, is an extensive and most magnificent structure, which has
                    been embellished and enriched by different princes. This magnificent cluster of
                    domes and minarets is situated in the centre of the city, where there is a noble
                    oblong square, 160 yards in length by 75 in breadth, with gateways at either
                    end, and forms a splendid specimen of the style of eastern architecture. The
                    mausoleum itself comprises a mass of buildings which appear to be of the octagon
                    form; and a silver gate, the gift of Nadir Shah, admits into the passage to the
                    chief apartment, beneath a gilded cupola of magnificent dimensions, rising
                    loftily into a fine*dome, from the centre of which depends a huge branched
                    candlestick of solid silver. There are numerous other apartments, a description
                    of which will be found in Fraser’s account of his journey to Khorassan. Mushed
                    contains no other religious shrine worthy of notice. There is a large ruined
                    mosque with two minarets; and there are numerous other smaller ones to be found
                    in all quarters of the city. There are also sixteen schools or colleges, ten or
                    twelve public baths, and at least twenty-five or thirty caravanserais; many of
                    them spacious and handsome establishments, whilst others are in ruins. The
                    palace of the prince is a poor fabric, scarcely deserving of notice. Mushed
                    contains the tombs of Nadir Shah and his son, though not their dust; their
                    remains having been dug up by their bitter enemy Mahommed Khan, and carried to
                    Teheran. This city rose into importance during the contests between the
                    Mahommedan sects of the Soonies and the Sheahs, under the patronage of Tahmareb,
                    a zealous Sheah, and a prince of the Suffanean dynasty, who decorated the tomb
                    of Imam Reza. It was taken and pillaged by the Tartar tribes; and it was again
                    utterly ruined by the Afghans, and scarcely restored to its former magnificence
                    by all the favours which were lavished on it by Nadir Shah. Its commerce is
                    considerable, being an entrepôt for that of the surrounding countries, and rich
                    caravans daily arriving from Bockhara, Khyvah, Herat, Kerman, Yezd, Cashan,
                    Ispahan, and other cities. There are in Mushed many merchants, with a
                    considerable number of shopkeepers and tradesmen; and one quarter of the city is
                    appropriated to the Jews, who are here tolerably numerous, and exercise their
                    customary profession of scrap sellers. Of travellers, whether in the way of
                    religion or of commerce, numbers are to be seen from all the surrounding
                    countries, such as Arabs, Turks, Afghans, Turcomans, Usbecks, in the different
                    caravanserais and bazaars of Mushed. It is famed for the manufacture of velvets,
                    which are esteemed the best in Persia; and of sword-blades, which sell, many of
                    them, at from fifteen to a hundred reals a piece, or from L.l to between L.6 and
                    L.7. Those of them made by the old workmen sell as high as 2000 reals; and even
                    more is sometimes demanded for a blade of known antiquity and goodness. The
                    vicinity of the turquoise mines gives employment to numerous stone-cutters. The
                    population is estimated by Fraser at 31,000. Long. 57. E. Lat. 37. 35. N.</p>
