                <p><label type="entry">MUNSTER</label>, the most southern of the four provinces of
                    Ireland, is bounded on the north by Connaught, on the east by Leinster, and on
                    the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean. It measures 150 miles in its greatest
                    length, from Brow-Head, the most southern point of Ireland, to Meelick, the
                    northern extremity of Tipperary, and about the same breadth in an eastern and
                    western direction, from Dunmore Head in Kerry to Waterford harbour, extending
                    over a superficies of 5,879,872 acres, of which 3,929,852 are capable of
                    cultivation, 1,905,368 are bog or unprofitable mountain land, and 44,652 are
                    covered with standing water.</p>
                <p>The ancient name of the province was Mumhan, in Latin Momonia. According to the
                    older geographers, its maritime regions were peopled, commencing eastwardly, by
                    the Brigantes, the Velabori, the Ibernii, the Lucenii, the Vodii, and the
                    Cangani; whilst its interior was occupied by the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193826918" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6918-0593"/>Scoti. At a later period it
                    contained the eight following principalities: 1. Hy Breoghan, now the county of
                    Waterford; 2. Osragii, afterwards Ossory, and now forming parts of the Queen’s
                    County and of Tipperary; 3. Oir-Mumhan, East Munster, now Ormond, comprehending
                    the baronies of Ormond and of Owney and Arra in Tipperary; 4. Tuath-Mumhan,
                    Thomond, or North Munster, now the county of Clare; 5. Aine-Cliach, or Eoganach
                    Aine-Cliach, now Limerick; 6. Ciar or Cerrigia, now Kerry; 7. Aoibh-Liathain,
                    containing the northern part of the county of Cork; and, 8. Corcaluighe, the
                    southern part of the same county, and the ancient kingdom of Cork. The principal
                    toparchs or heads of septs in those divisions, several of whom assumed the title
                    of king, but acknowledged the supremacy of the king of Munster, were the
                    O’Briens, the Barrys, the M <hi rend="superscript"> f</hi> Arthys, and the
                    O’Sullivans. After the arrival of the English, the greater part of the province
                    became the property of the Butlers, and of different branches of the Fitzgerald
                    family, amongst the latter of whom the Earl of Desmond long ruled the whole of
                    its southern portion with an authority almost independent of that of the English
                    crown. On the death of the last earl of that name, and the subsequent
                    confiscation of his immense estates by Elizabeth in consequence of his
                    rebellion, the greatest part of it was parcelled outamongst English adventurers,
                    amongst whom was the celebrated Sir Walter Raleigh. The descendants of these
                    adventurers, or “undertakers,” as they were styled in the phraseology of those
                    days, have, for the most part, melted away from observation in a manner
                    altogether unaccountable and surprising. The province is now divided into the
                    six counties of Clare, formerly included in Connaught, Cork, Kerry, Limerick,
                    Tipperary, and Waterford.</p>
                <p>According to the ecclesiastical arrangements of Ireland, Munster constituted the
                    province of Cashel, consisting of the archbishopric of the same name, with which
                    were united the diocese of Emly; the bishopric of Limerick, Ardfert, and
                    Aghadoe; the bishopric of Waterford and Lismore; the bishopric of Cork and Ross;
                    the bishopric of Cloyne; and the bishopric of Killaloe and Kilfenora. This
                    arrangement has been lately altered by the legislature. The archbishopric of
                    Cashel is, on the demise of the present holder thereof, to he reduced to the
                    rank of a bishopric, subordinate to the archiepiscopal see of Dublin, and the
                    whole province is to be consolidated into four dioceses, in the following
                    manner: Cashel is to be holden with Emly, Waterford, and Lismore; Cloyne with
                    Cork and Ross; Killaloe with Kilfenora, and with these are also to be united the
                    sees of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh, hjtherto forming part of the archiepiscopal
                    province of Tuam; and Limerick with Ardfert and Aghadoe, as hitherto..</p>
                <p>The northern parts of Munster are, generally speaking, level. Towards the south
                    and south-west the land rises into elevations of considerable height,
                    Macgillicuddy’s Recks, in Kerry, being the highest mountain range in Ireland.
                    Garrantual, the most elevated of its peaks, is nearly 3500 feet above the level
                    of the sea. The mountains in the county of Cork stretch in the direction of east
                    and west. The lofty range of Slieve-Bloom forms the eastern boundary of the
                    province. The river Shannon passes through its northern part, separating the
                    county of Clare from those of Tipperary, Limerick, and Kerry. The Suir,
                    Blackwater, Lee, and Bandon, water the southern districts. The only lakes of
                    note are those of Killarney, in Kerry, which owe their celebrity much more to
                    the picturesque beauties of their scenery than to the extent of their surface.
                    The bays, creeks, headlands, and islands, which are numerous, and in most
                    instances worthy of special notice, have been already mentioned in the general
                    description of the island. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Ireland.</hi></p>
                <p>The climate, though moist from its exposure to the prevailing south-western
                    winds, which pass over itloaded with the humid exhalations of the Atlantic, is
                    peculiarly mild. The severity of winter is but slightly felt even in its more
                    elevated regions, whilst in its more level parts, along its southern shores, the
                    myrtle blooms richly and unsheltered; and the arbutus, indigenous in Kerry,
                    attains an unusual size. Such is the prevailing opinion of the genial
                    temperature of the atmosphere, that an attempt was lately made to introduce the
                    rearing of the silk-worm on a great scale, in the hope of establishing the silk
                    manufacture on a permanent basis in this part of Ireland, by having the raw
                    material at the mere price of its production; and though the experiment has
                    failed as to its main object, the growth of the mulberry trees, which were
                    planted in large numbers for the sustenance of the insect, has proved that they
                    were not fixed in an ungenial climate.</p>
                <p>The soil throughout the level parts is peculiarly fertile, producing abundantly
                    rich crops of every kind of grain, and many species of fruits, which, in other
                    parts of the island, are capable of being ripened only by means of an artificial
                    atmosphere. The tract of land stretching across the counties of Limerick and
                    Tipperary, from Askeaton to the limits of Kilkenny, has long been distinguished
                    by the name of the Golden Vale, an appellation justly bestowed upon it from its
                    singular fertility. Even in the less favoured climate of the elevated parts of
                    Kerry, tillage has been carried upwards along the mountain sides to heights
                    unexampled elsewhere.</p>
                <p>As to its geological relations, the northern parts of Munster are included within
                    the limits of the great plain of floetz limestone, which constitutes the central
                    formation of Ireland. The southern parts are mostly of the sandstone and
                    clay-slate formation; the former being more developed in the mountains, the
                    latter in the more level parts. Bog is abundant and very generally distributed,
                    although the province lies without the great central band, which embraces most
                    of the soil of this description. Coal is found in large quantities in the
                    interior; but its use is much limited by the rugged character of the region
                    within which it lies, and the consequent difficulty of carriage. There are two
                    fields of this mineral; one, the larger, in the centre of Cork county; the other
                    in Tipperary, where a branch of the great Leinster coal-field stretches into the
                    province. In both places the -mineral is of the carbonaceous or stone-coal
                    species, the slate glantz-coal of Werner. Several mines of copper, lead, and
                    iron, were worked with profit until stopped by the failure of timber for fuel;
                    notwithstanding which a few are still carried on successfully. Mineral springs
                    are numerous; that of Mallow, which is of the same nature with the hot wells
                    near Bristol, maintaining a high character for its medical efficacy. Transparent
                    crystals are frequently found in Kerry. Some caves producing stalactites have
                    been lately discovered in the county of Cork, and the precipitous fissures in
                    the cliffs upon the western and southern shores, where the surface soil has been
                    washed away by the workings of the ocean, present many objects of great interest
                    to the geologist.</p>
                <p>The population ofMunsteramountedin 1821 to 1,935,612 souls, and in 1831 to
                    2,165,193. The peasantry are a large, athletic, and handsome race, exhibiting,
                    in their oval faces and dark hair, strong traces of similarity with the
                    Spaniards. Their occupation is chiefly agricultural. The raising of grain and
                    the pasturage of cattle, which are exported in great numbers from Cork,
                    Limerick, and Waterford, form their chief employment. The manufacture of frizes
                    and coarse woollens, as also of coarse linen cloth for domestic consumption, is
                    carried on very generally. Formerly the country round Carrick-on-Suir was the
                    seat of an extensive woollen trade.</p>
                <p>The province contains several of the largest cities in Ireland: Cork, the next in
                    size and population to Dublin, containing a population of upwards of 100,000;
                    Limerick, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826931" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6931-0594"
                    />having 65,000; and Waterford, nearly 30,000. Each of these is the seat of a
                    good export trade, chiefly in provisions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">. Münster,</hi> one of the governments into which the
                    Prussian province of Westphalia is divided. It is formed out of. the, ancient
                    bishopric of that name, and several sovereignties which have been at different
                    times secularized or mediatized, viz. Salm-Ahaus, Salm-Bocholt, Rheina-Wol-bech,
                    Horstmar, Dulmen, Steinfurt, Anhalt-Dulmen, Ghemen, and Gronau. It extends over
                    2228 square miles, is divided into ten circles, and comprehends thirty-eight
                    cities or walled places, fifteen market-towns, and 732 villages, with 57,577
                    houses, inhabited by 382,540 individuals. It is for the most part a poor and
                    heathy district, excepting near the rivers. It produces barley-corn equal to the
                    consumption, but is very deficient in fuel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Munster,</hi> a city, the capital of the Prussian government
                    of that name. It is situated on the river Aa, which, by means of a canal,
                    communicates with the Ems. It was formerly fortified; but its walls have
                    recently been converted into elegant promenades. It has a fine palace, and a
                    castle near it; and the cathedral is an ancient building, surrounded by rows of
                    trees. It contains six parish churches, one of which is Lutheran, the others
                    Catholic. It is the seat of a Catholic bishop, and of a college formerly
                    belonging to the Jesuits, for the education of Catholic priests. On the tower of
                    one of the churches are affixed the three iron cages in which Knipperdoling and
                    his companions, the leaders of the Anabaptists, were suspended, after their
                    revolutionary movements were suppressed, in 1535. The place is remarkable for
                    the peace of Westphalia, concluded at it, after many years of deliberation, in
                    1648. It now contains 1500 houses, and 18,260 inhabitants, exclusive of the
                    military. In the town-hall is a curious collection of ancient armour, and many
                    other antiquities. There are only some small manufactories of linen and woollen
                    goods; but there is considerable trade in the exchange of internal commodities,
                    especially in Rhine wine and wool, and there are several breweries. Long. 7. 31.
