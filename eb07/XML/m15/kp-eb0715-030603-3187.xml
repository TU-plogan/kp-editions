                <p><label type="entry">MITHRIDATES</label>, the name of several kings of Pontus.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mithridates,</hi> surnamed <hi rend="italic">Eupator,</hi>
                    and also the <hi rend="italic">Great,</hi> succeeded to the throne at the age of
                    eleven, about 123 years before the Christian era. The beginning of his reign was
                    marked by ambition, cruelty, and artifice. He murdered his own mother, who had
                    been left by his father co-heiress of the kingdom; and he fortified his
                    constitution by drinking antidotes against the poison with which his enemies at
                    court attempted to destroy him. He early inured his body to hardship, and
                    employed himself in the most manly exercises, often remaining whole months in
                    the country, and making frozen snow and the earth the place of his repose.
                    Naturally ambitious and cruel, he spared no pains to acquire power and dominion.
                    He murdered the two sons whom his sister Laodice had by Ariarathes king of
                    Cappadocia, arid placed one of his own children, when only eight years old, on
                    the vacant throne. This violent proceeding alarmed Nicoedes king of Bithynia,
                    who had married Laodice the widow of Ariarathes, and ultimately involved
                    Mithridates in a quarrel with the Romans. Mithridates never lost an opportunity
                    by which he might lessen the influence of his adversaries; and in order the more
                    effectually to destroy their power in Asia, he commanded that all the Romans who
                    were in his dominions should be massacred. This was done in one night, and no
                    less than a hundred and fifty thousand according to Plutarch, or eighty thousand
                    according to Appian, became the victims of his cruelty. This atrocious butchery
                    called aloud for vengeance. Aquilius, and soon after½’ards Sylla, marched
                    against Mithridates with a large army. The former was made prisoner; but Sylla
                    obtained a victory over the generals of Mithridates; and another decisive
                    engagement rendered the great Roman captain master of all Greece, Macedonia,
                    Ionia, and Asia Minor. This adverse fortune was aggravated by the loss of about
                    two hundred thousand men, who were killed in the different engagements; and
                    Mithridates, weakened by repeated reverses both by sea and land, sued for peace
                    from the conqueror, which he obtained on hard terms. But he soon took the field
                    again with an army of a hundred and forty thousand infantry and sixteen thousand
                    horse, consisting of his own forces and those of his son-in-law Tigranes king of
                    Armenia. At the head of this army he made himself master of the Roman provinces
                    in Asia; none dared to oppose his conquests; and the Romans, relying upon his
                    fidelity, had withdrawn the greater part of their armies from the country. But
                    the news of his warlike preparations were no sooner heard than Lucullus the
                    consul marched into Asia, and without delay blocked up the camp of Mithridates,
                    who was then besieging Cyzicus. The Asiatic monarch, however, escaped, and fled
                    into the heart of his kingdom. Lucullus pursued him with the utmost celerity,
                    and would have taken him prisoner after a battle, had not the avidity of his
                    soldiers preferred the plundering of a mule loaded with gold to the taking of a
                    monarch who had exercised such cruelties against their countrymen. The
                    appointment of Glabrio to the command of the Roman forces, instead of Lucullus,
                    proved favourable to Mithridates, who recovered the greater part of his
                    dominions. But the sudden arrival of Pompey soon put an end to his successes.
                    During the night a battle was fought near the Euphrates, and an universal
                    overthrow ensued; but Mithridates, bold in his misfortunes, rushed through the
                    ranks of the enemy at the head of eight hundred horsemen, five hundred of whom
                    perished in the attempt to follow him. He fled to Tigranes his son-in-law, who
                    however refused him an asylum, although he had previously supported him with the
                    collected forces of his kingdom. Mithridates found a safe retreat amongst the
                    Scythians; and though destitute of power, friends, and resources, he yet
                    meditated the overthrow of the Roman empire, by penetrating by land into the
                    very heart of Italy. But these wild projects were rejected by his followers, and
                    he sued for peace. It was denied to his ambassadors; and the victorious Pompey
                    declared, that, in order to obtain it, Mithridates must ask it in person. The
                    proud monarch scorned to trust himself in the hands of his enemy, and resolved
                    to conquer or to die. His subjects, however, refused to follow him; and, having
                    revolted against his authority, made his son Pharnaces king. The latter showed
                    himself ungrateful to his father; and, according to some writers, he even
                    ordered his parent to be put to death. This unnatural treatment broke the heart
                    of Mithridates, who obliged his wife to poison herself, and attempted to do the
                    same himself. But his attempt was in vain. The frequent antidotes he had taken
                    in the early part of his life had strengthened his constitution against the
                    poison; and when this proved unavailing, he attempted to stab himself. The blow
                    did not prove mortal; and a Gaul who happened to be present, gave him, at his
                    own request, the fatal stroke, about sixty-four years before the Christian era.
                    Such were the misfortunes, the abilities, and the miserable end, of a man who
                    supported himself so long against the whole power of Rome, and who, according to
                    the declarations of the Roman authors, proved a more powerful and indefatigable
                    adversary than Hannibal, Pyrrhus, Perseus, or Antiochus. It is said that
                    Mithridates conquered twenty-four nations, whose different languages he knew and
                    spoke with the same ease and fluency as his own. As a man of letters he also
                    deserves attention. He was acquainted with the Greek, and even wrote in that
                    language a treatise on botany. His skill in physic is well known; and even now
                    there is a celebrated antidote which bears his name, and is called <hi
                    rend="italic">mithridate.</hi> The great work of Adelung has also been called by
                    his name.</p>
