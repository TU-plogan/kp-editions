                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Within</hi> the limits necessarily prescribed to this
                    article, it is impossible to do more than touch upon a few points belonging to
                    the subject. A complete treatise upon the theory and practice of music,
                    according to the received doctrines, would contain about six thousand articles,
                    and would fill several volumes. In writing this article, we have frequently
                    availed ourselves of materials offered by the best and latest musical
                    authorities. When so many works have been published by skilful professional
                    musicians upon their art, we have not the presumption to suppose that we can add
                    much that is new; more especially as we have no new theory to propose, and to
                    maintain with Quixotic zeal and recklessness. Whenever we differ from
                    authorities generally followed, we express our dissent, and give our reasons for
                    it. Our main purpose is to direct attention to some useful musical objects,
                    hitherto in general too much overlooked; to point out some errors in the theory
                    and practice of music; and to show the utter uselessness of pursuing the old
                    routine of building up false theories of music, and spending years in the vain
                    study of what is called thorough bass, and is even still considered, by too many
                    persons, as comprehending the whole art and science of music. To attempt to make
                    any one a composer of music by means only of dry treatises upon intervals and
                    chords, is just as absurd as to attempt to make a poet by means of Bysshe’s Art
                    of Poetry, or other books of the kind. Genius and observation, and a careful
                    study of the best models, are really the only things that can ever make a good
                    poet, or a good painter, or a good composer of music. The aid of a skilful
                    master will be of great importance, if he is not wrapped up in a theory. In the
                    absence of a master, two or three of the best modern treatises, such as Reicha’s
                    and Cherubini’s, may help the student to understand the construction of those
                    models of composition which he ought to have constantly before him. We suppose
                    the reader to understand musical notation, and to be able to sing, or to play
                    upon some musical instrument. If this should be the organ, or piano-forte, so
                    much the better for his more easy attainment of a knowledge of harmony; although
                    he must always remember that both these instruments are <hi rend="italic">out of
                    tune,</hi> and do not produce perfect intervals or perfect harmony. If the
                    student of musical composition would acquire a real dominion over the materials
                    of his art, he must not trust entirely to his organ or piano-forte. He must
                    learn to read, in silence, any piece of music in score (in partition), and to
                    hear, “in his mind’s ear,” the effect of the whole; and he must learn to compose
                    in silence, and without the aid of any instrument. All great composers have
                    acquired these powers. This seems, to the vulgar musician, impossible. To
                    mention only one instance of such powers among living artists; Cherubini
                    composes all his music with the aid of no other instruments but pen, ink, and
                    paper. We have seen him at work. An accomplished composer is able to form in his
                    mind, with no aid from any instrument, the whole plan and details of a
                    complicated piece of harmony, before he writes a note of it. In his “mind’s eye”
                    he <hi rend="italic">sees</hi> the whole score; in his “mind’s ear” he <hi
                    rend="italic">hears</hi> the effect which the piece would produce if performed.
                    Until the student acquires this power of abstraction, he must consider himself
                    as only on a par with those every-day musicians whom the “fatal facilities” of
                    the organ or piano-forte raise into the ephemeral class of pseudo-composers.</p>
                <p>• Some persons consider music as a frivolous and useless art. They do not feel
                    nor understand music, and they are not to be blamed for this when nature has
                    denied them a musical ear, any more than a blind man is to be blamed for-not
                    admiring painting or sculpture, or a blind and deaf man for not admiring poetry.
                    But really, when musical compositions are frivolous and useless, the fault is in
                    the artist, not in the art. If men choose to write bad poetry, to paint bad
                    pictures, to chisel bad sculptures, this can never prove that poetry, painting,
                    and sculpture, are frivolous and useless arts. Every one of the fine arts may be
                    rendered frivolous and useless by misapplication of its means; nay, some of them
                    may be made highly dangerous and mischievous, as has often happened. No doubt
                    all the fine arts may be considered in one point of view as <hi rend="italic"
                    >superfluous</hi> things, not at all contributing to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >necessaries</hi> of human existence. Food, clothing, fire, and shelter, are
                    really all that man’s mere animal existence requires to keep him alive. But if
                    poetry and music, and painting and sculpture, cannot till the earth, nor build
                    hovels, nor make clothing, nor kindle coal-fires, they can at least add
                    ornaments to the structure of civilized society, and contribute to the innocent
                    pleasures and happiness of man’s transitory life. And it seems to be proved by
                    experience, that the cultivation of these arts, how unimportant soever they may
                    be to mere animal existence, has always tended to divert the attention of
                    mankind from the sole indulgence of their animal appetites, and of their more
                    dangerous passions. If so, it would not be wise to deprive man of such sources
                    of innocent and pleasing occupation, or rather relaxation, and to reduce him to
                    the merely animal state of the savage, who enjoys and admires nothing beyond his
                    animal comforts, and his murderous triumphs over his rivals or his enemies.</p>
                <p>Many persons are so constituted, or so trained, as to have no relish for poetry,
                    or painting, or music. So much the worse for them, perhaps, since their want of
                    feeling or imagination deprives them of sources of innocent pleasure open to
                    others. If a mere mathematician should be dissatisfied with the works of a great
                    poet, because these works <hi rend="italic">prove</hi> nothing mathematically, a
                    lover of poetry must not take offence at the mathematician. The lover of poetry,
                    perhaps himself a poet, may be totally insensible to the beauties of the most
                    profound mathematical reasonings, or the finest musical compositions. This often
                    happens. But it rarely happens that the real lover of music is not also a lover
                    of poetry and of painting. We have known men high in the literary and scientific
                    world, upon whom the best music produced no other impression than that of an
                    agreeable or a disagreeable noise. But this never made us respect them the less
                    for their own <hi rend="italic">peculiar</hi> powers of feeling and thinking.
                    They were not so organized as to feel and think as we did. That was all. The
                    wiser and more philosophical plan is, not to be angry with any of our
                    fellow-creatures for not feeling and admiring as we do; but to regret that they
                    cannot feel and admire with us, because such communion of feeling and admiration
                    would serve to draw those persons closer to us in human fellowship. To call a
                    man a blockhead, because he does not, or cannot, feel and think in every thing
                    exactly like ourselves, is merely to be at once ill natured, uncharitable, and
                    unphilosophical. It is, “<hi rend="italic">not to know ourselvesΓ Non
                    omnia</hi><hi rend="italic">possumus omnes.</hi> We find∙no fault with men who
                    <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> perceive the beauties of music. We find fault with
                    the perversions of an art which we ourselves feel to be a fine and expressive
                    one, too often deformed and perverted.</p>

                <p>Most treatises on this subject begin with a definition of music. To persons who
                    already understand music thoroughly, any attempt at such a definition is
                    unnecessary. They have already formed their own ideas of music as an art. To
                    persons ignorant of music, any such definition is quite unintelligible. The
                    extent, the complexity, and the mutability of the art, render all such
                    definitions imperfect and objectionable. The best way in this, as in all others
                    of the fine arts, is to leave the student to form his own definition, after he
                    has thoroughly studied the art. We follow this plan.</p>
                <p>In some of the latest and best works on music, we find a definition of it
                    attempted in this manner: “The art of expressing an agreeable play of feelings
                    by means of sounds.” But music often expresses the most painful and tragical
                    feelings. Another is, “The art of expressing determinate feelings by means of
                    regulated sounds.” And then follows a long description of the nature of all the
                    various branches of music; which is just tantamount to a confession that the
                    definition is unintelligible and useless without the lengthy description.</p>
                <p>Leibnitz had a strange metaphysical notion of music, which he thus expressed:
                    “Musica est exercitium arithmeticae occultum nescientis se numerare animi; multa
                    enim facit in perceptionibus confusis seu insensibilibus, quae distincta
                    apperceptione notare nequit. Errant enim, qui nihil in anima fieri putant, cujus
                    ipsa non sit conscia. Anima igitur etsi se numerare non sentiat, sentit tamen
                    hujus numerationis insensibilis effectum, seu voluptatem in consonantiis,
                    molestiam in dissonantiis inde resultantem. Ex multis enim congruentiis
                    insensibilibus oritur voluptas,” &amp;c. Descartes entertained similar notions;
                    and Euler, in his <hi rend="italic">Tentamen</hi><hi rend="italic">Novae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Theoriae Musicae,</hi> assures us that the ear is pleasingly or
                    unpleasingly affected by musical intervals, according to its perception of the
                    simplicity or of the complexity of their ratios of vibration. His measures of
                    these ratios do not agree with practice. But the absurdity consists in supposing
                    such an auricular arithmetic, by which the ear judges of the ratios of
                    intervals. Does the milk-maid calculate the ratios of the intervals in her
                    untutored song, and take pleasure in it, or the reverse, according to her
                    perception of their simplicity or complexity? In Italy we may hear persons who
                    cannot read music, singing very agreeably in two, or three, or four parts, in
                    harmony. Do such persons know any thing of the harmonic ratios of the sounds
                    they combine together in this way? They have no more idea that even an octave is
                    in the ratio of 1:2, than they have of the distance between the earth and the
                    moon. Similar false applications of mathematics have tended greatly to produce
                    that mysterious obscurity which has hitherto been artificially thrown over the
                    beautiful and inviting regions of musical melody and harmony. There, genius and
                    perseverance have culled the sweetest flowers; while mathematical investigations
                    have, as yet, only groped among the soil from which these blossoms sprang.</p>
                <p>The state of our knowledge of acoustics, one of the most subtile and difficult of
                    sciences, is still too incomplete to permit of the formation of a perfect theory
                    of music, even were music, as a fine art, entirely dependent upon the
                    physicomathematical science of acoustics, which it is not. Of late years,
                    however, the beautiful experiments of Dr Chladni, Μ. Oërsted, Monsieur Savart,
                    Professor Faraday, and Professor C. Wheatstone, have thrown much light upon some
                    of the obscurer parts of acoustics.</p>
                <p>In another work, we have expressed ourselves in the following terms regarding
                    proposed theories of music. “The mischievous effects of false principles have
                    been experienced in every branch of physical science. The blind rashness of
                    premature generalization has operated with as great absurdity in music as in any
                    other branch of human knowledge. While music was in its infancy, and while the
                    observations and experiments which had been made respecting it were confined
                    within limits by much too narrow to permit the formation of just and
                    comprehensive general principles, musicians, both practical and speculative,
                    misled by a false philosophy, and by erroneous ideas of simplicity, attempted to
                    establish one single principle as the sole basis of musical harmony and
                    composition. Confounding together the essentially distinct methods proper to
                    physical and to mathematical science, they seized upon a particular phenomenon
                    belonging to acoustics, and endeavoured to torture it into a principle which
                    might apply to, and explain, the whole phenomena belonging to musical
                    composition. From a particular fact, which had no necessary connection with
                    musical composition, they attempted, with some ingenuity, and with much
                    sophistry and ineffectual labour, to deduce the whole system of that art; while
                    they were not aware either of the imperfection and incompleteness of the system
                    which then existed, or of the improper method of induction which they had
                    adopted. They employed the synthetical method of induction proper to
                    mathematics, instead of the analytical method of induction, which is the true
                    guide to physical investigation. In mathematics, we make discoveries by
                    reasoning from definitions, axioms, and postulates; in other words, by reasoning
                    from generals to particulars; but in physics, we extend our views and
                    consolidate our knowledge by the opposite method of reasoning from particulars
                    to generals. In physical science, when our observations and experiments have
                    been sufficiently numerous and extensive, we may then, but not till then,
                    establish general laws, or first principles, and reason from these
                    synthetically; but if, on the contrary, the facts from which we generalize have
                    been gathered from a narrow and unenlightened survey of the field of physical
                    science, we shall almost inevitably draw false conclusions, and form principles
                    which involve error and absurdity in relative proportion to the obscurity and
                    contraction belonging to our investigation of particulars.</p>
                <p>“It was long ago observed, that a musical string, or wire, capable of rendering a
                    grave and powerful sound when thrown into a state of vibration, produced, in
                    that state, not only a <hi rend="italic">principal</hi> sound, corresponding to
                    its length, tension, thickness, &amp;c., but also two audible, concomitant, and
                    accessory sounds, related to the <hi rend="italic">principal</hi> sound by the
                    intervals of a twelfth, or double (replicate) fifth, and seventeenth major, or
                    second replicate major third. For example, the fourth string, or largest string
                    of the violoncello, when strongly vibrating, may produce these accessory sounds,
                    or <hi rend="italic">harmonics</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> which, although
                    feeble in comparison with the principal sound, may, however, be heard by a
                    delicate and attentive musical ear.</p>
                <p>“Upon this acoustical phenomenon, Rameau, a French musician, attempted to found
                    his theory of harmony. We shall afterwards quote the opinions of some of the
                    highest authorities in Europe upon this theory, and also upon that of Tartini,
                    to which we now proceed.</p>
                <p>“Tartini, in his <hi rend="italic">Trattato di</hi><hi rend="italic">Musica,</hi>
                    published at Padua in 1754, informs us, that if two sustained sounds (forming,
                    for example, a third or a fifth) are produced at once from two violins, two
                    trumpets, &amp;c. the result will be the generation of a harmonic third sound,
                    distinctly perceivable by the ear. This phenomenon was observed by Rameau in
                    1753. Tartini seems to have mistaken the pitch of the third sound, or grave
                    harmonic, produced in this experiment, since Μ. Serre of Geneva, in his
                    Principles of Harmony, tells us that the grave harmonic sounds produced by major
                    and minor thirds are each an octave lower than those mentioned by Tartini. This
                    phenomenon gave rise to Tartini’s theory of harmony. We now make the quotations
                    which we promised. The first is from the works of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193827087" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7087-0606"/> the late Professor Robison,
                    whose <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> authority, on such a point, is of
                    indubitable weight. He is writing of Rameau’s theory. ‘ Rameau has made this,’
                    the generation of acute harmonics, ‘ the foundation of his system of music,
                    asserting that the pleasure of harmony results from the success? ful imitation
                    of this harmony of nature. But a little logic should convince these theorists
                    that they must be mistaken. A little mathematics, too, or mechanics, would have
                    convinced them. His theory is a very <hi rend="italic">forced</hi> accommodation
                    of this principle to the practice of musicians and taste of the public.’
                    Speaking further of Rameau’s theory, he says, ‘ It is a mere whim, proceeding on
                    a false assumption, namely, that a musical sound is essentially accompanied by
                    its octave, twelfth, and seventeenth, <hi rend="italic">in alto.</hi> This is
                    not true, though such accompaniment be very frequent, &amp;c. Are these acute
                    harmonics musical sounds or not? He surely will not deny this. Therefore they
                    too are essentially accompanied by <hi rend="italic">their</hi> harmonics, and
                    this absolutely and necessarily <hi rend="italic">ad infinituml</hi> Of
                    Tartini’s theory he says, ‘ Tartini prized this observation,’ the generation of
                    grave harmonics, ‘ as a most important discovery, and considered it as affording
                    a foundation for the whole science of music.’ After some farther remarks, he
                    adds, ‘ The system of harmonious composition which Tartini has, with wonderful
                    labour and address, founded on it, has, therefore, no solidity.’</p>
                <p>“Dr Chladni, in his celebrated work <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d’Acoustique,</hi> expresses himself as follows regarding the
                    theories which we have just mentioned: ‘ It is not conformable to nature to
                    desire, like many authors, to derive all harmony from the vibrations of a
                    string, and especially from the coexistence of several sounds with the
                    fundamental sound. A string is <hi rend="italic">only one</hi> species of
                    sonorous body.</p>
                <p>“ ‘ In many other sonorous bodies the general laws of vibrations, which were not
                    known, are differently modified, consequently the laws of one sonorous body
                    cannot be applied to that which ought to be common to all. A monochord cannot
                    serve to establish the principles of harmony, but only to give an idea of the
                    effect of ratios.’ ‘ Many authors have regarded the co-existence of sounds
                    comprised in the natural series of numbers (which, according to true principles,
                    is nothing buta particular phenomenon) as an essential difference between a
                    distinct sound and a noise. They have taken this quality for the basis of all
                    harmony, believing that an interval is consonant, <hi rend="italic">because</hi>
                    the acute sound maybe heard along with the fundamental sound. They do not know
                    that, if more than one sound is heard at the same time, this is nothing more
                    than a consequence of the existence of many species of vibrations; that in many
                    sonorous bodies the series of possible sounds is very different from the natural
                    series of numbers; and that we may produce each manner of vibrations, where
                    there are nodes, without any mixture of other sounds, by touching the nodal
                    points, or lines, which ought to be in motion in other manners of vibrating.</p>
                <p>“ ‘ According to their principles, the perfect minor chord— if one does not make
                    use of sophisms—would not be consonant; and, on the bell of the harmonica, the
                    ninth (4: 9) would be the first consonance, since it is the first sound which
                    can mingle itself with the fundamental sound, &amp;c. Daniel Bernouilli and
                    Lagrange have sufficiently refuted these false principles.’</p>
                <p>“With respect to Tartini’s theory in particular, he says, ‘ Tartini pretended
                    that this third sound was more acute by an octave than it really is. He regarded
                    this phenomenon, combined with the pretended co-existence of the series of
                    sounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c. in each fundamental sound, as the basis of
                    harmony. Mr Mercadier de Belesta has very well refuted some false assertions of
                    Tartini, in his <hi rend="italic">Système de Musique,</hi> Paris, 1776.’</p>
                <p>“Choron, in his work upon composition, says, ‘ It has been attempted to déduce
                    the' laws of succession from the multiple i resonance, or from the sub-multiple
                    resonance. Tartini had hardly discovered this last phenomenon, when he hastened,
                    in order to satisfy the taste of his time, to rear up upon it a system, which he
                    gave to the world in a very unintelligible work. J. J. Rousseau, who was almost
                    equally a stranger to geometry and to the science of composition, produced,
                    without having even comprehended it, a very imperfect analysis of it (Tartini’s
                    system) in his shapeless dictionary, and exalted it to the utmost of his power,
                    for the pleasure of mortifying Rameau, with whom he had some quarrel.</p>
                <p>“<hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> With the phenomenon of the multiple resonance, of
                    which he had considered no more than the three first terms, Rameau had propped
                    up his system of the fundamental bass. Without entering more into detail, I
                    shall remark, that this phenomenon has no connection with the laws of harmony.
                    That if one absolutely would apply it to them, it would be necessary, yírsí, in
                    order to be consistent, to suppose, at least implicitly, that the sounds of the
                    system are those of the series of aliqupts: first absurdity. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Second,</hi> That all the notes of the bass ought to be accompanied by all
                    their aliquots, moving in a parallel manner with each other: second absurdity.
                    Every other consequence is illegitimate, and tends, not to give a foundation in
                    nature to the rules of harmony, but to reconcile, as one best can, the phenomena
                    with the rules of harmony, which is a very indifferent matter.’”</p>
                <p>In 1753, Μ. Serre, a miniature painter at Geneva, published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essais sur les Principes de</hi><hi rend="italic">l’</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Harmonie.</hi> He assumed three essential fundamentals in the scale; the tonic,
                    the fifth, and the fourth. He described the nature and use of what he termed <hi
                    rend="italic">diacommatic</hi> intervals, or slides necessary to perfect
                    intonation in various modulations; and he laid down as a principle, that it
                    depended upon the nature of the intervals of a chord whether that chord should
                    have <hi rend="italic">one</hi> or <hi rend="italic">two,</hi> or even <hi
                    rend="italic">three</hi> fundamentals. These opinions of Μ. Serre’s have been of
                    late years, and with some modifications, reproduced as new. In some works
                    recently published, we have observed an analogy pointed out, as new, between the
                    harmonics above mentioned and the curious phenomena of complementary colours. In
                    Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine for February 1823 (pp. 159— 162), will be found a
                    letter of ours in Italian, in which this analogy is particularly noticed, and a
                    short description of some of the phenomena given. In the same letter there are
                    some remarks upon the analogy between the harmonic series 1, 3, 5, 7, &amp;c.
                    and the progression of numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, ascribed by Newton to the squares of
                    the diameters of the coloured circles produced by him on applying to the plane
                    side of a plano-convex lens one of the convex sides of a double convex lens.</p>
                <p>A strange error has long prevailed regarding the co-existent vibrations of a
                    musical string. The <hi rend="italic">total</hi> vibration which gives the
                    gravest sound of the string, can by no means <hi rend="italic">co-exist</hi>
                    with the vibrations of the aliquot parts of the same string. The thing is
                    physically impossible, as could be easily demonstrated. In fact, to assert that
                    a vibrating string can move in a number of <hi rend="italic">different</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">opposite</hi> directions at the same instant of time, is as
                    absurd as to maintain that a man can run backwards and forwards, to the right
                    and to the left, &amp;c. all at the same moment. The following diagrams
                    represent the three primary curves of the harmonic series 1, 2, 3.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827100" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7100-0607"/>
                <p>The co-existence of all these curves is a <hi rend="italic">physical
                    impossibility,</hi> For <hi rend="italic">how</hi> can ACB <hi rend="italic"
                    >coincide</hi> with AdeB, or with A/ÿ½B? It is needless to go farther. There may
                    be many <hi rend="italic">co-existent</hi> vibrations of traction and torsion in
                    the string, but not any <hi rend="italic">co-existent</hi> vibrations in
                    directions quite opposite to each other.</p>
                <p>The musical treatises of Choron, Catel, and Momigny, &amp;c. among the French,
                    and of Reicha and others among the Germans, are still too much tinctured with
                    peculiar and arbitrary theories and systems, for which there are no sufficient
                    grounds in either acoustics or aesthetics. By this last term the Germans have
                    long chosen to designate, not very appropriately, the theory of taste in the
                    fine arts. It is indeed impossible, by any purely mechanical and mathematical
                    theories, or even by any metaphysical ones, to explain all the varieties of
                    human sensations, affections, passions, that enter into our perceptions of
                    beauty, sublimity, &amp;c. in poetry, painting, or music. It cannot be too often
                    repeated, that all the <hi rend="italic">rules</hi> laid down by theorists for
                    the construction of works belonging to the fine arts, are drawn from models of
                    art previously in existence, and relate merely to the mechanical portions of
                    these arts.</p>
                <p>Had the rigid rules formed for (and from) the ancient Greek drama been always
                    adhered to, we should never have possessed Shakspeare’s plays. The magnificent
                    musical works of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, not to speak of many other great
                    German and Italian composers, were not produced by blind adherence to old rules
                    of art, but by an enlightened view of things, far beyond what the authors of
                    these rules contemplated. Biihle has remarked, that the mechanical rules laid
                    down in treatises on the fine arts may be compared to telescopes, which assist
                    the vision of those persons who already see. A remarkable instance of this is
                    found in the case of Beethoven, who happened to be placed under a master
                    destitute of genius for melody; but a profound harmonist, and a learned writer
                    of fugues and canons, &amp;c. Under this man, Beethoven laboured most
                    industriously, and went through the whole drudgery of thorough bass, and all the
                    rigid ancient rules of composition; but evidently with frequent misgivings as to
                    the general truth and application of what was taught to him. But the result was,
                    that these lessons and <hi rend="italic">rules</hi> served him as a “telescope,”
                    to enable him to perceive a wide field of composition far beyond them all. In
                    short, he was a man of first-rate musical genius, and therefore by nature a
                    great melodist; and, fortunately for the world, his injudicious training <hi
                    rend="italic">could</hi> not extinguish his passionate feeling for melody, and
                    his charming expression of it in his best works. In some of his works,
                    especially among his last, we find unpleasing traces of the predominance of his
                    early training over his native genius. But his latest works were composed when
                    he had been for many years perfectly deaf.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the laborious investigations of many eminent anatomists and
                    physiologists, from Comparetti downwards to Magendie, the uses and functions of
                    all the various parts that compose the human ear are by no means well
                    understood.</p>
                <p>The perceptive powers of the ear differ considerably among mankind, especially as
                    regards the perception of the various qualities and relations of musical sounds.
                    In like manner, we find that the perceptions of form, proportion, colour,
                    &amp;c. are by no means always the same in every human eye. Perfection of the
                    eye is requisite to the painter; perfection of the ear to the musician.
                    Sometimes persons are found who cannot distinguish colours, or shades of colour,
                    from each other. Perhaps more frequently instances are met with of persons whose
                    perceptions of the differences between musical sounds are very imperfect. We
                    have been informed that Mr Pond, the late astronomer royal, though a real lover
                    of music, and capable of hearing distinctly sounds of a grave pitch, or of a
                    middle pitch, was incapable of hearing very acute sounds, whether musical or
                    not, which were perfectly audible to other persons; for example, the loud
                    chirping of a number of crickets in a room, and the very piercing sound produced
                    by turning round the ground-glass stopper of a bottle containing calomel. The
                    stopper was turned round close to Mr Pond’s ear without producing any sensation.
                    All this clearly proved that Mr Pond’s ear, however perfect in other respects,
                    was incapable of conveying any perception of very acute sounds.</p>
                <p>All vibrations sufficiently rapid and powerful to act upon the auditive organs
                    produce the sensation of sound. To enable us to hear slow vibrations as well as
                    more rapid ones, it would be necessary, according to Ricca⅛ that the intensity
                    of each simple vibration should be in proportion to its duration. For this
                    reason, says Chladni, and on account of the different organization of each
                    individual, and each kind of animal, there exist no absolute limits to the
                    perceptibility of sounds.</p>
                <p>The ear does not distinguish the very small differences of the exact ratios
                    between sounds. Were it not for this illusion, music would have no existence.
                    But this is not to make us seek the less for true intonation, wherever it can be
                    obtained. Few persons are aware how great is the difference between the true
                    intonations of a fine voice, or a violin, &amp;c. and the false intonations of
                    such instruments of fixed sounds as the organ, piano-forte, &amp;c. Many
                    singers, trained to the intonation of a piano-forte, have their ear and voice so
                    misled that they can never afterwards learn to sing in tune. The famous Madame
                    Mara condemned the use of the piano-forte in learning to sing. She said every
                    singer ought to learn to play on the violin, in order to know what true
                    intonation is.</p>
                <p>The different quality <hi rend="italic">(timbre)</hi> of a musical sound and its
                    articulations, says Chladni, are among the most remarkable objects of audition.
                    They do not appear to depend on the manner of vibration, nor (or very little)
                    upon the form of the sonorous body; but rather on the matter of the sonorous
                    body, and that of the body by which it is rubbed or struck, as well as on the
                    matter which propagates the sound. We have not the least idea of the nature of
                    these different characters of sound, nor of their propagation.</p>
                <p>The limits usually assigned to musical sounds, reckoning from grave to acute, or
                    the contrary, are as follows:</p>
                <p>The lowest of these sounds will be such as is produced by an open organ-pipe of
                    32 feet in length, and the number<pb break="no" facs="nls:193827113"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-7113-0608"/> of vibrations of the reed will be 32 in a second
                    of time. The next octave above will be produced by an open organ-pipe of 16
                    feet, and the number of vibrations in a second will be 64; the next octave above
                    that, pipe 8 feet, and 128 vibrations; and so on. The highest sound above noted
                    will have 16,384 vibrations in a second. This last sound is not to be taken
                    absolutely as indicating the extreme limit of acute sounds that may be used in
                    music, and may be appreciated by the human ear; for it has been calculated that
                    a sound produced by 24,000 vibrations in a second is appreciable. We shall give,
                    in a wood cut, p. 618, a copy of a very useful table of the compass of voices
                    and instruments, published by Monsieur Choron, in his large and expensive work
                    upon composition. As all the plates of that work were destroyed some years ago,
                    copies are now extremely rare and valuable.</p>
                <p>If we take a vibrating musical string or wire, perfectly uniform in thickness,
                    and homogeneous throughout, and divide it into its aliquot parts, its half, its
                    third, its fourth, its fifth, and so on, we shall obtain, by this division of
                    the <hi rend="italic">monochord,</hi> as it is called, a great many of the
                    sounds belonging to our musical system. A number of these sounds can be obtained
                    from it by lightly touching it at these divisions, as happens when we produce
                    harmonics on the open string of a violin, &amp;c.; and all these sounds are <hi
                    rend="italic">true,</hi> or nearly true, if the string is perfect; otherwise
                    they are not. This frequent imperfection in the uniformity and homogeneity of
                    strings is one great obstacle to perfect intonation. Again, if we take an
                    organ-pipe, or a French horn, &amp;c., and blow into it in such a manner as to
                    produce its natural series of sounds, we shall have, beginning with the lowest,
                    a series corresponding (in ratio of vibrations of the column of air contained in
                    it) to the arithmetical series 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, &amp;c. thus:</p>
                <p>These sounds also are <hi rend="italic">true</hi> harmonics, supposing the
                    sonorous tube properly constructed, and the force of the blast suitably
                    regulated. If we push this harmonic generation of sounds still farther, we may
                    obtain a number of other sounds, some of which, though apparently <hi
                    rend="italic">false</hi> as regards our artificial temperament on instruments of
                    fixed sounds (such as the organ, piano-forte, &amp;c.), are yet <hi
                    rend="italic">true,</hi> or nearly so, as regards the intervals which occur in
                    <hi rend="italic">true intonation.</hi></p>
                <p>There is no room here to enter into a discussion of this curious and intricate
                    subject. We shall content ourselves with giving a table of the harmonics
                    obtainable from an open cylindrical glass tube furnished with a suitable
                    mouthpiece, and fitted to an organ-bellows. This table shows that the gravest
                    sounds obtainable from the tube are removed from each other by wide intervals.
                    Thus the two first sounds, C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> are separated by the interval of an octave. G <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is a fifth above C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and C
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> is a fourth above G <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,
                    and so on. This is the series followed by the natural sounds of such instruments
                    as the horn, trumpet, serpent, &amp;c.; but it is extremely difficult, or nearly
                    impossible, to produce on these instruments the sound corresponding to C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. Even C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is very difficult
                    to produce; and the first sound that usually occurs corresponds with G <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. <hi rend="smallcaps">As</hi> the sounds become more
                    acute, that is, as the column of air divides itself into a greater number of
                    parts, they approximate each other more and more. By and by, chromatic intervals
                    occur, represented by flats and sharps; and, at last, intervals so small that
                    they cannot be represented by any of the common signs of musical notation. But
                    these smaller intervals are necessary to perfect musical intonation, and are
                    employed by the best singers and performers on instruments of the violin kind.
                    In France, a number of experiments were tried with Viotti’s performance, and it
                    was ascertained that he employed a vast number of very minute intervals, in
                    order to play perfectly in tune in all keys.</p>

                <p>In treating of the musical sounds produced by sonorous bodies, such as vibrating
                    strings, or wires, or springs, or columns of air in tubes, &amp;c., it is rarely
                    kept in view that in these, as in all mechanical phenomena, allowance must be
                    made for the mechanical conditions which may render the actual phenomena not
                    exactly correspondent to the mathematically calculated results. From want of
                    attention to this, many false theories of musical intonation have been adopted.
                    It is quite true, mathematically speaking, that if all the hypothetical
                    conditions of a sonorous body were, as they are assumed to be, in the course of
                    a mathematical reasoning regarding them, the physicomathematical result deduced
                    by such reasoning, supposing this reasoning accurate, must be perfectly correct.
                    But, in general, such reasoning and deduction are carried on with abstraction
                    made of some of the inevitable physical circumstances which attend the real
                    phenomena. In this way, pure mathematical reasoning is often, in some degree, at
                    variance with mechanical phenomena. A badly formed string, or wire, &amp;c. will
                    not conform to the mathematical calculations as to the sounds that it must
                    produce when divided in such and such ways. Neither will its real vibrations
                    agree with those mathematically calculated. In like manner, the friction, and
                    inequalities and imperfections, of any piece of machinery, will, in the real
                    operations of the latter, produce results in some respects contradictory to the
                    abstract mathematical theory of what the operations of the mechanism ought to
                    be.</p>
                <p>A musical interval consists in the difference between two given soùnds, in
                    respect to their relative acuteness and gravity. Thus it is evident that the <hi
                    rend="italic">unison</hi> is not an <hi rend="italic">interval,</hi> although it
                    is often improperly so called. Aristotle, in the tenth section of his
                    thirty-ninth problem, very correctly designates the unison as being “only the
                    same sound multiplied.” But the slightest departure from <hi rend="italic"
                    >unison,</hi> by one of the sounds becoming a little more acute, or the other a
                    little more grave, forms an <hi rend="italic">interval,</hi> though it may be so
                    <hi rend="italic">very small</hi> as not to belong to those intervals generally
                    recognised in melody and harmony. The measure of the relative lengths, or
                    vibrations, of two musical strings producing an interval, will be the difference
                    of their respective logarithms, as has been remarked by Dr Smith in his
                    “Harmonics,” and by various other subsequent writers. Among these, the late
                    Professor Robison, of Edinburgh <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827126"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-7126-0609"/> University, pointed out some useful applications
                    of the logarithmic subdivision of the circumference of a pasteboard circle,
                    fitted with a moveable concentric circle, &amp;c. as described in his article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Temperament,</hi> in the present work. He adds: “Ora
                    straight line may be so divided, and repeated thrice; then a sliding ruler,
                    divided in the same manner, and applied to it, will answer the same purpose.” We
                    may remark, that these suggestions of Professor Robison have been employed in
                    the construction of similar instruments, without any acknowledgment; and also,
                    that Professor Robison’s experiment, by applying a stop-cock to an organ-pipe,
                    and producing various sounds from the regular and rapid opening and shutting of
                    the stop-cock, bears great analogy to the syren instrument recently constructed
                    by Μ. Cagniard de la Tour. Professor Robison, speaking of his stop-cock
                    apparatus, says, “The intelligent reader will see here an opening made to great
                    additions to practical music, and the means of producing musical sounds, of
                    which we have at present scarcely any conception,” &amp;c. We have already
                    mentioned, very briefly, how intervals are produced by the subdivisions of a
                    sonorous string or wire, &amp;c. or of the column of air in a wind-instrument,
                    or in the glass tube before described.</p>
                <p>If we suppose such a tube to produce, as its gravest sound, its primary harmonics
                    will be viz. octave, replicate of fifth, and replicate of third. Carrying the
                    series farther, we shall have one similar to that already given in the table of
                    harmonics. Supposing two other such tubes, the one having for its gravest sound
                    and the other the harmonics re sulting from these respectively will be</p>
                <p>5</p>
                <p>, and</p>
                <p>, and so on, as in the case of the first.</p>
                <p>By bringing closer together these dispersed primary har monies, by means of their
                    octaves above or below, we shall obtain the following series of sounds:</p>
                <p>or and so on. If to the last of these series we add at the top, we shall have the
                    major diatonic scale of C. By carrying farther the series of harmonic products
                    of these three tubes, we shall obtain a number of other intervals (see the
                    table), and among these the ones suitable to the scale of C minor:</p>
                <p>The subject of intervals has been involved in frightful confusion by the number
                    and complexity of names introduced, and the contradictory statements of various
                    writers upon music. We have no space to devote to the clearing up of this chaos;
                    but we may remark, in general, that in this matter, as well as in many others
                    connected with music, there is great need of a reformation in terminology. To
                    glance at only three or four of the misnomers in daily use, without meddling
                    with the more abstruse terms: the fifth diatonic sound of an ascending scale is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">dominant</hi> of the scale, which signifies the <hi
                    rend="italic">ruling</hi> or <hi rend="italic">governing</hi> sound; while, in
                    fact, the tonic, or key-note, and no other, is the chief and ruling sound of the
                    scale, the sound from which, as a common centre, all the others of the scale may
                    diverge, or to which they may converge, like the radii of a circle. This use of
                    the term <hi rend="italic">dorminant</hi> seems to have arisen from the <hi
                    rend="italic">predominance</hi> of the fifth of the key in ancient
                    church-chants. The term <hi rend="italic">subdominant</hi> is improper, too, as
                    applied to the diatonic fourth of a scale. The terms <hi rend="italic">double
                    octave, double third, double fourth,</hi> &amp;c. are wrong as applied to
                    intervals, because they <hi rend="italic">imply</hi> that these intervals are
                    <hi rend="italic">doubled</hi> in the unison, while it is meant to express only
                    the acuter or graver replicates of these intervals in the octave. The same with
                    regard to <hi rend="italic">triple octave,</hi> &amp;c. When we read of <hi
                    rend="italic">diminished</hi> or <hi rend="italic">augmented unisons, false
                    fifths, superfluous fifths, seconds,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. we must regret the
                    obscurity of such terms; but meantime we shall use the common terms as we find
                    them, because to introduce new ones abruptly would only add to the confusion
                    already existing.</p>

                <p>Inversion of an interval takes place when the graver sound is carried an octave
                    higher, or the acuter an octave lower. The effect of inversion of intervals may
                    be represented by the following two rows of figures, where it will be seen that
                    1 or unison, becomes 8 or octave; 2, or second, becomes 7 or seventh, and so

                <p>By looking at the above table of intervals, and their in versions, we perceive
                    that romor intervals inverted become <hi rend="italic">major,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">major, minor</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    diminished.</hi> We have placed D♭ before Cö, and Eb before D♯, and so on;
                    because, contrary to the common opinion, the D♭ in the above series is a graver
                    sound than the C♯, and the Eb than the Dît, and so of the others. This is not
                    easily understood by a mere player on the organ or piano-forte, but can be
                    exemplified by any accomplished singer or violinist.</p>
                <p>In writing for voices, especially in the strict or serious <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193827139" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7139-0610"/> style, many of these
                    intervals are hot used. The following are generally prohibited in that style:
                    Augmented second, diminished fourth, augmented fourth, diminished fifth,
                    augmented fifth, major sixth, diminished seventh, minor seventh, major seventh,
                    augmented third.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scale</hi> is the more comprehensive of these terms, since all
                    appreciable musical sounds between the extremes of grave and acute form the
                    general scale or system of sounds employed in melody and harmony. A <hi
                    rend="italic">mode</hi> is a certain arrangement of tones and semitones, &amp;c.
                    between a given sound and its octave above or below. <hi rend="italic">Key</hi>
                    properly signifies a character employed at the beginning of the staff, to fix
                    the names of the notes; but it has long been used as nearly synonymous with
                    scale or mode, since these terms are often employed the one for the other. What
                    is called the <hi rend="italic">key-note,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tonic,</hi>
                    is the principal sound of a mode, or that from which we begin to reckon its
                    degrees upwards or downwards. Suppose we take the note C as <hi rend="italic"
                    >tonic,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">key-note.</hi> The arrangement of notes No. 1
                    will form the <hi rend="italic">mode</hi> or <hi rend="italic">key</hi> of C
                    major, and the arrangement of No. 2 the <hi rend="italic">mode</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">key</hi> of C minor.</p>
                <p>Both these are called <hi rend="italic">Diatonic</hi> scales, although they are
                    not strictly such, since they contain other intervals besides tones. The
                    chromatic scales formed from these consist of a semitonic (or so-called
                    semitonic) series between the key-note and its octave above or below, ascending
                    or descending. These two modes, major and minor, and their respective chromatic
                    scales, may be considered as the types or representatives of all other major and
                    minor modes and chromatic scales. No. 3 and No. 4 are two forms of the major and
                    minor mode not generally adverted to, but which are very effective when
                    skilfully used, as, for example, by Haydn in the andantino in C minor of his
                    symphony in E flat. As an octave series or scale may be formed anywhere within
                    the limits of appreciable musical sounds, we thus obtain a variety of scales,
                    diatonic and chromatic, all of which, however, are to be considered as only so
                    many fragmentary formulae, comprehended within, and belonging to the <hi
                    rend="italic">whole series</hi> of the general system. Thus we shall have the
                    modes or scales of C flat, C sharp, major and minor; D major and minor, D flat
                    and D sharp, major and minor, and so on with E, F, G, A, B, and their chromatic
                    alterations, flat or sharp. The term <hi rend="italic">key</hi> is usually
                    applied to these. Thus we speak of the <hi rend="italic">key</hi> of C major, of
                    C minor, of C sharp major or minor, and so on. As concert-pitch is not one and
                    the same in all countries, keys of the same name do not everywhere correspond
                    exactly. The production of what is called the sharp series of keys arises from a
                    regular succession of perfect fifths taken in ascending, or fourths in
                    descending, beginning with C for the major ones, or A for the minor ones. Thus
                    the first step of a 5th ascending from C brings us to G as a new key-note. G
                    major, with one ♯ at the clef. The first step of a 5th ascending from A brings
                    us to E as a new key-note E minor, with one ♯ at the clef. A5th, again,
                    ascending from G brings us to D major with two sharps at the clef; and a 5th
                    ascending from E brings us to B minor, also with two sharps at the clef; and so
                    on progressively with the major keys of A, E, B, with 3, 4, 5 sharps at the
                    clef, till at last, at the twelfth 5th from C, we reach B sharp, which, when
                    brought down by octaves towards the original C, will be found not to correspond
                    with that C in unison or octave, but to be too sharp. The same thing will occur
                    after a similar series of twelve perfect 5ths from A, as tonic of A minor, up to
                    G double sharp, which last will not be in unison or octave with the original A,
                    but will be too sharp in the same proportion as the other extreme of the series
                    of twelve ascending 5ths from C to B sharp. We may mention here, that composers
                    seldom go beyond the keys of F♯ or C♯ major or minor, in their notation of a
                    piece of music, on account of the multiplicity of sharps and double sharps in
                    the subsequent keys of G♯, D♯, A♯, E♯, B♯, and the difficulty of reading these,
                    and of playing in tune in such keys upon musical instruments even of the most
                    perfect kind.</p>
                <p>What is called the flat series of keys, arises from a succession of perfect 5ths,
                    the converse of the former. That is to say, when, beginning with C, or with A,
                    for the major or for the minor series, each key-note, in regular succession, is
                    a 5th in descending below, or a 4th in ascending above the key-note immediately
                    preceding. Thus, from C to F in descending, F major with one flat at the clef;
                    from this F to B♭ in descending, B♭ major with two flats at the clef; and so on
                    with E♭, A♭, D♭, major, and with 3, 4, 5 flats, &amp;c. at the clef. Then,
                    again, the minor flat series, beginning from A as tonic of minor, D minor with
                    one flat at the clef; from D tonic to G tonic of G minor, with two flats at the
                    clef; and so on with C minor, F minor, B flat minor, &amp;c. with 3, 4, 5 flats,
                    &amp;c. at the clef. We may here remark, that what is commonly called the
                    relative minor key of a major key, has its tonic at the interval of a minor
                    third below the tonic of that major key, and bears at the clef the same number
                    of sharps or of flats. Thus the relative minor of C is A, without any sharps or
                    flats at the clef; the relative minor of G is E, with one sharp at the clef; and
                    so on with D major and B minor, A major and F sharp minor, &amp;c. with 2, 3
                    sharps, &amp;c. The same kind of relation occurs in the flat series of relative
                    major and minor keys. Thus C major, A minor; F major, D minor; each of the
                    latter two with one flat at the clef; B flat major, G minor, each with two flats
                    at the clef; and so on with the rest, 3 flats, 4 flats, &amp;c. The remoter flat
                    keys beyond D flat are rarely used, for reasons similar to those assigned for
                    the infrequent use of sharp keys beyond C sharp. To render more intelligible
                    what has been said regarding the production of the sharp and the flat series of
                    keys, we subjoin the following explanations. Suppose a musical string to render
                    a sound equal to the lowest C of the violoncello, and to be numerically
                    represented by 1. If this string be divided into three equal parts, any one of
                    these parts will (tension and other circumstances remaining the same) render a
                    sound equal to the first octave of the 5th above that C, and will be expressed
                    by ⅛. Two of these parts taken together will render the 5th above that C, and
                    such 5th will be expressed by θ, and will be equivalent to the lowest G of <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193827152" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7152-0611"/> the violoncello.
                    Taking, again, the length of the string 2</p>
                <p>represented by -, and dividing it into three equal parts, two of these parts will
                    render a sound equivalent to D of second open string of violoncello, and this D
                    will be ex- 22</p>
                <p>pressed by . By proceeding in the same manner, we shall obtain the series
                    represented in the following diagram. With regard to the numerical expressions
                    placed under the 5ths, it will be remarked, that at each successive 5th the
                    exponent of the number 3 increases by one, while that of the number 2 sometimes
                    increases by one, sometimes by two, according as the new term is in the 5th
                    above, or in the 4th below, the preceding one.</p>
                <p>We shall find that the B♯, the twelfth 5th of this series, will not be in unison
                    with C^, the octave above the original Cl, but will be more acute than that C^.
                    If we suppose the whole string Cl divided into a number of parts equal to 2 X
                    531541, the B♯ in question will have 524,288 of these, while the C-will have
                    531,541; and therefore the B♯ will be the acuter sound of the two. In reversing
                    the process above described, that is to say, in reckoning a series of 5ths from
                    acute to grave, the numerical expression of the 5th will be -. If, then, we set
                    out from the C represented by ∣, and carry on, from acute to grave, a series of
                    operations similar to the former, we shall obtain the following expressions for
                    the flat series of keys by descending 5ths.</p>
                <p>The D♭b, the twelfth 5th from C^, will be found to be a graver sound than Cl, the
                    octave below that C∣; for, supposing the whole string = Cl divided into 524,288
                    equal parts, the D♭b would require 531,541 of these parts, which exceeds the
                    whole length of the string, and would therefore produce a graver sound than Cl.
                    The following diagram of the scales by 5ths ascending (sharp series), and by
                    5ths descending (flat series), will show the relative differences in pitch
                    between the sounds of the one series and of the other.</p>

                <p>If we compare with each other the corresponding terms of these two scales or
                    series, we perceive that the sounds of the sharp series are more acute than
                    those which correspond with them in the flat series, because the strings which
                    produce the latter surpass the others in length by the difference between
                    524,288 and 531,541, = 7253. A slight consideration of these processes, and
                    their results, will show the necessity of what is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >temperament</hi> upon such an instrument as the organ, the piano-forte, &amp;c.
                    By it the fifths are rendered a little false, in order to obtain all the octaves
                    true.</p>
                <p>What are called the ancient ecclesiastical scales or modes, being, in reality,
                    nothing but certain conventional scales or modifications of the common major and
                    minor scales, and differing from these in nothing but the disposition of their
                    semitones, it is not necessary here to notice them very particularly. The four
                    most ancient of these were the Dorian, the Phrygian, theLydian, and the
                    Myxo-Lydian. The first of these was equivalent to the series <hi rend="italic"

                    semitones is indicated by the curved line ^. The reader will find a full
                    explanation of all the ecclesiastical modes, authentic and plagal, in the first
                    part of the first volume of Padre Martini’s <hi rend="italic">Saggio di
                    Contrappunto.</hi> A good many years ago, a Frenchman, Blainville, pretended to
                    have discovered a new scale or mode, which was really nothing more than the
                    Phrygian mode above indicated. Reicha, in his volume of thirty-six fugues,
                    proposed what he considered as a <hi rend="italic">new system</hi> of scales,
                    harmonies, and cadences, which he considered as <hi rend="italic">relative</hi>
                    to the usual major and minor scales, &amp;c. These relative scales, however,
                    were merely the Dorian and others above mentioned, with the addition of the
                    series <hi rend="italic">a, b, c, d, e, f g, a.</hi> The relative cadences were
                    those that might be used between the assumed dominant and tonic of such scales,
                    there being no, chromatic alteration made in the sounds of the scale. For
                    example:</p>
                <p>Reicha says, enthusiastically, “according to this system, we should have two
                    primitive scales, a major and a minor, and five relative ones; and, by
                    transposition, twelve primitive minor scales, and sixty relative scales; in all
                    eighty-four scales, and as many cadences. What resources unknown till now !” We
                    cannot join Reicha in this burst of enthusiasm. The formulae of these scales and
                    cadences are to be found in a great many old church chants, and even national
                    melodies. We must not mistake these fragmentary formulae for entire and peculiar
                    scales, independent of the general system of musical sounds. Reicha adds, “It
                    remains for philosophers and men of genius at a future period to deduce all the
                    consequences from this important system, as well as from the compound measures,
                    and their use. But the subtilty of a conventional taste, the ignorance and the
                    prejudices so fatal to the progress of the arts, and which are peculiar to
                    narrow minds, will be long opposed to such deduction.” We should rejoice if
                    Reicha’s anticipated deductions could be verified in our day; but, with all
                    respect for that excellent musician, we rather think that he has too often
                    suffered his reason to be led astray by the incomprehensible idealism and
                    metaphysics, so general in Germany upon almost all subjects of art, science, and
                    literature.</p>
                <p>Some peculiarities that have been observed in certain national tunes, such as the
                    omission, in some instances, of the fourth and seventh of the key, have been
                    referred to scales of a particular kind, while it seems more reasonable to refer
                    them merely to the imperfections of some of the musical instruments employed;
                    for instance, the ancient flageolet, and the chalumeau, &amp;c. Scales,
                    seemingly anomalous, may arise from such causes, or from caprice, or
                    conventional usage; but all such scales are only fragments of that general
                    system of sounds which comprehends all manner of appreciable intervals, many of
                    which last are much smaller than is commonly believed. It has been denied that
                    the ancient Scotish music contained any semitones; but that this is an error, is
                    proved by the Skene manuscript in the Advocates’ Library, Edinburgh. In the ten
                    Indian scales given by Sir William Jones, we find two that want the fourth and
                    seventh of the key note, and one that wants the third and seventh. The former
                    are the scales called <hi rend="italic">Maravi</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gaudi,</hi> equivalent to <hi rend="italic">c, d, e, g, a,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">g, α, b, d, e</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the latter is the one
                    called <hi rend="italic">Saindhavi,</hi> equivalent to <hi rend="italic">a, b,
                    d, e, f.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Asavéri, Bahairava,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Malava,</hi> correspond exactly with the Dorian, the Lydian, and
                    the Myxo-Lydian modes above mentioned. The <hi rend="italic">Friraga</hi> is the
                    same as the <hi rend="italic">Malava,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Todi</hi> is
                    the same as our scale of C major, and the <hi rend="italic">Varati</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Bengali</hi> correspond with our scale of A minor with minor
                    seventh. As to the Hindu, Persian, and Chinese scales, and the use of quarter
                    tones, or other minute intervals, we refer the reader to what we published on
                    that subject in No. iv. of the New Edinburgh Review, April 1822, pp. 521-528. We
                    have examined a number of Chinese wind and stringed instruments brought home in
                    June 1837, and have found semitones in ail of them. Professional musicians who
                    followed Napoleon into Egypt, remarked the frequent and dexterous use of very
                    small intervals by some singers in that country. Dr Burney, in the second volume
                    of his history, p. 424, mentions that the Arabian scale of music is divided into
                    quarter tones, and that each of the twenty-four of these, into which the octave
                    is divided, has a particular denomination.</p>
                <p>At the head of these must be placed the human voice. The nearer any artificial
                    instrument approaches to it in quality and power of expression, the more
                    excellent it is. Much controversy has arisen regarding the mechanism of the
                    vocal organs which effect the modulations or inflexions of the human voice in
                    singing. Some physiologists have considered this mechanism as similar to that of
                    a reed instrument; others as similar to that of a stringed instrument. It is
                    indeed neither, according to our artificial instruments, but a mechanism of
                    wonderful delicacy and complexity, infinitely surpassing all artificial
                    instruments in variety of <hi rend="italic">timbre,</hi> in delicacy of
                    intonation, and in power of melodic expression. Some of the most curious
                    inquiries into this subject were made by the late Dr Francesco Bennati, an
                    Italian physician and surgeon, and an accomplished amateur singer, who died a
                    very few years ago in the prime of his life. He says that <hi rend="italic"
                    >phonation</hi> has hitherto been confounded with <hi rend="italic"
                    >modulation</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the sounds of the voice in speaking,
                    &amp;c. with those of the voice in singing. We would observe, that the ancient
                    Greeks, in their writings on music, made a marked distinction in this. Dr
                    Bennati says that the muscles of the larynx are by no means, as hitherto
                    asserted, the only ones employed in the production of the sounds of the human
                    voice in singing; and that from leaving out of view a number of elements which
                    belong to the real mechanism in such production, the theories of the whole
                    matter that have been proposed and received are erroneous. Among these omissions
                    of real elements, he instances the muscles of the <hi rend="italic">os
                    hydides,</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">tongue,</hi> of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >upper anterior</hi> and <hi rend="italic">posterior part of the vocal
                    tube,</hi> besides other anatomical parts that contribute to modify the voice.
                    We cannot here enter into the curious details given by Dr Bennati; but may add,
                    that he rejects the received terms of <hi rend="italic">note di testa and note
                    di petto,</hi> as conveying false ideas; and proposes to substitute for them the
                    terms <hi rend="italic">supra-laryngean</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >laryngean</hi> notes or sounds. His proofs of all that he asserts are drawn
                    from his own frequent observation of the actual functions of the whole mechanism
                    of the voice in the cases of -a number of the most celebrated male and female
                    singers, his contemporaries. Stretched strings of gut or silk, either plain or
                    spirally covered with wire, are the sonorous bodies employed to produce musical
                    sounds on instruments of the violin kind, or of the guitar kind, or on the harp.
                    Stretched wires of brass or steel, &amp;c. plain, or spirally covered with wire,
                    produce the sounds of the pianoforte, &amp;c. Other instruments are constructed
                    of glass bells or rods, &amp;c. made to sound by friction or percussion; others,
                    again, of metal springs, made to sound by a revolving toothed barrel, as in the
                    Geneva musical boxes; or by a current of air directed against them, as in the
                    German toy called the mouth harmonica, or in theAEolophon, or the Accordion and
                    Symphonion. Several other instruments of a similar kind were invented before
                    these. It <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827178" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7178-0613"/> may
                    be mentioned, that Professor Robison of Edinburgh University gave the hint for
                    constructing instruments of this last land.</p>
                <p>In the year 1785, the Abbate Gattoni constructed at Como a most singular Aeolian
                    harp. He stretched fifteen iron wires, of different thicknesses, from the top of
                    a tower fifty-two <hi rend="italic">braccia</hi> in height (about ninety feet),
                    to his dwellinghouse, about 150 paces distant. This giant-harp, by its
                    mysterious sounds while the air was calm, indicated changes of the weather. This
                    was ascribed to electric influence. The same phenomena occurred in a similar
                    harp constructed by Captain Haas of Basle. The effect of the vibrations of the
                    wires in each of these giant-harps, prior to changes of weather, or during
                    storms, is said to have been quite indescribable. The sounds swelling and dying,
                    and combining in the wildest harmonies, were sometimes heard for miles around.
                    Wind instruments are tubes of wood or metal, in which the vibrating body is the
                    column of air contained in them. They are sounded either by a peculiar
                    mouth-piece, like that of the old flute or the flageolet; or by blowing into an
                    aperture on one side of the tube, as in the fife, german flute, &amp;c.; or by
                    means of a reed, as in the oboe, clarinet, bassoon, &amp;c.; or, as in the case
                    of the horn, the trumpet, &amp;c. by means of a cup shaped mouthpiece, to which
                    the lips are applied in a particular manner, and the sounds produced by
                    compressions and dilatations of the lips, and the regulated force of the breath,
                    and, in some circumstances, by introducing the band within the bellshaped end of
                    the instrument. Other instruments are merely pulsatile, such as triangles,
                    cymbals, bells, gongs, drums, &amp;c., and have their sounds fixed. The harsh
                    and unmusical tone of the gong seems to be owing to its peculiar shape, as well
                    as to the numerous abrupt inequalities in its thickness and density.</p>
                <p>With reference to Choron’s table of compass of voices and instruments, we have to
                    remark in general, that the best sounds of voices and instruments are their
                    medium sounds, and that this ought to be carefully attended to by the composer.
                    The frequent neglect of this in modern compositions produces a detestable chaos
                    of screaming, squeaking, and grumbling. We add the following supplementary and
                    explanatory information, which is of importance to the student. The medium
                    compass of voices is as follows:</p>
                <p>These restrictions are, of course, not intended to apply to solo singers, who
                    have voices of great compass, but to Parts<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In this article, we use the word Part, beginning with a
                    capital, to signify that portion of a musical composition assigned to 3
                    particular voice or instrument.</p></note> written in songs, duetts, trios,
                    &amp;c. for voices of ordinary compass. It should be kept in view, that in
                    writing for voices of the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> compass and quality, we
                    can hardly go beyond a trio or a quartett without producing a poor effect.
                    Duetts, or at most trios, of this kind, are therefore best when circumstances
                    require such combinations. But, for <hi rend="italic">variety</hi> of effects,
                    and freedom of harmonic combinations, three, four, or more voices of different
                    compass and quality ought almost always to be preferred in vocal trios,
                    quartetts, &amp;c. For <hi rend="italic">duetts</hi> of this contrasted kind,
                    see the operas of Cimarosa, Mozart, Cherubini, Himmel, &amp;c. To write
                    effective Parts in harmony for voices, requires great skill and judgment. In a
                    vocal quartett, for example, if we throw any of the voices out of their best
                    medium com pass, and do not carry them all on in correspondence with that
                    compass, we shall produce poor and ineffective harmonies; for instance, if we
                    place the tenor Part too low and too near the bass, while the treble and contr’
                    alto remain in their best medium compass. Again, we may render the principal
                    Part in a soprano a secondary Part (to the ear), by bringing it and the contr’
                    alto too close to the tenor and bass; and may thus render the tenor, or even the
                    bass, the most prominent Part, when we intended the contrary. In vocal Parts for
                    many voices, such as choruses, &amp;c. great simplicity of structure and of <hi
                    rend="italic">performance</hi> is required to produce any good effect. In 1819
                    we witnessed the famous Crescentini’s training of a chorus at Bologna. His ear
                    caught in an instant the slightest defect of intonation in any of the voices;
                    the slightest excess of disproportionate <hi rend="italic">piano</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">forte</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the slightest attempt at any
                    embellishment, even an <hi rend="italic">appoggiatura.</hi> He stopped the whole
                    performers immediately, pointed out the fault, and made them repeat the music
                    over and over again till he was satisfied. This was the true way to train a
                    perfect choral band; it would be well if his example were followed in all such
                    cases.</p>
                <p>Its powers and compass as a solo instrument are very great, although too often
                    misused. In orchestra music it is seldom carried above F in alt.</p>
                <p>In writing for an orchestra, the viola is rarely used above G, two octaves and a
                    fifth above its lowest sound C. Not unfrequently, in modern music, it crosses
                    the second violin, and rises above it for a short time in the harmony of a
                    quartett, even where it is not performing a solo Part. But this generally occurs
                    for the sake of preserving a melodious progression of the Parts, or of producing
                    some particular effect from the <hi rend="italic">interweaving</hi> of the
                    different <hi rend="italic">timbres</hi> of the stringed instruments.</p>
                <p>We must keep in view, that the German double basses have generally four strings,
                    and that some are tuned E, A, D, G, upwards, while others have D for their
                    lowest note. In Italy and France the double basses have only three strings, and
                    are tuned A, D, G. In writing for the double bass, rapid passages ought to be
                    avoided, because they produce no effect, but only a confused noise. In music for
                    a full orchestra, the double basses are reinforced by the tenor violins and
                    violoncellos, or by the bassoons; or by the trombones, serpent, &amp;c;
                    sometimes by the horns and trumpets, by the lower notes of the clarinet or of
                    the oboe, even by the flute in its upper octaves, or by the octave flute, though
                    the latter combinations are often abused by some living composers. Sometimes, in
                    a florid passage for the double bass, a good effect is produced by reinforcing
                    it by the second violins. In orchestra music, the violoncello generally goes (an
                    octave above) with the· double bass Part: but beautiful effects are often
                    produced by giving the violoncello a principal melody, accompanied by other
                    instruments. When the treble clef is used in passages for the violoncello, care
                    must be taken to write them according to the real pitch of the sounds, and not
                    an octave higher, as is too often done.</p>
                <p>In writing for the German flute, all rapid passages in keys having more than one
                    or two sharps or flats should be avoided, as they are very difficult <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> execution. We have corrected Choron’s table, by extending
                    the compass of the flute to C downwards, as most flutes now have the C
                    finger-key. Its compass upwards is to B flat on the fifth ledger line in alt. In
                    modern orchestra music, the octave flute, or <hi rend="italic">piccolo,</hi> is
                    too much employed. Its shrill and piercing sounds ought to be reserved for
                    particular effects. In military music there arc other kinds of flutes used, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193827191" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7191-0614"/> the <hi
                    rend="italic">piccolo</hi> in E flat, and the <hi rend="italic">piccolo</hi> in
                    F; the former being a semitone higher, and the latter a minor third higher, than
                    the octave flute. There are also what are called third and fourth flutes, the
                    former being a minor third, and the latter a fourth, higher than the common
                    German flute in D. Parts for these flutes are written in , D. There are five
                    sorts of flageolets, in C, D, E flat, F, and G, for the sake of facilitating
                    their performance in different keys. Double and even triple flageolets have been
                    contrived in London by Mr Bainbridge. On the former, two parts can be played at
                    once; on the latter, three. The oboe requires attention in writing for it. The
                    easiest scales for it are C major, F major, G major, and D major. In some modern
                    oboes, there are, in the upper part of the instrument, finger-keys for F and A
                    flat; and, in the middle part, for F sharp, E flat, and C. Some have a
                    finger-key for the lowest C sharp. Some players have two or three upper and
                    middle pieces, to serve for altering the pitch of the instrument to different
                    keys, on the same principle as flutes and clarinets, &amp;c. are made of
                    different lengths to avoid difficulties of fingering. In orchestra music the
                    oboe is not used beyond È flat in alt.</p>
                <p>The English horn, or <hi rend="italic">vox</hi><hi rend="italic">humana,</hi> is
                    an instrument of the oboe kind, having the same relation to the oboe that the
                    viola has to the violin. It has the same number of sounds as the oboe, only the
                    scale is a fifth lower; so that pieces of music in F are written in C for the
                    English horn, pieces in E flat are written for it in B flat, and so on.</p>
                <p>The clarinet, or clarionet as it is often called, is an instrument of great power
                    and compass. We have corrected Choron’s table, by extending its compass upwards
                    to C above fifth ledger line in alt. The sweetest sounds of the clarinet are
                    comprised between and</p>
                <p>The sounds between B on third line of treble clef and C♯ on second ledger line
                    above are the most penetrating and brilliant. The sounds above that C♯ are very
                    difficult to produce without harshness of tone. It requires great skill to play
                    in tune on this instrument, particularly in the lower part of its compass. On
                    this account, as well as to avoid difficult fingering, clarinets of different
                    sizes are used to suit different keys. The most common used in orchestras are
                    those in C, in B♭, and in A. Besides these, there are used, in military bands,
                    clarinets in D, Eb, F, and G. These changes alter the pitch of the instrument,
                    but the fingering remains as before. Thus the pitch of a B♭ clarinet becomes in
                    its lowest sound <hi rend="underline">4⅜÷</hi><hi rend="subscript underline">
                    o</hi>; that is, a tone lower than the C clarinet. The pitch of the A clarinet
                    in its lowest sound becomes <hi rend="underline">*Q÷ ^</hi><hi rend="subscript
                    underline"> r</hi>, and so on.</p>
                <p>It is the custom to consider the principal key of every clarinet, whatever that
                    may be, as if it were C. The composer must attend to this in writing for the
                    clarinet. The B♭ clarinet serves to lessen the number of flats at the clef, and
                    the A clarinet to lessen the number of sharps, and so of the others. When the
                    piece of music is in Eb, the B♭ clarinet plays in F. The A clarinet plays in C
                    when the piece is in A. If the piece is in Ab the Bflat clarinet plays in Bb,
                    and so on. An example or two will make this rather puzzling matter more
                    clear.</p>
                <p>A few years ago, a German instrument-maker invented a bass clarinet and a
                    double-bass clarinet. The former is an octave lower than the C clarinet, and
                    reaches B♭, the lowest note of the bassoon. The double bass clarinet has a
                    compass of two octaves and a half upwards from the lowest F in bass clef. It
                    therefore extends to a fourth below the bassoon. The union of these with common
                    clarinets permits the formation of a clarinet quartett, and, of course, new
                    orchestral effects.</p>
                <p>The basset-horn is an instrument of the clarinet kind, although differing in form
                    from a clarinet. Choron has omitted it in his table. As it is sounded and
                    fingered like a clarinfet, any clarinet-player can play upon it also. It holds a
                    middle place between the clarinet and the bassoon.</p>
                <p>Some authors give it a compass of four octaves from to</p>
                <p>; others a compass from to</p>
                <p>As it is an instrument difficult to manage, it is generally confined to the keys
                    of C, F, B♭, and G. Mu∙</p>

                    higher than the real sounds, except in the case of arpeggios, &amp;c. in its
                    lower octave, which are expressed in the bass clef. For instance, if the music
                    is in G or in F, the part for the basset-horn will be written in C. For examples
                    of its use, see Mozart’s <hi rend="italic">Requiem,</hi> his <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The bassoon is an instrument of the oboe kind, though it differs from the oboe in
                    shape and construction. It holds the same place among the oboe class of
                    instruments as the violoncello does among the violin class. Some writers state
                    its compass to be from to or even to among solo-players. Music for the bassoon
                    is written in the bass clef for the lower sounds, and in the tenor clef for the
                    higher ones. The easiest keys for it are C, F, 1⅛, and G. In general it wants
                    the sound and the sounds are very bad, and must be avoided.</p>
                <p>Of late years, some bassoon-players and instrumentmakers have facilitated the
                    execution of certain passages on that instrument by a new disposition of the
                    finger-holes and the finger-keys. In orchestra music, bassoons are important
                    instruments. They serve as a bass to the flutes, oboes, clarinets, and horns;
                    they may fill up and enrich the harmony of the middle parts; they may go along
                    with (in the octave or the unison, as may suit) and reinforce the double bass,
                    the violoncello, the viola, the violin, the clarinet, the oboe, the flute, the
                    horn; or they may perform solo passages of their own with great effect.
                    Composers seldom put the bassoons to their proper and effective use, but too
                    often make them a mere reinforcement to the other bass instruments.</p>
                <p>The bass-bassoon (fagottone or contra fagotto) is an octave lower than the common
                    bassoon. It is not mentioned by Choron in his table. The first bass-bassoon seen
                    in England was made by Handel’s orders, for the use of Lampe, an excellent
                    bassoon-player, and author of the music of the Dragon of Wantley. Being an
                    unwieldy instrument, sixteen feet long, it was necessary to fix it in a frame
                    like a telescope.</p>
                <p>The serpent is chiefly used in military music, but has of late been introduced
                    into orchestra music to reinforce the basses. Mersenne says that a serpent
                    played by a boy was sufficient to sustain the voices of twenty stout monks. Of
                    late years some improvements have been made on it by the addition of keys,
                    though it is still an imperfect instrument. Writers differ in the compass
                    assigned to it. Some give it a compass from the lowest B flat of the pianoforte,
                    upto G on the second line of the treble clef, with all the semitones. Others
                    state its compass to be from lowest C of violoncello, up to C in third space of
                    the treble clef. One eminent writer says that its compass is four complete
                    octaves; that is, from C an octave below the lowest C of violoncello, up to C in
                    the third space of the treble clef. He says the lower notes, in this last
                    compass, are very difficult to produce, and their intervals not easily
                    appreciable. Reicha assigns to it a compass of three octaves, viz. from lowest C
                    of violoncello, up to C in third space of treble clef. The safest compass for
                    ordinary players is the two first of these octaves only, leaving out the highest
                    of the three. It is a singular fact, that there exists at this day, even among
                    many professional musicians, a great deal of misconception regarding the real
                    compass of a number of musical instruments of the wind kind. We have often been
                    surprised to find that a performer upon a horn, for instance, did not know its
                    real pitch or compass, and that he even supposed these to be just what appeared
                    from the notation in the treble clef. Now, a C horn, for example, is a tube of
                    eight feet or so in length; and, when played upon, becomes a tube stopped at <hi
                    rend="italic">one end</hi> by the lips, and therefore may render, as its lowest
                    possible sound, one equivalent to that produced by an organ-pipe of sixteen feet
                    open at both ends; that is to say, = C an octave below the lowest C of the
                    violoncello. The serpent, if a tube of the same length, will, when played on
                    with all the finger-holes stopped, be in a condition to render (but, like the
                    horn, with great difficulty) the same low C as the horn.</p>
                <p>The name of this powerful brass instrument (from the Greek õp/¢ and <hi
                    rend="italic">κ</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">εις)</hi>
                    signifies a keyed serpent. The ophicleide was invented a few years ago in
                    Germany. It was at first used in military music only, but of late years has been
                    introduced into orchestras. It is too noisy an instrument for any place but a
                    large locality. There are several kinds of ophicleides, as of trombones, and
                    music for the former is written in the same manner as for the latter. Examples
                    of the judicious use of the ophicleide may be seen in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gloria</hi> and subsequent movements, and <hi rend="italic">Marche
                    Réligieuse</hi> of Cherubini’s third solemn mass performed at the consecration
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Charles X.</p>
                <p>Whatever may be the key of the piece of music in which horns are employed, their
                    Parts are always written in the key of C. The following is the harmonic
                    progression of sounds producible by the horn, without any assistance from the
                    hand introduced into the bell.</p>
                <p>The sounds marked + are, successively, = to B flat, harmonic; G flat, ditto; and
                    G sharp, ditto. See preceding section, <hi rend="italic">Musical Sounds and
                    Intervals.</hi> We may here remark, once for all, that the sounds called false
                    and bad on the horn, trumpet, &amp;c. such as the pseudo fourth and sixth and
                    flat seventh of the scale, are <hi rend="italic">true</hi> as <hi rend="italic"
                    >chromatic</hi> harmonics, but do not correspond with the sounds found in the
                    same nominal places in the <hi rend="italic">diatonic</hi> scale. In treating of
                    harmony, it will be seen that these same chromatic harmonics—called false sounds
                    from their not belonging to the diatonic series—are frequently employed in
                    modern harmony and melody. The dominant seventh continually occurs, and less
                    frequently the diminished fifth and the augmented fifth, which are the other two
                    harmonics in question. It must be observed, that if a horn in C, of eight feet
                    tube, performs the above notes, the real sound of each is an octave lower than
                    the notation indicates. Of late years it has been attempted to remedy the
                    imperfections of the horn, and to render it capable of playing in a variety of
                    different keys without difficulty. This was so far done in Italy in 1822, by
                    means of eight finger-keys, and a sliding tube to regulate the pitch; but this
                    improvement has not been generally adopted. Some German instrument-makers have
                    also contrived stops, to be pressed down by the fingers, which are said to
                    answer much better than keys. They have also applied these stops to trumpets and
                    trombones. This has also been done in England. We shall consider only the common
                    horns, as they are still used in some orchestras. The method generally adopted
                    to alter the pitch of a horn, is to shorten or lengthen its tube by means of
                    moveable bent tubes called <hi rend="italic">crooks.</hi> In some few cases,
                    horns of different sizes are used instead. Thus there are horns in C, in D, in E
                    flat, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827217" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7217-0616"/> in E,
                    in F, in G, in A flat, in A, in B flat, and even in C above. There are two B
                    flat horns, the one an octave lower than the other. The lowest B flat horn goes
                    a tone lower than the lowest C of the C horn. In writing for the horn, it is
                    necessary to mark, st the beginning of its Part, for what key it is intended, as
                    in the following examples. The Italian word <hi rend="italic">corni</hi> (horns)
                    is generally used in partitions.</p>
                <p>In general, in writing for an orchestra, there are two horn Parts, the first of
                    which does not (by <hi rend="italic">notation)</hi> go lower than the lowest C
                    in the treble notation, and the second one not higher than E in the fourth space
                    of treble clef. The compass is generally limited to the following sounds,</p>
                <p>But in solo Parts for the horn, the compass is as follows, a number of the
                    semitones being produced by a dexterous use of the hand within the bell of the
                    instrument.</p>
                <p>The notes marked + may be used in passages of some quickness, but should never be
                    sustained. The sounds of the middle part of this compass, or at least from G on
                    second line of treble clef to G above the fifth line, are the best. In modern
                    orchestra music, the proper use of the horns is too often lost sight of. They
                    are either too much employed, or used in passages quite unsuitable to their
                    character and powers. Their best effect lies in sustained sounds, not in rapid
                    passages. They should be used to enrich the harmony in proper places, or to
                    sustain a principal melody, or to produce contrast by their solos judiciously
                    introduced. By using at once three or four horns tuned to different keys, a
                    number of rich and beautiful harmonic effects have been produced by modern
                    composers. As the sounds of the middle compass of the horn are the best,
                    judicious composers for that reason often make use of horns in a key different
                    from that of the piece of music in which these take part. Sometimes, but rarely,
                    we find horn Parts written in the bass clef, as more truly representing the
                    compass of the instrument; but it is better to avoid difficulty in reading such
                    notation, by conforming to the usual practice of writing horn Parts in the
                    treble clef. Skilful horn players expend but little breath on their instrument,
                    and thus produce its finest tone. Others not only exhaust themselves by strong
                    blowing, but produce a harsh tone, and fill the tube with water from their
                    condensed breath. This water contributes to spoil the quality of the tone, and
                    to break it into gurgling sounds.</p>
                <p>Trumpets in the keys of C, D, and Eb are those most commonly used; but there are
                    also trumpets in A, Bb, E, F, and G. It must be observed, that in some of these,
                    F and G, for example, the gravest sounds are very difficult to produce. Some
                    very skilful performers execute all sorts of passages on the trumpet; but, in
                    writing for an orchestra, we ought not to go beyond rapid passages of double or
                    triple tongueing upon a reiterated sound, or certain arpeggio passages. The
                    trumpet may be either played softly, like the horn, or loudly with tongued
                    passages, as in military music. To perfect the trumpet, finger-keys have been
                    applied to it by some makers, and a sliding tube by others. Whatever the key of
                    the music, the trumpet Part is written in C. The pitch of the trumpet is an
                    octave higher than that of the horn. Its natural scale is</p>
                <p>The notes marked +, like those of the horn, do not correspond with the diatonic
                    series, and should not be used in sostenuto passages. The best notes are from up
                    to and those higher had better be avoided.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827230" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7230-0617"/>
                <p>Trumpets, as we∏ as horns, may be muted by introducing a pasteboard tube into the
                    bell of the instrument. The sound then becomes extremely feeble, and the pitch
                    is lowered a semitone. By using two trumpets in different keys (as in the case
                    of horns), a number of harmonic combinations in minor keys may be introduced
                    which could not otherwise be effected; also by combining together two or more
                    horns in one key, with two or more trumpets in another. The penetrating and
                    warlike sound of the trumpet renders it very effective in pieces of military
                    music, and in music expressive of heroic or exulting feelings.</p>
                <p>The trombone is a most powerful and effective instrument, but very difficult to
                    manage correctly. In Italy the bass-trombone only is used; but in France,
                    Germany, and England, there are three kinds of trombones, the bass, the tenor,
                    and the counter-tenor. There is also a <hi rend="italic">double-bass
                    trombone,</hi> which goes a fifth lower than the common basstrombone, but is not
                    much used. The treble trombone is very rarely used; and it is better to add to
                    the three former another counter-tenor trombone when four trombones are to be
                    employed, than to add a treble one. In the performance of solemn, religious, or
                    warlike music, the combination of three or four trombones produces a great
                    effect; for instance, in the statue scene in Mozart’s <hi rend="italic">Don
                    Giovanni,</hi> where the supernatural voice is accompanied by three trombones,
                    two bassoons, two clarinets, and two oboes. The effect of the chant so
                    accompanied is terrific. Mozart borrowed the idea from that passage in Gluck’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Alceste,</hi> where the voice of the oracle of Apollo is heard
                    in the temple.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scales of Bass, Tenor, and Countertenor Trombones.</hi></p>
                <p>Parts for trombones are written in the above clefs; and, as in the case of
                    bassoon Parts, the key is marked at the beginning, or accidental sharps or flats
                    introduced when required. It is to be noticed, that there are trombones in
                    different keys, for different purposes: in F, C, G. Sustained sounds are most
                    suitable to the trombone, especially in orchestral combinations. A very few
                    players are so skilful as to be able to execute very difficult solos on the
                    trombone; such as Schmidt, who performed on it in London in 1829. The trombone
                    can be <hi rend="italic">muted,</hi> like the horn or the trumpet, and then its
                    effect in funereal music becomes very striking. Chromatic passages ought, in
                    general, to be avoided on this instrument.</p>
                <p>Kettle-drums, called <hi rend="italic">Timpani</hi> in Italian, are tuned to
                    various keys, as occasion requires. They are generally in pairs; one of them
                    sounding the key-note of the music, and the other the 4th below, as</p>
                <p>The Part for them is always written in the key of C, whether the key of the music
                    be C or not; but if it be another key, this is marked at the beginning, as</p>

                <p>posed to introduce into orchestras three drums tuned to different sounds; and
                    perhaps there might often be advantage in this. *We have seen a vocal and
                    orchestral composition for forty voices and forty-two instruments, in which
                    eight kettle-drums were employed. They were to be played by four persons, and
                    were tuned thus: from G upwards, A flat; A, B flat; C, D flat; D, E flat.</p>

                <p>The Chinese pavilion, the triangle, the common drum, and cymbals, are almost
                    entirely confined to military music, though they are sometimes used in
                    theatrical orchestras. In Mozart’s <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>To point out all the difficulties of the wind-instruments above mentioned, and
                    all the particular passages that should be avoided in writing for them, would
                    occupy a volume. We shall merely notice, that in the flute, oboe, clarinet, and
                    bassoon, the finger-keys of these instruments often render the performance of
                    certain <hi rend="italic">legato</hi> passages impracticable, and that therefore
                    the composer ought to make himself acquainted with all these niceties. If he do
                    not, his music, however excellent in other respects, can never produce the
                    effects that he intended. We have dwelt more at length upon these matters
                    regarding voices and instruments, because they are really of great importance to
                    the musician and the composer, and because they have been hitherto too much
                    neglected in our British treatises upon music. What we have stated in our
                    general view of voices and instruments will preclude the necessity of entering
                    into details regarding most instruments under their alphabetic heads in other
                    articles of this Encyclopaedia.</p>
                <p>The guitar, the harmonica, the harp, the organ, and the piano-forte, are
                    mentioned in Choron’s table; but we have no particular remarks to make upon them
                    in this place. We shall have something to say of the organ and the piano-forte
                    in speaking of accompaniment, in the course of the present article.</p>

                <p>Melody may be considered in relation to a single voice or instrument, or as
                    accompanied by one or more voices or instruments. In the latter case it is
                    called the principal melody. There are many simple and expressive melodies, of
                    such a kind that they will hardly bear any accompaniment without injury to their
                    effect. Too often such melodies are spoiled by the addition of crowded and
                    elaborate accompaniments, having nothing in common with the melody in style or
                    character. This is one of the great mistakes of the modern schools of music,
                    though we have no doubt that a better taste will prevail when more study is
                    bestowed upon melody as the most important part of musical composition. We
                    cannot too often repeat, that harmony ought always to be considered as
                    subordinate to melody, although we are aware that certain great and peculiar
                    effects may be produced by harmony, independent of melody in the true sense of
                    the latter term; for instance, such effects are heard in certain forms of solemn
                    ecclesiastical harmony that contain hardly a vestige of melody. The effects of
                    mere harmony are often very striking when produced by a certain combination of
                    voices, or of instruments, or of both, and in a building sufficiently spacious
                    and suitably constructed, or even in the open air when heard at a certain
                    distance, and especially if they pass over an expanse of still water. In ancient
                    ecclesiastical music, the length of the sounds and the simplicity of the harmony
                    were well calculated to produce a great effect in large cathedral churches. In
                    such places, rapid changes of sounds, and chromatic harmonies, never produce any
                    thing but confusion; and this ought to be kept in view by the young composer. He
                    must calculate the effect that his music will produce in a cathedral or in a
                    theatre, a concert-room or a private room. No one who has not observed the
                    difference of effect produced by the same music in places of different size and
                    construction, can understand how important it is to attend to all this. But we
                    must not encroach here upon'another section of this article.</p>
                <p>The study of melody is by far too much neglected. Harmony has generally in these
                    days usurped its place; and we find ten good harmonists according to rule, for
                    one good melodist. The reason is, that a man without real musical genius may
                    become a very good scholastic harmonist, while a great melodist must be a man of
                    great genius. Handel was in his day <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the most
                    remarkable musicians for <hi rend="italic">general</hi> excellence in both
                    melody and harmony; but he was a man of the highest musical genius, and his
                    profound skill in all the harmony of his time could never altogether check the
                    flow from the spring of melody which existed in his mind. In his oratorios and
                    his operas that spring is never failing. It is a pity that Handel’s operas are
                    now so little known. They contain much beautiful melody, although that is often
                    disfigured (as in his oratorios) by conventional passages of a formal kind,
                    which must, like all other such passages, become quite antiquated after a short
                    time, having no foundation in any thing but temporary fashion of style.</p>
                <p>In the proper order of musical study, melody ought to precede harmony. It is from
                    reversing this order that so many dry unimaginative harmonists have been
                    produced;— men actually rendered incapable of composing good melodies, or of
                    appreciating their beauties when heard. The student ought to have daily before
                    him specimens of the most beautiful and expressive melodies in all styles, and
                    of all nations. It is much to be regretted that there has ι not been published
                    any judicious and comprehensive collection of such melodies. It would be
                    invaluable to the student.</p>
                <p>One of the earliest writers who treated of melody was Salinas, a Spaniard, and
                    blind, but an eminent musician, and professor of music in the university of
                    Salamanca. His work, which is now very rare, was published in Latin in 1577, at
                    Salamanca. The fifth, sixth, and seventh sections of it are devoted to the
                    consideration of the nature of musical, oratorical, and poetical rhythm. There
                    is a great deal of curious and instructive matter in these sections, and he
                    illustrates his text by numerous fragments of melody, some of which are very
                    interesting, being old Moorish, Spanish, or Italian melodies. We have given some
                    of these as curiosities in Plate CCCLXXIII. Salinas says (page 235), “In the
                    three following books (sections) we have to treat of the rhythmical part of
                    music, a part of it not less useful, and even more delightful, than the
                    harmonical part.”</p>
                <p>Another of the earliest writers on melody was G. B. Doni, the Florentine musical
                    amateur and antiquary. Among his published works (3 vols. folio, 1763) we find
                    many sensible remarks upon melody, and some curious notices of the
                    distinguishing characteristics of national melodies (see, in particular, his <hi
                    rend="italic">Trattato della</hi><hi rend="italic">Musica</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Scenica,</hi> vol. ii. of his works). Speaking of the remarkable difference in
                    the pronunciation of Latin by the French, Spaniards, and English, as compared
                    with its pronunciation by the Italians and Greeks, he says, “This difference
                    arises from the diversity of the accents, and the elevations and depressions of
                    sound.”...“We may say that common speech is a kind of outlined melody; and the
                    mode of speaking in the recitation of poems, a kind of shaded melody, half
                    finished; while true melody, called by the Greeks <hi rend="italic">ωδικδν
                    μ'iλoς,</hi> is perfect and finished, and, as it were, completely coloured.” (P.
                    18 of <hi rend="italic">Trattato.)</hi> With regard to setting of words to
                    music, he says, “One of the most important remarks, and one perhaps not attended
                    to by any person at present, is, that the music should not imitate the words,
                    but the whole sentiment of the poetry; for in this consists true musical
                    expression.” He adds, that “Mimics and buffoons adopt the other mode; and, by
                    exaggerated looks, and gestures, and noises, attempt to enforce the words they
                    utter, or to represent the passions they are supposed to feel. (P. 29.)
                    “Melopoeia is the art of composing beautiful melodies, without any reference to
                    counterpoint, which belongs to another part of music.” (P. 35.) As to
                    modulation, he says, “The modems are too scrupulous in wishing to keep always in
                    the same key; a custom perhaps derived from the ecclesiastical chants, but quite
                    unsuitable to varied and scenic melody.” (P. 33.) Chapter xvii. of Doni’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Trattato</hi> contains a number of ideas which Reicha has borrowed
                    and developed in his Treatise on Melody. Doni proposes the use of <hi
                    rend="italic">quinary,</hi> and even</p>
                <p>5 5 7 7</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">septenary</hi> measures, such as -, -, &amp;c., or -, -,
                    &amp;c. Reicha has also proposed the adoption of the quinary measure, and gives
                    a specimen of its use in a national dance-tune of the district of Kochersberg,
                    on the Lower Rhine, in the old province of Alsace. Reicha says, from information
                    sent to him, “The manners and customs of the inhabitants of Kochersberg
                    distinguish them completely from the other people of Alsace. Their dances have a
                    particular and remarkable character, and nothing in common with those of their
                    neighbours. The tunes of these dances have a very decided measure of five times.
                    Tradition, in the country, carries back this music to the remotest antiquity.”
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827269" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7269-0620"/> William
                    Shield, a clever English composer, introduced a movement in this quinary measure
                    into one of his instrumental trios. Two or three other Englishmen, and several
                    Germans, have attempted the same measure; but it has not been generally adopted,
                    though there is no <hi rend="italic">reason</hi> but <hi rend="italic"
                    >custom</hi> and <hi rend="italic">habit</hi> why it should be rejected. Doni
                    says (p. 74 of <hi rend="italic">Trattate),</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> If the
                    septenary measure could be conveniently adopted, it would produce a more
                    remarkable effect upon the ear than any other, and it would suit lachrymose and
                    compassionable subjects. But we let this alone, because it will be no small
                    matter if we bring the quinary measure into use.”</p>
                <p>The following passage from Doni relative to national melodies is interesting, as
                    having been written more than two centuries ago: “Although Italian music seems
                    the most excellent and varied of all, still let us remember that <hi
                    rend="italic">non</hi><hi rend="italic">omnis fert</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >omnia</hi><hi rend="italic">tellus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but that one
                    nation abounds in one thing, another in another thing, according to the
                    different genius of each. Therefore the judicious composer may draw from French
                    airs (which have great variety and lightness in lively subjects), good passages
                    and spirited and pleasing melodies. From the old Spanish airs he may derive many
                    hints regarding melody and rhythm, for grave and majestic subjects; for example,
                    from the Pavana ι and from modern airs, and those borrowed from the Moors, he
                    may also draw beautiful and lively melodies, but more soft and effeminate.
                    Portuguese melodies may afford him very tender and affecting passages; and, for
                    mournful and lugubrious subjects, he may enrich his imagination with Sicilian
                    melodies, although they have little variety; and if he will go farther, he will
                    find in English” (Scottish? Irish? Welsh ?) “and German airs something to
                    imitate in certain bold and military conceptions; there being perceptible in
                    these airs, especially the German, a certain manly and military character,”
                    &amp;c. (P. 131, <hi rend="italic">Trattato.^)</hi> The Spanish ex-jesuit
                    Eximeno, in his work <hi rend="italic">Dell' Origine,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >&amp;c. della Musica,</hi> published in 1774, says, “In Italy national airs are
                    not common, for most of the people have so fine an ear that it is enough for
                    them to hear the opera airs, in order to amuse themselves afterwards by singing
                    them in the streets.” However, he adds, “The country people and villagers have
                    their songs and tunes in a simple style, but in good taste. The roma-nella,
                    which they sing accompanied by the colascione, is full of good taste, and still
                    more so the tamburo of the Trasteverini. The taste for songs reigns chiefly in
                    Venice; and although they are usually composed by professional musicians, the
                    people learn them easily.”</p>
                <p>In Plate CCCLXXIII. we give the tamburo, No. 1, and a beautiful Venetian air from
                    Eximeno, No. 2. The tunes to the Spanish romances Eximeno thinks “monotonous and
                    tiresome,” and believes them to be remnants of Moorish melody, or else ancient
                    sprouts of the Canto Fermo. “The most tasteful popular songs of Spain are the
                    Seguidillas, of which there is an endless variety.” (See Plate CCCLXXIII. No.
                    4.) We have given a few other specimens of curious melody which have not before
                    been pub-ìished in Britain. Among these are (Plate CCCLXX1V.), No. 15, a German
                    melodj' of the year 1425; No. 17, Egyptian air, performed “with all their might”
                    by the musicians of Grand Cairo, when the principal inhabitants, headed by all
                    the sheiks of the town, went to meet Bonaparte on his return from the Syrian
                    expedition. It was dictated by the chief of these musicians to one of
                    Napoleon’s. The performer accompanied it on the instrument called in Arabic <hi
                    rend="italic">al oeouxl.</hi> Hence the English name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >lute,</hi> Spanish <hi rend="italic">laudo,</hi> Italian <hi rend="italic"
                    >liuto,</hi> French <hi rend="italic">luth.</hi> No. 18 is a song and chorus of
                    cannibals. This curiosity was written down by a Russian voyager (Councillor
                    Tilesius) in 1804, and published in the Leipsic <hi rend="italic">Musical
                    Gazette,</hi> No. 17, in 1805. Tilesius passed a night in listening to this
                    music among these savages, in one of the islands of St Christina. He says,
                    “there was something frightful in this melody, which almost drove one to
                    desperation, and seemed to make one hear his own funeral dirge.” He mentions, as
                    a curious circumstance, that the voices of these savages passed, by sliding
                    through very small intervals, from the E to the G of this chorus, or the
                    converse. The savages, several hundreds, men and youths, sung it in unisons, or
                    octaves, and danced at the same time. They marked the measure by clapping their
                    hands, and also by beating drums. Tilesius explains the meaning of this chorus.
                    “The warriors have returned from battle. It is night. One of them perceives a
                    distant fire on the enemy’s island. He asks, <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>
                    Where is the fire ?’ The chorus answers, ‘ Upon Tanhuatah Montanioh, among our
                    enemies! they are roasting our dead and the captives 1 ’ This renders them
                    frantic; they call for fire immediately, and feel a pleasure in being able to
                    use it in reprisal against the dead, and prisoners taken from the enemy, but not
                    without compassion in thinking of the wives, the children, the relatives, who
                    will weep at that moment Finally, they reckon the days from the first to the
                    tenth, indicating the time fixed for feasting upon the victims, and for
                    solemnizing the victory.” An English writer of the last century, when speaking
                    of Scottish music in one of his essays on various subjects, says, “Who was it
                    that threw out those dreadful wild expressions of distraction and melancholy in
                    <hi rend="italic">Lady Culrosds Dream</hi><hi rend="italic">?</hi> an old
                    composition, now, I am afraid, lost; perhaps because it was almost <hi
                    rend="italic">too terrible for the ear.</hi> I’ll venture to swear that David
                    Rizzio was as innocent as any lamb of all such frantic horrors.” The examination
                    of the melodies Nos. 1 to 18 inclusive will suggest matter for reflection. We
                    would point out especially the elegance of No. 2, the expressive character of
                    No. 4, the beauty and absolutely <hi rend="italic">modern modulations</hi> of
                    No. 14 (of fifteenth century), the curious rhythm and changes of measure in No.
                    15, the wild and singular cast of the Egyptian air, Nô. 17, and the hideously
                    lugubrious character of the cannibal chorus, No. 18. Burckhardt, Bowdich, and
                    some others, have published curious specimens of African melodies. We can only
                    refer to these, and to a great variety of national melodies, Russian, Danish,
                    Swedish, Norwegian, Polish, Bohemian, Hungarian, Greek, Spanish, Italian,
                    Sicilian, Welsh, Irish, Scottish, &amp;c. &amp;c. that have appeared from time
                    to time in collections, or detached. Among foreign national airs, we may mention
                    some rescued from obscurity among the mountains of Auvergne, by that admirable
                    English amateur and accomplished composer, the Honourable George Onslow. He has
                    introduced some of these interesting national tunes of Auvergne into his violin
                    quartetts, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Reicha, in his <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Melodie,</hi> is the latest writer upon this subject. Several
                    valuable works upon it by Italian and German writers had preceded Reicha’s
                    treatise. Among these writers may be mentioned Pisa, Sacchi, Ni-chellman,
                    Riepel, Koch, &amp;c. A translation of Reicha’s Treatise on Melody, with some
                    judicious notes and modifications, would -be a useful offering to British
                    students of music. Before we proceed farther, we must advert to what we consider
                    as an error in treatises on melody or harmony. We allude to what are called <hi
                    rend="italic">passing</hi> notes, or <hi rend="italic">unreal</hi> notes, and
                    which are said not to form any <hi rend="italic">real</hi> part of the melody or
                    the harmony. It appears to us very plain that this is a mere fallacy, and that
                    <hi rend="italic">every sound</hi> that is <hi rend="italic">actually heard</hi>
                    in a melody or a harmony is just as <hi rend="italic">real</hi> a sound as any
                    other can be. For example, we take the following melody: <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193827282" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7282-0621"/> And then this one, No.
                    2.</p>
                <p>We shall be told that this No. 2 is only No. 1 varied, or embellished by notes of
                    grace, <hi rend="italic">passing</hi> notes, <hi rend="italic">unreal</hi>
                    notes, that do not belong to the melody. But No. 2 is a melody <hi rend="italic"
                    >per se</hi> as much as No. 1; and supposing No. 1 had never existed, No. 2
                    would still be a real melody, and all its sounds <hi rend="italic">real</hi>
                    sounds. It would startle us were a poet to say, “Such and such words in my poem
                    are not to be taken as <hi rend="italic">real</hi> words, but merely as <hi
                    rend="italic">passing</hi> shadows of words that do not belong to the language,
                    or melody, or harmony, or meaning of my verses.” There can be no doubt that if
                    we pre-establish a certain chord, we may say that any sound that does not form
                    one of the sounds of that chord is not a sound belonging to it. This is easily
                    exemplified.</p>
                <p>But suppose that the notes Fit, Dit, B, C♯, in the above passage were to occur as
                    <hi rend="italic">real</hi> notes in a melody—and might they not do so ?—what
                    then becomes of their <hi rend="italic">unreality</hi><hi rend="italic">?</hi>
                    For instance,</p>
                <p>To avoid all uncertainty of <hi rend="italic">meaning</hi> as to <hi
                    rend="italic">intonation,</hi> we shall take these passages as if performed on
                    the organ or the piano-forte. All that we could rationally say in such cases
                    would be, that the ear <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be pleased by the one harmony
                    as well as by the other, according to circumstances; but that the melody in both
                    cases is a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> melody, and cannot be explained <hi
                    rend="italic">harmonically</hi> in either case by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >generally received system</hi> of the fundamental bass.</p>
                <p>‘Musical rhythm, in its general sense, applies to the symmetrical arrangement of
                    the sounds of a melody.</p>
                <p>Measure is the manner in which these sounds are divided into portions of equal
                    duration, and this division is represented in musical notation by means of bars;
                    the notes, pauses, &amp;c. contained between two bars constituting a
                    measure.</p>
                <p>Times, as they are called, are the subdivisions of a measure into its simpler
                    aliquot parts, binary or ternary, or quaternary or senary, &amp;c. It might be
                    better to use the terms <hi rend="italic">accented</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >unaccented aliquots,</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">strong</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">weak times.</hi> But musical nomenclature requires a thorough
                    reformation. It is the perception of a decided rhythm in the sounds of a measure
                    that has given rise to these terms <hi rend="italic">strong</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">weak times.</hi> Certain modifications of two, or three, or more
                    aliquot parts of a measure, in regard to accentuation, how faint soever this may
                    be, or the regulated succession of sounds of unequal duration, will impress the
                    ear with a particular rhythm, binary or ternary, or quaternary or senary,
                    &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Were all the sounds of the following passage <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> performed
                    with perfect equality of intensity and duration, no strong nor weak times would
                    be perceived; and yet it is divisible into exact measures of different kinds,
                    producing different rhythmical effects, as at (6), (c).</p>
                <p>Sometimes, to produce a particular effect, the accent or emphasis is thrown upon
                    the weak times of the measure.</p>
                <p>It is plain enough that the simplest elementary forms of musical measure are the
                    binary and the ternary, and that the compound forms arise from a duplication, or
                    quadru-plication, &amp;c. of the binary, or a duplication, triplication, &amp;c.
                    of the ternary, or by certain combinations of the binary with the ternary. In
                    the latter case, we have quinary and septenary measures. The last of these is
                    not in use, but the former is occasionally employed. It may be remarked, that
                    although these quinary and septenary measures are generally avoided by
                    composers, yet <hi rend="italic">periods</hi> of melody containing five or seven
                    <hi rend="italic">measures</hi> are of frequent occurrence. In binary and
                    quaternary measures we often meet with triplets which really belong to a measure
                    ternary or senary, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Thus (d) produces on the ear the same effect as (e), <hi rend="superscript">
                    a</hi> ∏d (∕) the same effect as <hi rend="italic">{g)</hi>; so that there would
                    really be no impropriety in writing (e) for <hi rend="italic">(ã),</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">{g)</hi> for (/). Haydn’s beautiful canzonet, <hi rend="italic">0
                    Tuneful Voice,</hi> and the larghetto movement of Beethoven’s charming <hi
                    rend="italic">Adelaida,</hi> are examples of the use of compound ternary
                    measures; while the sign C at the clef, and other circumstances of notation,
                    lead one by the eye to infer that the measures are compound binary ones. But the
                    effect upon the ear, from the predominance of continuous triplets in the ac <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193827295" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7295-0622"/> companiment, is
                    that of compound ternary measure. A curious instance of the intermixture of
                    different measures in melody and harmony occurs in the dance-scene near the end
                    of the first act of Mozart’s <hi rend="italic">Don Juan,</hi> where there are
                    three different orchestras, each playing a different</p>
                <p>3 3 2</p>
                <p>tune, one in -, the other in ð, and the third in -. Inter- 4 8 4</p>
                <p>mixtures of different measures were not uncommon in the works of composers of the
                    fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, but generally produced nothing better than
                    confusion.</p>
                <p>The only modern music that is not divided into measures is simple recitative. It
                    has often been desired by composers of music, that the inflexions, the varying
                    sounds of declaimed language, could be reduced to a musical notation more
                    delicate and accurate than the one in common use. To enable us to express such
                    inflexions, a notation for <hi rend="italic">very minute</hi> intervals, as well
                    as for peculiar accents, would need to be contrived. The attempts to express
                    such declamation are represented by recitatives and <hi rend="italic">arie
                    par-land.</hi> Some of these are remarkably expressive, from their near
                    imitation of the inflexions of the voice in declamatory and impassioned
                    language; among others, those of Gluck and Piccini. Beethoven, among the very
                    few remarks that he has left to us upon recitative, says, “Recitative ought to
                    be declaimed as if it were spoken. It is a discourse sometimes accelerated,
                    sometimes retarded, according to what is required by the impassioned expression
                    of the words. The comma, the semicoon, the colon, the period, the sign of
                    interrogation, and of exclamation, each require a different accent.” “To compose
                    a recitative well, it is useful, previously, to declaim the poetry to one’s
                    self, as an intelligent actor would do. Any composer who has not ability to do
                    this, ought not to be ashamed to have recourse to some one who can aid him.” The
                    best composers of recitatives have carefully studied the declamation of the
                    great actors of their day. The danger lies in imitating false inflexions of the
                    voice, intended to express natural feelings or passions.</p>
                <p>We shall now give a brief statement of some of the chief points in Reicha’s
                    Treatise on Melody, referring the reader to that work for all developments and
                    minutiae. The treatise consists of a hundred and twenty-three quarto pages of
                    letter-press, and seventy-five plates. “Melody is nothing but a succession of
                    sounds; but if these sounds were placed at random, they would form no sense,
                    that is to say, no melody. It is the same as in regard to words not connected by
                    syntax, nor directed by the understanding. The circumstances that connect sounds
                    together so far as to form a musical sense, are, 1. the key; 2. the measure; 3.
                    the different durations of the sounds; 4. the slurs which connect these more
                    closely; 5. the rhythm; 6. the perfect equality of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >timbre</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> 7. the period in which the sense is more
                    developed; all this being guided by feeling and taste. Ideas and periods are
                    separated from each other by points of repose, which are cadences of different
                    kinds. In order to see how all these objects form melodic ideas, and contribute
                    to connect them together, it will not be superfluous to analyze here the
                    following period:</p>
                <p>PERIOD.</p>
                <p>The following are Reicha’s explanations of technical terms, which he uses in his
                    treatise on melody.</p>
                <p>“1. <hi rend="italic">A quarter cadence,</hi> or a point of repose weaker than a
                    half cadence, and which serves to separate one melodic design from another.</p>
                <p>“2. <hi rend="italic">A half cadence,</hi> which separates one member and one
                    rhythm from another, and which ought consequently to be stronger than the
                    preceding cadence.</p>
                <p>“3. <hi rend="italic">A three-quarter cadence,</hi> which is stronger than the
                    half cadence, and weaker than the full cadence, but which terminates a period as
                    well as the latter, the difference between them existing only in the key in
                    which we end. Thus, the first period of an air of two strains which ends on the
                    dominant, would be only a three-quarter cadence, because another period is
                    required in order to return to the tonic.</p>
                <p>“4. <hi rend="italic">Perfect cadence,</hi> which terminates the period in a
                    positive and indubitable manner; but which does not hinder other periods from
                    being added, if this be thought proper.</p>
                <p>“5. <hi rend="italic">Interrupted cadences,</hi> where, instead of the final
                    sound, we fall upon another, or else leap suddenly from the final sound to
                    another sound.</p>
                <p>“6. <hi rend="italic">Melodic design,</hi> a short musical idea separated from
                    another by a quarter cadence. Two or three of these designs may form a member,
                    which last ought to form a half cadence.</p>
                <p>“7. A member of a period is composed of one or of several designs, and ought to
                    make up a rhythm, and form a half cadence.</p>
                <p>“8. <hi rend="italic">A period</hi> may be composed of different designs and of
                    different members. Its cadence is final, or else a three-</p>
                <p>quarter cadence, which may be called a perfect cadence relative to the key.</p>
                <p>“9. <hi rend="italic">Rhythm</hi> is the extent or the symmetrical and
                    comparative number of the melodic members. It may have all the cadences except
                    the quarter cadence Measure divides into equal parts a series of simple times,
                    as, for example, crotchets in common time; and rhythm divides into equal parts,
                    and consequently in a symmetrical manner, a series of measures. Hence we may say
                    with propriety, that measures are simple times of rhythm, as the crotchets and
                    rests are the simple times of a measure.</p>
                <p>“10. <hi rend="italic">The complement</hi> is a little melodic design that fills
                    up the pauses which occur between the members.</p>
                <p>“11. <hi rend="italic">The supposition</hi> is a measure which, in the theory of
                    rhythm, counts as two; 1. as final measure of the first rhythm; and, 2. as
                    initial measure of the following rhythm.</p>
                <p>“12. <hi rend="italic">The echo ic</hi> the repetition of a part of a melodic
                    design, executed by other instruments, and which is not reckoned in the
                    rhythm.</p>
                <p>“13. <hi rend="italic">The coda</hi> is the confirmation of the end of a piece of
                    music. It is also sometimes employed at the end of a period, either at the
                    beginning or in the middle of the melody; but in this case it is short. When it
                    terminates a piece, it ought to increase the animation of the music. It is for
                    this reason that interrupted cadences and the supposition are employed in it,
                    and that it is often executed with an accelerated movement. As to the length of
                    the coda, it depends upon the duration of the piece. When the coda finishes a
                    grand piece, it may be compared to the peroration of an oratorical
                    discourse.”</p>
                <p>Wo pass over Reicha’s explanations of “Le Retard de <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193827308" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7308-0623"/> la Cadence,” and of “Le
                    Conduit,” as these relate merely to arbitrary embellishments introduced just
                    before a final cadence, or between one period and another.</p>
                <p>To please avitiated public taste,most modern performers make an overwhelming use
                    of such <hi rend="italic">embellishments,</hi> as they are called. Among
                    singers, for instance, none would be listened to who did not prepare to conclude
                    every melody, no matter how simple and unsuited to such trappings, with a
                    flourishing cadenza and a long <hi rend="italic">shake.</hi> Pietro Verri very
                    properly abominates all such formal shakes and cadences, and desires all
                    rational melodies to be finished off by a simple appoggiatura. G. Μ. Raymond,
                    writing in 1811 of singers of that time, says: “L’un chante avec les épaules,
                    les bras, les coudes, le corps'tout entier; l’autre pousse des cris et pratique
                    des élans qui prouvent suffisamment ses bonnes intentions; celui-ci se livre à
                    des mouvemens convulsifs qui peignent l’excès du sentiment; celui-là à des
                    efforts semblables à ceux qui accompagnent les nausées, et qui ne remplacent pas
                    mal les mouvemens de l’âme et les accens du coeur,” &amp;c. All this applies too
                    nearly to many of the singers of 1837.</p>
                <p>Among most writers upon music, we find great confusion regarding <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ι</hi> ∕⅛i, <hi rend="italic">caesures, phrases, clauses,
                    sections, times, rhythms.</hi> We think that, in general, Reicha has been more
                    successful in clearing up and simplifying these matters. His 11 3</p>
                <p>-, -, and — cadences come in place of the confusion of cae- 4 2 4 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> sures, phrases, clauses, &amp;c. He shows, by
                    numerous examples, the nature of these melodic cadences, and of the final
                    cadence or period; and also of melodic designs, members of periods, periods,
                    rhythms, &amp;c. A discrepancy occurs in what he says (above cited) regarding;
                    and cadences in melodic <hi rend="italic">designs</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >members;</hi> and we have to object to what he says about <hi rend="italic"
                    >the</hi><hi rend="italic">supposition</hi> (article 11, <hi rend="italic"
                    >supra),</hi> as being a measure that counts as two in the theory of rhythm. In
                    a matter of this kind there are really no <hi rend="italic">suppositions</hi>
                    made by the ear. It hears neither more nor less than what it hears. As to the
                    echo (article 12) “not being reckoned in the rhythm,” we conceive that it ought
                    to be just as much so as any other passage in the melody. Reicha refers to Haydn
                    and Mozart as models of skill in the development of a melodic subject, and we
                    cordially agree with him. He says that a treatise upon melodic modulation is
                    wanted; also one upon the accompaniment of melody. We refer to Plate CCCLXXV.
                    No. 19, for an example of the mixture of different rhythms in a melody of
                    Paésiello. There is an almost inexhaustible store of melodies, in all their
                    forms, in the works of ancient and modern composers. The student who examines
                    these works will find, that the modern melodists have, in general, little to
                    boast of in originality. To give an instance, one of the most popular vocal
                    compositions in England, <hi rend="italic">Oh, Happy Fair,</hi> is framed in its
                    commencement, in melody and harmony, upon a church chant of C. P. E. Bach.</p>
                <p>Harmony has been defined by an eminent French philosopher of our day, “a
                    succession of chords, subjected to certain laws, according to which several
                    different melodies, governed by a common rhythm, and heard together, produce an
                    agreeable effect to the ear.” This definition is, like many other technical
                    ones, unintelligible to every person who has not studied harmony. But we shall
                    make only one objection to it, which is, that very frequently harmony contains
                    little or no melody, properly so called. It must be kept in view that harmony
                    has its own peculiar means of producing effects, independent of melody, or, at
                    least, of any prominent melody. It is more vague in its effects than melody;
                    and, being more complicated, is less generally relished and understood than the
                    latter. A chorus of Handel, or a symphony of Beethoven, requires a trained ear
                    to relish and understand it fully. The progress of both melody and harmony was
                    slow in improvement, as the history of music shows. As the materials of each
                    were increased, like the enrichment of a language, melody and harmony assumed
                    new forms, and became more copious and expressive. To assign limits to what may
                    be called <hi rend="italic">improvements</hi> in melody or harmony is
                    impossible, since the plastic nature of the human ear is such as to be capable
                    of being trained to relish almost any peculiarities in music, as in the sounds
                    and inflexions of language. When we find that, in ancient times, a rude,
                    unmelodious, ecclesiastical chant, and its accompaniment by another voice in
                    consecutive octaves, fifths, and fourths, were considered as the perfection of
                    melody and harmony, it is hard to say what the human ear may or may not be
                    trained to relish. Gerbert, in his work <hi rend="italic">De Cantu el</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Musica</hi><hi rend="italic">Sacra,</hi> gives several specimens
                    of this strange harmony of the fourteenth century. See vol. i. pp. 376, 392,
                    435, 6, 7, 8, and 456, 7.</p>
                <p>But something still more curious than this is given by Franchino Gafforio in the
                    fourteenth chapter of the third book of his work <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proetica</hi><hi rend="italic">Musica,</hi> published at Milan in 1496. Under
                    the head “De Contrapuncto Falso,” he says that it was anciently the custom to
                    sing a counterpoint composed of dissonances; that is to say, of second major and
                    minor, perfect and major fourth, seventh, and ninth; and that such counterpoint
                    was used in the fourth century in solemn vigils, and in certain masses for the
                    dead. He gives the following example of this horrible counterpoint, as having
                    been sung in the cathedral of Milan, from an ancient mass for the dead. He
                    confesses it to be hideously bad. We avoid the alto clef, for the reader’s sake;
                    so the example should be performed an octave lower than it is here written.</p>
                <p>Doubtless the human ear was <hi rend="italic">then</hi> not a different organ
                    from what it is <hi rend="italic">now,</hi> and yet we should consider such
                    harmony as intolerable. But to many persons the noisy confusion of certain
                    modern compositions for orchestras <hi rend="italic">and</hi> voices is
                    delightful; voices yelling and growling, and, in the orchestra, all sorts of
                    heterogeneous instruments mingled together to make a chaos of deafening noises.
                    When we find, in a celebrated German orchestra, musical effects attempted to be
                    produced by cracking of whips, firing of pistols, jingling of post-horse bells,
                    ringing of bells of all sorts and sizes, thrumming on the Russian balalaika,
                    beating<pb break="no" facs="nls:193827321" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7321-0624"/> of
                    drums, and so on, and all this received with rapture by a civilized European
                    audience, we may well be justified in saying that it is hard to tell <hi
                    rend="italic">what</hi> the human ear may or may not be trained to relish in
                    music, or rather in noise. Such music reminds us of the pewter dish, the tongs,
                    the bellows, and the salt-box, used as solo or concerto instruments, according
                    to No. 90 of the Babbler; or of the hog-concert, produced by order of Louis XI.
                    Bayle gives the passage on this subject from Bouchet, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">d’Aquitaine.</hi> A great number of hogs of
                    different ages were confined in a tent covered with velvet. In front of the tent
                    there was an apparatus with keys like an organ. These keys communicated with the
                    hogs in the tent, and were armed with needles, so that when the performer
                    touched the keys, the hogs were pricked by the needles, which “les faisoit crier
                    en tel ordre et consonance, que le Roy, et cculx qui estoient avec luy, y
                    prindrent plaisir.”</p>
                <p>The opinions of theorists on the subject of chords alone, without reference to
                    their successions and modulations, are very much at variance. Some reckon only
                    one single fundamental chord, formed from the first harmonics of a vibrating
                    string, and which chord, they say, contains all the other chords. Other
                    theorists assume two fundamental chords, others seven, others twelve, others
                    thirteen, others seventy, and so on. Another theorist reckons so many as 3600,
                    and among these, 700 dissonant fundamental chords. Besides all this perplexity
                    and contradiction, these theorists give no satisfactory explanation of a
                    multitude of· phenomena belonging to modulation and harmonic combination. We
                    would advise the student to pay very little attention to theories, but a great
                    deal to the works of the best composers. Our space permits us to make only a few
                    occasional remarks upon some received opinions regarding harmony, which seem to
                    us to be erroneous.</p>
                <p>Hitherto, what is called thorough bass has been confounded with figured bass; and
                    both, as if one and the same thing, have been ascribed to L. Viadana as their
                    inventor, in the beginning of the seventeenth century. But it appears that
                    Viadana was not the inventor of figured bass, and that his thorough bass <hi
                    rend="italic">{basso</hi><hi rend="italic">continuo)</hi> has nothing whatever
                    to do with figured bass, or with the doctrine of the progressions of chords.
                    This appears clearly from his Italian work published at Venice in 1603, in five
                    volumes 4to. It contained what he called “a hundred ecclesiastical concertos for
                    one, two, three, and four voices, with the continuous bass <hi rend="italic"
                    >{basso</hi><hi rend="italic">continuo)</hi> to be played on the organ.” He says
                    he invented these pieces in 1597, at Rome, and that his chief reason for
                    composing them was, that there were no pieces of the kind constructed for one,
                    two, or three voices, with organ bass. In these concertos, the organ bass had no
                    pauses, and was therefore called <hi rend="italic">basso</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >continuo,</hi> that is, <hi rend="italic">continuous</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >thorough bass</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but it was not figured. The organist
                    played this bass, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> the voice part, or parts, as they
                    lay before him. G. Sabbatini, a contemporary of Viadana, was the inventor of the
                    <hi rend="italic">figured bass,</hi> as appears from his work published at
                    Venice in 1628, in which all the basses are figured, and in which he claims this
                    invention. But this invention, which might serve well enough in these days for
                    <hi rend="italic">slow</hi> and <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> music, accompanied
                    on the organ according to <hi rend="italic">certain fixed rules,</hi> has been,
                    unfortunately, brought down to our day, when it is worse than useless, although
                    the teaching and practice of it are still persevered in, to the great
                    disadvantage and perplexity of musical students. Besides, different composers
                    and different nations have different ways of figuring their basses, which adds
                    to the confusion and difficulty. This clumsy contrivance should be entirely
                    abandoned by all modern composers, who ought to write down in the common
                    notation, fully and exactly, the accompaniment as they wish it to be
                    performed.</p>
                <p>A chord, as it is called, consists of two, or three, or four, or more sounds,
                    heard at the same time. A primary <hi rend="italic">consonant</hi> chord
                    consists of intervals such as those given in the following examples, No. 1. A,
                    B, and No. 8, <hi rend="italic">a, b.</hi> Examples of primary <hi rend="italic"
                    >dissonant</hi> chords are given at No. 4, <hi rend="italic">a, c.</hi> Other
                    dissonant chords will be afterwards noticed. The tonic or key-note of every
                    scale may be considered as the central point to which, in the course of a
                    melody, or a harmony, the other sounds of the scale converge, or from which they
                    diverge; in the former case producing tonic cadences or reposes, and in the
                    latter, imperfect cadences and inconclusive passages. We have already seen that
                    the sounds of a scale, whether major or minor, may be derived from the harmonic
                    products of three sonorous bodies, representing the tonic, the dominant, and the
                    subdominant. In the scale of C major, for example, the simplest harmony
                    belonging to the tonic, the dominant, and the subdominant, considered as bass
                    sounds, will appear in the three following chords, either as they stand at A, or
                    with a changed position, or inversion, of the two upper sounds in each, as at
                    B.</p>
                <p>These chords, as they stand, cannot form a harmonia succession, on account of the
                    consecutive fifths between them. In harmony, as in melody, the intervals are
                    reckoned from the lower sound upwards. Each of these chords is called a major
                    common chord, and consists of lowest or fundamental sound with its major third
                    and perfect fifth. The change of position at B makes no difference in the name
                    of the chord, but only in its effect. The closest possible position of the
                    intervals, as at A, is called <hi rend="italic">close harmony.</hi> Their
                    altered position at B is called <hi rend="italic">extended</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">dispersed harmony.</hi> By making the thirds of these chords the
                    bass sounds, we obtain the following inversions, called chords of the sixth. The
                    lowest sound of a chord is the bass for the time being.</p>
                <p>Diatonic or chromatic successions of chords of the sixth, with or without the
                    third, are very frequent in harmony. If in each of the preceding common chords
                    we make the fifth the bass, we shall have the following inversions, called
                    chords of the sixth and fourth.</p>
                <p>Most writers on harmony consider the interval of the fourth as a dissonance,
                    while in truth it is a consonance, as is clearly shown by its forming one of the
                    intervals in the perfect common chord, which contains no dissonance of any kind.
                    Besides these three principal chords of the major scale, with their inversions,
                    and which are all <hi rend="italic">consonant,</hi> there is an important <hi
                    rend="italic">dissonant</hi> chord formed by adding the minor seventh to the
                    fifth and third of the dominant. This is named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >dominant</hi> seventh. We subjoin it <hi rend="italic">{a),</hi> and its three
                    inversions <hi rend="italic">{b).</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827334" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7334-0625"/>
                <p>The sounds above the bass, in each of these chords, may be placed in various
                    positions, some of which are shown at (c) and <hi rend="italic">(d).</hi> The
                    first inversion of the chord of the dominant seventh is called the chord of the
                    sixth, fifth, and third; the second inversion, sixth, fourth, and third; and the
                    third inversion, sixth, fourth, and second. In particular circumstances, the
                    second, third, sixth, and seventh sounds of the major scale may each, as a bass,
                    bear a common chord with a minor third. See No. 5 (e), (jf), <hi rend="italic"
                    >(g), (fι),</hi> and the inversions <hi rend="italic">i, k, l, m.</hi> But
                    harmony of this kind is generally confined to ancient music, or imitations of
                    the ancient style.</p>
                <p>The chord at <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> with imperfect fifth, is rarely used in
                    what are called <hi rend="italic">fundamental progressions.</hi></p>
                <p>The chord of the dominant seventh contains two primary dissonances which are the
                    least harsh of any in use, and are therefore the most frequently employed; the
                    interval between the bass sound and its seventh, and the interval between the
                    third of the chord and the seventh; see <hi rend="italic">n, o, p.</hi> This
                    last is an imperfect fifth, and requires a particular <hi rend="italic"
                    >resolution</hi> (as it is called) in the next succeeding chord, unless some
                    chromatic alteration intervene to change the simple progression; see <hi
                    rend="italic">q, r, s, t.</hi> For the most common resolutions of the seventh,
                    see <hi rend="italic">u, v, w.</hi></p>
                <p>A good ear will be displeased by such passages as those at <hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi> and <hi rend="italic">z,</hi> where the resolutions of the seventh and
                    of the imperfect fifth are neglected.</p>
                <p>Such passages are bad, whatever number of Parts there may be besides to fill up
                    the harmony; but they are intolerable when there are only two Parts.</p>
                <p>The three principal common chords of the minor scale are the following, at <hi
                    rend="italic">a, b,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c.</hi></p>
                <p>Those subordinate ones at <hi rend="italic">d, e,f</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >g,</hi> may be occasionally used. The same remark applies to them as to the
                    common chords on the second, third, sixth, and seventh sounds of the major
                    scale. Of course, all the common chords in the minor scale may be inverted in
                    the same manner as those in the major scale, thereby producing so many chords of
                    sixth and third, and of sixth and fourth. The positions of their intervals above
                    the bass may also be varied in the same manner as formerly shown.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, and especially in ancient harmony, we find a chord of the seventh
                    occurring on every sound of the scale, in what are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >sequences</hi> or <hi rend="italic">chains</hi> of sevenths, in which the
                    progressions of the bass sounds are by ascending fourths or descending fifths.
                    These dry and formal passages, and their inversions, are now rare. There are
                    some other kinds of sequences still in use; such as the fifth and sixth on each
                    bass sound of a diatonic ascending series, or the seventh and sixth on each bass
                    sound of a descending diatonic series.</p>
                <p>Besides these dissonant chords, there are many other dissonant ones, such as the
                    chord of ninth and seventh, or ninth only; the chord of fourth and fifth; and so
                    on.</p>
                <p>It is evident that every common chord, or either of its inversions, consists of
                    three distinct sounds only; so that in composing for four voices, for example, a
                    gap would occur in the harmony whenever a common chord, or one of its
                    inversions, had to be employed, unless one of these three sounds should be
                    doubled in the unison or octave. This doubling accordingly takes place when
                    there are more than three Parts in the harmony. Which of these sounds <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193827347" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7347-0626"/> it is best to
                    double, depends entirely upon the nature of the melodic and harmonic succession
                    of sounds in this or that particular passage, and cannot be rightly learned but
                    by a careful study of the best compositions in four, five, six, and more Parts.
                    The chord of the seventh, again, or any of its inversions, consists of four
                    distinct sounds, and therefore requires no doubling of any of its sounds in
                    writing for four Parts. In other cases where the Parts are more than four, the
                    doubling of any of the sounds (except the third, or the seventh of the primary
                    chord) must be regulated by the circumstances of the case. The third and the
                    seventh of the dominant chord of seventh do not bear to be doubled, because the
                    progression of each of these sounds follows a certain course in <hi
                    rend="italic">resolution</hi> by the third rising a semitone and the seventh
                    falling a semitone, or a tone, into the next succeeding chord, unless in the
                    case of some chromatic alteration which interferes with the simpler progressions
                    of these two sounds. In writing for three or for two Parts, it becomes necessary
                    to omit one or two of the sounds belonging to the chord of seventh, or any of
                    its inversions. Whether the third or the fifth of the primary chord should be
                    retained along with the seventh, depends upon die effect intended to be
                    produced. In the former case the effect will be more piquant, in the latter more
                    soft and undecided. Again, in writing for two Parts, suppose a duett for two
                    voices, it is necessary to use only two of the sounds of a common chord, or two
                    of the sounds of a chord of seventh. In the former case none of the sounds ought
                    to be doubled, except at the beginning, or at a close, or in preparing a
                    cadence, when the unison or octave of the lowest sound of the primary chord, or
                    of its fifth, may be used. In the other case (chord of seventh) there is a
                    choice among the intervals of primary sound and seventh, third and seventh, or
                    fifth and seventh, or the inversions of these. The effect intended must guide
                    the choice. In these cases none of the sounds should be doubled in unison or
                    octave.</p>
                <p>What are called the <hi rend="italic">preparation, the percussion,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">resolution</hi> of dissonances, may be made sufficiently clear
                    by the following examples of Padre Martini.</p>
                <p>At No. 12, (a), the seventh is <hi rend="italic">prepared</hi> by the previous
                    consonance of sixth, and is <hi rend="italic">resolved</hi> upon the consonance
                    of third. At (δ) the ninth is prepared by the previous consonance of tenth, and
                    is resolved upon the consonance of fifth. At (c) the sevenths are both prepared
                    by previous fifths, and resolved by the consonances of fifth in the first case,
                    and third in the second case. At (c?) the second is prepared by third, and at
                    (e) by sixth, in the preceding chord.</p>
                <p>At No. 13, <hi rend="italic">(p),</hi> the ninth and eleventh are <hi
                    rend="italic">prepared</hi> by previous tenth and twelfth, and are <hi
                    rend="italic">resolved</hi> into eighth and tenth. At (Ä) the ninth and seventh
                    are prepared by previous tenth and eighth, and are resolved into eighth and
                    sixth. As to what is called the <hi rend="italic">percussion,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">striking</hi> of the dissonance, it means simply the actual
                    occurrence of the latter. The dissonance of the dominant seventh has no need of
                    preparation; and the diminished seventh, the ninth, and the diminished ninth,
                    are often struck unpre pared. The chord of the ninth, and of the di minished
                    ninth, are susceptible of three inver sions. These, with their resolutions, are
                    as follows:</p>
                <p>In the chord of the ninth, and in its inversions, the sound forming the fifth in
                    the direct chord is generally omitted. The ninth itself is not inverted,
                    and.care must be taken to keep the ninth in its proper interval above the lowest
                    sound of the direct chord, so as to form a ninth or higher octave of ninth above
                    that sound. The following infractions of this rule produce in general a bad
                    effect, especially when prolonged.</p>
                <p>The ninth may be used in the following manner, without any preparation:</p>
                <p>In Haydn’s beautiful canzonet, <hi rend="italic">Fidelity,</hi> there are
                    examples of the use of the major seventh, the ninth, and the diminished ninth,
                    all without preparation. In the same canzonet we find the augmented octave and
                    augmented fifth employed very elegantly. His tenth canzonet shows a very
                    effective use of the diminished seventh, at the word “grief ;’’ and also, at the
                    same passage, the skilful introduction of an interrupted cadence. In the second
                    section of the first movement of Mozart’s third quintett in G minor there are
                    many diminished ninths, and ninths and sevenths, introduced very boldly without
                    any preparation. In Italy, about 1580, Monteverde began to introduce <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">wλ-</hi><hi rend="italic">prepared</hi> sevenths and ninths;
                    but it would appear, from the following very curious passage, that Jean Mouton,
                    a Frenchman, had used these <hi rend="italic">unprepared</hi> dissonances long
                    before. J. Mouton was born in 1461.</p>

                <p>It is worth while to remark, that, in dissonant chords, the dissonance often
                    leaves its place and passes to some other sound of the chord, without being
                    resolved in the way it would have been had it continued to keep its place. For
                    example:</p>
                <p>Passages of this kind often puzzle the student, as seeming to contradict the
                    rules given for the resolution of dissonances.</p>
                <p>In a series of chords, the progression from one to another may take place by
                    similar motion, oblique motion, or contrary motion. The latter is the most
                    frequent and the most useful, as it gives greater variety to the harmony, and
                    enables us to avoid displeasing consecutions of octaves and fifths.</p>
                <p>In similar motion, the Parts move together by conjunct or disjunct degrees,
                    ascending or descending.</p>
                <p>In oblique motion, one of the Parts remains on the same degree, while the other
                    moves upwards or downwards.</p>
                <p>In contrary motion, the Parts move in opposite directions; the one ascending, the
                    other descending.</p>
                <p>An examination of all the possible successions of chords, consonant and
                    dissonant, direct or inverted, diatonic or chromatic, is beyond our limits and
                    our purpose. These successions must be learned from an extensive perusal of the
                    best compositions. We must confine ourselves to a few examples and a few general
                    remarks. First, with regard to common chords in succession, two or more of them
                    are not allowed to succeed each other diatonically, or by leaps in similar
                    progression, or what is called similar <hi rend="italic">motion</hi> ascending
                    or descending.</p>
                <p>The bad effect of such progressions is much more striking in compositions for
                    voices, or for different instruments, than it is upon such an instrument as the
                    piano-forte, on which the progressions of the different parts are not so
                    distinctly perceived by the ear, owing to the quality of tone or <hi
                    rend="italic">timbre</hi> of each sound being of the same kind. It ought to be
                    remarked, that this last circumstance is too much neglected in writing for the
                    organ or the piano-forte, and that in consequence many particular passages of
                    harmony written for one of these instruments produce little or no effect, or
                    even a bad effect, while the same passages, if performed by different voices or
                    different instruments, would be good and effective. In the above successions of
                    common chords (No. 20) there are consecutive fifths and octaves, both of which,
                    and especially the former, are prohibited in all cases where <hi rend="italic"
                    >the ear perceives them</hi> and is displeased by them. There is no other
                    rational rule against their use. With regard to consecutive unisons or octaves,
                    daily experience proves that they are not in themselves displeasing when they
                    are employed in the reinforcing of some particular melody or passage of melody.
                    Were this not so, there would be no such thing in choruses or in orchestras as
                    ten, or twenty, or more voices or instruments, performing the same melody in
                    unison or in octaves. Haydn said that one of the most overpowering effects he
                    ever experienced from music, was when he heard the singing of the subjoined
                    melody in unison by a vast number of trained children in St Paul’s Cathedral at
                    London.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827373" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7373-0628"/>
                <p>In a composition for two, or three, or four voices or instruments, where the
                    intention is to interest by means of harmony, the <hi rend="italic">casual</hi>
                    occurrence of consecutive octaves is felt unpleasingly from the poorness of
                    their effect, from the deficiency of that richness of harmonic combination
                    generally expected in such compositions; but still only a <hi rend="italic"
                    >musical</hi> and <hi rend="italic">trained</hi> ear would perceive this poverty
                    of effect, and be displeased by it. The fewer the number of Parts, down to the
                    duett, the more perceptible would this poverty be. The bad effect of consecutive
                    fifths also rests upon the ground of poverty and want of variety. Some modern
                    theorists assert that the <hi rend="italic">reason</hi> why two or more
                    consecutive fifths produce a bad effect, is, that the ear supplies the major
                    third of the lower sound of each fifth, and thereby perceives a succession of
                    major common chords forming so many disjoined tonic chords, which give an
                    impression of a series of different keys unrelated to each other. This
                    hypothesis is erroneous, because the car does really supply no such thirds, nor
                    any other sounds. The ear, in harmony as well as in melody, supplies nothing
                    beyond what it actually hears. It has to do with nothing but its own actual
                    sensations. The <hi rend="italic">imagination</hi> may supply or suggest what it
                    pleases; but that is quite a different matter. Cherubini says of consecutive
                    fifths, that “a succession of them forms a discordance, because the upper part
                    moves in one key, while the lower part moves in another. For example, if to the
                    scale of C major we add an upper Part moving in perfect fifths with the former,
                    it will result from this, that one Part will be in C, while the other will be in
                    G. It is from this double concurrence of key that the discordance arises, and
                    consequently the prohibition to employ several fifths in succession.” The best
                    way to avoid the effect of consecutive fifths and octaves, is to employ contrary
                    motion of the Parts. The second examples (No. 22) should never be used in music
                    for two Parts only, or between two extreme Parts of a harmony, though they may
                    be used in two middle Parts between the bass and the highest Part where the
                    harmony is full.</p>
                <p>We have seen that the three principal common chords of a scale are those of the
                    tonic, the dominant, and the subdominant; and that the principal dissonant chord
                    is the chord of the dominant seventh. We shall first examine these common chords
                    in their simple diatonic successions, direct and inverted; and afterwards as
                    undergoing certain chromatic changes, and other modifications. The letter T will
                    stand for tonic chord, D for dominant chord, and S for subdominant chord.</p>
                <p>At <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi> we have three progressions from T to D producing three imperfect
                    cadences (see preceding section, <hi rend="italic">Melody)</hi> of harmony and
                    melody together. At <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> e, and∕, we have three other
                    progressions from T to S, producing also imperfect cadences, but not so
                    decidedly imperfect as those at <hi rend="italic">a, b,</hi> and c. Indeed these
                    last might, not improperly, be called <hi rend="italic">reversed</hi> cadences.
                    At <hi rend="italic">g, h, i,</hi> we have three progressions the reverse of a,
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> and c, and forming
                    tonic cadences more or less complete. At <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> the cadence
                    is complete, from the third of dominant rising semitonically, in the upper Part,
                    to the tonic itself. The cadence at <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is less complete,
                    from the fifth of dominant descending to tonic by a whole tone in the upper
                    part; and at <hi rend="italic">i</hi> the cadence is still less conclusive by
                    the fifth of dominant rising by a whole tone to the third of dominant. At <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> and <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> if the dissonance of seventh
                    were added to the dominant, the determination of the complete cadence from D to
                    T would be more striking.</p>
                <p>A perfect cadence from the chord of the dominant seventh may be <hi rend="italic"
                    >interrupted</hi> in various ways. The following are examples.</p>
                <p>The successions at <hi rend="italic">k</hi> and <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> No. 23,
                    may be considered as imperfect cadences, although in some cases, in
                    ecclesiastical harmony, the cadence from the chord of the S to the chord of the
                    T is used as a final cadence. The succession at <hi rend="italic">l</hi> is an
                    imperfect cadence, the most imperfect that occurs in the scale, if we except <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> and <hi rend="italic">o.</hi></p>
                <p>The succession at <hi rend="italic">n</hi> from S to D is used in ancient and
                    modern music; but the contrary succession at <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> from D to
                    S, is very rarely attempted, on account of its harshness and striking
                    discontinuity. No satisfactory reason has been assigned (theoretically) for the
                    avoidance of such successions; nor why the progressions of common chords
                    (properly managed) between the tonic and its second, ascending or descending by
                    conjoint degrees, or between the dominant and the sixth of the scale, ascending
                    or descending by conjoint degrees, should be frequently used with no displeasing
                    effect And, again, <hi rend="italic">what fundamental bass</hi> can be assigned,
                    according to received theories, to such successions as chords of sixth and third
                    ascending or descending by conjunct degrees? Not to speak of many <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193827386" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7386-0629"/> more successions in harmony
                    and in melody, quite inexplicable by the system of fundamental basses, commonly
                    received as the true one. It may be remarked, that singers, in attempting to
                    sing the ascending major scale, always find great difficulty at first in
                    executing, in tune, the series of sounds from the fourth upwards to the
                    seventh.</p>
                <p>This is a practical fact, not ex plained by any theory. If you give the learner
                    (with a good ear) three of the ancient conjunct Greek tetrachords to sing in
                    ascending, there is no difficulty in the intonation.</p>
                <p>The ancient Greeks seem to have known more about fragmentary scales than our
                    modern theorists do.</p>
                <p>The partial inversions of the preceding successions of common chords are as
                    follows:</p>
                <p>At <hi rend="italic">b</hi> the progression <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be but
                    such a passage is harsh in its effect, from the more natural progression of the
                    third of the dominant being by a semitone ascending, instead of by a leap.
                    Another harsh progression <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be (according to some
                    composers) in troduced at <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> But such progressions ought
                    in general to be avoided, though they sometimes occur in the free style of
                    modern music; not, however, in the works of the best masters. It may be here
                    remarked, that although the perfect fourth is a consonance, as we have said
                    before, still, when it occurs between the bass and an upper Part, it requires a
                    certain management. This is the reason why it has been erroneously called a <hi
                    rend="italic">dissonance.</hi> It would require a great many examples to show in
                    what manner the perfect fourth should be treated when it occurs between the bass
                    and an upper Part. We shall merely remark, that, except in such successions
                    as</p>
                <p>&amp;c.</p>
                <p>the fourth must, in general, descend by a semitone, or a tone, to the third of
                    the same bass sound; or, if the bass moves upwards or downwards to the following
                    chord by a tone or a semitone, the sound forming the original fourth must either
                    be continued in that following chord, or must descend a semitone or a whole
                    tone. Such are the technicalities regarding the treatment of the fourth in
                    harmony. The quantity of printed disputation regarding the nature, &amp;c. of
                    the fourth is most unreasonable.</p>
                <p>A great deal of the variety and <hi rend="italic">colouring,</hi> as it is
                    called, of the free style of modern music depends upon the use of chromatic
                    changes of the intervals of the simple common chords, and their inversions. To
                    make the nature of this more clear, we shall again have recourse, in the first
                    place, to the same successions of common chords that we have already given, and
                    show how their forms and effects can be altered by means of these chromatic
                    changes. Of course, it is not upon every occasion that these chromatic changes
                    are to be used. Some clever composers of the more modern schools indulge in
                    these chromatic alterations to such excess that many of their compositions are
                    little better than continuous lamentation, or caterwauling. By such abuses, the
                    manly simplicity, energy, and dignity of certain styles of music are entirely
                    destroyed. The whole practical principle of these chromatic changes is the
                    division of a tone into two smaller intervals, ascending or descending. We do
                    not say “into two <hi rend="italic">semitones?</hi> because that is not really
                    the case in correct intonation of such passages. In a succession of chords such
                    as we have given, one at least of the Parts may rise or fall by a tone to one of
                    the Parts of the next succeeding chord. It is therefore obvious that an
                    ascending or descending tone <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be divided into two
                    smaller intervals; and this is done by the chromatic alteration,—sharp in
                    ascending, and flat in descending, as shown in Plate CCCLXXVI. Nos. 20 to 27
                    inclusive. We give these merely to show how the thing may be done. <hi
                    rend="italic">When</hi> such chromatic alterations may be introduced with good
                    effect, is to be studied in the compositions of Haydn, Mozart, Clementi,
                    Beethoven, and some others. All our examples of mere chords are to be considered
                    by the student as no more than some of the dry and detached bones of a skeleton
                    of harmony. He will find them all knitted together in their proper places, and
                    clothed in living beauty of form and substance in the works of the best
                    composers. It is <hi rend="italic">there</hi> that he must seek for their use,
                    and not in theories.</p>
                <p>False relations must be avoided in melody as well as in harmony. When a sound
                    passes to its diminished or augmented octave, above or below, there is a false
                    relation in melody; as,</p>
                <p>In harmony, such octaves struck together, and <hi rend="italic">prolonged for
                    some time,</hi> would be intolerable. Such passages as the following contain
                    false relations.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827399" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7399-0630"/>
                <p>In these passages, the chromatic alteration is not made in the same Part; hence
                    arise the false relations, and their harsh effect. These examples, when
                    corrected, will stand as follows :—</p>
                <p>Such passages as the following, where dissonances occur along with the chromatic
                    alteration, are not objectionable.</p>
                <p>Such as the following are permitted.</p>
                <p>Dr Burney, in criticising some of Purcell’s harmonic combinations, blames him
                    severely for using the be and ¢3 and says that this chord is “<hi rend="italic"
                    >detestable,”</hi> and is “jargon at all times and in all places.” It so happens
                    that this same <hi rend="italic">detestable</hi> chord is very frequently used
                    in modern music; and, if Dr Burney had looked into the works of Emanuel Bach and
                    Haydn, of which he speaks with unmingled commendation, he would there have found
                    many instances of the elegant and effective use of the chord of t∣6 and ¢3; also
                    in Mozart’s works, both vocal and instrumental. Another chord that Dr Burney
                    finds great fault with in Purcell, is the chord of but this chord is found in
                    the works of the best modern composers. Among chromatic chords we shall notice
                    only two more, of considerable importance, which frequently occur in harmony.
                    They are the chord of the diminished seventh, and the chord of the augmented
                    sixth.</p>
                <p>These chords occur more frequently in minor scales than in major ones; and when
                    they do appear in the latter, the notation is generally wrong. For example,</p>
                <p>The effect of the diminished seventh is mournful and pathetic. Among other
                    instances, see “He was despised,” in Handel s <hi rend="italic">Messiah,</hi> at
                    the words “a man of sorrows.” Sometimes we meet with a series of three or four
                    chords of diminished seventh, or their inversions, in which all the Parts ascend
                    or descend together by semitones. With regard to the chord of the augmented
                    sixth, it is called the Italian sixth when it consists of the the French sixth
                    when it consists of</p>
                <p>. Of these, the Italian sixth is the most simple and elegant, and the German
                    sixth the most powerful in its effect. The French sixth is harsh and poor. In
                    writing for four Parts, the third of the Italian sixth is doubled:</p>
                <p>The third and fifth of the German sixth</p>
                <p>L r*</p>
                <p>are usually prolonged in the form of <hi rend="superscript"> υ</hi> J upon the
                    next bass sound; but there are some exceptions to this practice. These augmented
                    sixths are rarely inverted; but some instances are to be found in good
                    composition. In the chord of the diminished seventh, it depends upon the
                    position of the upper Parts, whether or not we may double</p>
                <p>German sixth when it consists of and its third. When in this position we
                    cannot<pb break="no" facs="nls:193827412" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7412-0631"/>; but we
                    may in the following position, where the diminished seventh occurs in a middle
                    Part, and below the third</p>
                <p>We have a few remarks to make upon what are called enharmonic changes of
                    modulation, made by means of the chord of the diminished seventh, or of the
                    chord of the German augmented sixth, or inversions of these. What is termed <hi
                    rend="italic">enharmonie,</hi> is really neither more nor less, in practice,
                    than a change of signs in notation; which change, being merely addressed to the
                    eye in all such pretended enharmonic transitions, leaves the sounds exactly as
                    they were before upon all our imperfectly-tuned instruments, such as the organ
                    and pianoforte. For example, we strike the following chord on a piano-forte</p>
                <p>If we choose to alter the signs of this chord, and to write or or all this makes
                    no change whatever in the sounds heard on the piano-forte. The very same sounds
                    are produced, because the very same finger-keys are struck.</p>
                <p>In the case of the German augmented sixth we might change the notation into but
                    the sounds would remain the same on the piano-forte; so that the real
                    differences between the sounds represented by these different modes of notation,
                    cannot be made by such an instrument as the piano-forte, and therefore all
                    pretended enharmonic changes and modulations upon it are mere delusions and
                    non-existences. Again, to take a very plain case: Suppose that we were playing
                    on the piano-forte a passage written in Eb, and that we chose to change the
                    notation suddenly to D♯, where would be the enharmonic <hi rend="italic"
                    >modulation</hi> in such a case?</p>
                <p>There is not the slightest difference of effect A <hi rend="italic">real</hi>
                    enharmonic change in such a passage, if effected by voices or instruments in
                    perfect intonation, would produce a very perceptible difference of pitch, and no
                    agreeable result.</p>
                <p>In passing from ope chord to another, one or more of the parts of the first chord
                    will (in compact harmony) ascend or descend by a tone, or a smaller interval, to
                    one or more of the parts of the next chord that follows. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >prolongation</hi> of one or more of these ascending or descending parts of the
                    first chord, after one or more of the parts of the second chord has been
                    introduced, gives rise to a variety of dissonances termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >suspensions,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">syncopations,</hi> and so on. These may
                    be single, or double, or triple, or even quadruple. In order to make the nature
                    of this part of our subject intelligible, but without entering into many
                    details, we shall again have recourse to the successions of common chords
                    already given in this section, and also to the chords of seventh, and of
                    diminished seventh, and of diminished ninth.</p>
                <p>At 1 we have a single suspension, that of the fourth; and at 2, a double
                    suspension of sixth and fourth. These are two of the cases formerly alluded to,
                    in which the perfect fourth, though a consonance, is treated as if it were a
                    dissonance when it occurs between the bass and an upper Part. At 3 occurs a
                    single suspension, a major seventh ascending a semitone to its resolution in the
                    octave; at 4, a single suspension of ninth resolving <hi rend="italic"
                    >downwards,</hi> as the ninth almost always does, by descending a tone or a
                    smaller interval, according to the nature of the passage in which it occurs; at
                    5, a double suspension of ninth and major seventh, in which the ninth is
                    resolved by ascending a tone, and the seventh by ascending a semitone; at 6, a
                    double suspension of ninth and fourth; at 7, a triple suspension of ninth, b
                    sixth, and fourth; at 8, a quadruple suspension of ninth, seventh, sixth, and
                    fourth. Such combinations of dissonances as this last are not frequent; but they
                    sometimes occur in the best instrumental compositions. This <hi rend="italic"
                    >legato</hi> and <hi rend="italic">syncopated</hi> style belongs more to the old
                    schools of composition than to the modern. The effect of such passages is good
                    on the organ as an accompanying instrument, or as a principal instrument, on
                    account of its powers of producing the <hi rend="italic">sostenuto</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">legato</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but is almost null on such
                    an instrument as the piano-forte, from its deficiency in these powers of <hi
                    rend="italic">sostenuto</hi> and <hi rend="italic">legato.</hi> Voices and
                    wind-instruments produce great effects in this style of music. It is not so
                    effective in music for stringed instruments. Besides a great variety of
                    suspensions that may take place in an upper Part, there are many that may occur
                    in the bass when its progression is by conjunct degrees ascending or descending.
                    Of the following examples, 1 and 2 are the best, though 3 and 4 are from
                    Beethoven. These last may be used in cases where the combinations of different
                    voices or instruments are suitably arranged, or in the course of a rapid
                    movement.</p>

                <p>The nature of what are called <hi rend="italic">anticipations</hi> (the converse
                    of <hi rend="italic">suspensions</hi> or <hi rend="italic">retardations)</hi>
                    will be understood from the following examples.</p>
                <p>At 1 the anticipations are in the upper part; at 2 they are in the bass.
                    Anticipations such as those at 3 are frequent in music of the time of Handel,
                    and before then.</p>
                <p>We give a few examples of what are called <hi rend="italic">passing</hi> notes,
                    <hi rend="italic">changing</hi> notes, <hi rend="italic">transient</hi> notes,
                    &amp;c. which (as well as suspensions and anticipations), are said by theorists
                    to be <hi rend="italic">unessential</hi> or <hi rend="italic">accidental</hi>
                    notes.</p>
                <p>These so called <hi rend="italic">passing</hi> notes are marked with a small
                    zero. It is needless to multiply examples here, and we shall only refer to one
                    remarkable instance of the use of <hi rend="italic">passing notes,</hi> which
                    occurs at the beginning of the first movement of the first quartett in
                    Beethoven’s fifty-ninth work The violoncello begins with a fine and dignified
                    subject (key F major), accompanied by the viola and second violin, in the
                    following manner for six bars and a half, when the harmony changes.</p>
                <p>The first violin comes in at the ninth bar, imitating the preceding passage of
                    the violoncello, and accompanied by the three other instruments forming the
                    chord of the second inversion of dominant seventh, as far as the seventeenth
                    bar, where the following bold passage occurs.</p>
                <p>With regard to <hi rend="italic">passing</hi> notes, notes of <hi rend="italic"
                    >grace, anticipations, substitutions, altered</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >chromatic</hi> notes, and so on, the truth seems to be, that theorists have
                    always found them inexplicable upon their favourite principle of the fundamental
                    bass; and that, not knowing how to account for them rationally upon that
                    principle, they have been obliged to treat all such sounds that occur in melody
                    and in harmony as sounds that have no foundation in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >real</hi> structure of the composition; and to assign to them, by way of salvo,
                    any names that might pass current in an obscure and erroneous terminology. But
                    if theorists <hi rend="italic">will</hi> adhere to the received systems of
                    fundamental basses, they ought to be able to apply these systems to <hi
                    rend="italic">all</hi> the phenomena of melody and harmony. This is not the
                    case; for it is utterly impossible to refer <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the
                    combinations of modern (or even of ancient) harmony, to the received systems of
                    fundamental basses. Every candid and intelligent musician will admit this to be
                    true. Among all the systems of fundamental basses, Serre’s theory (formerly
                    alluded to) seems the most plausible, although still very imperfect. He assigns
                    to a chord, one, or two, or three fundamentals, which are to correspond to the
                    diatonic or chromatic nature of the sounds and intervals of the chord. But other
                    theorists have their fundamental <hi rend="italic">suppositions</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">substitutions</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> their <hi rend="italic"
                    >after</hi> notes; their <hi rend="italic">changing</hi> notes; their <hi
                    rend="italic">passing</hi> notes; their <hi rend="italic">altered</hi> notes;
                    their <hi rend="italic">appoggiature</hi>; their <hi rend="italic"
                    >suspensions</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> their <hi rend="italic"
                    >anticipations</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, in short, such a chaos of
                    hypothetically unessential and <hi rend="italic">unreal</hi> things, that it is
                    no wonder if the study of harmony is looked upon with horror and despair by all
                    students who are trained in the ordinary schools of composition. They meet, at
                    every step, with contradictions as absurd and perplexing as the long established
                    algebraical dogma that there are <hi rend="italic">quantities less</hi> than <hi
                    rend="italic">nothing.</hi> A little common sense and logic might have shown
                    that this puzzling dogma is a mere contradiction in terms. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nothing</hi> being <hi rend="italic">no quantity</hi> at all, it is obvious
                    that there can be no such thing as a <hi rend="italic">quantity less</hi> than
                    <hi rend="italic">nothing,</hi> or even <hi rend="italic">equal</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">nothing.</hi> If such absurd contradictions in terms pass so long
                    current in the most severe and exact of all sciences—mathematics—it cannot
                    surprise any thinking man that musical theories and systems should abound in
                    similar ones.</p>
                <p>It is wrong to say that the <hi rend="italic">ear</hi> recognises or suggests
                    what are called <hi rend="italic">suppositions</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >substitutions</hi> in fundamental basses; sounds that are not heard, but are
                    ascribed, by erroneous theory, to such and such chords. The ear hears none of
                    these imaginary and hypothetical things. Were it otherwise, and to carry this
                    hypothesis to the <hi rend="italic">reductio</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">absurdum,</hi> the ear ought to hear all the chords that can
                    possibly be applied to the accompaniment of any given melody. In fact, if two
                    voices, or two instruments, perform a duett, for example, the lower Part is <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193827438" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7438-0633"/> felt to be the
                    bass for the time being; and there is no other Part felt, <hi rend="italic">ox
                    supposed,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">substituted,</hi> by the ear. The
                    imagination may suggest an additional Part below the lower Part, or above the
                    higher Part, or intermediate; but this has nothing to do with the theory of the
                    fundamental bass. If another lower Part is added to this same duett, then the
                    ear feels <hi rend="italic">that</hi> Part to be the bass; and supposing a
                    fourth or a fifth Part, and so on, added still lower, then such added Part
                    becomes the bass, in so far as the ear is concerned. If the lowest Part is
                    overpowered by the upper ones, then the ear pays no attention to it, but to the
                    predominant upper or middle Part or Parts. Experiment will prove this. If a
                    melody is performed by a single voice or instrument, or by a great number of
                    voices or instruments in unison or in octaves, does the ear supply a fundamental
                    bass, or any bass at all? Surely not. As to what are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >passing</hi> notes, chromatically <hi rend="italic">altered</hi> notes, <hi
                    rend="italic">suspensions, anticipations,</hi> and so on, in melody or harmony;
                    all these <hi rend="italic">sounds</hi> are just as <hi rend="italic">real</hi>
                    as any other sounds that are heard in the course of the melody or of the
                    harmony; and if theorists adhere to the received fundamental bass system, then
                    <hi rend="italic">every</hi> sound that is heard in a melody, or in any Part of
                    a harmony, must have its own fundamental bass, just as much as <hi rend="italic"
                    >any other</hi> sound that exists in the melody or the harmony. This inference
                    is inevitable from rational logic. One of the most absurd hypotheses in musical
                    theories is found in the attempt to explain, according to the fundamental bass
                    system, a series of chords of 6th and 3d ascending or descending by conjunct
                    degrees. It is said that in such passages there is an <hi rend="italic"
                    >ellipsis</hi> of a chord between every two chords of the series, and that the
                    ear understands this to be the case, and supplies the omitted chords!</p>
                <p>When musical theorists meet with passages that cannot be explained by the
                    hypotheses advanced, such passages are called <hi rend="italic">licences.</hi>
                    Unfortunately these <hi rend="italic">licences</hi> are so numerous in music,
                    that the rules are overwhelmed by exceptions. The easy way for a puzzled
                    system-monger to escape from the difficulties that beset him is, no doubt, to
                    have recourse to such convenient words as <hi rend="italic">licences,
                    exceptions,</hi> and so on, which are not unwillingly received by the public as
                    substitutes for truth. In the works of the greatest composers are found many
                    passages of excellent effect, though prohibited by the rules of theorists. Such
                    being the case, we would again earnestly urge the student to form an extensive
                    acquaintance with the best models of the art, rather than trust to any theories
                    on the subject. He ought never to give up his reason and his feelings to any
                    theoretical authorities. <hi rend="italic">If</hi> he do, he will become timid
                    and uncertain. Every thing he meets with different from what his dry rules have
                    taught him, will perplex and terrify him. His energies will be paralyzed, and he
                    will be incapable of producing any thing but cold, feeble, and formal music. To
                    escape this result, he must take a comprehensive view of the art and its
                    accessories; devote himself to no particular composer or school of composition;
                    study the best music of every kind and of every country; and not allow himself
                    to be captured and manacled by any theorist. He ought to keep in view that, in
                    music, nothing is out of rule except what offends the ear, the taste, and the
                    judgment; but that he must not venture to imitate the freedom and the bold
                    effects of the greatest masters, until he has acquired great knowledge and
                    command of the materials of the art. This cannot be acquired but by a
                    well-directed course of study. Young painters are generally ambitious of
                    handling the brush and colours before they have learned to draw correctly with a
                    pencil or a crayon. If they are permitted to follow this course, they never
                    attain eminence in their art. The case of the impatient musical student is
                    analogous. Before he has learned to write correct melody, or correct harmony for
                    two voices or two instruments, he burns to signalize himself by writing a chorus
                    or a symphony, an opera or an oratorio. The lamentable failure of such a
                    premature attempt disgusts and disheartens him. He abandons study as hopeless;
                    and, if a man of genius, deprives the world of an excellent composer by neglect
                    of the old maxim, <hi rend="italic">festina</hi><hi rend="italic">lente.</hi> It
                    is well to remark here, that Haydn, in the height of his reputation, declared to
                    his friends that he did not recollect having passed a day without working
                    sixteen and sometimes eighteen hours. We may also remark, that Haydn formed his
                    own admirable style by the indefatigable study of every good composition within
                    his reach; by neglecting no opportunity of gaining information regarding his
                    art; and by forming for himself his own theory and principles of musical
                    composition. In the earlier part of his life he studied intently the works of C.
                    P. E. Bach, a musician of the highest order of genius, and also the works of G.
                    B. San Martini of Milan, a composer of great genius and originality, but not
                    possessed of patience enough to cultivate his abilities to the uttermost. In
                    Haydn’s earlier works, among others, some of his Sonatas, the resemblance
                    between his style and that of Emanuel Bach is most striking. Indeed, the two
                    styles are hardly distinguishable. But, as his musical horizon extended, he saw
                    that neither E. Bach, nor John Sebastian Bach the father, nor G. B. San Martini,
                    nor many more whom he studied and imitated, would suffice to make him a great
                    and original composer. So he applied himself to the improvement of instrumenta!
                    music, and to the invention of a new style of composition in instrumental
                    quartette and symphonies. His best quartetts and symphonies still remain
                    unrivalled, for the admirable management of the subjects and modulations, the
                    judicious employment of the different instruments, the unity of design in each
                    movement, and the clearness of construction and of harmony. Haydn was a great
                    advocate for melody. He used to say, “Every composition that has a fine melody
                    is sure to please ;” and experience proves the truth of Haydn’s assertion. He
                    was of opinion that the most <hi rend="italic">recherche</hi> and learned
                    harmony without melody was only an elaborate noise, which, if it did not
                    displease the ear, excited neither the feelings nor the imagination. We shall
                    close this part of our subject with a few remarks that may be useful to the
                    student.</p>
                <p>The practice of composition ought to begin with melody for a single voice, with
                    or without a bass Part. The next step is to learn to write correctly for two
                    voices, then for three, then for four, and so on. The custom of writing for
                    voices will induce a habit of correctness not to be acquired by persons who
                    begin by writing for instruments.</p>
                <p>The proper manner of accompanying vocal music forms a difficult branch of the
                    art, and cannot be studied with advantage till considerable skill has been
                    acquired in vocal composition. The compass and quality <hi rend="italic"
                    >(timbre)</hi> and powers of different instruments, and their effects in
                    combination, must now occupy the student’s attention. He ought to take every
                    opportunity of hearing good instrumental music well performed, not only by
                    orchestras, but also by military bands; and of observing attentively the various
                    effects produced. In whatever he composes, clearness of harmony ought to be
                    carefully preserved. Obscurity of harmony arises from the following causes: Too
                    rapid a succession of sounds, chords, and keys; a complication of different
                    movements that take place simultaneously in the different Parts, especially when
                    these movements are at the same time accompanied by a series of chords that
                    succeed each other very quickly, or by sudden modulations. Two different
                    movements at the same time, unite easiIy; three not so easily; four may produce
                    obscurity, if they are not very ski!fully arranged, and especially if care is
                    not taken, at the same time, that the chords do not sueceed<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193827451" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7451-0634"/> each other, but at the
                    distance of a bar at least. More than four different movements at once almost
                    inevitably produce confusion. It is therefore mere waste of time to attempt to
                    give a different movement to each of the Parts of an orchestra. Harmony for
                    three, and especially for two Parts, is much less liable to become confused than
                    harmony for more than three Parts. For this reason, harmony in two or three
                    Parts should be frequently used, particularly in music written for the public.
                    Besides clearness of harmony, there is another kind of clearness not less
                    important. It depends on the choice of ideas, and the order in which they are
                    connected. Wherever there is neither <hi rend="italic">unity of ideas,</hi> nor
                    <hi rend="italic">proportion,</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">symmetry,</hi> there is
                    confusion.</p>
                <p>That excellent composer Piccini, the rival of Gluck and of Sacchini, occasionally
                    employed full and rich harmony in his orchestra, but disapproved of the common
                    practice of keeping all the instruments continually busy. He wished to make the
                    voice the principal Part in his operas, and that the instruments should only
                    sustain the voice, or express what was indicated by the words, or by the action
                    of the persons of the drama, or by the place and circumstances of the scene. He
                    was opposed to those <hi rend="italic">disegni ostinati</hi> in the
                    accompaniment, which Jomelli brought into fashion, and which are uniformly
                    prolonged through nearly the whole extent of a piece of music, although the
                    words present shades of feeling or ideas which would require corresponding
                    shades in the accompaniment. Multitudes of different instruments, continual
                    orchestral effects, crude masses of harmony, and a perpetual affectation of
                    dissonances, were considered by him as musical monstrosities. He said, “It is
                    not difficult to know what can be put into a harmony. The difficulty lies in
                    knowing what should be left out. The four Parts for stringed instruments, which
                    form the basis of the orchestra, lend themselves almost equally to every kind of
                    expression. This is not the case with the wind instruments, and instruments of
                    percussion. The expression of the oboe differs from that of the clarinet, and
                    that of the clarinet very much from that of the flute. The horns change their
                    expression according to the key in which they are used. The bassoon, whenever it
                    is not confounded with the bass, becomes sad and melancholy. The trombones can
                    express nothing that is not lugubrious. The trumpet, nothing that is not warlike
                    and brilliant. The kettle-drum is altogether military. If each of these
                    instruments were reserved for its proper employment, we should produce varied
                    effects, succeed in describing every thing, and continually diversify our
                    musical pictures. But we are lavish of all these means, all at once, and always.
                    We exhaust and harden the ear. I should like to know what we shall do to awaken
                    it when, as will soon happen, it will be accustomed to this uproar. What new <hi
                    rend="italic">diablerie</hi> shall we contrive? Perhaps we shall then wish to
                    return to nature, and to the true means acknowledged by art; but you know what
                    happens to persons accustomed to drink brandy.” Some combinations of harmony,
                    and treatments of dissonances, &amp;c. not explicable by common theories, will
                    be found in Plates CCCLXXVI. CCCLXXVII. No. 28 to 71.</p>
                <p>We mentioned, in the section on Melody, that a treatise on melodic modulation is
                    wanted; and we think that a satisfactory treatise on the modulation of harmony
                    is also a desideratum. But neither can be written to any good purpose in the
                    present state of the theory of music, taking the word theory in its most
                    comprehensive sense, as applied to this art. Philosophers seldom understand
                    music; and the greatest practical musicians have neither leisure nor inclination
                    to attempt to analyse its nature; So that, for want of properly conducted
                    investigation, we are likely to remain in the same “aere senza stelle” which at
                    present darkens the depths of the art.</p>
                <p>Modulation signifies, properly, the regular constitution of melody and of harmony
                    in any given key, but is <hi rend="italic">commonly</hi> used to express the art
                    of conducting a melody or a harmony from one key into another, or through
                    several successive keys. This change of key might be more properly called <hi
                    rend="italic">transition.</hi> Many persons believe that there can be no
                    modulation where there is no change of key. But this is an error, since
                    modulation takes place even in the simplest melody confined to one key.
                    Transition is only one kind of modulation, and is worthless if injudiciously
                    employed. We may make a transition from one key to another suddenly, and without
                    any intermediate sounds; or by means of one or more intermediate chords through
                    which we modulate into the new key.</p>
                <p>The art of good modulation from one key to another, consists in the choice of
                    these intermediate chords, and in their relative durations. The use of sudden
                    transitions from one key to another, without any intermediate chords, requires
                    attention to a variety of circumstances, in order to produce a good effect. Such
                    transitions should be but sparingly employed in any regular composition. Every
                    regular piece of music is composed in a particular key, in which it begins and
                    ends, and which generally predominates over all the other keys that may happen
                    to be introduced in the course of the piece. If the key is major, what are
                    called its relative keys will be two major ones and three minor. If a minor key,
                    its relative keys will be three major ones and two minor. The following tables
                    will show what these relatives are :—</p>
                <p>C major, principal key. A minor, principal key.</p>
                <p>D minor, first relative key. C major, first relative key. E minor, second
                    relative key. D minor, second relative key. F major, third relative key. E
                    minor, third relative key. G major, fourth relative key. F major, fourth
                    relative key. A minor, fifth relative key. G major, fifth relative key.</p>
                <p>These six keys offer, in their modulated connection, 720 combinations. The
                    nearest related keys to a major key, taken as principal, and into either of
                    which it may easily pass without any intermediate chord, are its dominant, its
                    subdominant, and its sixth; thus, from C major to G major, or to F major, or to
                    A minor.</p>
                <p>The keys most nearly related to a minor key, are its third below or above, or its
                    dominant, or its subdominant. It may pass into any one of these without an
                    intermediate chord; thus, from A minor to F major, or to C major, or to È minor,
                    or to D minor. In such cases we do not properly modulate, but make a sudden
                    transition into a new key. In the following examples, we modulate by an
                    intermediate chord: <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827464"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-7464-0635"/> The general rule is, that we can <hi
                    rend="italic">modulate</hi> into a <hi rend="italic">relative</hi> key by means
                    of one single intermediate chord, which chord is the dominant seventh, or some
                    inversion of the dominant seventh, of that relative key. We may remain in the
                    new key for some time, or we may quit it immediately, and modulate into a third
                    key, and so on. An example of rapid modulation from key to key by means of
                    intermediate dominant sevenths, or their inversions, occurs in what is called
                    the “Tour du Clavier,” or harmonic circle of keys. It is needless to give more
                    of this than a fragment by way of example, since long successions of the kind
                    are not used in modern music. Only short passages of such modulation occur in
                    the best modern compositions.</p>
                <p>Not unfrequently we meet with modulations into relative keys brought about by
                    means of an intermediate common chord. For example:</p>
                <p>In passing from one key to another, a third, a fourth, or a fifth below, without
                    using any intermediate chord, it is proper to keep in view the following remarks
                    :—1. Transition to third below. In this case, if the former key is major, the
                    second should be minor. For example, C major, A minor. Here the transition is to
                    the minor third below. A bolder and more unusual transition is from one major
                    key to another major key, a major third below; such as from C major to A flat
                    major. If the first key is minor, the second key should be major. Thus, from C
                    minor to A flat major, a major third below. 2. Transition to the fourth below.
                    The two keys ought to be both minor or both major, otherwise they will not be
                    relative. 3. Transition to fifth below. The two keys ought to be both major or
                    both minor, for the same reason that has just been given. To make a real change
                    of key without intermediate chords, we must introduce at least one entire phrase
                    or period in the new key. (See <hi rend="italic">Melody,</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">phrase</hi> and <hi rend="italic">periods</hi> Thus, after a
                    subject in C major, we might introduce a period in G major, in F major, or in A
                    minor, and afterwards return to the key of the subject. Sometimes, but much more
                    rarely, a transition is made from a given key to another a major second or a
                    minor third above it.</p>
                <p>The following is an instance of the first kind of transition just mentioned.</p>
                <p>In the case of a transition from one key to another a minor third above it, the
                    first key must be minor and the second major; for instance, from A minor to C
                    major. This kind of transition is found in certain short pieces of music, and,
                    among othérs, in some Russian airs. Another transition (if so it may be called)
                    which is not unfrequent, occurs when we change the mode without changing the
                    key; for example, when we change C major into C minor, or the converse. We may
                    “ass immediately from a major key into a minor key its fifth below; for example,
                    from C major into F minor. Again, after making a cadence upon the dominant of a
                    minor key, we may proceed immediately to the key of the major third below that
                    dominant, or to the key of the minor second above that dominant. For example,
                    from dominant common chord of C minor, we may make a transition into the key of
                    E flat major, or of A flat major. Of the former kind of transition a very
                    beautiful example occurs in the <hi rend="italic">Adagio sostenuto</hi> in
                    Haydn’s second quartett, Op. 16, where, from the dominant common chord of C
                    minor, the change of key is made into E flat major. Also another in the “<hi
                    rend="italic">Hodie</hi><hi rend="italic">mecum</hi> ’ of Haydn’s “Seven last
                    Words of the Passion,” at the 21st measure of the movement. In the same
                    movement, at the beginning of its second section, a very effective modulation
                    occurs from E flat major into F minor, by means of the following passage.</p>
                <p>Examples of transition from the dominant common chord of a minor key, to a major
                    key a minor second above that dominant, as at No. 6 below, may be found in the
                    works of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and other composers. An instance may be seen
                    in the Finale to Haydn’s Symphony, No. 5 (about the middle of the movement),
                    where the transition is from dominant of F sharp minor to the key of D major. In
                    the “Trio” of the first quartett in Beethoven’s Op. 18 there is an example of a
                    transition from the dominant of F major into the key of D flat major. In the
                    sixth measure of the first movement of Beethoven’s quartett, Op. 95, we find a
                    very singular transition from the dominant of the key of F minor into the key of
                    G flat major.</p>
                <p>3</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">allegretto vivace</hi>- in the first quartett of
                    Beethoven’s Op. 59, there are some curious transitions. Near the beginning there
                    is a transition from the dominant of B flat major to the key of A flat major,
                    and from the dominant of this last key a transition to the key of C flat major.
                    Sometimes, in order to produce a powerful effect of contrast, a transition takes
                    place directly from the tonic of a major key to the major key a semitone above,
                    or a major third below. For example, from C major to D flat major, or to A flat
                    major.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827477" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7477-0636"/>
                <p>At the beginning of the second part of the first movement in Beethoven’s first
                    sonata, Op. 12, there is an example of the second kind of transition just
                    mentioned. It is from A major to F major. See another example about the middle
                    of the <hi rend="italic">andante</hi> in Haydn’s Symphony, No. 4; transition
                    from tonic G major to E flat major. Also another in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >adagio</hi><hi rend="italic">cantabile</hi> of second quartett of Haydn’s Op.
                    72; transition from E major to C major. All such powerful contrasts as those we
                    have just spoken of, especially the transition from a given key to another a
                    semitone above, ought to be very sparingly used. In dramatic music, and
                    symphonies for an orchestra, these transitions may be very effective. The
                    judicious composer may occasionally introduce them in music, of a different
                    description; for instance, in a cantata, or an instrumental quartett or
                    quintett, &amp;c. Excepting the cases we have mentioned of transitions made from
                    one key to another without any intermediate chords, the general rule to be
                    followed in modulating is to connect together the different keys by intermediate
                    chords. In the proper selection of these intermediate chords consists the art of
                    modulation taken in its widest sense. It depends entirely upon the relation or
                    non-relation between the keys from and into which we modulate, what number of
                    intermediate chords may be necessary to render the modulation smooth and
                    agreeable. The manner in which these intermediate chords are to be
                    disposed—direct or inverted, with or without dissonances or altered chromatic
                    notes, &amp;c.—rests with the composer’s skill and imagination. One, or two, or
                    three, or four intermediate chords may be necessary, according to circumstances;
                    but there is hardly any modulation that cannot be effected by means of four of
                    these.</p>
                <p>It is necessary to observe that, in many cases, the intermediate chords used in
                    modulating from one key to another must have a sufficient duration given to
                    them; otherwise the effect of the modulation will be harsh and displeasing.</p>
                <p>Both of these examples of modulation are harsh and unpleasing, because the
                    intermediate chords are too few, and have not sufficient duration allowed to
                    them; and yet they are given in a set of elaborate tables for modulation by
                    Hudl, a German musician. Haydn never falls into errors of this kind. By taking
                    care to prolong his intermediate chords sufficiently, he produces the smoothest
                    and at the same time the most unexpected modulations. The following example,
                    though not Haydn’s, will illustrate this:</p>
                <p>At A the modulation from B flat major into D flat major is gradually conducted.
                    At B the same modulation is brought about too rapidly, and sounds harsh and
                    unsatisfactory. Some good examples of Haydn’s judgment in dwelling upon the
                    intermediate chords when modulating, may be seen in the movement “Ecce mulier,”
                    in his “Seven last Words of the Passion.” See the first nine measures of the
                    second part of that movement, and from thirty-fourth to forty-fourth measures of
                    same part.</p>
                <p>A modulation frequently takes place into a key which is not a relative one to
                    that immediately preceding, though both are related to the principal key of the
                    piece. For example: 1. When the principal key is major, a modulation may occur
                    from the second of the key to the third, from the third to the fourth, from the
                    fourth to the fifth, from the second to the fifth. 2. When the principal key is
                    minor, we may modulate from the fourth degree to the fifth, from the fifth
                    degree to the sixth, from the sixth degree to the seventh, from the fourth
                    degree to the seventh, and the converse of all these cases. In modulating into a
                    key not are lative one (for instance, from G major into F major), care must be
                    taken that the two keys are relatives to a principal key which has previously
                    been sufficiently established; for it is only in such case that a modulation of
                    that kind can be suitably employed. One may easily modulate from G major into F
                    major by means of two intermediate chords in a piece of music of which the
                    principal key is C major or A minor; but one could not do so if the principal
                    key "were D major or E minor; so that a modulation which is good in one case may
                    become bad in another. This must always be kept in view with regard to
                    modulations of the kind just mentioned. In order to modulate smoothly into a key
                    more or less remote from the one we quit, we may employ two, three, or four
                    modulations instead of one only. These may be called <hi rend="italic">compound
                    modulations.</hi> For example, to modulate from G major into F major, we may
                    employ two modulations instead of one; the first, from G into A minor; the
                    second, from A minor into F major.</p>
                <p>As we can make a transition immediately from a major <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193827490" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7490-0637"/> key to the minor key of its
                    fifth below, so we can modulate into all the relative keys of the latter in
                    setting out from the former; for example, into all the relative keys of F minor,
                    beginning to modulate from C major. Again, we can modulate into all the relative
                    keys of C minor, in setting out from C major. It is easier to modulate into keys
                    that increase the number of their flats, than into keys that increase the number
                    of their sharps. For instance, it is more difficult to modulate smoothly from C
                    major into A major, than from C major into A flat major.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, instead of using intermediate chords, a pause of some duration is
                    employed between two keys that are not related to each other, and a modulation,
                    or transition, effected in this way from the one key to the other. The longer
                    the pause, the smoother the modulation in such cases. A single prolonged
                    intermediate sound, not a <hi rend="italic">chord,</hi> placed between two keys
                    not relative, and followed by a pause, may also render the transition from the
                    one to the other sufficiently smooth. For instance, after the chord</p>
                <p>No. 11. ⅛</p>
                <p>of G minor, introduce a prolonged E flat <hi rend="superscript underline">
                    ,</hi><hi rend="underline">7)*</hi><hi rend="superscript underline"> ,</hi><hi
                    rend="underline">b r√~</hi> and a pause, and then pass at once into the key of A
                    flat major. Towards the end of the last movement of Beethoven’s third
                    Piano-forte Trio, Op. 1, there is a curious modulation from dominant of C minor
                    into B minor by means of two prolonged sounds, G and Fö. We may modulate from
                    one key to another far remote, by means of a series of chromatic notes performed
                    by one Part that seems to wander uncertain in quest of something. “Or su, or
                    giù, ed or ricirculando.” The finest example that we know of this kind of
                    modulation is in the <hi rend="italic">Adagio Fantasia</hi> of Haydn’s sixth
                    Quartett, Opera 76. The whole movement is charming.</p>
                <p>As to what are called <hi rend="italic">enharmonic</hi> modulations, or
                    transitions, we shall pass them by, since they have no real existence upon keyed
                    instruments. We refer to what we have said on this subject in the section on
                    Harmony. We must remark, however, that they are dangerous delusions, and are
                    continually giving rise to a number of harsh and intolerable pseudo-modulations
                    in the music of young composers, and even in the music of experienced composers
                    who ought to know better. No sooner has a young composer (not wisely taught) got
                    acquainted with <hi rend="italic">the</hi><hi rend="italic">formulée</hi> of
                    these pseudo-enharmonic transitions, than he is eager to use them on all
                    occasions, in order, as he thinks, to display his learning. He deceives himself,
                    for his indulging in such things only betrays his ignorance of his art.
                    “Modulation,’’ said Piccini, “like all the other processes of the art, ought to
                    be employed as a means of just expression and judicious variety. To modulate for
                    the sake of modulating, is to prove one’s ignorance of the object and principles
                    of music. It is to affect a superabundance of imagination and of knowledge, in
                    order to conceal the want of both.”</p>
                <p>We advise the student to examine carefully the works of the best composers,
                    Italian and German, for examples of modulation, as well as of harmony and
                    melody. There is no other way for him to acquire even a respectable knowledge of
                    his art. As to the books published expressly upon modulation, some of them are
                    written by Germans, and generally contain only mere <hi rend="italic"
                    >formulae</hi> of the shortest ways in which modulations can be effected. These
                    formulae the student ought to shun, except for mere reference; because, although
                    the study of them might render him able to modulate in a dry and formal manner,
                    they could never teach him that grace, and freedom, and effect, without which
                    the most elaborate modulations äre worthless.</p>
                <p>Imitation is a musical artifice, by which a Part, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >antecedent,</hi> proposes a subject, or melody; and another Part, called the
                    <hi rend="italic">consequent,</hi> repeats the same melody, after some rests, in
                    any given interval, and so continuing to the end.</p>

                <p>In an imitation the <hi rend="italic">consequent</hi> is not always obliged to
                    answer to the <hi rend="italic">antecedent</hi> in the whole extent of the
                    subject proposed by the latter. It may imitate only a part of the subject, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">consequent</hi> proposing a new melody, becomes, in its
                    turn, the <hi rend="italic">antecedent.</hi></p>
                <p>Imitation may take place in several ways. It is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >regular</hi> or <hi rend="italic">constrained</hi> when the nature of the
                    intervals proposed by the <hi rend="italic">antecedent</hi> is strictly observed
                    in the response of the <hi rend="italic">consequent-</hi> This of course happens
                    when the <hi rend="italic">consequent</hi> imitates the <hi rend="italic"
                    >antecedent</hi> in the unison or the octave. Imitation in the fourth or the
                    fifth is the next nearest to exact correspondence of intervals.</p>
                <p>Imitation is called∕ree or <hi rend="italic">irregular</hi> when this exact
                    correspondence is not observed.</p>
                <p>Imitation is by similar motion, by contrary motion, by similar retrograde motion,
                    by contrary retrograde motion.</p>
                <p>The other kinds of imitation are by <hi rend="italic">augmentation,</hi> by <hi
                    rend="italic">diminution,</hi> by <hi rend="italic">countertime</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">»</hi><hi rend="italic">interrupted, convertible, periodical,
                    canonical,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Canonical imitation is that in which the consequent answers to the antecedent,
                    note for note, from the beginning to the end. -An imitation of this kind is what
                    is called a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827503" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7503-0638"/>
                    canon, and may be treated in two ways. It may end with a <hi rend="italic"
                    >coda,</hi> or complete close; or it may be made what is termed an <hi
                    rend="italic">endless</hi> or <hi rend="italic">circular</hi> canon, when it is
                    so constructed that we can return from the end of the imitation to the beginning
                    as often as we please, without stopping. Another kind of <hi rend="italic"
                    >circular canon</hi> is one which modulates through all the twelve keys.</p>
                <p>A canon written upon one stave, with particular signs to indicate how and when
                    the different parts follow each other, is called a <hi rend="italic">close
                    canon.</hi> Latin enigmatical mottos were often applied to these close canons,
                    to direct the performer mysteriously. Padre Martini has given a list of
                    fifty-six of these mottos. When the canon is written fully out in score, or
                    partition, it is called an <hi rend="italic">open canon.</hi></p>
                <p>The artifice of this kind of composition consists in combining the Parts in such
                    a manner that they may, without inconvenience, be transposed from <hi
                    rend="italic">acute</hi> to <hi rend="italic">grave</hi> if they are placed
                    above the theme, and from <hi rend="italic">grave</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                    >acute</hi> if they are placed below it, while the theme suffers no change in
                    its melody, whether it exist in one of the extreme Parts, or in one of the
                    intermediate.</p>
                <p>These inversions may take place in seven ways, so that there are seven species
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> double counterpoint. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ninth</hi> or <hi rend="italic">second;</hi> in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tenth</hi> or <hi rend="italic">third;</hi> in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >eleventh</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fourth;</hi> in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >twelfth</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fifth;</hi> in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >thirteenth</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sixth;</hi> in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fourteenth</hi> or <hi rend="italic">seventh;</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fifteenth</hi> or <hi rend="italic">octave.</hi> Those most commonly used are
                    in the <hi rend="italic">tenth</hi> or <hi rend="italic">third</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">twelfth</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >fifth</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">fifteenth</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">octave.</hi></p>
                <p>In double counterpoint the Parts ought to be, as much as possible, distinguished
                    from each other by the different lengths of their notes. The Part which forms
                    the counterpoint ought to begin after the theme. The Parts must not be allowed
                    to cross one another without some cogent reason. In all double counterpoints,
                    except that in the octave, it is not only permitted, but it is necessary, to
                    alter intervals when inverting the Parts, especially when the modulations
                    require this.</p>
                <p>From what has already been said regarding the inversions of intervals, the
                    following very short examples of double counterpoints will be more easily
                    understood. But, for full explanations, we must refer to Marpurg and others;
                    and, above all, to the works of the great masters.</p>
                <p>Here occur some of the <hi rend="italic">alterations</hi> of intervals lately
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>“Double counterpoint in the twelfth,” says Cherubini, “is one of the most used,
                    and one of the richest in resources.” See his “Cours de Contrepoint et de
                    Fugue,” published in 1835. In this work he <hi rend="italic">specially</hi>
                    recommends Marpurg’s Treatise on Fugue and Counterpoint, as the most complete of
                    any. We would advise the reader to consult Cherubini’s work also, as containing
                    admirable examples of his own composition. Reicha and Cherubini seem to be at
                    variance as to the nature of Marpurg’s work. Reicha says, “il ne parle, pour
                    ainsi dire, que des imitationset des canons.” <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193827516" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7516-0639"/> In the symphonies,
                    quartetts, &amp;c. of Haydn and Mozart, instances are frequent of the freest and
                    boldest melodies being used in counterpoint with the best effect; but it is only
                    the highest genius and most consummate skill that can do this.</p>
                <p>There are also triple and quadruple counterpoints, susceptible of being inverted
                    in various ways. Of these the best and most usual are in the octave, the tenth,
                    or the twelfth.</p>
                <p>In these triple and quadruple counterpoints, where the <hi rend="italic"
                    >subjects</hi> are merely doubled in thirds, there is a dryness and want of
                    variety which had better be avoided by writing, in a free style, accessory
                    accompaniments to the counterpoint. Our limits do not permit us to enter farther
                    into this extensive subject. We refer to Marpurg, and Reicha, and Cherubini, for
                    full explanations.</p>
                <p>We must add the following passage from Cherubini: “All these examples give rise
                    to an important remark, which is, that in spite of the denominations of <hi
                    rend="italic">triple</hi> and <hi rend="italic">quadruple</hi> counterpoint, in
                    the <hi rend="italic">tenth</hi> or in the <hi rend="italic">twelfth,</hi> there
                    is no veritable <hi rend="italic">triple ox quadruple</hi> counterpoint, but
                    that in the <hi rend="italic">octave."</hi></p>
                <p>The fugue is a very complicated piece of music when it is carried to its highest
                    pitch of artifice. It comprehends all sorts of imitations, canonical
                    contrivances, and double counterpoints. Studied with proper views and within
                    proper limits, so as not to interfere with the supremacy of melody and with the
                    genius of a true composer, the fugue is extremely useful as an exercise of the
                    student’s ingenuity, and as tending to show him all the resources of artificial
                    harmonic combination. To those who have <hi rend="italic">learned</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">understand</hi> the artificial mechanism of fugues, and who can
                    enjoy them on that ground, they are often very admirable things, though
                    composers of great genius might have been better employed than in constructing
                    them. Homer, Milton, or Shakspeare, would not have done justice to themselves,
                    had they spent their time in writing difficult poetical puzzles, such as
                    anagrams, acrostics, single, double, and triple poems in the shapes of crosses
                    and triangles, or in which every word began with the same letter, as in the
                    famous <hi rend="italic">Pugna Porcorum,</hi> beginning “Plaudite porcelli
                    porcorum pigra propago Progreditur,” and so on for five closely printed pages.
                    All such poetry is beyond the verge of the enchanted circle of poetical
                    inspiration. So of all calculated artifices in music. If musical <hi
                    rend="italic">imitations,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">canons</hi> of any sort,
                    suggest themselves fluently and gracefully to a man acquainted with all the
                    elements of the art, it is well; otherwise not; for mere dry labour ought to
                    have no place in music. Since such artificial harmonic combinations can give
                    pleasure to the initiated only, who have gone through a long training, there
                    seems to be no reason why the laboured contrivances of imitation and fugue
                    should have any <hi rend="italic">preference</hi> over the simplicity of
                    beautiful and expressive melody, and its adjunct, appropriate and effective
                    harmony. We know well that this is all heterodox doctrine among a certain class
                    of musiciafis, but do not the less adhere to our long-established opinion. With
                    great respect for the knowledge and ingenuity of all eminent writers of canons
                    or of fugues, we must remark, that all these artifices arose at a time when
                    melody was in its infancy, and had not acquired, like Hercules, the power to
                    strangle the serpents that besieged its cradle. Among the greatest fugue writers
                    are certainly to be reckoned G. P. Colonna, Handel, the Scarlattis, John
                    Sebastian Bach, and his son Emanuel; and more recently Haydn, Mozart, A. Reicha,
                    and Cherubini. Beethoven did not attempt much in this style, and what he
                    attempted in it is not to be classed amongst his best productions. It is no
                    wonder if a man of his towering genius and impetuous character was early
                    disgusted by the arbitrary rules and restrictions imposed upon him by some of
                    his unimaginative teachers, in such laboured music.</p>
                <p>Cherubini says (we translate from the French), “The fugue, in spite of the
                    ancient origin of the word, is, then, a creation of modern times, which was not
                    practised in church-music until contrapuntists had freed themselves from the
                    self-imposed obligation of working upon plain chant There are two kinds of
                    fugue, from which a third kind emanates, and from this arise all the others. The
                    two principal are, the <hi rend="italic">fugue of the key,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">real fugue</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the other is the <hi

                    type="authorial"><p>Reicha says, “Since fugues of the key are no longer
                    composed, and as simple canons are not called fugues, the terms <hi

                    imitation,</hi> are not really necessary, and only serve to confuse our
                    treatises.” (P. 56, 2d part.)</p></note> All the others, children of caprice,
                    are <hi rend="italic">irregular fugues of imitation, or pieces in fugue

                    >answer,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">countersubject,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">stretto.</hi> To these conditions may be added the <hi
                    rend="italic">pedal,</hi> which is almost always employed in a fugue somewhat
                    developed All the artifices which can be in troduced into a fugue depend on the
                    knowledge, the skill, and the choice of the composer, and at the same time on
                    the nature of the <hi rend="italic">subject</hi> and of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >counterpoint,</hi> either or both of which may be more or less susceptible of
                    yielding to these artifices. These artifices consist, in brief, 1. Of the
                    employment of imitations, in detaching, to form them, a portion either of the
                    <hi rend="italic">subject</hi> or of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >counter-subject</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> 2. in the transposition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">sulyect</hi> into different keys, and in the advantage which may
                    be derived in this respect from" double counterpoints; 3. in the inversion of
                    the <hi rend="italic">subject</hi> by contrary motion; 4. in a new <hi
                    rend="italic">sulyect</hi> which may be introduced, and which can be combined
                    with the first <hi rend="italic">sulyect</hi> and the first <hi rend="italic"
                    >counter-subject',</hi> 5. in the manner of introducing the <hi rend="italic"
                    >stretto</hi> in several ways, by drawing closer and closer, each time, the <hi
                    rend="italic">answer</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">subject</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> 6. in the means that may be employed to make the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sulyect</hi> and its inversion by contrary motion be heard simultaneously; 7.
                    in the manner of combining the <hi rend="italic">subject,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">counter-sulyect,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">stretto</hi> upon
                    the <hi rend="italic">pedal;</hi> and in the address and the taste employed in
                    enchaining together and introducing these artifices in the course of a fugue.
                    All these combinations, and others besides, may be employed in a <hi
                    rend="italic">studied fugue</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but, in a fugue for the
                    public, a selection must be made from them, and they must not be all employed,
                    otherwise the fugue would be too long and tiresome.”</p>
                <p>Reicha says, “it is essential to remark, that in our days the ancient fugue (or
                    in the rigorous style) is no longer <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827529"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-7529-0640"/> composed quite under the same restrictions as in
                    the time of Palestrina. At present we modulate in it a little more boldly, and
                    employ more of dissonant chords. We sometimes introduce little chromatic
                    phrases, and employ a greater variety in the values of the notes. We choose
                    subjects of a more modern cast ;—from time to time we permit successions of
                    notes formerly prohibited, such as the diminished fourth, the augmented fifth,
                    diminished seventh, minor seventh ;—we add a coda ;—we compose these fugues in
                    all kinds of measures, &amp;c.; so that we may say there exist three kinds of
                    fugues: 1. The fugue entirely in the <hi rend="italic">ancient style</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> 2. the <hi rend="italic">modern</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >free fugue</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> 3. the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mixedfugue,</hi> which participates in these two styles.” (P. 4, part ii.)</p>
                <p>Cherubini remarks, that “although the denomination of <hi rend="italic">fugue
                    with two, with three, and with four subjects</hi> is generally adopted, this
                    denomination is, in my opinion, improper. I think so, because a fugue cannot,
                    and should not, have more than one single principal subject, to serve for its
                    exposition. All that accompanies the subject is only accessory, and neither can
                    nor should bear any other name than that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >counter-subject.</hi> Thus, according to this principle, the fugue that we are
                    accustomed to call <hi rend="italic">fugue with two subjects</hi> ought to be
                    called <hi rend="italic">fugue with one subject and one counter-subject</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> that <hi rend="italic">with three subjects</hi> should be
                    called <hi rend="italic">fugue with one sulject and two counter-subjects</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and, lastly, that with <hi rend="italic">four subjects</hi>
                    ought to bear the name of <hi rend="italic">fugue with one subject and three
                    counter-subjects^</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. (P.l 11.)</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">pedal</hi> is a prolonged sound, sustained for several
                    measures. It may be placed in the upper Part, or in a middle Part, and may occur
                    on the key-note or the dominant; but in general it is best to place it in the
                    lowest Part, and upon the dominant of the key.</p>
                <p>For examples of vocal fugues, we refer the reader to Padre Martini’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Saggio di Contrappunto;</hi> Paolucci’s <hi rend="italic">Arte
                    pratica di Contrappunto</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> Choron’s large work on
                    composition, and his collection of musical classics. Clementi’s collection,
                    entitled Practical Harmony, contains a great variety of examples of instrumental
                    fugues by different composers. Among the best of these are the fugues by Handel
                    and the two Scarlattis, in the second volume. All Handel’s fugues are excellent
                    studies, having more melody, force, and freedom, than most others of that
                    period. Among what are called free fugues, we would point out two beautiful
                    specimens in Mozart’s overture to the <hi rend="italic">Magic Flute,</hi> and in
                    the last movement of his first violin quartett in G.</p>
                <p>Cherubini gives an advice which the student will do well to follow. He says, “we
                    will add here, that in all the kinds of counterpoint of which we are to treat,
                    as well as in the fugue, the scholar ought to write for voices, and not for
                    instruments. He ought to write conformably to the natural compass of the
                    different kinds of voices. By this practice he will have the advantage of
                    learning to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827542" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7542-0641"/>
                    produce effects by voices only,—a difficult study, and one perhaps too much
                    neglected,—and he will find himself, afterwards, much more at his ease when he
                    writes for instruments, and consequently is no longer obliged to confine himself
                    within the limits of voices.” Speaking of modulation (after having given general
                    rules for it), Cherubini says, “Modern composers have freed themselves in their
                    compositions from this simple and rational method of modulating, replacing it by
                    a manner too free, and often incoherent; but if their deviations are tolerated
                    in modern works, it is essential, and it is even expressly enjoined, not to
                    follow these wanderings in the case of a composition so severe as the
                    fugue.”</p>
                <p>By imitative music we do not here mean the imitation of one melody or passage of
                    melody by another, which has been already treated of in the section connected
                    with canon and fugue; but the employment of music, more or less appropriately
                    and successfully, to imitate certain natural phenomena, audible or visible. The
                    great mystery of music lies in its power of suggesting and exciting ideas and
                    feelings in persons endowed with a sufficient degree of sensibility and
                    imagination. In this respect it resembles poetry, for poetry is a <hi
                    rend="italic">dead</hi> art to all who have not sensibility and imagination
                    enough to receive and expand its suggestions. We speak of the higher poetry; not
                    of that which attempts in vain to be minutely descriptive or imitative, and
                    which, by so doing, loses the nobler essence of poetry, without attaining the
                    object proposed.</p>
                <p>There are many musical compositions that do not aim at imitation or expression of
                    any determinate kind. Such are the great majority of pieces of instrumental
                    music. Some fanciful persons have gone so far as to imagine a story told, or a
                    scene described, by a quartett or a symphony, although the composer gave no
                    indication of any such purpose, and would have transgressed the true imitative
                    limits of his art by doing so.</p>
                <p>One of these fanciful persons, Momigny, in his <hi rend="italic">Cours</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Complet</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic">Harmonie et
                    de Composition,</hi> has ventured to give what he calls “a picturesque and
                    poetical analysis” of the introductory movement and succeeding allegro of
                    Haydn’s eighth Symphony in El?, and to add words here and there, to show what
                    the music is intended to express. Momigny has also adapted words (see his third
                    volume) to the first movement of Mozart’s second Violin Quartett in D minor, and
                    tells us that “he thinks he has discovered that the feelings expressed by the
                    composer were those of a loving female on the point of being abandoned by the
                    hero whom she adores,” and that this luckless woman was Dido! All this, however,
                    is mere imagination, and every one is at liberty to exercise his own fancy in
                    such cases. In such a composition as Beethoven’s famous Pastoral Symphony, it
                    would certainly be impossible for any person to divine, merely from hearing it
                    played, what was meant to be expressed or imitated by the different movements of
                    that remarkable work. Unless he were previously told that such a movement was
                    meant to express the sensations excited by visiting a country scene; such
                    another, those felt beside a river; another movement meant to imitate a storm,
                    and so on; certainly his imagination might lead him to guess very wide of
                    Beethoven’s intentions. The only things that he could have no doubt of, if
                    accustomed to such rural sounds, would be the notes of the quail and the cuckoo,
                    introduced in the river scene. As to the nightingale, he could make nothing of
                    it, because the notes that Beethoven uses do not express the subtle song of that
                    bird, any more than Handel’s notes do in his song “Sweet Bird,” in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Penseroso.</hi> In the oratorios and operas of eminent composers
                    are to be found many instances <hi rend="italic">of</hi> attempted imitations,
                    most of which had better have been omitted. To attempt to imitate, by music, a
                    hail or a snow storm, the leaping or creeping of animals, the falling of walls,
                    and so on, is to mistake the powers of the art. A particular style of music may
                    sometimes be effectively employed to enforce the ideas conveyed by descriptive
                    words. In Haydn’s <hi rend="italic">Creation,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Seasons,</hi> we have several instances of this. Among other passages, we may
                    cite the song in the <hi rend="italic">Seasons</hi> (pp. 396 to 408 of Leipsic
                    Partition), describing the traveller wandering bewildered among the snow; and
                    the chorus, “Oh! the tempest comes” (pp. 203, 230). In other parts of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Seasons</hi> we find passages intended to express the rustling of
                    leaves, the running of a brook, the buzzing of flies, the crowing of a cock, the
                    croaking of frogs, &amp;c. but most of them unworthy of Haydn’s genius. The
                    overture to the <hi rend="italic">Seasons</hi> is intended to describe the
                    transition from winter to spring; the introduction to summer (p. 138), “the dawn
                    of day;” the introduction to autumn (p. 252), “the husbandman’s satisfaction in
                    contemplating the abundant harvest ;” the∙introduction to winter, “descriptive
                    of thick fogs.” All these are phenomena not susceptible of musical imitation;
                    and the consequence is, that the fancy of the hearer might lead him to associate
                    the pseudo-imitations with ideas totally different from those which Haydn
                    intended to suggest. The philosopher D’Alembert, says, “Si j’avois à exprimer
                    musicalement le feu, qui dans la séparation des <hi rend="italic">élemens</hi>
                    prend sa place au plus haut lieu, pourquoi ne le pourrois-je pas jusqu’à un
                    certain point par one suite de sons qui iroient en s’élévant avec rapidité ?”
                    and, a little after, “Si je voulois peindre le lever du soleil, pourquoi ne le
                    pourrois-je pas par one musique dont le son auroit un progrès assez lent, mais
                    iroit tout à la fois en s’élévant et en augmentant d’éclat, précisément comme le
                    soleil quand il se leve?” Haydn, in the representation of chaos in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Creation,</hi> and in the introduction to the recitative “In
                    splendour bright,” in the same oratorio, seems to have had D’Alembert’s ideas in
                    view.</p>
                <p>Many striking instances of indirect musical imitation may be found in the operas
                    of Gluck. One of them occurs in his opera of <hi rend="italic">Iphigenia,</hi>
                    in the scene where Agamemnon deplores his daughter’s lot in these words:
                    “J’entends retentir dans mon sein le cri plaintif de la nature,” &amp;c. This
                    “plaintive cry of nature” is expressed by the wailing notes of the oboe heard at
                    intervals,</p>
                <p>&amp;c. while the “oracles of destiny” are expressed by the gloomy and obstinate
                    re sponses of the bassoon,</p>
                <p>&amp;c.</p>
                <p>This remarkable passage is given, with a criticism upon it and some others from
                    Gluck, in the first volume of Forkel’s <hi rend="italic">Musikalisch-Kritische
                    Bibliothek.</hi></p>
                <p>The famous painter Leonardo da Vinci, in his Treatise on Painting (c. xvi.), thus
                    expresses himself regarding the aids to pictorial invention that may be derived
                    from the contemplation of confused objects: “Se riguarderai in alcuni muri
                    imbrattati, o pietre di vary mischj, potrai quivi vedere 1’inventione e
                    similitudine di diversi paesi, diverse battaglie, atti pronti di figure, Strane
                    arie di volti, et hab⅛i, e infinite altre cose; perche nelle cose contuse
                    l’ingegno si desta a nuove inventioni.” A painter of such genius as Leonardo da
                    Vinci may have his imaginative faculties thrown into action by “a blotched wall,
                    or by stones of various colours,” or by other objects that would <pb break="no"

                    an ordinary man. So it is with the musical composer endowed with genius. To
                    persons who feel and understand both poetry and music, poetry is well calculated
                    to suggest musical ideas. We should think little of the musical genius of a man
                    who could peruse the <hi rend="italic">Allegro,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Penseroso,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Comus</hi> of Milton, and feel their
                    beauties, without having his musical imagination strongly excited. To the
                    musician of a poetical temperament (such as Beethoven), the glories of sunrise
                    or sunset—the various gentler lights and shadows of morning or of evening—the
                    more solemn and mysterious lights and shadows of the moonlight landscape—the
                    wildness and vastness of mountainous scenery under all the aspects of “skyey
                    influences”—the calm or the agitated sea—the dreary sounds of the tempest—the
                    thrilling sublimity of the thunder-storm—will suggest musical ideas by some
                    strange alchemy of mind yet unknown to musical theorists.</p>
                <p>Musical invention, like poetical or pictorial, is really no more than the art of
                    combining, in new and remarkable forms, certain elements presented to us by
                    nature or by art. In music, vocal and instrumental, sounds are those elements;
                    in poetry, sounds and language, signs that fluctuate in their nature and uses,
                    and in their indications of innumerable external objects and endless shades of
                    human feelings and passions; in painting, forms of infinite variety, and colours
                    contrasted or combined in all the possible diversities of light and shadow. As
                    to musical invention, or originality in melody and harmony, those who have the
                    most extensive acquaintance with the musical compositions of the last two
                    centuries must perceive that there is very little originality to be found in the
                    compositions of our day. Melodic ideas and phrases, except of the most
                    artificial kind, were nearly exhausted before the commencement of the nineteenth
                    century. The works of Galnppi, Piccini, Sacchini, Paesiello, Sarti, and many
                    other Italians, are now hardly known to the public; and yet from them the more
                    modern melodists have drawn most of their best ideas of melody. The artificial
                    combinations of harmony, and successions of modulations, had been carried to a
                    great extent by some of the Italian composers—.the Scarlattis and others—and by
                    Handel and the Bachs and Bendas, and others among the Germans—before Haydn,
                    Mozart, and Beethoven directed the public attention, not so much to a new style
                    of melody and harmony, as to a <hi rend="italic">freer</hi> style of both
                    combined. They threw aside a number of fetters imposed upon composers by
                    unreasonable rules drawn by theorists from anterior compositions of a
                    conventional kind. Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven—especially the two former—seem
                    to have carried artificial music nearly as far as possible without rendering it
                    void of pleasing melody, clear design, and intelligible harmony. Most other
                    composers who have come after them, or who were their contemporaries, have done
                    little more than caricature their styles. Some of the more fashionable composers
                    who have deigned to keep any thing like melody in view, have had recourse to the
                    older and forgotten masters, and pillaged them without mercy. But, after aD, it
                    must be confessed that no limits can be assigned to change and innovation in an
                    art so vague and arbitrary in its general signification as music, and so
                    dependent upon the training given to the public ear. That beauty and deformity
                    are mere mental affections, and not existences separate from the sentient being
                    who feels them and judges of them, is proved every day by the diversity of human
                    opinions regarding productions of the fine arts. It is vain and absurd to argue
                    upon these matters. The old proverb that says “there is no disputing of tastes,”
                    holds not only in things affecting the nerves of the tongue and palate, but also
                    in things affecting the eye and the ear. It is not unworthy of remark, that the
                    word “taste” has been so transferred from its original signification as to be
                    applied, by common consent, to the senses of sight and hearing, and even to what
                    may be supposed to be more intimately intellectual judgments regarding the
                    merits of poetry and oratory. Where are we to find a perfect theory of poetry
                    and oratory? although these arts stand at the head of all human arts. Choron
                    writes as follows regarding musical invention: “In music, and in the arts in
                    general, we call <hi rend="italic">idea</hi> that which in a more exact language
                    we call thought. However that may be, the musical <hi rend="italic">thought</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">idea</hi> is usually a passage of melody which presents
                    itself to the mind of the composer with all its suitable accessories. From this
                    we perceive that there are many kinds of different ideas, according to the sort
                    of effects, whether simple or compound, which they employ. We ought also to
                    distinguish ideas into principal ideas and secondary ideas. The first are suited
                    to form the basis or foundation of a composition; the others are applied to the
                    development of the principal ideas. It requires art and experience to discern
                    whether an idea belongs to the one or to the other of these classes; and also to
                    perceive whether an idea is suited to the free or to the severe style of
                    composition; and to be able to develop it according to the rules applicable to
                    each of these styles. The art, or, more properly, the faculty of finding ideas,
                    is called invention. This term sufficiently indicates that we look upon
                    invention as almost entirely a gift of nature. No rules whatever can be laid
                    down upon this subject. We can only offer some observations which may be useful.
                    We distinguish two kinds of invention; invention properly so called, and
                    invention by imitation. What we have just said applies particularly to the
                    former kind; that kind of invention which creates new and original productions
                    that do not resémble preceding ones, and that serve as models for succeeding
                    productions. It is the most distinctive characteristic of genius. It is found in
                    the details as well as in the general structure; in the manner as well as in the
                    matter. An artist often shows as much genius in treating, in his own way, a
                    common idea, as he could by producing new ideas. Invention by imitation consists
                    in approximating, in peculiarities of style and manner, to some production
                    already known.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Clementi’s admirable preludes in imitation of the different styles of Haydn,
                    Mozart, Dussek, &amp;c.; and J. BÍ Cramer’s <hi rend="italic">parody</hi> of one
                    of Dussek’s Sonatas for the piano-forte; and Mozart’s compositions in imitation
                    of Handel’s style.</p></note> Although this seems more easy than the other, it
                    has its dangers and difficulties. The chief objection to it is the danger we
                    incur of falling into plagiarism; a danger which cannot be avoided if we have
                    not enough of imagination, taste, and skill, to enrich by accessories of our
                    own, or to disguise dexterously, the materials which we endeavour to appropriate
                    to ourselves. On the other hand, a happy imitation may be as good as a real
                    invention. The talent of invention is developed by a continual application of
                    mind to the object of invention, by the study of original works, and by
                    directing the attention to seek in all things for the relations that they may
                    have to the art which we cultivate. A thousand things that appear indifferent or
                    useless to an inattentive man, become very significant to him who refers every
                    thing to a principal object. We are often astonished that artists should have
                    been so happy in their invention, and ascribe this to superior genius. We should
                    be much more astonished if we knew to what circumstances they owe these
                    advantages. The greater part of their talent consists in neglecting nothing, and
                    in perceiving in what surrounds them every thing that can have connection with
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827568" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7568-0643"/> their art. If
                    we are attentive in collecting every thing that presents itself, and take care
                    to treasure up the ideas which occur in favourable moments, we shall soon form a
                    rich collection of materials from which we can draw when occasion requires.
                    Finally, we must never torture ourselves to find ideas; and must especially shun
                    that mania of originality which induces us to reject easy and natural ideas, and
                    to run after fantastical and perplexed ones. One may often present novelty under
                    a guise almost common. On the contrary, as Boileau says,</p>
                <p>Il est certains esprits dont la fougue insensée Toujours loin du droit sens va
                    chercher leur pensée, Ils croiroient s’abaisser dans leurs vers monstrueux S’ils
                    pensoient ce qu’un autre a pu penser comme eux·</p>
                <p>And all this is often mere lost labour; for an idea which at first seems new, on
                    account of the manner in which it is presented, is frequently reduced to nothing
                    when it is brought back to its true expression.</p>
                <p>“If the gift of invention is invaluable, we may say that the art of conducting
                    and developing ideas is not less important. We might cite many authors who,
                    though not remarkable for variety or originality, have yet acquired a great
                    reputation by the talent which they have shown in the development of their
                    ideas. Among such authors are Sacchini and Anfossi; and in the works of authors
                    verÿ rich in invention might be pointed out pieces that have become highly
                    celebrated, and of which the sole merit lies in the taste and the art shown in
                    the development of the ideas. Most of Haydn’s compositions are unrivalled models
                    of skill and judgment in the development of musical ideas, and the conduct of
                    the melody, harmony, and modulation. The study of double counterpoint,
                    especially of that in the octave, is of essential importance to the attainment
                    of skill in developing musical ideas. A knowledge of double counterpoint offers
                    numerous resources to the composer of a symphony, an overture, an instrumental
                    quartett, &amp;c.; and, indeed, without such knowledge, it is impossible to make
                    the most of one’s musical ideas. This kind of knowledge is far remote from the
                    dry and cumbrous learning of most of the older contrapuntists; learning which
                    generally served no better purpose than to enable them with great labour to
                    construct music <hi rend="italic">for the eye,</hi> and not for <hi
                    rend="italic">the ear.</hi> To show the advantages that a composer of symphonies
                    may derive from a knowledge of double counterpoint, we have only to refer to
                    Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. Among Haydn’s symphonies, the following movements
                    occur to us at this moment as containing examples of what we have just been
                    discussing. We refer the reader to the Partitions.</p>
                <p>No writer on composition has treated so fully as Reicha of the uses of double
                    counterpoint in the development of musical ideas. (See his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">de Haute Composition</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Musicale,</hi> a large and expensive work, of 596 folio pages.) It is to be
                    regretted that Reicha, in his two large works on composition, does not give
                    examples from the works of the best composers. He does not even give direct
                    references to such passages in the works of these composers as might illustrate
                    his rules and observations. A man so versed as he was in music of all kinds
                    could have done this easily; especially as his treatises were of great extent,
                    and could have admitted of many classical examples, instead of those which he
                    gives composed by himself or by his pupils. He says (p. 140 of first volume),
                    “Now-a-days, it is required that the employment of any counterpoint should be
                    effective. If a composer has not genius enough to accomplish this, he will do
                    well not to make use of counterpoint .. In all, the treatises where counterpoint
                    is spoken of, there is a defect, inasmuch as they neglect to show, in a
                    satisfactory manner, the true resources offered by counterpoint. This is the
                    cause that the public has never had a just idea of invertible harmony, and of
                    its utility. Here is an example of a double counterpoint in the octave.</p>
                <p>« This model of four measures gives eight in reckoning its inversion. This is
                    nearly all that is generally known. But what is to be done with eight measures,
                    it is asked, if there are no more? These eight measures may serve as
                    follows.</p>
                <p>“1. To form a canon for two unequal voices—(t. <hi rend="italic">e</hi> voices of
                    different pitch and compass).</p>
                <p>“2. To form an entire double fugue for two, three, or four Parts.</p>
                <p>“And, which is more important in our days, these eight measures can be employed,

                    movement in a symphony, &amp;c. where a very advantageous use of them may be
                    made; as, for example, fragment of a movement in a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193827581" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7581-0644"/> symphony for a grand
                    orchestra, formed entirely from the preceding counterpoint.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“This fragment being placed
                    in the second section of the movement, supposes that the first or the second
                    subject of the counterpoint, or both, have been previously heard in the first
                    section. Without this precaution, the hearer would feel it as something foreign
                    to the movement, as out of place, which would be a fault on the composer’s part.
                    To render this counterpoint appropriate</p><p>I</p><p>to the movement, it is
                    enough that the four measures form a part of tha <hi rend="italic">subject</hi>
                    of the movement.”</p></note></p>
                <p>Reicha then proceeds to show, by a Partition on the five following pages, the use
                    and development of this counterpoint in the fragment above alluded to. We must
                    refer to the passage in the original work.</p>
                <p>This term sometimes signifies the harmonic support given to a melody or to a
                    principal voice by one or more instruments, and sometimes means that knowledge
                    of chords which is required in playing from a figured bass, or from a Partition.
                    Since a voice or an instrument, or several voices or several instruments, may be
                    accompanied by one or more instruments, the variety of combinations of this kind
                    are almost endless. Melody, which forms the most expressive part of musical
                    language, and regulates the march of composition by different rhythms, usually
                    occupies either the highest or the lowest Part of a piece of music, in order to
                    become more conspicuous. But sometimes, to produce a particular effect, the
                    melody is placed in a middle Part. When this happens, or when it occupies the
                    lowest Part, the accompaniment must be disposed accordingly, and constructed in
                    such a manner as to produce the best possible effect in union with the melody.
                    Since accompaniment is always subordinate to melody, some persons have looked
                    upon it as an accessory of little importance, and have improperly compared it to
                    the frame of a picture, or to the pedestal of a statue. This comparison, though
                    having an appearance of justness, is really so absurd as to merit no refutation.
                    Other persons consider accompaniment as a purely mechanical work, which requires
                    only patience and application. If those persons mean by such work, the adding of
                    some insignificant chords to a melody, they are not in the wrong; but such
                    accompaniment is not that which we find in the works of Gluck, Piccini,
                    Sacchini, Mozart, Winter, Cherubini, and other great composers.</p>
                <p>Two of the most important instruments used in accompaniment are the organ and the
                    piano-forte. The organ is, in reality, a collection of wind-instruments of
                    different kinds, forming in itself a species of orchestra, but not capable of
                    the varied expression that can be given to a number of different
                    wind-instruments played upon by different performers. Its noble and solemn
                    effect renders it highly appropriate for the accompaniment of church-music; and
                    it is much to be regretted that, in more modern times, its true character and
                    powers have been too often lost sight of by injudicious composers and organists,
                    who have introduced a style of performance and accompaniment quite unsuitable to
                    the organ and to sacred music. The simple and <hi rend="italic">legato</hi>
                    style of accompaniment is that most suited to the nature and powers of the
                    organ. In a memoir upon church-music (in the Italian language) by J. P.
                    Schulthesius, there are many sensible observations upon this subject. The organ
                    forms the best accompaniment to choral music, and in this case the organist
                    ought to adhere to a simple and <hi rend="italic">legato</hi> style. As an
                    effective accompaniment to other sacred compositions, such as masses, &amp;c.,
                    the organ is too much neglected by modern composers. The organ accompaniment
                    ought always to be written in notes as the composer intends it to be performed,
                    and never left to be guessed at by the organist through the puzzling and
                    uncertain signs of a mere figured bass. We refer to what we have said on the
                    subject of thorough-bass in the section on harmony. When the organ is used along
                    with an orchestra, as in Haydn’s and Mozart’s masses, and others, it would often
                    be better for the effect, if the organ were more employed in strengthening the
                    bass Parts than in giving the full harmony of the chords; because, in the latter
                    case, the peculiar effects of some of the orchestra wind-instruments would be
                    obscured or overpowered. Fine effects may be produced by a judicious use of only
                    certain stops of the organ, even in accompanying with an orchestra. In some
                    modern organs, the compass of the finger-keys (reckoned upwards from the
                    eight-foot stop, or an open pipe eight feet long) is from the lowest C on the
                    piano-forte up to F in alt, with all the intermediate semitones. In many other
                    organs, the compass is not so extensive. There are, besides, stops of sixteen,
                    and sometimes (in the largest organs) of thirty-two feet pipes, for the pedals.
                    It must be observed, that in different organs the stops vary much in kind as
                    well as in number, and that all the stops do not extend throughout the whole
                    finger-keys, but in most organs serve for only one half of these keys. This is
                    not the place to enter more minutely into the structure of the organ. Most
                    foreign organs have pedals, or foot-keys, which generally extend to two octaves
                    of the lowest sounds.</p>
                <p>It does not appear to us that the extension, of late years, of the compass of the
                    piano-forte, beyond its former compass of five or five and a half octaves, has
                    been any real improvement of the instrument. The piano-forte is much used in
                    accompanying music of various kinds, vocal or instrumental, or both. Songs,
                    cantatas, vocal duetts, trios, quartette in chamber or concert-room music,
                    instrumental solos, orchestral symphonies or overtures, operatic music, and so
                    on, are all generally accompanied by a pianoforte. If the pianist understands
                    his instrument thoroughly, has a knowledge of composition, and is well practised
                    in reading from Partitions, he may give important assistance to the performers
                    whom he accompanies, even when there is a complete orchestral accompaniment
                    besides. He may do this more especially where singers are accompanied by an
                    orchestra. Supposing that a pianist has to accompany a piece of vocal music of
                    the old Italian school, and with nothing but the voice Part or Parts and a
                    figured bass before him; he must not only be a good harmonist, but also well
                    acquainted with the peculiar style <hi rend="italic">of</hi> harmony and
                    accompaniment suitable to such compositions, and really intended by the author,
                    although not expressed by the imperfect system of thorough-bass notation
                    anciently employed. Among these ancient composers, who were almost all excellent
                    harmonists, there was a method of accompaniment practised by them as
                    appropriate, and which, from tradition and habit, was clearly understood even by
                    means of the imperfect and conventional signs of thorough bass. But this is no
                    longer the case; and a modern pianist who would accompany a cantata of
                    Alessandro Scarlatti, or a duett of Clari, or a psalm of Marcello, and so on, as
                    the composer intended, must make a particular study of the older style of
                    accompaniment, otherwise he will fail in his attempt to accompany such
                    compositions.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827594" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7594-0645"/>
                <p>He will make the harmony too full, or too thin, or dispose T't in an unsuitable
                    manner. As we have not room for examples of the style of accompaniment suitable
                    to such music, we refer the reader to the edition of Marcello’s Psalms,
                    published in Paris some years ago by Mirecki, a pupil of Cherubini. It was
                    revised by Cherubini himself. In that work the accompaniments arc given as they
                    ought to be, and may serve as models for the accompaniment of such music, and of
                    much of the music of that period— the latter part of the seventeenth and the
                    earlier part of the eighteenth centuries. The accompaniment of the compositions
                    of that period for voices is generally attempted by modern pianists in mere dry
                    chords read from the thorough bass figures and notes. Such an accompaniment is
                    quite erroneous in so far as regards the composer’s intention, because the
                    accompaniment of these pieces roasan <hi rend="italic">accom-pagnamentο</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">figurato</hi> for three Parts, each of which Parts had its own
                    melodic progression, and the whole three were so contrived as to sustain the
                    voice or voices, and enforce the effect of these without overpowering them.</p>
                <p>To accompany a Partition from which the pianist has to select, on the instant,
                    those parts most important to the effect, while he leaves out others, or
                    portions of others, requires great practice and knowledge, especially with
                    regard to more modern Partitions. Formerly, the most important parts of a
                    Partition were the two violins, viola, and violoncello, forming a quartett that
                    represented the essential structure of the composition. The wind instruments
                    were at that time employed much more sparingly and less effectively than they
                    afterwards were in more modern music. There are other circumstances in the
                    structure of the older Partitions which render it less difficult to accompany
                    them than the more modern ones. But, with regard to the pianist’s accompaniment
                    of Partitions, especially modern ones, we may remark, that the attempt too often
                    made by injudicious accompaniers to crowd into the piano-forte accompaniment all
                    the orchestral effects that they see in a Partition, is worse than useless. The
                    thing is impossible, from the nature and powers of the piano-forte, and its
                    uniformity of <hi rend="italic">timbre.</hi> We have already alluded to this in
                    the section on Harmony. Where there is any particular and prominent design in
                    the Parts of a Partition, the pianist ought to adhere to it in his
                    accompaniment, in so far as the nature of such design and the powers of his
                    instrument will permit. In many cases he must be content to sacrifice much of
                    the design, and of the grace and freedom of movement, found in the Parts of the
                    Partition, and to arrange his accompaniment in such a way as to make the most of
                    the difficulties presented to him by the construction of the Parts. This will
                    frequently occur to him in accompanying modern Partitions, which often contain
                    so elaborate a construction of Parts as almost to defy any attempt to represent
                    even a shadow of them in the pianoforte accompaniment. The best way of learning
                    how such intricate Partitions may be suitably accompanied by the piano-forte, or
                    how they may be arranged for the pianoforte, so as to accompany the voice Parts
                    (for example) without any other instrument, is to study carefully the best
                    Italian and German arrangements of the best Italian and German operas,
                    oratorios, masses, &amp;c. for the piano-forte, with the voice Parts; for
                    example, Clementi’s admirable arrangement of Haydn’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Creation;</hi> the best French or German editions of the similarly arranged
                    masses and operas of Mozart, Winter, Cherubini, Beethoven, &amp;c. To render
                    this study really useful, the accompanier must, at the same time, have before
                    him, and consider attentively, the Partitions from which these arrangements were
                    made. No abstractrules can teach the art of accompaniment. Nothing but talent,
                    experience, and observation can do so; and therefore we would urge the student
                    to go at once to the interesting fountain-head of good models, and not to waste
                    time upon dry technicalities. Many pianists make a very easy matter of
                    accompaniment, by reducing it to a series of dry chords <hi rend="italic"
                    >(accords plaques')</hi> or else broken chords in the vulgar form of what some
                    musicians used to term “chopped hay.” For the proper piano-forte accompaniment
                    of modern songs, duetts, &amp;c. the reader may consult the compositions of this
                    kind by Haydn, Mozart, Cherubini, Beethoven, Himmel, &amp;c. where the
                    accompaniments are written by the composers themselves. The harp, although
                    introduced of late years into orchestras, is not very effective in such a
                    situation, unless when occasionally left nearly alone to accompany some vocal
                    Part in an opera, or in concert-room music. It serves better for an
                    accompaniment in chamber-music. The guitar, skilfully managed, forms a pleasing
                    accompaniment to a single voice in songs of a certain character. Although the
                    greater part of its sounds belong to the bass and tenor range, music for the
                    guitar is written in the treble clef; so that the sounds heard are really each
                    an octave lower than they are represented by the notation.</p>
                <p>Before we conclude this section, we must advert to a fault not uncommon in the
                    compositions of Germans for voices with orchestral accompaniments. Even Mozart
                    himself has sometimes committed this fault. It occurs when the harmony for two
                    or three voices is incomplete, and a succession of fourths, for example, is left
                    to have the harmony completed by some of the instruments of the orchestra. This
                    filling up of the harmony by the instruments does not produce the desired
                    effect; for the imperfect harmony of the voices,—from their peculiar and
                    prominent <hi rend="italic">timbre,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> is still
                    perceived. The best modern Italian composers are more careful in this respect.
                    They make the harmony oftheir voice Parts complete in itself, and independent of
                    completion from the orchestral accompaniment.</p>
                <p>The comparative simplicity of orchestral combinations in the works of the older
                    composers has been adverted to in the preceding section. Gluck, in the latter
                    part of the eighteenth century, was one of the first composers who introduced
                    wind instruments into the orchestra in a manner more effective than had till
                    then been practised. Any musician who will take the trouble to examine Gluck’s
                    Partitions will perceive that they suggested to other composers many ideas of
                    orchestral effect from the use of wind instruments,—ideas more fully developed
                    by Haydn, Mozart, Cherubini, Mehul, Beethoven, and others. The invention of new
                    instruments, the improvement of old ones, the introduction into orchestras of
                    instruments formerly confined to military music, have produced a superabundance
                    of materials for orchestral effect; a superabundance sadly abused by many modern
                    composers. The consequence of such ’abuse has been too frequently nothing better
                    than a chaotic confusion, arising from the simultaneous combination of so many
                    heterogeneous instruments. The <hi rend="italic">elaborate noise</hi> of a
                    modern orchestra is sometimes so great as to stun all ears but those petrified
                    by custom. Men who serve artillery get so accustomed to the din and roar of
                    cannon that they suffer no more annoyance from such noise than other untrained
                    persons do from the distant explosion of a spent rocket in its highest altitude.
                    They come at last to relish the martial din that deafens a common bystander.</p>
                <p>In the section upon voices and instruments, we have occasionally adverted to the
                    most suitable employment of some of the latter in orchestral music. We shall
                    here offer a few more remarks upon this subject, and upon orchestra music in
                    general.</p>
                <p>A complete orchestra consists of a number of stringed instruments and wind
                    instruments, and a few instruments of percussion; the latter being generally
                    kettle-drums. The nature and magnitude of an orchestra must be regu∙∙</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827607" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7607-0646"/>
                <p>lated by the locality, since a large orchestra in a small theatre or
                    concert-room, or the converse, would be ineffective, though from different
                    causes. The relative proportion of the instruments in an orchestra is of much
                    importance to its effect. The orchestra of the Italian opera at Vienna is small,
                    in order to suit the locality. It was recently as follows: one conductor, one
                    violin <hi rend="italic">obbligato</hi> for accompanying particular parts of the
                    vocal music, one leader and five first violins, six second violins, four viole,
                    four violoncellos, four double basses, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two
                    French horns, two bassoons, two trumpets, three trombones, one drum, one double
                    drum, one piano-forte; in all forty-three instruments. This is about the same
                    number and proportion as in the orchestras of Dresden, Francfort, and the
                    Italian opera at Paris. The orchestra of the opera at Berlin is much larger, on
                    account of the greater size of the house. In those smaller orchestras, the wind
                    instruments are suited in size and tone to the fewness of the stringed
                    instruments. The double basses, too, are small sized, and have four strings,
                    except the principal one, which has five, to facilitate the execution of
                    difficult passages. The orchestra of the grand opera at Paris lately consisted
                    of twenty first violins, twenty second violins, fourteen viole, thirteen
                    violoncellos, six three-stringed double basses, three four-stringed double
                    basses, four harps, four flutes, four oboes, four clarinets, four bassoons,
                    three trombones, horns, trumpets, kettledrums, one serpent. The number of
                    performers in the orchestras of the Scala at Milan, and San Carlo at Naples,
                    used to be, at most, about ninety-three; but their number varies, and has of
                    late been reduced.</p>
                <p>Trumpets, trombones, the serpent, and kettle-drums, are too noisy to be suited to
                    a small orchestra; and the judicious composer will, in such a case, avoid them.
                    In writing for an orchestra, the stringed instruments form, as it were, the body
                    of the composition, or a complete harmony in four Parts among themselves. This
                    quartett consists of first and second violin, viola, and violoncello; the double
                    basses being employed to enforce the violoncello Part. The number of violins,
                    viole, and violoncellos, makes no difference in the real harmony of this
                    quartett, because if there are twenty first violins they all play the same Part,
                    and so of the second violins, and viole and violoncellos respectively. But, for
                    the sake of variety, the full quartett is not always continued through a whole
                    movement, but is sometimes interrupted by harmony in two or three Parts, and by
                    passages in unisons or octaves. Occasionally, also, but more rarely, the
                    stringed instruments cease altogether for a short period, to allow a passage for
                    wind instruments alone to be heard with more effect from contrast; for instance,
                    in the trio of Beethoven’s first symphony in D major, Op. 36; in the trio of his
                    symphony in C major, Op. 21; and in the trio of his <hi rend="italic">Sinfonia
                    Eroica,</hi> Op. 55; and, <hi rend="italic">passim,</hi> in the orchestral
                    compositions of Haydn, Mozart, Cherubini, Weber, Spohr, &amp;c. The stringed
                    instruments of the orchestra are often employed without being accompanied by any
                    of the wind instruments. By the addition of wind instruments of different kinds,
                    and in different ways, to the stringed instruments, a great variety of
                    combinations and effects take place, which open a wide field of resources to the
                    composer. It is important to remark, that whether the stringed instruments form
                    a quartett, a trio, or a duett, their harmony ought to be good in itself,
                    independently of the addition of any wind instruments. The same remark applies
                    to the harmony of a duett, trio, or quartett, formed by a combination of wind
                    instruments. The harmony must be good and pure independently of any filling up
                    by the addition of stringed instruments. It is hardly necessary to say, that the
                    uses which may be made of all these possible combinations of the wind
                    instruments with the stringed ones, or of wind instruments with wind
                    instruments, depend entirely for their good effect upon the skill and judgment
                    of the composer. One of the wind instruments added to the stringed ones, may
                    either double one of the parts of these, if its nature permit it to do so, or
                    may have a distinctive melody given to it, and be accompanied by all, or by only
                    one, or two, or three, of these Parts; and thus, in the latter case, form with
                    them a quintett, or a quartett, or a trio, or a duett, for the time being. Thus,
                    the bassoon, or the horn, for example, may double the bass Part of the stringed
                    instrument quartett of the orchestra, or any of the other Parts, to produce a
                    particular effect of reinforcement; or it may have a distinctive melody, and be
                    accompanied as before mentioned. The same remark extends to the flute, the oboe,
                    the clarinet; with this exception, that instruments of a high pitch, like these,
                    are not properly employed to double the bass Parts of the orchestra. By this <hi
                    rend="italic">doubling</hi> of a Part is to be understood the addition to it of
                    another instrumental Part, which performs the same melody in unison, or in
                    octave higher or lower, according to the nature and compass of the added
                    instrument. When accompanying a wind instrument of a grave pitch with two
                    violins, the accompaniment is generally above the melody. In this case, the
                    melody should form a good bass to the accompanying harmony; and if it does not,
                    then the orchestral basses must be employed to supply the defect. To accompany a
                    bass instrument which has a principal melody, with other instruments of a higher
                    pitch, often requires much dexterity in the management of the harmony.</p>
                <p>The number of possible combinations of the different instruments in an orchestra
                    is so great, that we cannot here attempt to enter into the subject. We have
                    given some hints that may be useful to the student; but, to study the art of
                    orchestral combinations with most pleasure and most advantage, one must have
                    recourse to the Partitions of the best German and Italian composers of operatic
                    and orchestral music, from Glnck and Piccini downwards to Haydn, Mozart,
                    Cherubini, Beethoven, Spohr, Rossini, Weber, &amp;c. In studying the Partitions
                    of some of the latest composers, one should guard against being led away by the
                    love of noise and the affectation of singularity too often found in them.</p>
                <p>If even what we have had space for upon a subject so extensive as Music should be
                    of use to the young professional student, or to the real amateur, our object—the
                    advancement of music in our native country—will be so far attained. We conclude
                    by requesting the musical student to keep in view that there is no royal road to
                    a true knowledge of his art; and also that in music, as well as in other things,
                    Condillac’s observation holds true: <hi rend="italic">“Les règles sont comme des
                    garde-fous mis sur les ponts, non pas pour faire marcher les voyageurs, mais
                    pour les empêcher de tomber.''</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(g. f. g.)</hi><pb
