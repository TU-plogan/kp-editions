                <p><label type="entry">MOUNTAIN</label>, a considerable eminence of land, elevated
                    above the surrounding country. It is commonly full of inequalities, cavities
                    more or less exposed, and strata uncovered.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Attraction</hi> of <hi rend="smallcaps">Mountains</hi> is a
                    comparatively recent discovery, and affords a very considerable confirmation of
                    Sir Isaac Newton’s theory of universal gravity. According to the Newtonian
                    system, an attractive power is not only exerted between those large masses of
                    matter which constitute the sun and planets, but likewise between all
                    comparatively smaller bodies, and even between the smallest particles of which
                    they are composed. Agreeably to this hypothesis, a heavy body, which ought to
                    gravitate or tend towards the centre of the earth, in a direction perpendicular
                    to its surface, supposing the said surface to be perfectly even and spherical,
                    ought likewise, though in a less degree, to be attracted and tend towards <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> mountain placed upon the earth’s surface; so that the
                    plumb-line, for instance, of a quadrant, hanging in the neighbourhood of such a
                    mountain, ought to be drawn from a perpendicular situation, in consequence of
                    the attractive power of the quantity of matter of which it is composed, acting
                    in a direction different from that exerted by the whole mass of matter in the
                    earth, and with a proportionally inferior degree of force.</p>
                <p>Though Sir Isaac Newton had long ago hinted at an experiment of this kind, and
                    had remarked, that “a mountain of an hemispherical figure, three miles high and
                    six broad, would not, by its attraction, draw the plumb-line two minutes out of
                    the perpendicular j” <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> yet no attempt to ascertain
                    this matter by actual experiment was made till about the year 1738, when the
                    French academicians, particularly MM. Bouguer and Condamine, who were sent to
                    Peru to measure a degree under the equator, attempted to discover the attractive
                    power of Chimboraço, a mountain in the province of Quito. According to their
                    observations, which however were made under circumstances by no means favourable
                    to an accurate solution of so nice and difficult a problem, the mountain of
                    Chimboraço exerted an attraction equal to about eight seconds. Though this
                    experiment was not perhaps sufficient to prove satisfactorily even the reality
                    of an attraction, much less the precise quantity of it, yet it does not appear
                    that any steps have since been taken to repeat it.</p>
                <p>Through the munificence of his Britannic majesty, the Royal Society were enabled
                    to undertake the execution of this delicate and importantexperiment; and the
                    astronomer royal was chosen to conduct it. After various inquiries, the mountain
                    of Schehallien, situated nearly in the centre of Scotland, was pitched upon as
                    the most proper for the purpose that could be found in this island. The
                    observations were made by taking the meridian zenith distances of different
                    fixed stars near the zenith, by means of a zenith sector of ten feet radius;
                    first on the south, and afterwards on the north side of the hill, the greatest
                    length of which extended in an easterly and westerly direction.</p>
                <p>It is evident, that if the mass of matter in the hill exerted any sensible
                    attraction, it would cause the plumb-line of the sector, through which an
                    observer viewed a star in the meridian, to deviate from its perpendicular
                    situation, and would attract it contrariwise at the two stations, thereby
                    doubling the effect. On the south side, the plummet would be drawn to the
                    northward by the attractive power of the hill placed to the northward of it; and
                    on the north side, a contrary and equal deflection of the plumb-line would take
                    place in consequence of the attraction of the hill, now to the southward of it.
                    The apparent zenith distances of the stars would be affected contrariwise; those
                    being increased at the one station which were diminished at the other; and the
                    correspondent quantities of the deflection of the plumb-line would give the
                    observer the sum of the contrary attractions of the hill, acting on the plummet
                    at the two stations; so that the half would of course indicate the attractive
                    power of the hill.</p>
                <p>The various operations requisite for performing this experiment lasted about four
                    months; and from them it appears that the sum of the two contrary attractions of
                    the mountain of Schehallien, in the two temporary observations which were
                    successively made half way up the hill (where the effect of its attraction would
                    be greatest), was equal to H"∙6. From a rough computation, founded on the known
                    law of gravitation, and on an assumption that the density of the hill is equal
                    to the mean density of the earth, it appears that the attraction of the hill
                    should amount to about the double of this quantity. From this it was inferred
                    that the density of the hill is only about half the mean density of the earth.
                    It does not appear, however, that the mountain of Schehallien has ever been a
                    volcano, or is hollow, as it is extremely solid and dense, and seemingly
                    composed of an entire rock. The inferences drawn from these experiments may be
                    reduced to the following.</p>
                <p>1. It appears that the moun tain of Schehallien exerts a sensible attraction;
                    therefore, by the rules of philosophizing, we are warranted to conclude, that
                    every mountain, and indeed every particle of the earth, is endowed with the same
                    property, in proportion to its quantity of matter.</p>
                <p>2. The law of the variation of this force, in the inverse ratio of the squares of
                    the distances, as laid down by Sir Isaac Newton, was also confirmed by this
                    experiment. For if the force of attraction of the hill had been only to that of
                    the earth, as the matter in the hill to that of the earth, and had not been
                    greatly increased by the near approach to its centre, the attraction thereof
                    must have been wholly insensible. But now, by only supposing the mean density of
                    the earth to be double that of the hill, which seems very probable from other
                    considerations, the attraction of the hill will be reconciled to the general law
                    of the variation of attraction in the inverse duplicate ratio of the distances,
                    as deduced by Sir Isaac Newton from the comparison of the motion of the heavenly
                    bodies with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth; and the analogy of
                    nature will be preserved.</p>
                <p>3. We may now, therefore, be allowed to admit this law, and to acknowledge that
                    the mean density of the earth is at least double of that at the surface, and
                    consequently that the density of the internal parts of the earth <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> By a very easy calculation, it is found that such a
                    mountain would attract the plumb-line 1' 18" from the perpendicular.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826801" xml:id="kp-eb0715-6801-0584"/>
                <p>is much greater than near the surface. Hence, also, the whole quantity of matter
                    in the earth will be at least as great again as if it bad been all composed of
                    matter of the same density with that at the surface, or will be about four or
                    five times as great as if it were all composed of water. This conclusion, Dr
                    Maskelyne adds, is totally contrary to the hypothesis of some naturalists, “who
                    suppose the earth to be only a great hollow shell of matter, supporting itself
                    from the property of an arch, with an immense vacuity in the midst of it.” But
                    were that the case, the attraction of mountains, and even smaller inequalities
                    in the earth’s surface, would, contrary to experiment, be very great, and would
                    affect the measures of the degrees of the meridian much more than we find they
                    do; and the variation of gravity, in different latitudes, in going from the
                    equator to the poles, as found by pendulums, would not be near so regular as it
                    has been found by experiment to be.</p>
                <p>4. As mountains are by these experiments found capable of producing sensible
                    deflections of the plumb-lines of astronomical instruments, it becomes a matter
                    of great importance, in the mensuration of degrees in the meridian, either to
                    choose places where the irregular attraction of the elevated parts may be small;
                    or where, by their situation, they may compensate or counteract the effectsof
                    each other.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mountain</hi><hi rend="italic">of Forty Days,</hi> a
                    mountain of Judaea, situated in the plain of Jericho, to the north of that city.
                    According to the Abbé Mariti’s description, the summit of it is covered neither
                    with shrubs, nor turf, nor earth; it consists of a solid mass of white marble,
                    the surface of which has become yellow by the injuries of the air. « The path by
                    which you ascend to it,” says this writer, “fills one with terror, as it rises
                    with a winding course between two abysses, which the eye dares scarcely behold.
                    This path is at first pretty broad, but it at length becomes so confined, that
                    one can with difficulty place both feet upon it at the same time. When we had
                    ascended a little higher, we found an Arab stretched out on the path, who made
                    us pay a certain toll for our passage. Here the traveller requires courage. One
                    of the parapets of the path being broken, we clung to the part which remained
                    until we had reached a small grotto, situated very commodiously, as it gave us
                    an opportunity of recovering our breath. When we had rested ourselves a little,
                    we pursued our course, which became still more dangerous. Suspended almost from
                    the rock, and having before our eyes all the horror of the precipice, we could
                    advance only by dragging one foot after the other; so that had the smallest
                    fragments given way under us, we should have been hurried to the bottom of this
                    frightful abyss.</p>
                <p>“This mountain is one of the highest in the province, and one of its most sacred
                    places. It takes its name from the rigorous fast which Christ observed here
                    after having triumphed over the vanities of the world and the power of hell. In
                    remembrance of this miracle, a chapel was formerly constructed on the summit of
                    the mountain. It may be seen from the plain, but we could not approach it, as
                    the path was almost entirely destroyed. It, however, may be accessible on the
                    other side of the mountain, which we did not visit. A great many scattered
                    grottos are seen here; in one of which, according to Q,uaresmius, were deposited
                    the bodies of several anchorets, which are still entire. I have heard the same
                    thing asserted in the country, but I could never meet with any person who had
                    seen them. Here we enjoyed the most beautiful prospect imaginable. This part of
                    the Mountain of Forty Days overlooks the mountains of Arabia, the country of
                    Gilead, the country of the Ammonites, the plains of Moab, the plain of Jericho,
                    the river Jordan, and the whole extent of the Dead Sea. It was here that the
                    devil said to the Son of God, ‘ All these kingdoms will I give thee, if thou
                    wilt fall down and worship me.’”</p>
