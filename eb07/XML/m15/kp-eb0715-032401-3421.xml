                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Molluscous animals to which our attention is to be
                    directed in this article, formed, for a long period, two distinct objects of
                    study. The <hi rend="italic">naked species</hi> were considered as constituting
                    a particular group, to which the term <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusea</hi> was in
                    a great measure restricted; whilst the <hi rend="italic">shelly species</hi>
                    attracted a large share of attention, being known as objects of study by the
                    term <hi rend="smallcaps">Conchology.</hi> Of late years, however, this kind of
                    systematical separation of the naked and shelly species has been supported by
                    few advocates, whilst those who have urged the propriety of their union have not
                    only been numerous, but acknowledged as the intelligent and successful
                    investigators of nature. In consequence of these changes, which have taken place
                    in public opinion by the introduction of more correct notions of the principles
                    of classification, we have in this edition of our work, resolved on
                    incorporating the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusea</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Conchology,</hi> suppressing the latter term as unnecessary.
                    Indeed, in a physiological point of view, there is no definite boundary between
                    the naked and the shelly species, many of the reputed naked species having
                    shells concealed under their integuments, while in many of the shelly species,
                    the solid plate or shell can only be reached by removing the surrounding soft or
                    fleshy matter. But the propriety of abandoning the old divisions will become
                    sufficiently obvious, when we consider that all the species belong to one group
                    in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Invertebrate</hi> class of animals; that the organs
                    of the species have many points of resemblance; and that although differences
                    prevail in the character of the <hi rend="italic">protecting covering,</hi> the
                    gradations from one condition of the integuments to another, are too minute, in
                    many cases, to admit of precise limits being fixed. We shall therefore consider
                    <hi rend="italic">shells</hi> as peculiar modifications of the external
                    coverings of certain species, and, in this subordinate character, incorporate
                    the naked and shelly species; having recourse to the integuments, however, in
                    connection with the other organs, in the distribution of the genera and other
                    divisions of the class now denominated <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusea.</hi></p>
                <p>In treating of this extensive division of the invertebrate animals, we shall
                    confine our remarks to a general view of their physiology, taking notice of the
                    peculiarities of their forms, organs, and functions. This will prepare us for a
                    condensed view of the progress of the science, in reference to systematical
                    arrangement, and the illustration of the characters of those divisions or groups
                    into which the species may be distributed, whether for assisting the student in
                    his labours of investigation, or for facilitating the judicious disposition of
                    the established truths of the science. We shall then advert, in the last place,
                    to molluscous animals as objects of utility. The limits of the article will
                    unavoidably restrict us to a very brief exposition of the various subjects
                    connected with this very extensive department of natural history.</p>
                <p>CHAP. I PHYSIOLOGY.</p>
                <p>Molluscous animals exhibit very remarkable differences, both in their form and in
                    the number and position of their external members. Neither head nor foot can be
                    observed in some species; the principal organs being enclosed in a bag pierced
                    with apertures for the entrance of the food, and egress of the excrementitious
                    matter. In others, with an exterior still remarkably simple, cuticular
                    elongations, termed <hi rend="italic">Tentacula,</hi> surround the mouth, and a
                    foot, or instrument of motion, may likewise be perceived. This last organ is in
                    some free at one extremity, in others attached to the body throughout its whole
                    length. In many species there is,a head, not, however, analogous to that member
                    in the vertebral animals, and containing the brain and organs of the senses, but
                    distinguished merely as the anterior extremity of the body, separated from the
                    back by a slight groove, and containing the mouth and <hi rend="italic"
                    >tentacula.</hi></p>
                <p>In many of the animals of this division, the different members of the body are in
                    pairs, and are arranged, in reference to a mesial plane, into right and left. In
                    some, a part only of the organs has respect to a mesial plane, other parts being
                    single, or in unequal numbers. In other species, the organs, which are not in
                    pairs, are arranged round a central axis, and give to the external form a
                    radiated appearance. But these characters are exceedingly variable and
                    uncertain, as indicating the limits of particular tribes; since, in different
                    parts of the same animal, modifications of all these forms may be readily
                    distinguished.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">skin</hi> of molluscous animals is more simple in its
                    structure, than the same organ in the vertebral animals. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >cuticle</hi> is here very distinct; and, as in other classes, it is thick and
                    coarse where much exposed, but thin and delicate in its texture, where it lines
                    the internal cavities. A <hi rend="italic">mucous</hi> web may be detected in
                    the cuttle fish and slug, but of great tenuity. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >corium</hi> is destitute of a villous surface; and on its central aspect it is
                    so intimately united to cellular substance, that its fibrous structure can
                    scarcely be distinguished. The <hi rend="italic">muscular</hi> web may, in
                    general, be readily perceived. Its fibres proceed in various directions,
                    according to the kind of motion to be executed, and extend or corrugate the skin
                    at pleasure.</p>
                <p>The appendices of the skin in this class of animals ought to be carefully
                    studied, as they furnish the most obvious marks for distinguishing species, and
                    for constructing divisions in their systematical arrangement. The appendices of
                    the cuticle are few in number, and perhaps ought to be considered as limited to
                    <hi rend="italic">hairs.</hi> These, in some species, invest the surface
                    regularly and closely, and may be observed on those which live on land, as well
                    as those which reside in water. In some cases the hairs may be considered as
                    united, and forming continuous crusts or ridges. These hairs, as well as the
                    cuticle, are liable to be worn off, and in some places can seldom be perceived,
                    unless in early age.</p>
                <p>The most important appendix to the skin, for such it must be considered, appears
                    to be the <hi rend="italic">shell.</hi> This part is easily preserved, exhibits
                    fine forms and beautiful colours, and has long occupied the attention of the
                    conchologist. The matter of the shell is secreted by the corium, and the form
                    which it assumes is regulated by the body of the animal. It is coeval with the
                    existence of the animal, and appears previous to the exclusion from the egg; nor
                    can it be dispensed with during the continuance of existence. The solid matter
                    of the shell consists of carbonate of lime, united with a small portion of
                    animal matter, resembling coagulated albumen.</p>
                <p>The mouth of the shell is extended by the application of fresh layers of the
                    shelly matter to the margin, and its thickness is increased by a coating on the
                    inner surface. These statements are abundantly confirmed by the observations of
                    Reaumur, <hi rend="italic">(Mémoires de</hi><hi rend="italic">l’</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Académie</hi><hi rend="italic">des Sciences,</hi> 1709), whose
                    accurate experiments have greatly contributed to the elucidation of conchology.
                    If a hole be made in the shell of a snail, and a piece of skin so glued to the
                    inner margin as to cover the opening, the shelly matter will not ooze out from
                    the broken margin of the fracture, and cover the outside of the skin, but will
                    form a coating on its inner surface, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823434"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-3434-0325"/> thus proving it to have exuded from the body of
                    the animal. When a portion of the mouth of the shell of a snail is broken off,
                    and a piece of skin glued to the inner margin, reflected outwardly, and fixed on
                    the body of the shell, the defective part is again supplied, and the matter
                    added to the inner surface of the skin, thus leaving the interposed substance
                    between the new formed portion and the fractured edge. Similar experiments,
                    repeated on a variety of shells, both univalve and bivalve, by different
                    naturalists, leave no room to doubt that shells increase in size by the
                    juxtaposition of shelly matter from the common integuments.</p>
                <p>Each calcareous layer is more or less enveloped in the animal matter which we
                    have already stated as being present; so that the different layers of successive
                    growth may, by various processes, be distinctly exhibited. If the shell has been
                    exposed for a short time in the fire, the animal matter will appear charred, and
                    its black colour, contrasted with the white earthy matter, will indicate the
                    arrangement of the different strata; in the same manner as the ivory and enamel
                    of a tooth can be distinguished, when subjected to similar treatment. The same
                    satisfactory results may be obtained by a different process. If the shell be
                    steeped in weak muriatic acid, the earthy matter will be dissolved, and the
                    flakes of albumen will remain as the frame-work of the edifice.</p>
                <p>The layers of growth may often be distinguished on the surface of the shell, in
                    the form of striae or ridges, more or less elevated, but parallel to the margin
                    of the aperture. Other inequalities may likewise be observed on the surface, at
                    right angles to the layers of growth, such as ridges, knobs, and spines. These
                    last derive their origin from the inequalities of the skin on which they have
                    been moulded.</p>
                <p>In some univalve shells, the layers of growth parallel to the opening cannot be
                    discerned; when exposed in the fire, there is little darkening of colour; and
                    when dissolved in acids, but a feeble trace of animal matter remains. In the
                    fire, these shells crack in various directions, but exhibit no trace of a sealy
                    structure. By careful management with the file, the shell may be separated into
                    a central layer contiguous to the skin, and a peripheral layer, both similar in
                    structure, though frequently differing in colour. The shells exhibiting such
                    characters have been termed <hi rend="italic">porcellaneous,</hi> from their
                    dense structure, and the fine polish which their surface presents. The formation
                    of shells of this kind must take place in a different manner from those of the
                    first kind which we have noticed.</p>
                <p>If we attend to the form of a young shell belonging to the genus cypraea of
                    Linnaeus, we may perceive that an addition of shelly matter to the margin of the
                    aperture, in the manner in which it is applied in other shells, would not
                    enlarge the cavity, but completely close the aperture. The increase of the
                    shell, (accompanied with a corresponding increase of its inhabitant), must take
                    place, therefore, either by absorption of the accumulated shelly matter of the
                    mouth, and an elongation in the direction of the greatest curvature of the
                    shell; or the old shell must be thrown off, and a new one produced, suited to
                    the size of the animal. The former supposition has not been entertained, the
                    latter is now generally received by naturalists, though there are a few
                    individuals unwilling to adopt such a view of the matter. The inner coat of such
                    shells appears to be a transudation from the body of the animal, and the outer
                    one to be laid on the surface by the loose reflected lobes of the cloak. In many
                    other shells, portions of matter, more compact than the other parts, may be
                    observed spread on the pillar, and applied to the margin of the mouth by a
                    similar process. Mr. Platt, in support of Reaumur’s opinion, that shells are
                    formed by juxtaposition, against the objections of Mr. Poupart, <hi
                    rend="italic">(Phil. Trans,</hi> vol. liv. p. 43), erroneously considers the
                    different sizes of the cypreae as depending on the thickness of the shell
                    increasing according to age, without admitting a cor responding increase of the
                    dimensions of the contained animal, or cavity for its reception.</p>
                <p>The shells of the first kind which we have noticed, from being formed of cones or
                    layers applied to the inner edge of the margin, and extending beyond it, have an
                    <hi rend="italic">imbricated</hi> structure. Those of the second kind,
                    consisting of layers regularly superimposed, have consequently a <hi
                    rend="italic">lαminated</hi> structure; but between the two kinds there are
                    numerous intermediate links, formed by a combination of the two processes.</p>
                <p>In some cases, the hard parts of the skin are not entitled to the appellation of
                    shell, but may rather be considered as horn. Such are the coverings of the
                    mandibles of the cuttle fish, the branchial lid of the aplysia, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">operculum</hi> of the welk. The two last appendices, however,
                    though horny in some species, are shelly in others.</p>
                <p>The position of the shell, with respect to the constituent layers of the
                    integuments, exhibits very remarkable differences. In some it appears instead of
                    a cuticle, or at least without an external membrane investing it. In general,
                    however, it occurs between the cuticle and the skin; a position which induced
                    Cuvier <hi rend="italic">(Lec.AEAnat. Comp.</hi> xiv. 11.) to consider it as
                    analogous to the mucous web of the vertebral animals. Its intimate connection
                    with the muscular system of the animal, and the protection which it affords,
                    seem adverse to such a conclusion. In many species the testaceous substance
                    occurs in folds of the corium, or inserted in its substance. In this position it
                    never acquires the solid texture which shells exposed, or covered only by the
                    cuticle, exhibit. Those shells which are thus concealed are in general white;
                    those which are more exposed are frequently coloured. The colouring, however,
                    does not depend on the direct exposure to the light, as some have imagined, for
                    many shells which are destitute of a cuticle are white, while many of those
                    covered with a dense cuticle are finely variegated beneath.</p>
                <p>Between the skin and the shell neither vessels nor nerves have been traced; and
                    the manner in which the latter is formed, forbids us to expect their existence.
                    Yet the shell cannot be considered as dead matter, so long as it remains in
                    connection with the living animal. In those animals in which the shell is
                    external, there are muscles which connect the animal with its internal surface,
                    and the bond of union being a substance soluble in water, the muscle can be
                    detached by maceration. The analogy between shell and bone is here obvious,
                    although in the one case the connection between the muscle and the bone is
                    permanent, in the other, between the muscle and shell, temporary, or frequently
                    changed during the life of the animal. But the vitality of the shell, if I may
                    use the expression, is demonstrated, from the changes which it undergoes when
                    detached from the animal: the plates of animal matter harden: the epidermis
                    dries, cracks, and falls off; and in many cases the colours fade or disappear.
                    We confess ourselves unable to point out the means employed by the animal to
                    prevent these changes from taking place, by any process similar to circulation.
                    The difficulty, however, is felt in contemplating the functions of hairs, nails,
                    and feathers, in vertebrated animals.</p>
                <p>When the shelly covering consists of two or more pieces, they are joined
                    together, as the articulated bones in the higher classes of animals, by
                    ligaments. These, in some cases, are of great thickness and strength, and, in
                    consequence of their elasticity, assist in the motion of the different
                    parts.</p>
                <p>In the molluscous animals the skin secretes a viscous, adhesive substance,
                    differing according to the medium in which the animal resides, but in all cases
                    calculated to resist its influence. It is probably owing to the lubricating
                    agency of this secretion, that both the cuticle and shell are preserved from
                    decomposition. The skin likewise secretes the colouring matter by which the
                    shells are variegated.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823447" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3447-0326"/>
                <p>The glands from which it proceeds vary much in different individuals, and even in
                    the same individual in different periods of growth.</p>
                <p>The characters furnished by the skin and its appendices are extensively employed
                    in the systematical arrangement of molluscous animals. Nearly all those
                    characters which distinguish the species, and many of those on which genera are
                    established, are derived from the form of the shell, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tentacula,</hi> or the colour. This last character, however, is one on which
                    little dependence should be placed.</p>
                <p>There is nothing peculiar in the Μ <hi rend="smallcaps">oscular System</hi> of
                    this class of animals. Where the muscles are inserted in the skin, as is usually
                    the case, that organ is in some cases strengthened by condensed cellular
                    substance, and even acquires a leathery density.</p>
                <p>Molluscous animals preserve themselves in a state of <hi rend="italic">rest,</hi>
                    chiefly by suction and cementation. The organ which acts as a sucker, is in some
                    cases simple, soft, and muscular, as the foot of the snail, while in others it
                    is compound, and strengthened internally by hard parts, as in the arms of the
                    cuttle fish. The force with which some animals adhere is very considerable, and
                    is strikingly displayed, for example, when we attempt to detach a limpet from
                    the rock.</p>
                <p>The rest, which is maintained by cementation, in some cases depends on a glairy
                    secretion, which glues the body of the animal to the substance to which it Is
                    disposed to be attached. By such an expedient, the shells of snails adhere to
                    rocks, stones, and plants. It is probable that the bivalve shells of the genus
                    Cyclas, which readily adhere to the side of a glass, secure their temporary
                    attachment by means of their glutinous cuticle. In other animals threads are
                    produced, termed a <hi rend="italic">byssus,</hi> from particular glands, and
                    while one extremity is glued to the rock, the other remains in connection with
                    the animal. But there is an attachment more durable than any of these, which
                    takes place in some shells, they being cemented to rocks or stones by calcareous
                    matter, and retained in the same position during the whole term of their
                    existence.</p>
                <p>The locomotive powers of the mollusea are confined to creeping and swimming. The
                    former action is performed by alternate contraction and relaxation of the foot,
                    or muscular expansion, which serves as a sucker, and is analogous to the motion
                    of serpents. The motion of swimming is executed either by the serpentine
                    undulations of the foot and the body, or by the action of tentacula, or expanded
                    portions of the integuments. Many species are aided in swimming, by being able
                    to vary the specific gravity of their body at pleasure, and either rise or sink
                    in the water as circumstances may require. In some, as the Janthina, there is a
                    cellular organ peculiarly destined for this purpose, which may be regarded as in
                    some measure analogous to the air-bladder of fishes. In all these exertions the
                    progress of molluscous animals is proverbially slow. Some bivalve shells have
                    the power of <hi rend="italic">leaping</hi> or shifting their position by a
                    sudden jerk, produced by shutting the valves rapidly. This is strikingly
                    displayed in the common Scallop, and is less perfectly exhibited in the river
                    muscles. In a few instances, especially among the slugs, a thread is formed of
                    the viscous secretion of the skin, by which the animal is enabled to suspend
                    itself in the air from the branches of trees like a spider.</p>
                <p>Although the progressive motions of molluscous animals are comparatively slow,
                    the other muscular actions are executed with ordinary rapidity. The irritability
                    of some parts, as the tentacula and branchiae, is so great, that the protecting
                    movements arc executed almost instantaneously, and the organs are contracted or
                    withdrawn into the body. But these rapid exertions are only called forth in the
                    moments of danger.</p>
                <p>The characters furnished by the muscular system, are of great value in the
                    discrimination of species, and in the construction of genera and higher
                    divisions. They are intimately connected with the habits of the animal, and
                    merit the attentive examination of the philosophical naturalist.</p>
                <p>In the molluscous animals the <hi rend="smallcaps">Nervous System</hi> is less
                    complicated in its structure than in the higher classes, and the brain is not
                    restricted in its position to the head. The whole nervous system appears in the
                    form of ganglia and filaments. The principal ganglion, or the one to which the
                    term <hi rend="italic">brain</hi> is usually applied, is seated above the gullet
                    or entrance to the stomach. It sends out nerves to the parts about the mouth,
                    the tentacula, and the eyes. It may be considered as analogous to the cerebrum
                    of the vertebral animals. From this ganglion proceed two filaments, one on each
                    side, which in their descent inclose the gullet, and unite underneath to form a
                    second ganglion. From this last, which has been compared to the cerebellum,
                    numerous filaments are likewise distributed to the parts around the mouth, and
                    to the other regions of the body. These filaments in some cases again unite, and
                    form subordinate ganglia. In many cases the brain and ganglia are of a reddish
                    colour, and gramflated structure, while the nerves which issue from them are
                    white and uniform, as in the genus Aplysia. The covering of the first ganglion,
                    which is analogous to the <hi rend="italic">dura mater,</hi> does not adhere to
                    it closely, but leaves a space filled with loose cellular matter. The tunics of
                    the nerves are equally detached; and as they can be inflated or injected
                    readily, some have been led to suppose that the nerves were hollow, and others,
                    that the tunics were the vessels of the lymphatic system.</p>
                <p>The organs of perception common to the higher classes of animals, do not all
                    exist in an obvious manner amongst the mollusea. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >touch,</hi> that universal sense, is here displayed in many cases with great
                    delicacy; and the tentacula, and the other cuticular elongations which we have
                    already referred to, contribute to augment its resources. The sense of <hi
                    rend="italic">sight</hi> is by no means universally enjoyed by the inhabitants
                    of this class. In a few species, the eye is constructed on the plan of the same
                    organ in the vertebral animals. In general, however, it appears only as a black
                    point, the peculiar functions of which can only be inferred from analogy. In
                    many species there is no trace of an eye, consequently they cannot possess that
                    varied information which the others derive from that organ. Where eyes exist in
                    this class, they are uniformly two in number. In one tribe only, namely the
                    cuttle-fish, the rudiments of the organs of <hi rend="italic">hearing</hi> have
                    been detected. The organs adapted to <hi rend="italic">smelling</hi> cannot be
                    exhibited, but the existence of the sense is demonstrated by the facility with
                    which molluscous animals discover suitable food, when placed within their reach.
                    The sense of <hi rend="italic">taste</hi> appears to exist, but it is difficult
                    to point out the particular parts of the mouth fitted for its residence. As,
                    however, particular articles of food are selected in pre· ference to others, it
                    may be concluded from analogy that taste regulates the choice.</p>
                <p>In the classification of the mollusea, the characters furnished by the nervous
                    system, from the difficulty of their detection and exhibition, have never come
                    into use. But those furnished by the organs of preception are highly prized. Of
                    these, the eye is the most obvious and constant. It varies in position in
                    different species; but, among individuals of the same species its characters are
                    constant.</p>
                <p>In the cutaneous, muscular, and nervous systems, traces of a general plan may be
                    observed, according to which they have been constructed in the different tribes.
                    In the organs which remain to be considered, there is less uniformity of
                    structure, each family almost, being constructed according to a model of its
                    own.</p>
                <p>The time when molluscous animals feed has not been carefully attended to. Those
                    which live in the water are beyond the reach of accurate observation. Those that
                    reside on land usually shun the light, and creep forth in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193823460" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3460-0327"/> evenings to commit their
                    depredations. During warm, dry weather, they stir not from their holes.</p>
                <p>The animals under consideration, feed equally on the products of the vegetable
                    and animal kingdom. Those which are <hi rend="italic">phytivoroιιs</hi> appear
                    to prefer living vegetables, and refuse to eat those which are dried. We are not
                    aware that putrid vegetable matter is consumed by them, although many of the
                    snails and slugs are found under putrid leaves and decayed wood. In these places
                    there is shelter from the sun, together with dampness, so that it is difficult
                    to determine, whether they sojourn in an agreeable dwelling, or a well-stored
                    larder. Those mollusea which are <hi rend="italic">carnivorous,</hi> prey on
                    minute animals in a living state, and many of them greedily attack putrid
                    matter.</p>
                <p>The means employed to bring the food within the reach of the organs of
                    deglutition, are exceedingly interesting, both on account of their variety and
                    success. Some are provided with <hi rend="italic">tentacula</hi> for securing
                    their prey, and conveying it to their mouth, as the cuttle-fish; others protrude
                    a lengthened probosis, or an extended lip or tongue, as the limpet, and thus
                    bring their food into the mouth. By many, however, which are fixed to the same
                    spot during the continuance of existence, or only capable of very limited
                    locomotive power, successful efforts are made to excite currents in the water,
                    whereby fresh portions of it are brought in contact with the mouth, and its
                    animal or vegetable contents separated. Where part only of any kind of food is
                    taken into the mouth at once, the lips are possessed of sufficient firmness to
                    cut off the requisite portions, or there are corneous mandibles to perform the
                    office.</p>
                <p>In the mouth, there is scarcely any process performed analogous to that of
                    mastication, in the higher orders of animals. When the food is in the mouth, or
                    entering into the gullet, it is mixed with saliva, as in the more perfect
                    animals. The <hi rend="italic">salivary glands</hi> in which it is secreted, are
                    in general of considerable size, divided into lobes, and, in some cases,
                    separated into distinct masses. In many species the existence of a gullet is
                    doubtful, as the food seems to enter the stomach immediately; while, in others,
                    there is a portion of the intestinal canal which has some claim to the
                    denomination.</p>
                <p>The stomach, in many instances, is membranaceous, and can scarcely be
                    distinguished from the remaining portion of the intestinal canal. In some cases,
                    however, it is strong and muscular like the gizzard of a bird, and even
                    fortified with corneous knobs for the reduction of hard substances. In some
                    species, the stomach opens laterally into the py-lorous, and, in a few
                    instances, possesses a spiral coecum attached to it.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> is usually of very large dimensions, and seated
                    close to the stomach, which it, in many cases envelopes. It is divided into many
                    lobes, and receives numerous bloodvessels. There is, however, nothing analogous
                    to the <hi rend="italic">vena ρortarum</hi> of quadrupeds. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >bile</hi> is poured, in some, into the stomach, and, in others, into the
                    pyloric extremity of the intestine by different openings. There is no
                    gall-bladder.</p>
                <p>There is no division of the canal into small and large intestines, as in the
                    higher classes; or rather, among the mollusea, the relative size of the
                    different parts is reversed. Here the pyloric extremity is usually the largest,
                    while the anal is more slender. The intestine, as in fishes, is short in
                    proportion to the length of the body, and in its course, is subject to few
                    turns. The anus is, in some, placed on one side of the body; in others it is
                    terminal, while in a few it opens on the back.</p>
                <p>The digestive system is thus more simple in its structure than in the higher
                    classes. It possesses neither pancreas, spleen, nor mesentery. And, we may add,
                    that the calls of hunger are often at distant intervals, and the power of
                    abstinence very great.</p>
                <p>The characters furnished by the digestive system are extensively used in the
                    inferior divisions of molluscous animals. The form of the lips, the position of
                    the mouth and anus, and the structure of the stomach, deserve to be attentively
                    considered, as indicating the habits of the species.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Circulating System.</hi> —The process by which the food is
                    converted into chyme, has not been satisfactorily traced, nor has the existence
                    of the lacteals for the absorption of the chyme been demonstrated. In this class
                    of animals the veins seem to perform the offices both of lacteals and
                    lymphatics. The blood is white, or rather of a bluish colour Its mechanical and
                    chemical constitution yet remains to be investigated.</p>
                <p>The circulating system of molluscous animals, exhibits very remarkable
                    differences in the different classes.' In all <hi rend="italic">of</hi> them,
                    however, there is a systemic ventricle; but the other parts of the heart are not
                    of constant occurrence.</p>
                <p>The circulating system furnishes few characters which can be employed in
                    systematical arrangements. The structure of the systemic and pulmonary vessels
                    does not appear to be co-ordinate with any particular plan of external
                    configuration and manner, as we see in the case of the pteropoda and
                    gasteropoda. In these, the organs of circulation are very much alike, while the
                    external Forms exhibit very obvious differences.</p>
                <p>The molluscous animals which respire by means of <hi rend="italic">lungs</hi> arc
                    few in number, and form a very natural tribe, which Cuvier has termed <hi
                    rend="italic">gasterpodes</hi><hi rend="italic">pulmones.</hi> In them the
                    respiratory organ is simple, consisting of a single cavity, on the walls of
                    which the extremities of the pulmonary artery are spread. This cavity
                    communicates externally by an aperture which the animal can open or shut at
                    pleasure.</p>
                <p>The mollusea which breathe by means of <hi rend="italic">gills,</hi> exhibit very
                    remarkable differences, in their number, structure, and position. In some cases,
                    there is a single cavity communicating by an aperture, through which the water
                    enters. The walls of this cavity exhibit an uneven surface, disposed in ridges,
                    which are the gills, and on which the pulmonic artery is expanded. This
                    structure exhibits itself in the <hi rend="italic">Gasteropoda
                    pcctini-branchia.</hi> In many cases the gills, though seated in a cavity, like
                    the former, and equally exposed to the contact of the surrounding element, are
                    two in number, one on each side, as in the <hi rend="italic">Cephalopoda.</hi>
                    In the Bivalvia, they are four in number, two on each side like leaves, and
                    extend the whole length of the body. In these, the water is admitted at the
                    pleasure of the animal.</p>
                <p>The gills of other mollusea are seated externally, and consist either of
                    aborescent productions, or simple cuticular elongations, within which the
                    pulmonary artery terminates. In some of these, as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pteropoda,</hi> the branchial surface is constantly exposed to the action of
                    the surrounding water; whilst in others, the cuticular expansions, which are
                    analogous to gills, are retractile at the will of the animal. In several
                    examples, these cuticular elongations, which execute the functions of
                    respiration, are covered with moveable cilia, well calculated to excite currents
                    in the water, thus renewing the portions applied to the surface.</p>
                <p>By means of the characters furnished by the circulating and respiratory systems,
                    the molluscous animals may be divided into several distinct classes. But as we
                    shall employ these characters in the construction of the different divisions to
                    be employed, it is unnecessary, in this place, to enter into their details.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Peculiar secretions.</hi> —The molluscous animals are
                    considered as destitute of organs for the production of urine, but they possess
                    various organs for the secretion of peculiar fluids or solids, some of which are
                    useful in the arts.</p>
                <p>The coloured fluid, which is secreted by the Cephalopoda and some of the aquatic
                    gasteropoda, appears to consist chiefly of a peculiar mucus, united to a
                    peculiar pigment. The animals which furnish this secretion, eject it when in <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193823473" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3473-0328"/> danger or
                    irritated, and thus envelope themselves in a dark cloud, and elude the pursuit
                    of their foes. A milky secretion is poured forth over the surface of the skin of
                    some slugs when irritated. Other coloured secretions may likewise be detected in
                    the mollusea, to which we shall afterwards advert. The threadlike secretions,
                    termed a <hi rend="italic">byssus,</hi> with which some molluscous animals,
                    especially among the <hi rend="italic">Conchifera,</hi> fix themselves to other
                    bodies, appear to be of an albuminous nature. A few species in this division
                    have the power of secreting a <hi rend="italic">luminous</hi> fluid. Its nature,
                    and the organs in which it is elaborated, have not been investigated. It is
                    probable that some animals, as those which have the faculty of raising or
                    lowering themselves in the water, have likewise the power of secreting <hi
                    rend="italic">air</hi> into those organs which contribute to their buoyancy.</p>
                <p>Morbid secretions likewise occur amongst the animals of this division, chiefly,
                    however, amongst the Conchifera. The most important of these are <hi
                    rend="italic">pearls,</hi> so much prized as ornaments of dress.</p>
                <p>The organs of generation, some of which will be noticed afterwards in detail,
                    furnish many important characters for classification. The external openings are
                    those which are detected with the greatest facility, but the structure of the
                    internal organs exhibits more varied and discriminating marks.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Condition of the</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusea</hi>
                    —Molluscous animals, in reference to their condition, are divided, according to
                    the situation in which they reside, into three groups, which may be termed
                    terrestrial, fluviatile, and marine. Those that inhabit the land belong
                    exclusively to the gasteropoda. Among these, some prefer open pastures, others
                    the rubbish of old walls, while not a few reside in woods or among dead leaves
                    and putrid plants. All the animals of this group respire by means of a pulmonary
                    cavity.</p>
                <p>The fluviatile mollusea, or such as reside in fresh waters, include not only many
                    gasteropodous genera, but likewise a few belonging to the Conchifera. Amongst
                    these, some breathe air by means of a pulmonary cavity, and come to the surface
                    to respire. Such species frequent the more shallow ponds and lakes. Others,
                    respiring by means of gills, are less dependent on the shallowness of the water,
                    and consequently reside in different depths.</p>
                <p>The marine mollusea include genera of all the classes. Some burrow in the sand,
                    or adhere to the rocks which are left dry by the receding tide. These are termed
                    <hi rend="italic">littoral</hi> species. Others, however, which have been
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">pelagic,</hi> reside in the deep, and are seldom
                    obtained but by dredging, or when thrown ashore during storms.</p>
                <p>The effect of temperature in regulating the distribution of molluscous animals,
                    has not been investigated with any degree of care or success. Over the
                    terrestrial and fluviatile species, it probably exercises a very powerful
                    control, greatly limiting their geographical range. In proof of this, it may be
                    stated, that the south of France possesses several species not to be found in
                    England, whilst in England, there arc a few which have not been detected in
                    Scotland. But, among the marine mollusea, the influence of climate is not felt
                    in the same degree. Living in an element, the bulk and motions of which guard it
                    equally from the extremes of heat or cold, these animals, like the sea-weeds,
                    have a very extensive latitudinal and longitudinal range. Thus, some are common
                    to Greenland and the Mediteιτanean, others to Britain and the West Indies. The
                    mollusea of the tropical seas, however, differ widely as a whole from those of
                    the temperate regions. Some of the forms appear to be peculiar to warm regions,
                    and, in general, the intensity of colour decreases as we approach the poles. But
                    as there have been few cultivators of this branch of science, the geographical
                    distribution of the species has been but imperfectly explored. Few parts of
                    either England or Scotland have been surveyed by the eye of the helminthologist,
                    so that many species, the range of which is considered as limited, may soon be
                    found to be extensive.</p>
                <p>If the observations are few and imperfect, which have been made on the influence
                    of temperature, in regülating the physical distribution of mollusea, we are
                    still in greater ignorance with regard to the power of habit. In the floe¢z
                    rocks, the relics of marine and fluviatile mollusea are found mixed in the same
                    bed. This circumstance gave rise to the inquiry, how far the mollusea of fresh
                    water can be habituated to sea-water, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> In
                    the account of the proceedings of the National Institute of France, for the year
                    1816, it is stated, that Μ. Beuchant, professor at Marseilles, has directed his
                    attention to this subject. He found, that all these animals die immediately, if
                    we suddenly change their place of abode; but that, if we gradually increase the
                    proportion of salt in the water for the one set, and diminish it for the other
                    set, we can, in general, accustom them to live in a kind of water which is not
                    natural to them. He found, however, some species which resisted these attempts,
                    and which could not bear any alteration in the quality of the water in which
                    they reside. Before much confidence can be placed in the accuracy of these
                    results, it would be desirable that the experiments were repeated and varied by
                    other observers. There are, indeed, many sources of error to be guarded against.
                    When we change animals from fresh to salt water, or from salt water to fresh, we
                    must necessarily derange their motions, by compelling them to reside in a medium
                    of a different degree of density from the one in which they have been accustomed
                    to dwell, and to which the arrangement of the different parts of the body is
                    adapted. By such a change of place, it would be difficult for those which
                    breathe air to come to the surface, and descend again in their new situation. In
                    those with gills, the application of a new kind of fluid to the surface of such
                    delicate organs, would considerably influence the function of respiration. The
                    change of situation would likewise be accompanied by a corresponding change of
                    food, and consequently, not merely the organs of locomotion and respiration, but
                    likewise those of digestion, would suffer a derangement in their operations. We
                    know that the power <hi rend="italic">c£suffering</hi> in the animals of this
                    class is very great, and that they survive, though sadly mutilated. Some of the
                    snails will live in a quiescent state for years, without food, and almost
                    without air. Unless, therefore, the animals subjected to these experiments of a
                    change of situation, have been observed to thrive on the food which it
                    spontaneously yields, to execute their accustomed motions, and above all, to
                    propagate their kind, we shall be disposed to conclude, that patient suffering
                    Iras been mistaken for health and vivaciousness for the power of accommodation.
                    ,</p>
                <p>The influence of the <hi rend="italic">seasons,</hi> in regulating the motions
                    and habits of molluscous animals, has been but little attended to. Those which
                    live in the water, avoid the effects of low temperature, on the approach of
                    winter, by retiring to the deeper parts of the lakes or rivers in which they
                    reside. This migration, however, does not, in many cases, furnish the requisite
                    security, so that they betake themselves to burrowing in the mud in which they
                    repose until increasing warmth invites them to return to the open water.</p>
                <p>Among the naked terrestrial mollusea, it may be observed, that they burrow in
                    holes of the earth, under the roots of trees or among moss, and there screen
                    themselves from sudden changes of temperature, and appear to spend the winter in
                    a state of torpidity.</p>
                <p>The different kinds of shelly mollusea which inhabit the land, such as those
                    belonging to the genera Helix, Bulimus, and Pupa, not only retire to crevices of
                    rocks and other places, for safety in the winter season, but they form an
                    operculum or lid for the mouth of the shell, calculated to exclude the access of
                    the air, and by the intervention of which they likewise adhere to the wall of
                    their dwelling. A <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823486"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-3486-0329"/> rise of temperature, however, especially if
                    accompanied by moisture, excites their revival and motion, and the lid becomes
                    detached. If we bring, for example, the <hi rend="italic">Helix</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nemoralis,</hi> from its cold abode, and in an apparently torpid
                    state, with the mouth of its shell closed by the lid and adhering to a stone,
                    into a warm apartment, it will speedily revive, especially if it be moistened
                    with a little water, burst open the lid and begin to crawl. If the animal be
                    again exposed to a low temperature, it again secretes materials for a new lid,
                    and speedily returns to its slumbers or inactivity. The first formed opercula,
                    in these animals, always contain a considerable proportion of carbonate of lime,
                    a material which is found in smaller quantity in those of after formation. If
                    the animal has revived frequently during the winter, the last formed opercula
                    will be observed to consist chiefly of animal matter, and to be very thin. The
                    first formed winter lid of the Helix Pomatia is of the consistence of
                    card-paper.</p>
                <p>All the land shelly mollusea appear tc⅛have the power of passing into a state of
                    <hi rend="italic">quiescence</hi> resembling torpidity, at pleasure, and
                    independent of low temperature. Thus, even in midsummer, if we place in a box
                    specimens of the <hi rend="italic">Helix</hi><hi rend="italic">hortensis,
                    nemoralis aut arbustorum,</hi> without food, in a day or two they form for
                    themselves a thin operculum, become attached to the Side of the box, and assume
                    a dormant condition. In this state of apparent torpidity they may be kept for
                    several years. No ordinary change of temperature produces any effect upon them,
                    but they speedily revive if moistened or plunged in water. Even in their natural
                    haunts, they arc often found in this dormant state, during the summer season,
                    especially when there is a continued drought. Thus the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Helix</hi><hi rend="italic">nemoralis</hi> may frequently be observed several
                    feet from the ground, and attached to the stem or leaves of plants, with the
                    mouth of the shell closed.</p>
                <p>But it is not drought which influences these terrestrial shelly mollusea to
                    assume this quiescent state. The <hi rend="italic">Succinea</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">putris,</hi> a species in ordinary cases delighting in moisture,
                    may readily be observed during summer in a dormant state, high on the leaves of
                    the Water Flag, having retired from the moisture below. In the same manner, and
                    from causes equally obscure, some of the marine shelly mollusea, as the Limpet,
                    Periwinkle, and Trochus, may be observed in a quiescent state on the rocks,
                    above the reach of the tide. A shower, however, in general excites the Succinea,
                    as well as the Limpets and Periwinkles, to motion.</p>
                <p>CHAP. II PROGRESS OF THE SCIENCE.</p>
                <p>Naturalists have pursued a variety of methods in their examination of this
                    important branch of Zoology, and have proposed systems of arrangement founded on
                    very different principles, and marking different epochs in the science. In the
                    methodical distribution observed by some, the form of the shelly covering has
                    been exclusively attended to, while the organization of the animal itself has
                    been overlooked, or even disregarded. A few have made the habits of the animal,
                    the groundwork of their system. Others have passed over the characters exhibited
                    by the forms and structure of the shell, and have confined their attention
                    exclusively to the form and structure of the contained animal. Lastly, there
                    have been a few, who, embracing all the circumstances connected with the shell,
                    the animal, and its habits, have constructed systems at once natural and
                    convenient. In the following sections we propose to consider these four classes
                    into V. Inch the cultivators of this department of science may be
                    distributed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">Systems constructed from
                    circumstances connected with the characters of the Shell.</hi></p>
                <p>The arrangement of the testaceous mollusea, according to the different forms of
                    the shell, is unquestionably the most obvious and the most ancient method. It
                    was first employed by Aristotle, the father of natural history, and even in the
                    present day its admirers are warm in its praiser It is with great propriety
                    termed the <hi rend="italic">artificial method,</hi> because the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> characters employed have but a remote relation to the
                    more important functions of the animal. This eminent philosopher had the merit
                    of forming the great divisions of <hi rend="italic">univalves</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">bivalves.</hi> He likewise separated the turbinated univalves from
                    such as have but an imperfect spire, and formed many genera, or rather families,
                    still retaining the names which he imposed.</p>
                <p>The progress of the study of the shelly mollusea (the naked kinds being in a
                    great measure neglected,) made very little progress for many ages after
                    Aristotle had published his method of arrangement. Indeed, the first work of
                    this sort which claims attention, is the <hi rend="italic">Dictionarium
                    Ostracolo-gicum</hi> of Major, which was published in 1675. To him we are
                    indebted for the threefold division of shells into <hi rend="italic">univalves,
                    bivalves,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">multivalves,</hi> and for an explanation of

                <p>In the same career, but with more brilliant success, Languis followed, and, in
                    1722, published his <hi rend="italic">Methodus</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">distribuendi.</hi> The following character is given of this work
                    by the intelligent and industrious authors of the <hi rend="italic">Historical
                    Account of Testaceological Writers. {Linn. Trans,</hi> vol. vii. p. 156.) “After
                    having noticed a multitude of mere describers, we now come to an author who is
                    not undeserving of the title of a scientific one, and whose system, so far as
                    marine <hi rend="italic">testacea</hi> are concerned, (and of these alone he
                    treats) certainly glances at the great clue to simplicity, which was afterwards
                    so successfully and admirably seized by the great reformer of natural history in
                    general.” But Langius deserves more praise than is here bestowed upon him.
                    Before his system appeared, the characters of the genera depended principally on
                    the <hi rend="italic">outline,</hi> and were of uncertain application. He
                    remedied the defect, by directing the attention <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    conchologists to the form of the mouth in univalves, and to the structure of the
                    hinge in bivalves. Among the former, he constituted subdivisions of those <hi
                    rend="italic">ore superius</hi><hi rend="italic">aperto,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ore</hi><hi rend="italic">superius</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">ore</hi><hi rend="italic">superius clauso.</hi> Amongst the
                    latter, the circumstance did not escape him, that some of these shells are <hi
                    rend="italic">equivalve,</hi> others <hi rend="italic">inequivalve</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> some <hi rend="italic">equilateral,</hi> others <hi
                    rend="italic">inequilateral.</hi> Hence he may be considered as the founder of
                    the inferior divisions of the artificial method, and as having furnished, to
                    modern conchologists, manyuseful hints, of which they have availed themselves,
                    without, however, acknowledging their origin.</p>
                <p>Another important improvement was effected by Brey-nius <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dissertatio Physica</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Polythalamiis,</hi> 1732, in 4to.</p>
                <p>This consisted in separating from the ordinary univalves, such shells as possess
                    a cavity divided by partitions into several compartments, and in forming them
                    into a division, which he termed <hi rend="italic">Polythalamium.</hi> These
                    shells arc now called Mnltilocular.</p>
                <p>The system of Tournefort, which was published by Gualtieri, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Index</hi><hi rend="italic">Testarum Conchyliorum</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">Florentini,</hi> 1742, well deserves an attentive perusal. In his
                    observations on the bivalves, now denominated the acephalous mollusea, he drew
                    the attention of conchologists to an important character, and one of easy
                    application, having observed that, in some genera, the valves do not close or
                    unite all round, but that, at certain places, the shell remains in part open.
                    Such shells, in modern language, are said to <hi rend="italic">gape.</hi></p>
                <p>The system of the celebrated Linnaeüs, which ought now to be mentioned, is too
                    well known in this country to deserve particular notice. In many of the other
                    departments <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823499" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3499-0330"/>
                    of Zoology he effected the most important alterations; but his attempts to
                    reform the science of conchology, were far from being equally successful. To the
                    subject he never was much attached, nor does he appear to have availed himself
                    sufficiently of the labours of those authors whom we have mentioned, and of
                    others who preceded him. The primary divisions which he employed, were those
                    which Major had established, and his genera, with a few exceptions, were those
                    in common use. His merit as a conchologist rests entirely on the accurately
                    defined terms, the concise specific characters, and the convenient trivial names
                    which he employed and introduced. The particular consideration of the Linnaean
                    genera, and the subsequent changes which have been introduced into them, will
                    form the subject of a separate section.</p>
                <p>For some time after the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Systema</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Naturae,</hi> the illustrious Swede enjoyed a very dangerous
                    reputation. All his arrangements were regarded as of such high authority, that
                    it was considered as impious to attempt to introduce any change; so that
                    conchology, and along with it the study of the mollusea, according to the
                    artificial method, remained a long time stationary. At last in France, a country
                    which refused to submit to the fetters of the Linnaean school, several new
                    systems were proposed, which had for their object the restoration of those
                    well-founded genera, which Linnaeus, in his too great desire to simplify, had
                    suppressed, and the accommodation of the divisions of the science to those new
                    relations which a more extensive knowledge of species had discovered. In this
                    number Bose stands eminently conspicuous. In his work entitled <hi rend="italic"

                    of his system, the outline of which we shall here present to our readers:</p>

                <p>In this system which we have exhibited, the arrangement is more methodical, and
                    the genera are more definite, than in the Linnaean system. It unquestionably
                    holds the first rank in the modern artificial methods.</p>
                <p>There is a class of writers whose labours deserve some notice in this place. We
                    allude to those who have devoted their attention to the very minute shells, so
                    common among the sand on every sea-coast. These are too small to be examined by
                    the naked eye, and from the instrument employed in their investigation, they are
                    usually termed <hi rend="italic">Microscopic Shells.</hi> Plancus, in his work,
                    <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Conchis Ariminensibus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">minus</hi><hi rend="italic">notis,</hi> published in 1739, may be
                    considered as the first who drew the attention of conchologists to these nearly
                    invisible objects. J. F. Hoffman, in his <hi rend="italic">Dissertatiuncula de
                    Cornu Amrnonis</hi><hi rend="italic">nativo</hi><hi rend="italic">Littoris
                    Bergensis in Norvegia,</hi> published in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of
                    the Electoral Academy of Mentz,</hi> 1757, and in his essay <hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">Tubulis</hi><hi rend="italic">Vermicularibus Cornu
                    Ammonis</hi><hi rend="italic">referentibus,</hi> ibid. 1761, made us acquainted
                    with various species of minute nautili produced on the northern shores. Nor did
                    those discoveries fail to excite interest in this country. Boys and Walker
                    devoted their attention to the subject, and gave to the world the result of
                    their labours, in a thin quarto, entitled, <hi rend="italic">Testacea Minuta
                    rariora nuperrime detecta in arena littoris Sandvicensis,</hi> London, 1784.
                    Other observers, equally ardent and successful, have increased our knowledge of
                    the forms of these minute bodies, particularly Soldani, who, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Testaceographia</hi><hi rend="italic">ac Zoophytographia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">parva</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >microscopica,</hi> 1789 and 1795, exhibited many figures of the minute shells
                    of Portoferrara, &amp;c. Mr. Adams likewise described the minute species which
                    he observed on the coast of Pembrokeshire, in the third and fifth volumes of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Linnaean Society of London,</hi> and other
                    species of British growth have been investigated by the author of <hi
                    rend="italic">Testacea</hi><hi rend="italic">Britannica.</hi> We shall close
                    this list with noticing the <hi rend="italic">Testacea</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Microscopica</hi><hi rend="italic">attaque minuta</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    P. C. A. Moll, and merits an attentive perusal.</p>
                <p>We are aware that such microscopic investigations are regarded by some
                    conchologists as useless, so that the minute species are excluded from their
                    systems. But it is surely a strange method of proceeding in natural history, to
                    judge of the merits or importance of species from their size. It is true that we
                    are still ignorant of the inhabitants of those shells, and may long continue to
                    be so; but our present knowledge of these shells has enabled us to fill up many
                    blanks, to perceive several new relations, and even to draw some important
                    conclusions.</p>

                <p>That this sort of inquiry has in many instances been injudiciously conducted, all
                    who are acquainted with the subject must admit. Due care has not been taken to
                    distinguish these minute testacea from the fry of the larger shells, so that the
                    number of species has been very injudiciously multiplied. These remarks apply to
                    several figures of Walker, and to a still greater number of those of Adams.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II— <hi rend="italic">Systems constructed from
                    Circumstances connected with the Habits of the Animal.</hi></p>
                <p>The authors of the preceding class have laboured to bring to perfection the
                    artificial system of conchology, and have formed their arbitrary characters,
                    independent of the habits of life of the contained animal. But the naturalists
                    whom we have now to consider, have traced these animals to their lurking places,
                    and arranged them according to the situation in which they reside, instead of
                    the forms which they exhibit.</p>
                <p>At the head of this class of conchologists, Dr. Martin Lister stands
                    pre-eminently conspicuous. His great work, entitled <hi rend="italic">Historia
                    sive</hi><hi rend="italic">Synopsis</hi><hi rend="italic">Methodica
                    Conchyliorum,</hi> was begun in 1685, and completedin 1692. It will long remain
                    a monument of the extensive information and unwearied diligence of its author.
                    The following synoptical view of the work will enable our readers to comprehend
                    its plan; the original should be consulted with care.</p>

                <p>The plan followed by Sir Robert Sibbald in his <hi rend="italic">Scotia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Illustrata</hi> is somewhat different from that of Lister. He
                    divides the Testacea into two classes, land and water shells, and the latter
                    class he subdivides into fluviatile and marine. His inferior divisions are
                    destitute of precision, and the number of species referred to limited.</p>
                <p>The system of D’Argenville, which was so much esteemed and so long followed in
                    France, is essentially the same with that of Lister in the higher divisions. The
                    plan is indeed so simple, and in appearance so natural, that it has met with
                    many admirers. It has even been useful in encouraging naturalists to study
                    particular departments of the science, when they were prevented by their
                    situation from devoting their attention to the whole. It is probably to this
                    circumstance that we are indebted to Schröter for his observations on the land

                <p>The preceding arrangements, formed according to the situations in which the

                    as the first attempts at a natural method in conchology. They serve, as an
                    introduction to a new class of authors, whose views may be considered as of a
                    higher order, and to whose labours we shall devote our attention in the

                <p>The first attempt of any consequence to arrange testaceous animals according to

                <p>The presence or absence of an <hi rend="italic">operculum</hi> or lid, gives
                    rise, in this system, to a division of the univalves into two sections, and the
                    families are established from circumstances connected with the number of the
                    tentacula, and the number and position of the eyes. The families amongst the
                    bivalves are arranged according to the structure of their cloak or external
                    covering. In the class of multivalves, which we have omitted in the table, the
                    characters are taken from the form and structure of the shell.</p>
                <p>The work of Geoffroy, entitled, <hi rend="italic">Traité Sommaire des Coquilles
                    tant</hi><hi rend="italic">fluviatiles</hi><hi rend="italic">que terrestres, qui
                    se trouvent aux environs de Paris,</hi> 1767, is constructed upon the principles
                    of Adanson. Here, however, the objects were not sufficiently numerous to admit
                    of all the subdivisions of that author, but he has made the form of the animal
                    subservient to the construction of generic characters.</p>
                <p>After these attempts to classify the animals which inhabit shells had been made
                    in France, the celebrated zoologist of Denmark, O. F. Müller, turned his
                    attention to the same subject. In the <hi rend="italic">Zoologia Danica,</hi>
                    which contains his digested views of the subject, he employs, in the
                    construction of his genera of univalves, the characters first used by Adanson;
                    but among the bivalves, besides the form of the tubes or syphon, he notices the
                    construction of the branchiae and the presence or absence of a foot.</p>
                <p>To our knowledge of the animals which inhabit bivalves, Poli, in his expensive
                    work, the <hi rend="italic">History of the Shells of the Two Sicilies,</hi> made
                    very important additions. In the construction of his families, which are six in
                    number, he employs merely the characters furnished by the syphon and foot. In
                    the first family the animal has two syphons and a foot; in the second, there <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193823525" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3525-0332"/> is only one
                    syphon and foot; in the third, a syphon and no feet; in the fourth there is an
                    abdominal syphon and no feet; in the fifth there is a foot but no syphon; while,
                    in the sixth, neither foot nor syphon can be discovered. In the formation of his
                    genera, Poli takes advantage of the various forms of the cloak and the
                    branchiae.</p>
                <p>To the celebrated Cuvier, the conchologist is also under the greatest
                    obligations. By applying his vast knowledge of anatomy to the examination of the
                    molluscous animals, he has unfolded many new conformations of parts, and
                    exhibited many unlooked-for relations. The vast collection of objects, the
                    spoils of all the museums of the continent, which Paris once possessed, lay open
                    to his inspection, and his industry appears to have been equal to the harvest
                    which invited him to labour.</p>
                <p>In his first attempts to classify the molluscous animals, as contained in his <hi
                    rend="italic">TableauElémentairc</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ll</hi><hi rend="italic">Histoire Naturelle</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Animaux</hi> (1798); and his <hi rend="italic">Leçons</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Anatomie</hi><hi rend="italic">Comparce,</hi>
                    (1800-1805), he employed chiefly the characters which the preceding writers had
                    developed, in his inferior divisions; but in his primary distinctions, he
                    distributed the mollusea into three classes: <hi rend="italic">Cephalopoda,</hi>
                    having the head covered with tentacula, serving as feet; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gasteropoda,</hi> with the head free, the animal crawling on the belly; and <hi
                    rend="italic">Acephala,</hi> having no distinct head.</p>
                <p>Some years after the appearance of this classification, Cuvier directed more of
                    his attention to the internal structure of the mollusea, and, by means of
                    accurate dissections, obtained a more intimate acquaintance with the organs and
                    functions of these animals than any of his predecessors had acquired. The
                    information which he thus gained was communicated to the public at different
                    periods, in the well-known publication <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">du Museum d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Naturelle</hi><hi rend="italic">de Paris.</hi> These papers, with
                    some additional observations, were at last published in a separate form, under
                    the title <hi rend="italic">Mémoires pour servir</hi><hi rend="italic">a
                    l</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">histoirc</hi><hi

                    >distribué d’après son organisation,</hi> in which he arranged the mollusea
                    according to his peculiar views, from characters drawn exclusively from the
                    animal. In the third volume, of what may be termed the third edition of that
                    invaluable work, published in 1830, the same arrangement, with the exception of
                    a few modifications, was adhered to.</p>
                <p>He divides the mollusea into six classes, which he terms <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cephalopoda, Pteropoda, Gasteropoda,</hi><hi rend="italic">Acephala,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Brachiopoda,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cirrhipoda.</hi></p>
                <p>In the class <hi rend="smallcaps">Cephalopoda,</hi> the body is in the form of a
                    sack, open above, containing the branchiae, with a distinct head, surrounded by
                    fleshy elongations or arms, adapted for moving the body or seizing prey. Into
                    this class, along with the Sepia of Linnaeus, Cuvier has inserted the
                    multilocular shells of his genus <hi rend="italic">Nautilus</hi> and the genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Argonauta.</hi> But it is to be feared, that our knowledge of
                    the testaceous mollusea which inhabit the numerous multilocular shells, is too
                    limited to enable us to assign to all of them their true place in a natural
                    arrangement of animals.</p>
                <p>In the second class, termed <hi rend="smallcaps">Pteropoda,</hi> the body is
                    closed, the head is destitute of the long fleshy arms which distinguish the
                    animals of the preceding division; two fin-like membranes, situate.on the sides
                    of the neck, and on which the branchial tissue is in general spread, serve as
                    organs of motion. There is only one shelly mollusea belonging to this class,
                    viz., the anomia tridentata of Forskachl, now forming a part of the genus
                    hyaloea.</p>
                <p>The third class, which includes a great number of naked and testaceous mollusea,
                    and to which Cuvier gives the name <hi rend="smallcaps">Gasteropoda,</hi> from
                    the circumstance of the belly being formed for crawling, has been subdivided
                    into eight orders, from circumstances connected with the organs of
                    respiration.</p>
                <p>In the first order, termed <hi rend="italic">Pulmones,</hi> which breathe air, he
                    has constituted two divisions, the terrestrial and the aquatic. The animals of
                    the former live on land, and were included by Linnaeus in his genera limax and
                    turbo. They are the land shells of most authors. Those of the division, termed
                    aquatic, live in the water, but require at intervals to come to the surface to
                    obtain fresh air. They constitute, with a few exceptions, the fresh water shells
                    of naturalists. In the second and third orders, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nudibranches</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lnfero-branches,</hi> the species
                    consist almost entirely of genera formed from the animals which Linnaeus and
                    many others included in the genus doris. They are naked mollusea, and are
                    likewise destitute of any internal testaceous plate. The fourth order, termed
                    <hi rend="italic">Tectibranches,</hi> contains animals whose branchiae, like
                    small leaves more or less divided, are situate on the right side, or upon the
                    back. The animals of this division possess a shell, but it is in general placed
                    beneath the common integuments, such as the genus <hi rend="italic">Aplysia</hi>
                    and several species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Eulla.</hi> The fifth order,
                    termed <hi rend="italic">Heter-οpodes,</hi> have the gills plumore and dorsal,
                    with the foot compressed and vertical like a fin, with a small portion of it
                    only formed to act as an organ of adhesion, as in the other gasteropoda. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Pectinibranches</hi> form the sixth order, and are distinguished
                    by the branchiae, which are like leaves or threads placed parallel in one, two,
                    or three lines, on the surface of the pulmonary cavity, and by having the sexes
                    separate. It includes the whole of the marine species of the Linnaean genera of
                    turbinated univalves. Into this order, Cuvier, from the consideration of other
                    characters, has inserted the genus <hi rend="italic">Cyclostoma,</hi> which,
                    according to the characters indicated by the respiratory organs, belongs to the
                    Pulmones.</p>
                <p>In the seventh order, termed <hi rend="italic">Scuiibr</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >anches,</hi> the branchiae are similar to those of the preceding order, but the
                    sexes are united, each individual being capable of impregnating or being
                    impregnated. The shells in general are cup-shaped, and destitute of a lid. It
                    includes the genus Halyotis, and many species of the old genus Patella. In the
                    last order, called <hi rend="italic">Cyclobranches,</hi> the branchiae appear in
                    the form of small leaves or pyramids strung round the under margin of the cloak.
                    They enjoy a hermaphroditism similar to those of the preceding order. The
                    species of the genus Patella which are allied to the vulgata, and the genus
                    Chiton, are included in this order.</p>
                <p>In the fourth class, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Acephat,a,</hi> he includes the
                    bivalve shells, distributing them into families, from characters nearly similar
                    to those which we have pointed out as having been previously employed by
                    Poli.</p>
                <p>The fifth class, termed <hi rend="smallcaps">Brachiopoda,</hi> contains animals,
                    resembling those of the preceding class in having a cloak of two lobes, but
                    these are always open. The branchiae consist of small leaves placed on the inner
                    margin of each lobe. In place of a foot they have two retractile fleshy arms,
                    which are extensile. This class includes the Patella unguis of Linnaeus, the
                    genus Terebratula and the Patella anomala of Müller.</p>
                <p>The class <hi rend="smallcaps">Cirrhipoda,</hi> distinguished by the articulated
                    filaments with which the animals are furnished, contains the species of the
                    genus Lepas of Linnaeus. The shells belonging to the Linnaean genera Sarpula and
                    Dentalium, are transferred to the class termed Annelides.</p>
                <p>This system of the molluscous animals is unquestionably the most perfect of all
                    those which have been published. But, with all its excellence, we must inform
                    the reader, that many species, nay, whole genera, have their places assigned
                    them in this natural method, merely because the shells occupied a similar
                    position in the artificial system, the form of the inhabitants being
                    unknown.</p>

                <p>In this section, we shall confine our remarks to the only <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193823538" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3538-0333"/> system of this kind of any
                    consequence which has hitherto appeared, and which is the production of the late
                    industrious Lamark, one of the most celebrated zoologists of the French school.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Système des Animaux sans Vertèbres,</hi> Paris, 1801, of
                    this author, embraces the whole range of animals included in the classes
                    Insectaand Vermes of Linnaeus. Where treating of the Mollusea he divides them
                    into two orders. The first, termed <hi rend="italic">Cephalous,</hi> from
                    possessing a head, includes the univalves. The second, termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acephalous,</hi> from the absence of a head, includes the bivalves. This
                    eminent author greatly modified his views, as appears from what he announced in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Extrait</hi><hi rend="italic">du</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cours de</hi><hi rend="italic">Zoologie,</hi> Paris, 1812, the prelude to his

                    Mollusea, he fortunately lived to finish between the years 1818 and 1822. The
                    arrangement adopted in this invaluable work, has been greatly admired, a
                    circumstance which induces us to give the following synoptical view of its
                    contents.</p>
                <p>The species considered by the older naturalists as shells and mollusea, are in

                <p>The authors of the first class of conchologists which we have mentioned, employ
                    exclusively the characters furnished by the shell, and scarcely deign to tell us
                    that there is an animal attached to that shell. The authors of our third class
                    are anxious to keep the shell out of view, and draw their distinctions from the
                    animal; but they have failed in the attempt. In extreme cases, the characters
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the shell are resorted to in the absence of
                    distinctions furnished by the animal.</p>
                <p>Lamark perceived the inconvenience of separating these two modes of examining
                    molluscous animals, and fortunately formed a very natural combination. We shall
                    give his character of the genus Patella, as a specimen of this mixed system.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Patella.</hi></p>
                <p>Corpus testa univalvi penitus obtectum; capite tentaculis duobus acutis, basi
                    externa oculferis. Branchiae infra veli marginem per totam corporis periphaeriam
                    seriatim dispositae. Orificia pro generatione et ano ad latus dextrum
                    anticum.</p>
                <p>Testa univalvis, non spiralis, animal obumbrans, clypi-ata vel retuso conica,
                    imperforata; fissura marginali destituta; cavitate simplici; apice anterius
                    recurvo.</p>
                <p>In this manner the generic character is dependent equally on the shell and the
                    contained animal, and that genus in a system is consequently not sufficiently
                    established in which both these characters are not included. How many genera are
                    in this imperfect state! Were the same plan followed in the description of
                    species, everything we could wish for would be detailed; and our knowledge of
                    the forms of molluscous bodies would approach to perfection. How much is it to
                    be w ished that this plan of Lamark’s were generally adopted in this country!
                    conchology would assume a new aspect, and the number of his votaries would
                    rapidly increase.</p>
                <p>The reader will have perceived, in the course of the hasty review of those
                    systems which we have enumerated, that we have refrained from making any remarks
                    on their comparative excellence. This deficiency we now propose to supply in the
                    follow ing observations.</p>
                <p>The authors who have arranged testaceous bodies, without reference to the animals
                    that reside in them, appear to have mistaken the house for the inhabitant, and
                    the thing formed for the being that produced it. They have torn asunder objects
                    which are closely related, and united others which differ in structure and
                    economy. These are necessary consequences of an artificial system, and they
                    become more obvious in proportion as we descend in the scale of being.</p>
                <p>The examination of shells, according to this method, may be view ed as the study
                    of the osteology of the mollusea. It has not for its object the investigation of
                    living matter, but of dry bones. Nor has it any of those advantages which result
                    from the study of the osteology of the vertebral animals. A knowledge of the
                    bones of these animals enables us to ascertain many of their primary functions,
                    the nature and extent of their pow ers of motion, and even the food on which
                    they subsist. But our knowledge of shells does not enables us to say, whether
                    the animal can.crawl or swim; whether it feeds on plants or animals. The reason
                    is obvious. All the muscles inserted upon the shell are either mere organs of
                    adhesion, or destined to open and shut the valves. None of those muscles
                    connected with any of the primary organs have any connection with the shell.
                    That the shell furnishes several most important characters, we readily grant;
                    but we are here reasoning against the propriety of attending to the shell, to
                    the exclusion of the animal, and, to this extent, our reasoning appears to be
                    conclusive.</p>
                <p>We are aw are, that, in the other departments of natural history, the appearances
                    which the external parts of an animal exhibit are constantly employed in the
                    construction of orders and genera, and all the intermediate divisions. Thus, for
                    example, the bill, feet, and feathers of birds, furnish the characters by which
                    they are arranged in the system. Here, however, it must be observed, that the
                    combined information yielded by these parts, makes us acquainted with the habits
                    and organization of a bird. By means of these we can judge, and with certainty,
                    not merely of its internal structure, but the places which it frequents, and the
                    food which it consumes. Hence these characters may be applied with equal
                    propriety in an artificial as in a natural method. But what opinion would we
                    form of that ornithologist, who could readily inform us that the cormorant has
                    fourteen tail feathers, and the shag only twelve, but who was ignorant of the
                    haunts of these birds, their food, and the number of their young. We might prize
                    him as a companion in surveying a museum, but he is alike a stranger to science
                    and nature.</p>
                <p>Nor can we feel more respect for the student of mere shells. He may be able to
                    tell us the number of whorls in a spiral univalve, or the form of the hinge in a
                    bivalve; but if he knows not the nature of the organs of respiration, digestion,
                    and reproduction of the animal to which the shell <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193823577" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3577-0336"/> belongs, and contentedly
                    remains in this ignorance, he has yet to learn the value of method in natural
                    history. He cherishes with mistaken fondness the maxim of Linnaeus, “Nomina
                    nosse oportet qui rem scire velit,” while he overlooks a more important object,
                    expressed in the motto of the Linnaean Society, “Naturae discere mores.”</p>
                <p>These remarks apply to the conchological labours of Linnaeus and his followers,
                    who have devoted their whole attention to the arrangements of the shells,
                    without attending to the animals. We know that some of the admirers of the
                    Swedish naturalist presume to say, <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> But our great
                    author was not wholly inattentive to the creatures for which the beautiful and
                    endless diversified receptacles that he had characterised were designed. Among
                    the generic marks was included the name of the molluscous inhabitant; or, where
                    the animal differed from any which had a place in other parts of his system, he
                    described it at length.” (Linn. <hi rend="italic">Trans,</hi> vol. vii. 175.)
                    Now, to what does all this attention of Linnaeus amount? In all the species
                    which he has described, he has only noticed the animals of four of these, and in
                    a very slight manner; and, with regard to the name of the molluscous inhabitant
                    which he included in his generic marks, we hesitate not to say, that by this
                    union he has betrayed carelessness. To many British ears these terms may sound
                    harsh, but the proof of their correct application in the present instance will
                    be abundantly evident, if we examine the references to the animals of a few of
                    his genera. The genus <hi rend="italic">chiton</hi> is thus characterised;
                    “Animal Doris. Testae plures, longitudinaliter gestae, dorso incumbentes.” Are
                    we not led to conclude from this character, that the animals of the chiton
                    exactly resemble the animals of the doris genus, with the addition of the
                    shells? If this be the case, how artificial is that system which places these
                    two genera in separate orders! Upon turning, however, to the genus doris among
                    his vermes mollusea, we find the following characters assigned to it; “Corpus
                    repens, oblongum, subtus planum. Os antice subtus. Anus postice, supra cinctus
                    ciliis. Tentacula duo, supra corpus antice intra foramina retractilia.” Now, the
                    fine fringes around the anus of the doris, which are the branchiae of the
                    animal, and form the essential character of the genus, are not to be found in
                    the animals of the chiton, whose branchiae are in the form of leaves placed
                    along the margin of the body, and the anus is a simple pore.</p>
                <p>According to the generic character of the mya, the animal is an <hi rend="italic"
                    >ascidia,</hi> with the appendage of a shell. Upon turning to the genus ascidia,
                    we find it said, “Corpus fix-urn, teretiusculnm, vaginans. Aperturae binae, ad
                    summitatem; altera humiliore.” To prove the impropriety of referring the animal
                    of the mya to the genus ascidia, we shall only mention, that the former has a
                    foot, and possesses a locomotive power; the latter has no foot, remains
                    immoveably attached for life upon the substance to which it at first adhered,
                    and depends on the accidental bounty of the waves for all its nourishment.</p>
                <p>The animals of nearly all the univalves are represented as belonging to the genus
                    limax. But, with the exception of the restricted genus helix and bulimus, the
                    animals of the univalves are all generically different from the limax. Their
                    tentacula are generally two in number, with tl∣e eyes at the base; while the
                    tentacula are four in the limax, with the eyes at the tips of the two longest.
                    These examples will suffice to establish a truth so palpably obvious.</p>
                <p>The principal objection against this system of employing the shell, to the
                    exclusion of the animal, arises from the fact, that nature has not drawn aline
                    of distinction between the mollusea and the testacea. Thus, many of the vermes
                    mollusea of Linnaeus include shells in their bodies, as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >aplysia</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and many of his vermes testacea likewise
                    are soft on the outside, the shell being inclosed by the integuments, as <hi
                    rend="italic">the Jιelix laevigata</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> now
                    constituting the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Velutina.</hi></p>
                <p>We have another objection to this artificial system, and one which we consider of
                    great force; that, wherever it prevails, the form and habits of the animal are
                    overlooked. How fully is this truth illustrated in the works of the
                    testaceologists of this country! We might examine all their writings, from the
                    <hi rend="italic">Pinax</hi> of Merret to the <hi rend="italic">Descriptive
                    Catalogue</hi> of Maton and Raket, including the works of Penhant, Berkenhout,
                    Da Costa, and Donovan, and learn little more, besides the <hi rend="italic"
                    >habitat,</hi> than that to every shell there is an animal attached. Of this
                    charge the names of Lister and Montagu stand acquitted. The former has given us
                    several good dissections, and the latter minute descriptions of the testaceous
                    animals.</p>
                <p>Whilst, in the preceding remarks, we have objected to all arrangements taken
                    exclusively from the characters of the shell, we also disapprove of those
                    systems founded exclusively on the characters of the animal. By the former class
                    of methodists, the simplicity of nature is sacrificed to their peculiar views,
                    and, by the latter, practical utility is disregarded. Devoting their whole
                    attention to the animal, the later naturalists have overlooked the house in
                    which it resides; the roof which shelters it from the blast; and the walls which
                    guard it from its foes. The former observers possessed very limited views of
                    nature, 'and erected systems obviously artificial. To the systems of the latter,
                    the same objections will apply. Thus, for example, among the univalves of
                    Adanson, the families are formed from the position of the eyes chiefly. That the
                    black points which we witness at the tips or at the base of the tentacula are
                    actually eyes, we readily admit; but what influence have these eyes on the
                    habits of the animal? or rather, does a change of position of these organs
                    occasion a corresponding change in the habits of the animal? Unless this is
                    answered in the affirmative, we must consider such characters as equally
                    artificial with any employed by Linnaeus or his followers, since they have no
                    relation to any of the primary functions of life.</p>
                <p>The employment of characters taken exclusively from the animal is attended with
                    so many practical difficulties, that it never can be introduced into general
                    practice. If we find a shell thrown ashore, the animal may be dead, or it may
                    refuse for a time to display its organs, and prevent us from arriving at its
                    name and history. This defect, however, is partly remedied when we can call to
                    our aid the characters furnished by the shell.</p>
                <p>Another objection against this method arises from the well known difficulties
                    attending the preservation of the soft parts of molluscous animals. To dry
                    these, destroys their form and texture; to inject them is impracticable; and
                    when put into spirits of wine, they generally appear a shrivelled mass. But the
                    coverings of these animals are durable, and, since they form a part of the
                    animal; since they are produced at first along with it, increase by the addition
                    of new matter from its body, and continue attached to it for life; we must
                    condemn any classification from which the shell is excluded.</p>
                <p>From these remarks, it will be obvious, that we consider the mixed system as the
                    most natural and the most useful. It possesses all the advantages to which the
                    other systems lay claim, while it is free from their defects. It withdraws part
                    of our attention from the shell, because it is destitute of peculiar vessels,
                    and possesses no vital energy, to fix it on those organs of the animal which are
                    subservient to its existence. It leads us to examine the whole animal, instead
                    of certain parts of it merely, and has a tendency to excite us to become
                    acquainted with the manners of a tribe, from which, imperfect arid artificial
                    systems have hitherto withdrawn our attention.</p>
                <p>Value of the Characters Employed.</p>
                <p>It is of the utmost importance in the formation of any arrangement of natural
                    bodies, to have an exact idea of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823590"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-3590-0337"/> relative value of the characters used, and of
                    their true subordination. This is a subject of vast moment, and too little
                    attended to by naturalists. We do not here consider that character as of the
                    highest kind, which is the most general, but that which has the greatest
                    influence over the faculties and instincts of the animal. Had this subject been
                    studied with greater care, the science of conchology would, at this period, have
                    been in a more flourishing condition. To ascertain, in some degree, this
                    subordination of character, is the object of the following observations.</p>
                <p>The division of the testaceous mollusea into three orders, as adopted by
                    Linnaeus, is confessedly artificial. The Mul-tivalvia of that author possess no
                    characters in common, neither can they boast of a general resemblance. The first
                    genus, <hi rend="italic">Chiton,</hi> consists of animals which belong to the
                    cephalous and gasteropodous mollusea. The animals of the genus Lepas approach
                    more nearly to the crustacea than the mollusea; while the animals, inhabiting
                    the genus Pholas, bc4ong to the acephalous mollusea, and are closely connected
                    with the Myae and Solenes. The shells of the first genus are merely calcareous
                    scales, arranged transversely on the back of the animal. The shells of the
                    second genus are variously articulated, fixed, and either sessile or
                    pedunculated. The shells of the third genus are bivalves, with a few accessory
                    calcareous plates. It is to be hoped that modern conchologists will avoid so
                    incongruous a combination.</p>
                <p>The two remaining divisions of Linnaeus, the bivalves and univalves, are not only
                    obvious, but natural. They indicate the existence of certain forms peculiar to
                    the animals whose shells are thus separated in the system. The univalve shells
                    are inhabited by animals which possess a head, and whose organs of motion are
                    either tentacula situated on the head, or a foot spread over the belly, as in
                    the slug. The animals of the bivalve shells, on the other hand, are destitute of
                    a head; some of them have no locomotive power; and, in others, the organ of
                    motion is a fleshy foot, which the animal can protrude at pleasure. These
                    circumstances point out the connection which subsists between the organs of the
                    animal, and the external forms of the shell; a connection which, in every
                    system, ought to be carefully attended to.</p>
                <p>It is somewhat difficult to point out, among the univalves, the true
                    subordination, or relative importance of the characters employed by
                    conchologists in describing them. We have much to learn of their anatomy, and
                    hence we cannot with certainty point out the relation of the parts of the shells
                    to the organs which those parts protect. The form and structure of the mouth of
                    the shell, however, may be expected to furnish characters of the first-rate
                    importance, and have always attracted the notice of the student of testaceous
                    bodies. The very shape of the animal, together with its ordinary habits, must
                    necessarily depend, in a great measure, on the form of the mouth.</p>
                <p>In many genera, the mouth of the shell towards the base is produced, and
                    terminates in a groove or beak. These univalves are termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >canaliculated,</hi> and are readilv distinguished from those whose mouth is <hi
                    rend="italic">entire.</hi> The differences in the form of the shell in these two
                    divisions is an index of equally remarkable differences in the form of the
                    animals. The canaliculated shells contain animals possessed of an elongated tube
                    for the purposes of respiration, and this canal is destined for its reception
                    and protection when expanded. The animals whose shells are destitute of this
                    canal, are likewise destitute of this lengthened respiratory tube. Circumstances
                    of this kind induce us to believe, that shells, agreeing in external form, in
                    general, contain animals of a similar organization. We consider this division of
                    the univalves into canaliculated and entire, as obvious and natural.</p>
                <p>The next character, in point of importance, appears to depend on the direction of
                    the revolutions of the spire. In general, when a spiral univalve is placed upon
                    its base, or mouth, with its summit towards the observer, the mouth will open on
                    the right side of its axis or pillar, and the whorls will be observed to revolve
                    from right to left, beginning at the base, and ending at the summit. These
                    shells are termed <hi rend="italic">dextral.</hi> In a few shells, however, this
                    order is reversed. The mouth occurs on the left side of the pillar in the
                    above-mentioned position, and the whorls from the mouth to the summit revolve
                    from left to right. Shells of this sort are termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >sinistral,</hi> sometimes also heterostro-phe or heteroclite, and arc generally
                    called by dealers <hi rend="italic">unique.</hi></p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">dextral shells,</hi> the animals have the external
                    openings of the rectum, penis, and uterus, on the right side of the body, and
                    the heart on the left. In the <hi rend="italic">sinistral shells,</hi> these
                    organs are placed on the opposite sides. Thus the openings of the rectum and
                    organs of generation are on the left side, while the heart is situated on the
                    right. Here again we have an external character impressed on the shell, which
                    indicates certain arrangements in the organs of the animals. We are aware that
                    some conchologists consider the sinistral shells as accidental varieties, and on
                    that account regard the character which is indicated as of inferior importance.
                    Bose, indeed, says, “La cause de cette variation dans la direction des spires,
                    vient des circonstances dans lequelles s’est trouvé l’animal au moment de sa
                    naissance, et d’un obstacle qu’il a trouvé lorsqu’il a voulu tourner sa tête du
                    côté que la nature lui a indiqué.” This explanation might have been received,
                    had such changes in the direction of the whorls been confined to one individual
                    or two, of particular species. But when we observe all the individuals of
                    particular species, nay even of genera with their whorls thus invariably
                    reversed, we are disposed to regard the occurrence as connected with the primary
                    structure of the animal, and not as the result of accident. Besides, the viscera
                    of the animal of a reversed shell are not placed in the same position in
                    relation to its back or belly, as the animals of the dextral species. A simple
                    change of direction in the spire, therefore, will not convert a dextral into a
                    sinistral species, and the character must be considered as of a higher order
                    than those employed for the separation of the species merely. We consider
                    sinistral shells as belonging to distinct genera from those which are dextral,
                    it being inexpedient to make use of the character for higher divisions.</p>
                <p>Among many of the univalves, the animal is furnished with a lid, by means of
                    which it can close up the entrance of the shell after it has withdrawn itself
                    into the cavity. It is in general corneous, sometimes also calcareous. It is
                    usually flat, and attached to the superior and posterior part of the foot of the
                    animal. The shells which possess this lid are generally termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >operculated shells.</hi> They must not be confounded with those land shells of
                    which the animals form a temporary covering to the mouth, previous to winter,
                    for the purpose of protecting them from the vicissitudes of the weather. This
                    lid, in the former case, is permanent, in the latter deciduous; in the former it
                    adheres to the animal, being in connection with it; in the latter only to the
                    margins of the mouth of the shell.</p>
                <p>This character was first employed by Adanson in the construction of the second
                    section of his class univalves, and has been more or less attended to by
                    succeeding conchologists. It is certainly a very general character, and at first
                    sight might be supposed worthy of forming some of the higher divisions. It
                    appears but rarely in the land shells, more frequently in fresh water shells,
                    and generally in the marine species. It does not, as yet, appear to be connected
                    with any peculiar organization, although it must influence to a certain extent
                    the economy of the animal. Were we however, to employ it in higher divisions
                    than generic ones, some confusion would certainly arise. It would cause the
                    separation of many genera which are nearly allied, and even divide several
                    natural families» Thus, for example, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823603"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-3603-0338"/> among the porcellaneous shells, it would separate
                    the <hi rend="italic">olives</hi> from <hi rend="italic">cones,</hi> the former
                    being destitute of an operculum, while the latter possess one. These two genera,
                    however, belong to a natural family, the animals of both genera having a
                    respiratory tube upon the head, and the eyes placed on the sides of the
                    tentacula, instead of being situated, as in the other gasteropoda, on the tips
                    or at the base. This circumstance is calculated to convince us of the necessity
                    of caution in the admission of characters. These may at first appear to be of
                    extensive occurrence, and well adapted for the formation of families, but unless
                    they exercise some visible influence on the animal, they can never be employed
                    with propriety in a natural system, however convenient they may be in an
                    artificial arrangement. Operculated shells may be considered as generically
                    different from those which are destitute of that organ, without any injury to
                    the natural method. It would even, in many instances, be convenient.</p>
                <p>Amongst univalve shells, considerable differences are observable in the shape and
                    position of the cavity of the shell. In some cases this cavity is simply
                    conical, while in others it is conicotubular, either revolving horizontally
                    round a centre, or spirally twisted upon an axis or pillar. These circumstances
                    furnish characters of great importance in an artificial system, as by means of
                    them all testaceous bodies may be arranged into two tribes, the one possessing a
                    pillar, round which the tube of the shell is twisted, while the other is
                    destitute of any pillar. The former have been termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stulidia,</hi> the latter <hi rend="italic">Astulidia.</hi> As a natural
                    character, however, these distinctions are of inferior importance, and, if
                    employed would occasion a separation between the genera Planorbis and Lymnaea,
                    which are demonstrated by Cuvier to be nearly related. In the formation of
                    genera, it may be employed with advantage, even in a natural system, aided by
                    the structure of the pillar, and the direction of the whorl.</p>
                <p>The last character which we have to notice while speaking of the univalves,
                    depends on the circumstance of the cavity being entire, or divided into
                    chambers, being <hi rend="italic">unilocular</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >multilocular.</hi> In the multilocular testacea there are a number of
                    transverse plates, in some species perforated, in others entire, which cross the
                    cavity of the shell, and, in general, divide the external cavity, in which the
                    animal resides, from the older and smaller ones, from which it has receded. In
                    an artificial arrangement, such distinctions may be employed with advantage,
                    even in the formation of the primary divisions, but we entertain doubts as to
                    the propriety of using them in a strictly natural method. We are in a great
                    measure ignorant of the animals which inhabit the multilocular shells, yet as
                    far as our knowledge goes, we are induced to regard the distinction as merely
                    conventional, and as unconnected with any peculiar order of organization. Such a
                    division may be useful in the present state of the science, and may be permitted
                    on that account; but in proportion as onr knowledge of the mollusea advances,
                    this distinction will be deemed inexpedient. Indeed, were this division adopted,
                    the genera Argonauta and Nautilus would be torn from each other, although they
                    are, by Cuvier and many others, regarded as members of a family of cephalopodous
                    mollusea. The Nautilus lacustris of Lightfoot, now constituting the genus <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Segmentina,</hi> would, in that case, likewise be separated
                    from the genus Planorbis, with which it is very closely allied. In the meantime,
                    until our knowledge of the multilocular testacea arrives at a greater degree of
                    perfection, such divisions may be employed as convenient, and of easy
                    application.</p>
                <p>The preceding remarks apply to those shells which belong to the cephalous
                    mollusea. Among the bivalve shells, which belong to the acephalous mollusea, the
                    characters which they exhibit are of very different degrees of importance. Here,
                    as among the univalves, the appearance of the shell enables us to form an idea
                    of the organization of the animal, so that the characters thus furnished by the
                    shell may be safely employed in a natural system.</p>
                <p>The bivalve shells, in genera[, possess the faculty of moving from one place to
                    another, or of attaching themselves to rocks and stones, by means of temporary
                    threads. These are termed <hi rend="italic">free</hi> shells. But there are
                    others which secrete at their birth a calcareous cement, which unites the shell
                    to the rock or stone immoveably for life. These last are known by the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> shells. If we thus consider the difference in the
                    economy of these two divisions of bivalves, we may reasonably expect to find
                    corresponding differences in their organization. The free shells contain animals
                    endowed with locomotion, and by consequence with feet. In few of the animals
                    which inhabit fixed shells can a foot be observed. They are more simple in their
                    organization than the free shells, and are destitute of absorbing or ejecting
                    syphons, the place of these being supplied by holes in the duplicature of the
                    cloak. This last distinction, however, is not peculiar to the fixed shells,
                    although found in all of them.</p>
                <p>Among the free shells, a very important circumstance occurs, which we have
                    already noticed, viz. that some of these adhere to rocks and stones by means of
                    temporary threads produced by the animal. They are termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >byssi∙ feroe.</hi> Independent of the utility of this power of producing
                    threads of attachment, to the economy of the animals, the byssiferae must
                    possess at least three organs of which the other testaceous mollusea are
                    destitute. The first of these is a gland for the secretion of the substance of
                    which the threads are formed; the second, a foot so constructed as to be capable
                    of spinning these threads and fixing them to the rocks or other bodies to which
                    they are intended to adhere; and the third is a muscle in the animal to which
                    the inner end of these threads may be attached, and which muscle, in general,
                    has the power of contraction and elongation. This character, then, appears
                    perhaps of the very highest order, so that, in a natural arrangement, we might
                    divide the molluscous bivalves into such as spin threads of attachment, and such
                    as do not. We must, however, confess, that the byssiferae have scarcely any
                    other subordinate characters in common, to warrant such an arrangement</p>
                <p>In general, the valves of which the shell consists close upon each other in such
                    a manner as to leave no opening. In a few genera, however, the valves do not
                    close upon each other at one end, and sometimes at both; the point of union
                    being at one side or in the middle. The former are termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >close</hi> shells, the latter <hi rend="italic">gaping</hi> shells. The
                    character of gaping, so very obvious in the shell, is an index of equally
                    important distinctions which prevail in the animal. In the gapers, the syphons,
                    or the absorbing and ejecting pipes, are two in number, and very long, and
                    frequently united. The foot is contained in a sheath, from which it issues at
                    the pleasure of the animal. Besides, the branchiae are always united, and equal
                    in length to the tubes. This character appears, therefore, equally important as
                    the former. It has hitherto been employed in the construction of specific
                    characters merely, rarely of genera.</p>
                <p>When the two valves are of the same size and form, the shell is said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">equivalve</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but when the one valve
                    differs from the other in these particulars, the shell is said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">inequivalve.</hi> This character, so obvious and so commodious, is
                    not the index of any peculiar organization of the animal. If employed in the
                    higher divisions, it would separate closely connected genera, and destroy some
                    natural alliances. The inequivalves, however, are for the most part irregular in
                    their growth. The molluscous inhabitants have no lengthened syphon nor foot.</p>
                <p>When we examine the inner surface of bivalves, we observe some spots of a
                    different colour and lustre from the general surface. These are the places to
                    which the muscles adhered, which connected the animal with the shell, and are
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823616" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3616-0339"/> termed <hi
                    rend="italic">muscular impressions.</hi> They are either separate and lateral,
                    subcentral, or simple, or composite. This character was long employed by
                    conchologists in their specific distinctions, and sometimes in the formation of
                    the genera. It has been more recen tly empl oy ed by Lamark, as a character of
                    the first importance in the division of the bivalves. He forms these shells into
                    two sections, the first containing those shells which have the muscular
                    impressions separate and lateral, and the second such as have only one
                    subcentral, simple, or compound impression. However highly we respect the
                    conchological labours of this naturalist, we cannot join with him in the present
                    instance, and elevate a subordinate character to a primary rank. If, by muscular
                    impressions, he means those marks impressed on the valves of the shells by the
                    muscles which serve to close it, then his character is unconnected with any of
                    the primary functions of the inhabitant. For is it of much consequence whether
                    the valves be brought into contact by the action of one muscle or by the
                    assistance of two? In so far, the character is evidently artificial, when the
                    impressions of the abductor muscles only are employed. But he evidently uses the
                    term in a more extensive sense, to refer to those impressions left on the shell
                    by some of the other muscles by which the animal is attached to it. To the mere
                    conchologist, these marks are of a very uncertain import, and can never enable
                    him to construct natural families, and the student of the mollusea will employ
                    more important distinctions. If we are to take all the muscular impressions into
                    account, the arrangement of Lamark must undergo great alterations. Let us take
                    the common mussel as an example. It is placed by the French Conchologist in the
                    second section, as having only one muscular impression, although no less than
                    four muscles adhere to each valve, destined for the performance of very
                    different functions. The largest impression, which is situate near the obtuse
                    end of the shell and towards the posterior margin, belongs to the abductor
                    muscle, employed in closing the valves. Connected with this impression there is
                    a tongue-shaped mark, reaching nearly to the ligament. This mark is occasioned
                    by one of the lateral muscles for supporting the byssus, and by one of the
                    lateral muscles of the foot. The other muscle for supporting the byssus, is
                    inserted under the teeth which occur at the beak. There is even another mark of
                    adhesion on the margin of the shell, irregularly denticulated, occasioned by the
                    fringed margin of the cloak, which is there united with the shell. This mark may
                    be termed the <hi rend="italic">marginal impression.</hi> To which of these
                    marks then are we to attach the greatest importance? To the impression of the
                    one abductor muscle, which is common to all shells, —to the marks of the muscle
                    of the byssus, or to the indented mark of the fringed margin of the cloak. If we
                    attend farther to Lamark’s arrangement, we shall find the Camacea separated from
                    the Ostreacea, although the two families possess numerous external and internal
                    points of resemblance. We regard the muscular impressions as furnishing a
                    convenient character for the construction of genera, and tfie discrimination of
                    species, but it is not -worthy to occupy so high a rank as Lamark has assigned
                    to it.</p>
                <p>As intimately connected with the muscular impressions, we may here notice the <hi
                    rend="italic">ligament.</hi> It is a horny elastic membrane, which serves to
                    open the valves, when the adductor muscle relaxes. It is placed on the exterior
                    margin in some shells, and is concealed in others. When external, it is
                    stretched when the shell is closed, and when it is internal, it is compressed in
                    similar circumstances. This character is very useful in the construction of
                    genera, but it ought never to be employed in any of the higher divisions. It is
                    not the index of any peculiar organization, neither does it serve to unite
                    natural families. Lamark, without due consideration, regarded it as next in
                    importance to the muscular impressions.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">teeth</hi> of the hinge of bivalves, since the days of
                    Langius, have been studied with care, and the characters which they furnish have
                    been employed, both in artificial and natural arrangements, in the construction
                    of the primary divisions. It would have been of some advantage to the science,
                    had conchologists ascertained the use of the teeth in the economy of the animal,
                    before forming any divisions from their presence, absence, or position. They do
                    not appear to be the index of any peculiar organization, neither can they be
                    employed to bring together naturally allied families. The use of the adductor
                    muscle is to close the shell; the ligament opens it; and the teeth of the hinge
                    seem destined to modify and direct these movements. The characters furnished by
                    these three parts of the shell appear to be nearly of equal importance, and fit
                    only to occupy a very subordinate place. Were the circumstances connected with
                    the teeth of the hinge to become the foundation of the higher divisions, many
                    natural families would be broken. Thus, the genus anodonta would be removed from
                    the unio, although they are both fluviatile, possess one long subulated foot,
                    one syphon in the form of a hole, the summit of the cloak furnished with cirri,
                    the branchiae in part re-united, viviparous, carrying the young in the
                    branchiae. In short, it seems to be a character fit only for generic and
                    specific distinctions.</p>
                <p>Bivalve shells have often been divided into equilateral and inequilateral. These
                    differences do not appear to be the signs of any peculiar character of the
                    animal, or any of its functions. They must influence, to a certain extent, the
                    relation between the different parts, but this influence is not sufficiently
                    obvious. The character thus furnished is of an uncertain kind. It is influenced
                    by the age of the individual, and therefore can only be employed with caution in
                    specific distinctions.</p>
                <p>The last character of the bivalves which we shall notice is the power which some
                    of them possess of piercing stones and wood for the purpose of forming to
                    themselves a retreat. These are termed <hi rend="italic">borers.</hi> It was
                    supposed by many that the animal secreted a liquor with which it dissolved the
                    bodies into which it penetrated, but the sagacious Reaumur soon ascertained that
                    the boring was performed by means of a rotatory movement of the larger valves.
                    Μ. Fleurieu-Bellevue states, that the calcareous stone in which the ru-pellaria
                    lithophaga is found, is often discoloured in the immediate neighbourhood of its
                    recess. This may arise from other secretions of the animal, or even from the
                    stagnant sea water in the hole, and not from the action of the phosphoric acid,
                    or any other solvent supposed to be employed by the animal. These would act
                    equally on the shell as on the calcareous rock. But the borers are not confined
                    to calcareous rocks, they also lodge in slate-clay, and other argillaceous
                    strata. This is very often the case with the Pholades. But this character can
                    never be extensively employed, as the same species which, at one time, may be
                    found imbedded in stone, will be observed at another seated among the roots of
                    sea-weed, or buried among gravel.</p>
                <p>From the preceding remarks it will appear obvious, that there are many characters
                    furnished by the shell, which give us indications of corresponding peculiarities
                    in the structure of the animal, and on that account ought to be employed in
                    every natural arrangement. These characters have this circumstance to recommend
                    them, that they are obvious and permanent. The objects which furnish them can be
                    preserved in our cabinets, and serve to perpetuate our recollection of the
                    appearances which the more perishable parts . have exhibited.</p>
                <p>There is yet another class of characters to be considered, very variously rated
                    by different authors. These characters are taken from the situation in which
                    shells are found, whether on the land, in fresh -water, or in the sea.</p>
                <p>This mode of dividing testaceous bodies has not been <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193823629" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3629-0340"/> sufficiently attended to by
                    conchologists, who have, in general, condemned the plan, as founded upon an
                    improper principle, viz., the classification of animals from the places which
                    they frequent, instead of the forms which they exhibit. Such a mode of arranging
                    the higher divisions of the different classes we would readily censure; but when
                    employed in the inferior subdivisions of the testacea, we regard
                    itasanimportantandanatural character. We ask the truena-turalist to say, which
                    is the most impor taut character, the hinge having teeth or wanting projections,
                    and the animal residing in fresh water or in the sea? We anticipate with
                    confidence the preference which would be given to the latter, although the
                    decision might provoke a sneer in a mere collector. Nature has evidently drawn a
                    line of separation between the three tribes, which it is not difficult to
                    perceive.</p>
                <p>The terrestrial testacea are destined to live on vegetable matter. Their organs
                    of respiration are suited to the medium in which they reside. Their organs of
                    feeling are, in general, more numerous than those of the fluviatile or marine
                    shells. The tentacula of the latter seldom exceed two, while in the land shells
                    the tentacula are, in general, four in number. The eyes are likewise differently
                    placed; in the aquatic testacea they are situate on the head, at the base of the
                    tentacula; whereas the eyes in nearly all the terrestrial species are placed on
                    the tip of these organs. We might also add, that no bivalve shells are found on
                    the land; they belong exclusively to fresh water and to the sea.</p>
                <p>The fluviatile shells, though destined to reside in a different medium from the
                    terrestrial, have in the greater number of genera their organs of respiration
                    (according to Cuvier) nearly the same, and are, therefore, compelled to come
                    occasionally to the surface to respire. They have usually two flat tentacula,
                    with the eyes placed at the base. Theymay,in general, be distinguished from the
                    marine kinds by the superior thickness of their epidermes, their corneous
                    colour, and semi-transparency.</p>
                <p>The marine shells are the most numerous, the most beautiful, and the most highly
                    prized of all the testacea. Many of the univalves of this tribe possess a
                    lengthened respiratory tube, with a canal in the shell for its protection, a
                    circumstance not observed in the fluviatile testacea· There is one circumstance
                    which at once points out the difference in structure between the fluviatile and
                    marine testacea: the fluviatile cannot live in salt water, nor the marine in
                    fresh water. This fact points out an arrangement in their organization to which
                    conchologists ought to pay attention.</p>
                <p>These remarks are calculated to persuade conchologists to attend to the character
                    furnished by the habitation of shells. In the formation of genera, it ought to
                    be respected; in the higher divisions it would be inconvenient. The carelessness
                    of Linnaeus with regard to this character, is the principal reason why his genus
                    helix is such a confused and indigested mass. Were the distinction arising from
                    habitation to be observed in the distribution of the testacea, no confusion
                    could possibly take place. Some changes might be occasioned by it, but much
                    practical difficulty would be avoided. Indeed, so useful is the distinction,
                    that conchologists, without avowing the propriety of the principle, have in many
                    instances observed it.</p>
                <p>Having thus taken a short view of the different characters employed by
                    conchologists in the arrangement of the testacea, and endeavoured to ascertain
                    their relative importance, we shall conclude this part of the article by an
                    application of the principles we have established, to an examination of the
                    Linnaean genera, and to an enumeration of those genera which subsequent
                    naturalists have formed, without, however, attempting to give even an
                    approximation to many; of the modern divisions, which have been multiplied
                    beyond • all bounds; as our present object is to convey to the reader some
                    farther remarks, illustrative of the history of the science, rather than
                    specific descriptions.</p>
                <p>Linnaean Genera.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Chiton</hi> —The only change which has taken place in
                    this genus, of any consequence, is its transference to the naked cephalous
                    mollusea, effected by Lamark. The inhabitants bear a near resemblance to those
                    of the genus patella, and belong to the order cyclobranchia of Cuvier. The
                    marginal ligament which connects the testaceous plates, even after the
                    extraction of the animal, is, in fact, the margin of its cloak, and offers, in
                    connection with the notches of the plates, more certain and convenient
                    distinctions for the distribution of the species, than the number or appearance
                    of the valves, a character exclusively employed by Linnaeus.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Lepas.</hi> —This genus has undergone several important
                    alterations since the days of Linnaeus. As originally constructed by that
                    author, it contained shells which differ widely from one another in habit and
                    form. Bruguière, the celebrated French conchologist, separated the fixed shells
                    furnished with an operculum, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Balanus,</hi>
                    and those which were seated on a peduncle, he retained under the generic name
                    <hi rend="italic">Anatifer.</hi> He thus suppressed entirely the Linnaean name
                    of the genus. To the name of his first genus, we have no objections, but the
                    second, though it records a curious fact in the history of popular errors, has
                    been injudiciously selected. The name <hi rend="italic">Lepas</hi> has been
                    retained by the best British writers, who have described seven species which
                    live in our seas. These are distributed into two sections, according as the
                    valves are five or more in number. The <hi rend="italic">Lepas anatifera</hi> is
                    an example of the first division, and the Z. <hi rend="italic">scalpellum</hi>
                    of the second.</p>
                <p>The genus balanus, as thus formed by Bruguière, and represented by the lepas
                    balanus of Linnaeus, contained nineteen species. From these Lamark has separated
                    the <hi rend="italic">B.</hi><hi rend="italic">diadema,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >testudinaris,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">balanaris,</hi> to form his genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Coronula.</hi> These shells are conical, and have the compartments
                    formed into twelve areae, six of these being depressed, and six elevated. They
                    chiefly inhabit the skin of the whale, the base of the shell being placed in the
                    fat. Lamark has likewise formed another genus, from two species analogous to the
                    coronolulae, which he terms <hi rend="italic">Tubicinella,</hi> and
                    characterises it thus:—“Testa uni valvis, regularis, non spiralis, tubulosa,
                    versus basin attenuata, utrique truncata; apertura orbiculata terminali;
                    operculo quadrivalvi.” The lepas striata of Pennant is now the representation of
                    a new genus termed Creusia.</p>
                <p>Μ. Dufresne <hi rend="italic">(Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">du Museum,</hi> vol.
                    i. p. 465), endeavours to prove by very inconclusive reasoning, that these
                    shells are formed posterior to the birth of the animal. He supposes that, when
                    they become too small to contain the inhabitants on account of their increasing
                    size, the old shells are forsaken, and more commodious dwellings formed, until
                    the animal reaches its full size. Other proof, however, than what the author
                    adduces, is necessary to render the opinion probable.</p>
                <p>Lamark, in his <hi rend="italic">Systeme</hi><hi rend="italic">des Animaux sans
                    vertèbres,</hi> placed these shells in a separate section at the end of the
                    bivalves, and among the acephalous mollusea. Afterwards he considered them as
                    constituting a particular division of the crustaceous animals; and, lastly, he
                    has assigned them a place in his new class, which he terms <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cirrhipides.</hi></p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="smallcaps">Pholas.</hi> —This very natural genus was placed among
                    the multivalves by Linnaeus, in the twelfth edition of his system. It is now
                    united with the bivalves, the accessory plates at the hinge being regarded as of
                    subordinate importance. In other respects it has stood the test of modern
                    innovation, with the exception of the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Gastrocuaena</hi> of Spengler, in which the teeth are obsolete. This includes
                    the pholas hians of Chemnitz, and the mya dubia of Pennant.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="smallcaps">Mya</hi> —If we consider as definite the character
                    assigned to this genus by Linnaeus himself, we shall find that it excludes many
                    species which differ from the <hi rend="italic">M. truncata</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193823642"

                    In this shell, the valves gape at both extremities, the ligament is internal,
                    and placed on a thick erect tooth in one valve, not inserted into the opposite
                    side. As the Μ. Vulsella of Linnaeus is close at both ends, and destitute of a
                    tooth, it has been separated from the true myae, and formed into a distinct
                    genus by Lamark, under the title <hi rend="smallcaps">Vulsella.</hi> This shell
                    presented some difficulty to Linnaeus, as he placed it at first among the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pinnae,</hi> and afterwards among the <hi rend="italic">Myae.</hi>
                    Even Bruguière gave it a place among the oysters.</p>
                <p>Another genus has been formed by Lamark from the mya siliqua of Chemn. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Conch.∖</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> r</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">o∖.</hi> xi. p. 192, tab. 198, fig. 1934). He calls it <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Glycimeris.</hi> Though nearly related to the true myae, by
                    gaping at both extremities, yet it differs from them in the hinge, which is
                    destitute of teeth, and in the ligament being external.</p>
                <p>A new genus was formed by Μ. Μ. Groye, <hi rend="italic">(Annales</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">du Museum,</hi> vol. ix.), which he terms <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Panopea,</hi> and assigns to it the following characters :—“Coquille
                    transverse, baillante inégalement au deux bouts, charnière semblable dans l’une
                    et dans l’autre valve, ayant une callosité ou grosse dent allongée, placée en
                    avant et sur le corselet; decurrente sur le bord intérieur, relevée en arête,
                    mousse et saillant posterieurement; one dent cardinale conique un peu comprimée
                    et arquée, et sur le valve droit une fosette dans laquelle s’engrène la dent de
                    la valve opposée; ligament extérieur, crochets peu protuberans, eorsclet large,
                    deux impressions musculaires dans chaque valve situées vers les extrémités.” The
                    type of this genus is the mya glyeimeris of Gmelin first noticed by Aldrovandus.
                    It is inserted among the British shells by Mr. Donovan upon very slight
                    authority. In the construction of the genus, we think, that Μ. Groye has acted
                    properly, but there was no necessity surely for changing the trivial name (of
                    the first described species) bestowed upon it by the discoverer. He has added
                    another species from Monte Pulgnaseo in Parma. In the trivial name of this
                    species, we consider that he has been guilty of an act of injustice. He has
                    called it <hi rend="italic">P. Faujas,</hi> in honour of Faujas St. Fond, the
                    zealous Professor of Geology in the Museum of Natural History at Paris. But the
                    truth is, that it was found by Μ. Cortezi, Counsellor at Parma, and a successful
                    investigator of the organic remains of that district. It ought, therefore, to
                    have obtained the name of P. Cortezi, in honour of the discoverer, instead of
                    the name of Faujas. St. Fond, who received it from Μ. Cortezi, and whose sole
                    merit in the subject consisted in his bringing it in safety to Paris.</p>
                <p>The principal error of Linnaeus in the construction of this genus, consisted in
                    the insertion of fluviatile shells among his marine species. Bruguière readily
                    perceived this error, and formed a new genus for their reception, which he
                    called <hi rend="smallcaps">Unio.</hi> But this group, now denominated N <hi
                    rend="superscript"> τ</hi> AYADEsby Lamark, includes the genera unio hyria,
                    anadonta tridina, and, we may add, alasmodon.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="smallcaps">Solen</hi> —This genus has undergone few changes since
                    the days of Linnaeus. The character has been somewhat restricted, and those
                    species have been removed, in which the external margin is a little areuated,
                    and the cardinal teeth articulated, and two in number, and formed by Lamark into
                    a new genus, which be terms <hi rend="smallcaps">Sanguinolaria.</hi> The animals
                    of this genus, according to Poli, differ from the solens, in having the tubes of
                    the syphon separate, and of unequal length and thickness. The Ñ. <hi
                    rend="italic">minutus</hi> of Linnaeus, found in our seas, is referred to the
                    genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Hiatella</hi> by Cuvier, a genus very imperfectly
                    defined, but nearly allied to, if it be not identical with, the byssomia of the
                    same author, which includes the mytilus rugosus of Linnaeus.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="smallcaps">Tellina</hi> —This extensive genus of Linnaeus, the
                    essential character of which is to have an anterior inflection or fold in each
                    valve, and lateral teeth, includes many shells which differ greatly in form and
                    habit, and which disagree even with his own definition. Hence several important
                    improvements have taken place in the distribution of the species.</p>
                <p>The first change in the genus of any consequence consisted in the separation of
                    the fluviatile from the marine species. This was accomplished by Scopoli, <hi
                    rend="italic">(Introd, ad Hist. Nat. 3</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    i</hi><hi rend="italic">3T),</hi> who bestowed on them the generic name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sphaerium.</hi> Bruguière afterwards wantonly changed the name to
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Cyclas,</hi> and this change has been embraced by Lamark
                    and other naturalists.</p>
                <p>Another new genus of fluviatile shells, allied to the preceding, has been formed
                    by Bruguière and Lamark for the reception of one species. The genus is termed
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Galathea,</hi> and the spceies <hi rend="italic">G.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">radiata.</hi> There are two approaching hinge-teeth in the right
                    valve, with a cavity in front, and two distant hinge-teeth in the left, with an
                    intermediate large grooved callosity. The lateral teeth are of considerable
                    size. The ligament is external, and the muscular impressions are two in number,
                    and lateral.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Tellina inaequivalvis</hi> presents characters which
                    readily distinguish it from the other species with which Linnaeus placed it. The
                    shell is inequivalve and inequilateral; the ligament is internal, and the
                    lateral laminae are wanting. Besides, the animal differs from the other
                    inhabitants of the tellinae, and is nearly related to the solens. Hence
                    Bruguière formed a new genus for its reception, which he termed <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pandora.</hi></p>
                <p>There are several species of the genus tellina and Venus, which Bruguière and
                    Lamark have formed into a separate genus called <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Lucina,</hi> which is thus characterised:—“Testa bivalvis, acquivalvis,
                    orbiculata, vel ovato transversa; natibus arcuatis, postice versis. Cardo
                    dentibus cardinalibus 1. s. 2. variabilibus; lateralibus 1. s. 2. remotis,
                    interdum subnullis.” To this genus Lamark brings the <hi rend="italic">Tellina
                    lactea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">divaricata</hi> of Linnaeus, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">muricata</hi> of Chernn. <hi rend="italic">(Conch,</hi> vol. xi.
                    p. 209, tab. 199, fig· 1945-6), together with the Venus <hi rend="italic"
                    >fimbriata,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pensylvanica</hi> of Linnaeus, and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Jamaicensis</hi> of Chemn. <hi rend="italic">(Conch,</hi> vol.
                    vii. p. 24, tab. 39, fig. 403-9). Cuvier, however, has restored the T. lactea to
                    the genus Loripes, which Poli instituted for its reception.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cardium</hi> —This is, perhaps, the best constructed
                    genus which Linnaeus formed. The characters are definite and obvious, and all
                    the species are naturally allied. Hence few changes have taken place in their
                    arrangement. The animal constitutes a new genus in the system of Poli, which he
                    terms cerastis.</p>
                <p>Cuvier is disposed to constitute a new genus under the title <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hemicardia,</hi> for the reception of the <hi rend="italic">C. cardissa</hi> of
                    Chemn., commonly called the Venus-heart eockle. The truncated appearance on the
                    one side, and its being carinated in the middle, point out a conformation of the
                    inhabitant different from the true cockles. Of this new genus we possess some
                    fossil species.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="smallcaps">Mactra</hi> —The ligament, in the marine bivalves, is, in
                    general, placed on the outside, but in this genus, of which Lamark has formed
                    his family <hi rend="italic">mactreacca,</hi> the ligament is internal, and
                    inserted in a cavity at the hinge formed for its reception. This family, as it
                    stands at present, contains several well characterised genera.</p>
                <p>In the restricted genus, <hi rend="smallcaps">Mactra,</hi> as represented by the
                    <hi rend="italic">M.</hi><hi rend="italic">stultorum</hi> of Linnaeus; the shell
                    gapes a little, and the lateral teeth are strong, and lock into each other. The
                    shells with age arrive at a considerable thickness. The inhabitant belongs to
                    the genus callista in the system of Poli.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Crassatella</hi> of Lamark contains shells which
                    close exactly, and have the lateral teeth obsolete. He describes seven fossil
                    species, and eleven recent ones, viz. maetra <hi rend="italic">glabrata,

                    rend="italic">strata.</hi></p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Erycina</hi> is composed entirely of fossil
                    species. Lamark has assigned it the following character: “Testa bivalvis,
                    equivalvis, inequilatera, transversa. Dentes cardinales bini, superne
                    divergentes, cum foveola minima intermedia: laterales compressi oblongi.
                    Ligamentum foveola cardinali insertum.” From the situation of the ligament being
                    inserted in the small space between the teeth, the pit or cavity is less than in
                    any of the other genera. The muscular impressions are two in number.</p>
                <p>The transverse mactrae, which gape, but are destitute of lateral teeth, such as
                    the Μ. lutraria of Linnaeus, compose the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Lutraria</hi> of Lamark. The species already mentioned, and the mya <hi
                    rend="italic">oblonga</hi> of Gmelin, or mactra <hi rend="italic">hians</hi> of
                    Montagu, occur on our coasts; the former in great abundance at the mouths of the
                    European rivers.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Ungulina,</hi> formed by Daudin, contains only one
                    species, existing in the cabinet of Favanne. It is uncertain from what country
                    it came. It is a regular longitudinal shell. The hinge is formed by one small
                    tooth between two oblique pits. The muscular impressions are two in number. It
                    is figured in Deterville’s edition of Buffon. <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Nat. des
                    Coquil.</hi> tom. xx. f. 2, 3.)</p>
                <p>Another genus established by the same author, and termed <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Erodona,</hi> is subtransverse, irregular, and gaping, the hinge, in one valve,
                    consisting of one hollowed tooth, and in the other a depression between two
                    eminences. It includes two shells from the cabinet of Favanne. It is
                    intermediate between the mactrae and myae.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="smallcaps">Donax.</hi> The shells of this genus are readily known at
                    first sight by their singular cuneiform shape. The hinge teeth are two in
                    number, and the lateral teeth are spreading. The ligament is external, and, like
                    the tellinae, it is placed on the shortest side. This is a circumstance of rare
                    occurrence among the inequivalve testacea. The animal belongs to the genus
                    peronaea of Poli.</p>
                <p>Lamark has instituted a genus nearly allied to the preceding, termed <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Petricoa,</hi> the shells of which gape a little at both ends.
                    There is one hinge tooth in one valve, and a biful one in the other. The
                    ligament is external; the muscular impressions are two in number; the structure
                    of the hinge teeth, and the absence of the lateral teeth, at once distinguish
                    this genus from the dc ’ nax and venus. These animals are likewise peculiar in
                    their habits. Lamark quotes the venus lithophaga of Retzius, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Act. Acad. Tour.</hi> vol. iii. p. 11, and the venus lapicida of Chemn. <hi
                    rend="italic">Conch,</hi> x. p. 356. tab. 172, f. 1664-5. But Lamark’s genus has
                    been again altered by Fleurieu-Bellevue, who has formed his genus <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rupellaria,</hi> from the V. lithophagus of Retzius, and
                    another species termed <hi rend="italic">striata. (Mem. de l’Acad. de la
                    Rochelle,</hi> ii. tab. 2, fig. 9∙) In this genus the shell is transverse and
                    inequilateral, compressed in the anterior part, and swollen behind. There are
                    two crooked hinge teeth on each valve, one simple, the other biful. The ligament
                    is external, and there are two muscular impressions. The donax irio belongs to
                    this genus. The same author has formed two other genera of borers. The first he
                    terms <hi rend="smallcaps">Ruricoa,</hi> having a transverse inequilateral
                    shell, a little gaping at the ends: no teeth or callosities. In an internal
                    projection of each valve, there is a pit for the ligament. The other genus is
                    named <hi rend="smallcaps">Saxicava.</hi> It is transverse, inequilateral, and
                    gaping, without teeth or callosity, or pit. The ligament is external.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="smallcaps">Venus.</hi> This Linnaean genus contains so many
                    species, that there is considerable difficulty in studying it. The formation of
                    new genera, from its members, by diminishing their numbers, must prove highly
                    acceptable to the student of conchology. Lamark has succeeded so far by
                    previously restricting the character of the original as follows: “Testa bivalvis
                    acquivalvis, binaequilatera transversa vel suborbicularis. Dentes cardinales
                    tres in utroque valva, ad nates basi convergentibus. Ligamentum externum,
                    nymphas labiaque obtegens.” The three diverging hinge teeth constitute the
                    essential character of the genus, so that Lamark has been able to form three
                    other genera from different characters.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Cytherea</hi> (the meretrix of Lamark’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Systeme</hi><hi rend="italic">des Animaux)</hi> is thus
                    characterised: « Cardo dentibus duobus tribusve approximatis, basi convergentes;
                    uno soli-tareo remotiuscula sub ano.” It must be confessed that the insulated
                    teeth under the lunule, in the absence of other characters, is obviously
                    artificial. This genus contains many species requiring subdivision.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Venericardia,</hi> formed for the reception of
                    some fossil species, is thus defined: “Testa bivalvis, aequi val vis,
                    inaeqnilatera, extus longitudinaliter costata. Dentes cordinales sub-bini crassi
                    oblique secundi.” The number of hinge teeth, and the longitudinal ribs, readily
                    distinguish it from the genus Venus. It is very limited in recent species.</p>
                <p>Another genus instituted by Lamark, and termed by him <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Capsa,</hi> has two teeth in one valve, and a biful tooth in the other, the
                    type of which he considered to be the donax lavi-gata of Gmclin.</p>
                <p>It was in the construction of the characters <hi rend="italic">pi'</hi> the genus
                    Venus that Linnaeus unfortunately indulged in obscene allusions. It is now time
                    that the pages of natural history were freed from such pollution. Other names,
                    more expressive, can easily be substituted, alike advantageous to the interests
                    of science, and the reputation of the illustrious Swcdc∙</p>
                <p>11. <hi rend="smallcaps">Spondylus</hi> —The shells which Linnaeus included under
                    this head are usually denominated prickly oysters. The genus represented by the
                    N. <hi rend="italic">gaederopus</hi> of Linnaeus. The <hi rend="italic">S.
                    plicatula</hi> of the same author has been separated from the spondyli, and
                    placed in a new genus, under the name <hi rend="smallcaps">Plicatula.</hi> This
                    genus differs from the former in the valves wanting ears, and in the absence of
                    the triangular unisulcated space at the teeth of the under valve, so
                    characteristic of the parent genus.</p>
                <p>12. <hi rend="smallcaps">Chama.</hi> —This is by no means a well constituted
                    genns in the Linnaean system, as it includes shells possessing very different
                    characters. It has, accordingly, undergone several important alterations.
                    Bruguière proceeded so far by establishing two new genera, and Lamark, following
                    the same plan, has added three more to the number. Those shells, which now
                    belong to the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Chama,</hi> are irregular, inequivalve,
                    and adhere to other bocΓιes. The hinge contains only one thick oblique tooth. It
                    is represented by the chama <hi rend="italic">Lazarus</hi> of Linnaeus.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Cardita,</hi> of Bruguière, represented by the <hi
                    rend="italic">C.variegata,</hi> (Lister, tab. 344, fig. 84.,) consists of
                    equivalve free shells, with the hinge furnished with two unequal teeth, the one
                    situated under the beak, the other lateral, under the anterior margin.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">chama cor</hi> of Linnaeus appeared to Lamark possessed of
                    sufficient characters to constitute a distinct genus, which he has named <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Isocardia.</hi> It is an equivalve, free, regular, heart-shaped
                    shell, with two cardinal teeth, and a separate lateral one, with separate,
                    diverging, involuted beaks. It is an inhabitant of the British Seas.</p>
                <p>To Bruguière we owe the institution of the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Tridacna,</hi> which is represented by the chama <hi rend="italic">gigas</hi>
                    of Linnaeus, the largest shell in nature. The shell is equivalve and free. The
                    hinge consists of two compressed teeth, and there is a gape at the lunule.</p>
                <p>From the preceding genus of Bruguière, Lamark has separated the chama <hi
                    rend="italic">hippapus</hi> of Linnaeus, and formed from <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193823668" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3668-0343"/>it a new genus, which he
                    calls <hi rend="italic">hippopus.</hi> In its hinge it resembles the tridacna,
                    but differs in the structure of the lunule, which in this is closed.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Diceras</hi> of Lamark, which he formed from the
                    chama <hi rend="italic">biconis</hi> of Bruguière, approaches the isocardia in
                    appearance, but the following character which he assigns, is fully sufficient
                    for their discrimination: “Testa bivalvis inaequivalvis, adherens: natibus
                    conicis, maximis, divergentibus, in spiram irregularem contortis. Dens
                    cardinalis maximus, crassus, concavus, auricularis in valvula majore.
                    Impressiones duo musculares.” It occurs only in a fossil state.</p>
                <p>Before dismissing this Linnaean division of shells, we must notice another genus
                    which has been added to it by Lamark, from species brought from the Indian Seas.
                    He terms it <hi rend="italic">etheria,</hi> and originally described its generic
                    character in the following words: “Coquille bivalve, inequivalve,irregulière,
                    adherente, a crochets court, enfonces dans la base des valves et deriges de
                    cote. Charnière sans dent; deux impressions musculaires séparées et laterales.
                    Ligament demi-interieur, enveloppant une callosité oblongée, et sortant en
                    dehors par one fissure recourbée.” He has described four species which are very
                    rugged on the outside, but finely nacred within, and has placed the genus in his
                    family <hi rend="italic">camacea,</hi> while in external aspect, and in the
                    absence of teeth, the species make a near approach to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ostreacea.</hi></p>
                <p>13. <hi rend="smallcaps">Arc a.</hi> Linnaeus assimilated, under this genus,
                    every shell the hinge of which presented numerous mutually inserted teeth. The
                    shells which were thus united, have numerous relations, and constitute a very
                    natural family. But in this family there are several groups of which Berguière
                    formed sections and Lamark genera. The genus area is now restricted to those
                    shells in which the hinge is in a straight line, and composed of numerous small
                    lamelliform teeth, without lateral ribs. They have obtained their name from
                    their resemblance to a ship, when the shell is inverted. Many species of this
                    genus gape a little at the superior margin, to enable the animal to send out
                    those tendinous threads by which it adheres to the rocks. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >A.</hi><hi rend="italic">lactea,</hi><hi rend="italic">noae,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tetragona, barbata,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fusea,</hi> are
                    natives of the British Seas.</p>
                <p>The Linnaean arcae, whigh have the hinge line broken and angular, belong to the
                    genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Nucula.</hi> In this genus the beaks are contiguous
                    and turned a little backwards. The <hi rend="italic">nucula,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nuclea,</hi><hi rend="italic">minuta, rostrata,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">tenuis,</hi> are found on our shores.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Pectunculus,</hi> the hinge teeth are situated
                    on a curved line, the shell is nearly orbicular, and the muscular impressions,
                    which are two in number, form each a callous projection with a sharp margin. The
                    arca <hi rend="italic">pilosa,</hi> a native of Britain, is referable to this
                    genus.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Cucullaea,</hi> the teeth of the hinge are
                    similar to the arcae, but at each extremity there are three or four transverse
                    parallel ribs. It is represented by the area <hi rend="italic">cueullata</hi> of
                    Chemn. <hi rend="italic">(Conch,</hi> vii. p. 174. tab. 55. f. 526-528.)</p>
                <p>To the family arcacea, Lamark, at one period, added the genus which he terms <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Trigonia.</hi> The hinge teeth are only two in number,
                    diverging and compressed, but they are transversely grooved on each side. The
                    muscular impressions are two in number in the recent species, <hi rend="italic"
                    >T.</hi><hi rend="italic">pectinata,</hi> but in some of the fossil shells
                    referred to in this genus, Mr. Sowerby could observe only one. The trigonia now
                    forms along with castalia, the small family of Trigonées formed by Lamark at the
                    suggestion of Μ. Valenciennes.</p>
                <p>14. <hi rend="smallcaps">Ostrea.</hi> —Linnaeus, in the construction of this
                    genus, brought together many shells totally dissimilar in form, character, and
                    habit, and hence it has undergone great alterations in the hands of succeeding
                    conchologists. To associate in one genus shells which remain immoveably fixed to
                    the rocks and stones from their birth, and which exhibit few other signs of
                    vitality than the opening and shutting of their valves, with those which possess
                    a locomotive power; to unite such as are irregular in their form and imbricated
                    in their structure, with such as are of regular growth and solid texture, might
                    surely be regarded as a violation of all the laws of a natural or an artificial
                    system. Yet of such incongruous materials is the Linnaean genus ostrea composed,
                    which, in spite of all its imperfections, has still its admirers in this
                    country. (See <hi rend="italic">Descriptive Catalogue, Tin.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Transi)</hi> The first important improvement in the reformation of
                    the genus, consisted in the separation of the <hi rend="italic">pectens,</hi>
                    which was executed by Pennant, and afterwards by Bruguiere and Lamark. Since new
                    characters have been assigned to the genus ostrea, ocher separations must take
                    place. It is thus defined: “Testa bivalvis inaequivalvis, rudis adhaerens;
                    cardine edentulo. Fossula cardinalis majoris valvae actate crescens. Ligamentum
                    semi-internum. Impressio muscularis unica.” The genus may be divided into two
                    sections; the first having the margin of the valves simple, as the common
                    oyster; and in the second the margins are plaited, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >0. crista-galli.</hi></p>
                <p>In consequence of this change in the generic character, the ostrea <hi
                    rend="italic">malleus</hi> of Linnaeus, (Lister, tab. 219, f∙ 54.,)has been
                    formed into the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Malleus.</hi> The shell is free,
                    gapes a little at the beaks, produces a byssus, has no teeth in the hinge but a
                    conical pit for the insertion of the ligament, placed obliquely on the margin of
                    each valve. It was for a long time highly prized by collectors.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Pecten</hi> is one of thebest cha.∙deterised, most
                    natural, and most beautiful, in the system. The shell is inequivalve and
                    regular, the hinge is destitute of teeth, and the internal ligament is fixed to
                    a triangular cardinal cavity. There are fourteen species natives of our
                    shores.</p>
                <p>From the ostrea <hi rend="italic">perna, ephippium,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >isogonum,</hi> Bruguière formed the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Perna.</hi> The
                    hinge is linear, and cut into a number of lengthened parallel veins, which
                    receive the ligament. The interstices are formed into teeth, which simply oppose
                    those of the other valve. In the anterior side of the valve, near the beaks,
                    there is a callosity, and an opening for the byssus of the animal.</p>
                <p>Lamark has constituted another genus, nearly allied to the pernae, which he
                    styles <hi rend="smallcaps">Crenatula.</hi> The hinge in this genus presents
                    only a row of pits for the ligament, which makes it appear crenulated. The
                    intermediate spaces are not formed into teeth, neither is there any callosity,
                    or opening for the byssus. He has figured two new species, which he terms <hi
                    rend="italic">avicularis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mytiloides,</hi> and a third
                    is the ostrea <hi rend="italic">picta</hi> of Gmelin, (Chemn. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conch,</hi> vii. p. 243. tab. 38. f. 575.)</p>
                <p>Nearly related to the pectens is the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Lima</hi> of
                    Bruguière. The species differ, however, in the ligament being in a great measure
                    on the outside. They are all of a white colour. The ostrea <hi rend="italic"
                    >lima</hi> is considered as the type of the genus.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Pedum</hi> of Bruguière differs from the preceding
                    in the ligament being external, and attached to a long straight fissure. The
                    ostrea <hi rend="italic">spondiloidea</hi> of Chemn. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Conclu</hi> viii. t. 72. fig. 669, 670,) is considered as the type of the
                    genus.</p>
                <p>To this family we must add two genera, possessed of very singular characters.
                    They have neither hinge nor ligament. The first, instituted by the celebrated
                    botanist, Commerson, is termed <hi rend="smallcaps">Acardo.</hi> The valves are
                    depressed and nearly equal, and held together by the adductor muscle. The
                    species at present known come from the eastern coast of Africa. The second is
                    termed <hi rend="italic">radiolites,</hi> and was instituted by Lamark. It
                    differs from the former in the form of the valves, the inferior being
                    turbinated, and the superior convex or conical. The species occur only in a
                    fossil state, and have "been long known to geognosts under the title <hi
                    rend="italic">ostracites.</hi></p>
                <p>15. <hi rend="smallcaps">Ανομία.</hi> In the Linnaean system, this genus is
                    equally faulty as the last. It contains many species, which <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193823681" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3681-0344"/> differ greatly from one
                    another and from the generic character. Some arc found recent on our shores,
                    while others occur only in a fossil state. Lamark, having rectified the Linnaean
                    character of the genus, has separated many species, now grouped, into distinct
                    genera. In the restricted genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Ανομία,</hi> the under
                    valve has a bole or groove near the beak, which is closed by a testaceous
                    operculum. This appendage is fixed to rocks or stones, and has a ligament
                    attached to it.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Crania,</hi> represented by the Anomia <hi
                    rend="italic">crano-laris</hi> of Linnaeus, the under valve is pierced by three
                    holes, which are oblique and unequal. The genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Grythaea</hi> was constituted from the Anomia <hi rend="italic">Gryphus</hi> of
                    Linnaeus. The inferior valve is concave, terminating in a spirally involuted
                    beak, projecting upwards; the upper valve is small, and resembles a lid. A
                    transversely striated pit at the hinge contains the ligament. The only recent
                    species known is called <hi rend="italic">G.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >angulata.</hi> Many species are found in a fossil state in the rocks of this
                    country.</p>
                <p>Among the Anomia, Linnaeus placed the shells which compose the genus <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Terebratula,</hi> the characters of which are so obvious and
                    distinct. In this genus, which is inequivalve and regular, the beak of the
                    larger valve is produced, and pierced with a hole, through which the ligament of
                    adhesion passes. From the great extent of this genus in fossil species, several
                    subdivisions have been proposed.</p>
                <p>From the Anomia placenta of Linnaeus, Lamark has formed his genus <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Placuna.</hi> The hinge is remarkable for two teeth on the one
                    valve, placed like the letter V, the base toward the beak, and two impressions
                    on the other valve. It occurs in the Indian Scas. The natives polish it for
                    ornaments.</p>
                <p>To Lamark we are also indebted for having formed the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Calceola</hi> from the anomia <hi rend="italic">sandalum</hi> of Linnaeus. The
                    largest valve is sandal-shaped, and has at the hinge two or three small teeth.
                    The other valve is small, flat, semi-orbicular, and resembles an operculum. It
                    is frequent in a fossil state in Germany.</p>
                <p>Mr. Sowerby, in his valuable work on <hi rend="italic">British Mineral
                    Conchology,</hi> has made us acquainted with several new genera of fossil
                    shells, which, by the older naturalists, would have been inserted in the genus
                    Anomia. The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Pentameres</hi> is an equal-sided
                    inequivalve bivalve, with one valve, divided by a longitudinal internal septum
                    into two parts, the other by two septa into three parts or valves. Beaks
                    incurved, imperforate. He has figured three species of this curious genus.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Plagiostoma</hi> of Sowerby, is represented by the
                    Pectenites <hi rend="italic">Plagiostomus</hi> of Luid, (tab. 10, f. 639,) and
                    is thus defined: “An oblique cared bivalve, hinge destitute of teeth or internal
                    pit. Line of the hinge straight in one valve, in the other deeply cut by an
                    angular sinus.” He gives figures of two species in his first volume, the <hi
                    rend="italic">gigantea</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">spinosa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and many others have been subsequently detected.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Dianchora</hi> is nearly related to the preceding,
                    but in this the shell is fixed, and the attached valve has an opening in place
                    of a beak. The other valve is beaked and cared.</p>
                <p>The anomia <hi rend="italic">spinosa</hi> of Linnaeus probably belongs to Mr.
                    Sowerby’s genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Productus,</hi> which he thus defines: “An
                    equilateral unequal-valved bivalve, with a reflcxed, more or less cylindrical
                    margin; hinge transverse, linear; beak imperforate; one valve convex, the other
                    flat or concave externally.” But many new genera must be instituted, to embrace
                    all the fossil species which would have been referred by Linnaeus to the genus
                    Anomia.</p>
                <p>16. <hi rend="smallcaps">Mytilus.</hi> Before proceeding to notice those new
                    genera which have been formed from the Linnaean mytili, we may state, that the
                    three parasitical species of the <hi rend="italic">Systema</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Naturae,</hi> belong to the genus Ostrea, to which they have been transferred
                    by late authors. But improvements of a more important kind have been effected.
                    Linnaeus had associated together in this genus both fluviatile and marine
                    shells. The former now constitute a very natural genus termed <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Anodonta,</hi> formerly referred to, of which the British
                    rivers furnish several species. The muscular impressions are three in
                    number.</p>
                <p>It was easy to perceive that the mytilus hirundo of Linnaeus did not belong to
                    the true mussels, it being an inequivalve shell. Accordingly Lamark has
                    constituted a new genus for its reception, which he terms <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Avicula.</hi> The mytilus <hi rend="italic">margaritiferas</hi> of Linnaeus is
                    of this genus.</p>
                <p>Lamark, by restricting the characters of the genus mytilus to include such
                    species as have the beak terminal, has in this manner separated the transverse
                    species to form the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Modiola.</hi> The mytilus
                    modiolus of Linnaeus is the type of the genus. It is common on the British
                    shores, together with the modiola <hi rend="italic">discors</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">discrepans.</hi> We are at a loss to account for the scruples of
                    Lamark <hi rend="italic">(Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">de Museuss,</hi> vol.
                    X.) about considering this genus as byssiferous. Had he ever examined the figure
                    of the type of the genus in tab. 53 of <hi rend="italic">Zoologia Danica,</hi>
                    all his doubts would have been removed.</p>
                <p>17. <hi rend="smallcaps">Pinna. No</hi> changes have taken place in this Linnaean
                    genus, except that a few new species have been added.</p>
                <p>In the course of our review of the Linnaean genera of bivalves, we have exposed
                    some of those errors which the Swedish naturalist committed in associating
                    discordant species under the same genus. Perhaps our examination of the
                    univalves will make us better acquainted with the imperfections of that system,
                    and dispose us to prize those improvements which subsequent naturalists have
                    introduced.</p>
                <p>18. <hi rend="smallcaps">Argonauta.</hi> This genus, which contains but few
                    species, is highly prised by collectors, who call the principal species by the
                    name of paper nautilus. By restricting the characters of this genus, so as to
                    embrace only those species in which the opening is interrupted by the involution
                    of the spire, and in which the dorsal ridge is double, Lamark has been able to
                    form the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Carinaria.</hi> In this the mouth is entire,
                    and the dorsal ridge single. It is represented by the argonauta <hi
                    rend="italic">vitrea</hi> of Gmelin.</p>
                <p>18. <hi rend="smallcaps">Nautilus.</hi> Since the days of Linnaeus, our knowledge
                    of the <hi rend="italic">multilocular</hi> testacea has been greatly enlarged.
                    He contented himself with arranging all the species with which he was acquainted
                    under one genus, but, in consequence of modern industry, even the genera exceed
                    the number of Linnaean species. Many recent species have been discovered by the
                    aid of the microscope, among the sand on the sea shore, and a still greater
                    number in a fossil state among the calcerous strata. These newly discovered
                    kinds exhibit many different characters, and have compelled conchologists to
                    institute so many new genera for their reception, that the genus Nautilus of
                    Linnaeus appears rather as the head of a family or order, than as a separate
                    genus of univalve shells. In this department the names of Bruguière, Lamark,
                    Μontfort, Parkinson, and Sowerby, deserve respectful notice; and it is from
                    their writings that the following remarks concerning the multilocular testacea
                    have been extracted. The multilocular testacea may be divided into three
                    sections; the first including those which are obviously spiral; the second,
                    those which are produced; and the third, those which are of a globular or
                    lenticular form. These sections are merely provisional, and are only intended to
                    render more obvious and intelligible our notices of the genera.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The spiral multilocular</hi><hi rend="italic">testacea.</hi>
                    At the head of this first division stands the modern genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Nautilus,</hi> in which the turns of the spire are contiguous, and the last
                    whorl incloses the others. The partitions are perforated by a tube. We possess
                    on our shores several species of this genus, of which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >N.</hi><hi rend="italic">crispus</hi> is the most common.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823694" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3694-0345"/>
                <p>In form, the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Lenticulina</hi> is nearly related to the
                    former. The margin of the mouth reaches to the centre of the shell on both
                    sides, and the partitions are destitute of a syphon. Lamark is in possession of
                    a recent shell of this species from the sea near Teneriff.</p>
                <p>The shells which Mr. Sowerby, in his <hi rend="italic">Mineral Conchology,</hi>
                    has figured under the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Ellipsolithes,</hi> have the
                    whorls conspicuous, although the mouth clasps the body whorl. But it is easily
                    distinguished from the other genera with which it is related by its elliptical
                    form.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Discorbis</hi> of Lamark (formerly called by him
                    Planulites) bears a considerable resemblance to the nantilus in form, but the
                    whorls are all apparent, and the partitions entire.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Rotalia,</hi> the spires approach to a conical
                    shape, and the marginated trigonal aperture is reflected towards the base of the
                    shell. It consists of shells which are now found in a fossil state.</p>
                <p>The nautilus spirula of Linnaeus has afforded characters for the construction of
                    a new genus termed <hi rend="smallcaps">Sγirula.</hi> The whorls are separate,
                    the mouth orbicular, the partitions perforated by a tube, and the last turn of
                    the spire prolonged in a straight line. This last character was unknown to
                    Linnaeus, who had only seen the spiral body of the shell.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Sγirolina</hi> has the last turn of the spire
                    produced like the preceding, but the whorls are contiguous. The partitions are
                    perforated by a tube.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Lituola</hi> is allied to the spirula and
                    spirolina in the production of the last whorl. The spires of the body are
                    contiguous, and the partitions are pierced by a number of holes.</p>
                <p>In the preceding genera the inner walls of the cavity are simple; but in the two
                    following, the walls are formed into joints by sinuous sutures. The first of
                    these is the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ammonites,</hi> including those shells which
                    have been termed <hi rend="italic">cornua ammonis.</hi> The origin of this name
                    is, by some, sought for in their resemblance to the horns of a ram; by others,
                    to their having been found near the temple of Jupiter Ammon in Upper Egypt. By
                    the Indians, the <hi rend="italic">ammonites sacer</hi> is considered as a
                    metamorphosis of the god Vishnu, and termed by them <hi rend="italic"
                    >salgram</hi> or <hi rend="italic">salgraman.</hi> It is found among the peebles
                    of the Gandica where it joins the Ganges. In this genus the whorls are
                    contiguous, spiral, depressed, and obvious.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Orbulites</hi> of Lamark differs from the ammonites in
                    the circumstance of the last whorl embracing and concealing the others. In both
                    the syphon is marginal.</p>
                <p>Nearly allied to the preceding is the <hi rend="smallcaps">Turrilites</hi> of
                    Montfort. It is similar in internal structure, but while the shells of the
                    former are spirally discoid, those of the present genus are spirally turreted,
                    resembling a Turbo or Turricula. Several species are figured by Sowerby in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Mineral Concliology.</hi></p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Scaγnites,</hi> formed by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parkinson,</hi> possesses very peculiar characters. It commences with a
                    depressed volution, the last turn of which, after being enlarged and elongated,
                    is diminished and reflected inwards.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Multilocular</hi><hi rend="italic">testacea</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">with the shell produced.</hi> It must be confessed, that the
                    genera of this section are but imperfectly understood. The recent kinds are too
                    small to admit of any investigation of the animal, so that we are left entirely
                    to conjecture.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Hippurites</hi> is of a conical form, and either
                    straight or crooked. Within it is transversely chambered, and furnished with two
                    lateral, longitudinal, obtuse, converging ridges. The last chamber is closed by
                    an operculum.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ortiiocera</hi> the shell is straight or slightly
                    bent, and conical. The chambers are distinct, and pierced with a tube. We
                    possess on our shores many minute species of this genus.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Baculites</hi> of Faujas St. Fond possesses a
                    structure similar to the ammonites, the inner walls being articulated with
                    sinuous sutures, and the partitions perforated The shell is fusiform or bent
                    into tw0 parallel limbs. Mr. Parkinson has contributed greatly to our knowledge
                    of this genus, and has termed it <hi rend="italic">Hamites.</hi> We prefer the
                    name of the original discoverer to that of our English naturalist, which is very
                    faulty. For, according to Pliny, “Hammites ovis piscium similis est.”</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Belemnites</hi> the shell is straight, conical,
                    pointed, solid at the summit, and furnished with a lateral gutter. There is
                    seldom more than one of the cells apparent, of a conical form, the older ones
                    having been effaced in succession. The genus <hi rend="italic">Tulaxodes</hi> of
                    Guettard is not, perhaps, entitled to be considered as distinct.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Amplexus</hi> of Sowerby belongs to this division. It is
                    nearly cylindrical, divided into chambers by numerous transverse septa, which
                    embrace each other with their reflected margins. It contains one species from
                    the limestone rocks of Ireland, but we may add that it has been supposed to
                    belong to the zoophytes rather than the mollusea.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Multilocular</hi><hi rend="italic">testacea</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">of a globular form.</hi> The first genus of this section is the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Miliola.</hi> The shell is composed of three or four oval
                    cells, turning round an axis parallel to their longest diameter. Many recent
                    species of this genus are common on our shores; they were included by Montagu in
                    his genus vermiculum.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Renulina</hi> the cells are narrow, linear,
                    unilateral, curved into a part of a circle, and all situate on the same plane.
                    The smallest cell forms a little arch round a marginal axis, and the others are
                    placed contiguous to this on the same side. The species are all fossil.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Gyrogona</hi> was for many years viewed as a shell of a
                    spheroidal form, composed of linear, curved, grooved, pieces, terminating in two
                    poles, the external surface obliquely spiral, the spires terminating at each
                    pole, and as found only in a fossil state. But more recent observations have
                    connected it with the seed vessel of the genus chara.</p>
                <p>The shells of the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Nummuli*γes</hi> are remarkable for
                    their lenticular form. The external surface is smooth, and the cells concealed,
                    but internally the transverse shells are disposed in a spiral discoid form. The
                    cells are imperforate; they are the camerinae of Bruguière, the helecites of
                    Guettard, and the discolithes of Fortis. This last author supposes, that they
                    are formed in the interior of an animal analogous to the sepia. The same opinion
                    may, with propriety, be entertained of many other genera of multilocular
                    testacea. Faujas St. Fond found a recent specimen of a nummulite among the
                    fragments of the corallina officinalis, brought from the island of Corsica.</p>
                <p>It is probable that the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Lagena,</hi> formed from the
                    serpulae <hi rend="italic">lagenae</hi> of Walker’s <hi rend="italic">Testacea
                    minuta Pariora,</hi> belongs to the multilocular testacea; as in some of the
                    species we have observed the appearances of internal divisions.</p>
                <p>As connected with this division of the Linnaean genera, we may take notice of the
                    British shell called by Lightfoot <hi rend="italic">Nautilus lacustns, (Phil.
                    Trans,</hi> lxxvi. tab. 1). The very circumstance of its being a fresh water
                    shell, distinguishes it sufficiently from all those which we have been
                    considering, and its other characters are likewise peculiar. The partitions are
                    distant, and consist of three testaceous plates, not united, which leave a
                    sufficient opening between them to allow the animal to protrude and withdraw
                    itself. It constitutes a distinct genus, which has been termed <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Segmentina,</hi> from the trivial name bestowed on it by
                    Solander, which refers to the structure of the septa. Its place in the system is
                    next to the genus planorbis.</p>
                <p>These genera of multilocular shells which we have enumerated, are those which
                    have been established with the greatest attention. Many other genera might have
                    been enumerated, particularly those formed by Montfort, but the character given
                    of them by Cuvier will satisfy the curiosity <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823707"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-3707-0346"/> of the reader. When speaking of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Conchyliologie Systématique</hi> of that author, in reference to
                    this subject, he says, “<hi rend="italic">Où presque toutes les especes et même
                    des variétés sont érigées en genres^</hi></p>
                <p>19· <hi rend="smallcaps">Conus.</hi> —This genus is so very natural, that it has
                    undergone no changes since the days of Linnaeus, except by the addition of new
                    species. That author was acquainted with thirty-five species and a few
                    varieties; but Μ. Hawss communicated to Bruguière descriptions of one hundred
                    and forty-six, from specimens existing in his own cabinet. We cannot boast of
                    any British species.</p>
                <p>20. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cytraea</hi> —This genus is equally natural as the
                    former. It has undergone no change since the days of Major.</p>
                <p>21. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bulla</hi> —This genus presents to the mere conchologist
                    a source of great perplexity. It displays at once the absurdity of dividing the
                    molluscous ⅝nimals into testaceous and naked, since no such distinctionis
                    observable in nature. Many of the shells which were formerly included in this
                    genus are found to be contained within the common integuments of the animal. It
                    was this circumstance which induced Linnaeus to separate the limax and the
                    aplysia from the vermes testacea. Both of these have shells, but they are
                    concealed. In imitation of the same principle, Lamark has formed a new genus
                    among the naked mollusea, called <hi rend="smallcaps">Bullaea,</hi> for the
                    reception of those bullae in which the shell is concealed. The bulla <hi
                    rend="italic">aperta</hi> is the type of the genus. The bulla plumula of Montagu
                    is another shell included in the animal, which is very closely connected with
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Pleuro-branchia</hi> of Cuvier. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Annales du Mus.</hi> v. 269)∙ It may be asked, are all the other bullae found
                    in similar situations, and consequently do they belong to the naked mollusea?
                    Lamark considers, and apparently with reason, that all those which are
                    distinctly spirally involuted, and ornamented with colqurs, are not entirely
                    inclosed in the cloak of the animal, and ought therefore to be ranged with the
                    testaceous mollusea. How few British species does this character include. As
                    originally constituted, the genus of Linnaeus contained species of very
                    different characters, so that many new genera have been formed. To Bruguière,
                    Lamark, and Draparnaud, we owe all the improvements which have taken place.</p>
                <p>The modern genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Bulla</hi> includes those shells which
                    correspond with the following character:—“Testa univalvis, convoluta,
                    ovato-gibbosa vel cylindracea: spira non exserta, apertura longitudine testae,
                    labro acuto.” The Β. ampulla is the type of the genus.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Ovula,</hi> instituted by Bruguière, is more
                    nearly related to the cyprea than to the bulla. It differs, however, from the
                    former, in the left margin of the lip being smooth; and from the latter, in the
                    edges of the mouth being rolled inwards, and in the shell being produced at both
                    ends. The B. ovum of Linnaeus is the type of the genus; the B. patula of
                    Pennant.</p>
                <p>The bulla terebellum has been employed by Lamark to constitute his genus <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Terebellum.</hi> The canal at the base of the mouth, and the
                    truncated pillar, furnish the generic characters.</p>
                <p>Linnaeus was for some time uncertain where to place those shells which he at last
                    inserted in the genus bulla, under the trivial names ficus and rapa. These, with
                    a few of the <hi rend="italic">murices</hi> of the same author, constitute the
                    genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Pyrula</hi> of Lamark. Its canaliculated base removes
                    it from the bullae, while tire short spire, the swelling of the last whorl, the
                    smooth pillar, and pyriform shape, distinguish it from all those with which it
                    is apt to be confounded. It is more nearly allied to the Fusus than to any
                    other.</p>
                <p>The preceding genera consist of species which live in the sea. The B. virginea is
                    a terrestrial shell, and ought to form a distinct genus next the bulinius. The
                    B. fontinalis, hypnorum, and rivalis, reside in fresh water. They have, with
                    much propriety, been formed into a distinct genus by</p>
                <p>Draparnaud, which he calls <hi rend="smallcaps">Physa.</hi> They are all
                    sinistral shells, and will require further division when the form of the animal
                    shall become the basis of generic distinction. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >fontinalis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hypnorum</hi> are natives of Britain.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Achatina</hi> of Lamark, the pillar is
                    truncated as in the terrebellum, but the base of the mouth is entire. It is
                    represented by the bulla achatina of Linnaeus. To this genus we may refer the
                    <hi rend="italic">Buccinum acicula</hi> of Müller, which is found in England,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Helix</hi><hi rend="italic">octona</hi> of Linnaeus,
                    erroneously considered as a native of Britain.</p>
                <p>22. <hi rend="smallcaps">Voluta.</hi> —This genus, as originally formed by
                    Linnaeus, depended, as he informs us, on the plicae of the pillar, “volutae
                    genus facillime distinguitur columella plicata.” But as this character belongs
                    to many shells otherwise very different in form, succeeding conchologists have
                    separated many species from the genus, and reduced it within more natural
                    limits. As it now stands it is thus defined, “Testa univalvis, ovata,
                    subventricoa, apice papillari; basi emargi-nata. Columella plicata; plicis
                    inferioribus, majoribus, vel longioribus.” The type of the genus is the voluta
                    musica.</p>
                <p>Bruguiere removed from the Linnaean genus those species which are destitute of a
                    groove at the base of their mouth, and of which Lamark formed the genera <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Auricula, Tornatella,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Volvaria.</hi> In the latter the spire is not produced; in the former it is
                    produced. To the genus auricula, which contains land-shells, the <hi
                    rend="italic">V. auris-midae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">auris-judae</hi> belong.
                    The <hi rend="italic">V.</hi><hi rend="italic">tornatilis</hi> is the type of
                    the genus tornatella. In his reference to the genus volvaria, Lamark quotes the
                    bulla <hi rend="italic">cylindracea</hi> of Pennant and Da Costa, as if they
                    were one and the same. But Pennant’s shell is a true bulla, while that of Da
                    Costa is regarded as the voluta <hi rend="italic">pallida</hi> of Linnaeus, and
                    probably belongs to this genus.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Oliva,</hi> the turns of the spire are
                    separated externally by a very distinct gutter or canal, and the pillar is
                    obliquely striated. The <hi rend="italic">voluta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >oliva</hi> of Linnaeus contains many different species of this genus, which are
                    remarkable for the smoothness of their surface and the brilliancy of their
                    colours.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Ancilla,</hi> which, like the former, is of a
                    sub-cylindric form, is destitute of the groove which separates the whorls, and
                    is characterised by an oblique callous ring at the base of the pillar.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Mitra</hi> of Lamark, the spire is pointed
                    instead of ending in a small knob, as in voluta, and the plicae of the pillar
                    increase in size from the base upwards, which is the reverse in that genus. The
                    <hi rend="italic">V.</hi><hi rend="italic">episcopalis</hi> of Linnaeus is the
                    type of this genus, which contains many species much sought after by
                    collectors.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Columbella,</hi> the shell is oval, the spire short,
                    and the inner edge of the right lip is swollen. The <hi rend="italic">V.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mercatoria</hi> is the type of the genus.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Marginella</hi> is very distinctly marked by the
                    prominent callous collar which surrounds the outside of the right edge of the
                    shell. The opening of the mouth at the base is scarcely grooved. The <hi
                    rend="italic">V. glabella</hi> is the type of the genus.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Cancellaria</hi> is nearly related to the genus
                    columbella, but the absence of the swelling of the lip, and the presence of the
                    compressed sharp plicae of the pillar, furnish sufficiently obvious characters
                    of distinction. The <hi rend="italic">V.</hi><hi rend="italic">cancellata</hi>
                    of Linnaeus is the type of the genus.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Turbinellus</hi> the shell is turbinated,
                    sub-fusiform, and canaliculated at the base, having from three to five
                    transverse compressed plicae on the pillar. The <hi rend="italic">V. pyrum</hi>
                    is the type of the genus.</p>
                <p>23. <hi rend="smallcaps">Buccinum</hi> —This is another of the Linnaean genera of
                    shells, which has undergone great alterations. As originally constructed, it
                    embraced many distinct groups of shells, which Bruguière and Lamark have since
                    formed into genera. The restricted character of the genus Buccinum is <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193823720" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3720-0347"/> thus defined by
                    the last mentioned author: “Testa unival- ' vis, ovata vel elongata. Apertura
                    oblonga, basi emargina-ta, nudata, canali nullo. Collumella convexa plana.”</p>
                <p>Bruguiere separated the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Cassis,</hi> in which the
                    opening is oblong and denticulated on the right side, with a short canal towards
                    the back of the shell. The right margin has a callous border. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Buccinum</hi><hi rend="italic">cornutum</hi> of Linnaeus is the
                    type of the species.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Terebra</hi> was likewise formed by the same
                    author. It is remarkable for its turreted form, the spire being at least twice
                    as long as the mouth, and the pillar at the base twisted.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Nassa</hi> the groove in which the mouth
                    terminates is reflected as in Cassis, but the left edge of the mouth is callous,
                    and forms upon the pillar a transverse fold.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Purpura</hi> is readily distinguished from the Buccinum
                    and Murex, with which it has often been associated by its naked compressed
                    pillar, ending in a point at the base.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Dolium</hi> is distinguished by its bellied forms
                    and transverse rings, together with the margin on the right side being
                    denticulated its whole length.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">FIarpa</hi> is well known, and is distinguished by
                    its sharp parallel longitudinal ribs. The pillar is smooth and pointed at the
                    base.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Eburnea,</hi> the shell is smooth, and the
                    pillar umbilicated and subcanaliculated at the base. The buccinum <hi
                    rend="italic">glabratum</hi> is the type of the genus.</p>
                <p>24. <hi rend="smallcaps">Strombus.</hi> This Linnaean genus is now converted into
                    a family, distinguished by the right margin changing its form with age, and
                    having towards the base an indenture or sinus. It contains four genera,
                    strombus, rostellaria, pterocera, and hippocrenis.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Strombus,</hi> the canal is short, the right
                    margin is simple, and ends in a sinus. The &amp; <hi rend="italic">pugilis</hi>
                    of Linnaeus is the type of this genus-</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rostellaria</hi> the canal is produced into a long
                    beak, the right edge of the mouth is entire, and rests above on the spire, and
                    is sometimes decurrent. The sinus is contiguous to the canal. The <hi
                    rend="italic">R.</hi><hi rend="italic">cornuta</hi> of Mart. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Conch,</hi> iv. tab. 158. f. 1495,) is the type of the species.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Pterocera</hi> the canal is also lengthened, but the
                    right margin is dilated and digitated with a sinus near the base. The strombus
                    pes-pelicani of our shores is of this genus.</p>
                <p>25. <hi rend="smallcaps">Murex.</hi> The modern genus of this name is thus
                    defined by Lamark: “Testa univalvis, ovata vel oblonga; basi caniculata; suturis
                    varicoo-tumudis, sub asperis, longitudinalibus, et persistentibus.” In
                    consequence of this restriction, the following genera, among others, have been
                    instituted.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Fasciolaria,</hi> the spires are destitute of
                    those longitudinal ribs which the murices always exhibit, while the pillar is
                    furnished with two or three oblique folds. The murex <hi rend="italic"
                    >tulipa</hi> of Linnaeus is the type of this genus.</p>
                <p>The shell of the genus Fusus is lengthened, generally fusiform, destitute of
                    longitudinal ribs, and bellied in the middle or lower part with a smooth pillar
                    and lengthened, canal. The <hi rend="italic">F. longicauda,</hi> (Lister, tab.
                    918, f. 11. A.) is the type.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Pleurotoma</hi> is distinguished from the preceding by a
                    sinus or groove, which appears on the margin of the right edge of the mouth,
                    near its summit. It is represented by the Μ. Babylonicus of Linnaeus. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi></p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Clavatula</hi> differs from the former, in
                    possessing a short canal, and ought never to have been separated.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Ceritinum,</hi> the mouth is oblique,
                    terminating below in a short truncated or recurved canal, and having at the

                <p>26. <hi rend="smallcaps">Trochus.</hi> This is a very natural genus in the
                    Linnaean system, and has undergone few alterations in the hands of modern
                    conchologists. The T∙ perspectivus has given rise to a new and very obvious
                    genus, termed <hi rend="smallcaps">Solarium,</hi> characterized by the internal
                    spiral edge of the umbilicus being crenulated. Another species, the <hi
                    rend="italic">T. labio,</hi> is the type of the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Monodonta,</hi> which contains shells of an oval form, with a rounded mouth,
                    furnished with a tooth, formed by the truncated projecting base of the pillar:
                    the two margins are separated. The turreted trochi of Linnaeus constitute the
                    genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Pyramidella.</hi></p>
                <p>The T. terrestris of British writers is so imperfectly described and figured,
                    that it is impossible to assign it a place in the system. It is nearly allied to
                    the helix.</p>
                <p>27. <hi rend="smallcaps">Turbo.</hi> This very extensive genus has been greatly
                    dismembered by modern conchologists, in consequence of Lamark having restricted
                    the character in the following terms: “Testa univalvis, conoidea vel subturrita.
                    Apertura integra rotundata, edentula; marginibus superne semper disjunctis;
                    columella basi planulata.” Our T. littoreus is now considered as constituting
                    the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Littorina.</hi></p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Scalaria,</hi> the mouth is circular and
                    bordered, with the margins united. The spires are covered with raised edged,
                    slightly oblique, longitudinal ribs. The famous wentletrap is the type of the
                    genus.</p>
                <p>Lamark thus defines his genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Delphinula</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">:</hi> « Testa univalvis subdiscoidea vel abreviato conica,
                    solida, margaritacea, umbilicata; anfractibus subasperis. Apertura rotundata,
                    marginibus orbiculatim connexis.” The <hi rend="italic">T. delphinus</hi> is the
                    type of the genus. There are many species of turbines common on our shores,
                    which are excluded by the preceding characters from the genera turbo and
                    delphinula, such as the striatus, cingellus, bryereus and others. They are
                    distinctly turreted, with the margins of the mouth united, and constitute a
                    genus termed <hi rend="smallcaps">Cingula.</hi></p>
                <p>The Turbo terebra of Linnaeus serves as the type of another genus, termed <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Turritella,</hi> in which the margins of the mouth are
                    disjoined, the spire regularly turreted, and the lip emarginated by a sinus.
                    Nearly allied to the preceding is the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Phasianella,</hi> which Lamark thus defines: Testa univalvis, ovata vel conica,
                    solida. Apertura longitudinalis, ovata, integra; labro simplici acuto. Columella
                    laevis basi attenuta. Operculum calcareum vel corneum animali adherens.”</p>
                <p>Perhaps a rigorous examination of the turbines of British writers might justify
                    the formation of one or two new genera. In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Õdostomia,</hi> the columella is furnished with a tooth. The Turbo
                    interstincta, unidentata, plicata, Sandivicensis and insculpta of Montagu, are
                    of this genus. They have no resemblance in their structure to the Linnaean
                    volutae; although they have been inconsiderately associated with them by the
                    authors of the <hi rend="italic">Descriptive Catalogue.</hi> The preceding
                    genera are formed of marine shells; those that follow live on the land.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Cyclostoma,</hi> the mouth is circular, with
                    united, and often reflected margins. The animal is furnished with an operculum.
                    The <hi rend="italic">T. elegans</hi> of Montagu is the only British species of
                    the genus.</p>
                <p>The species which are related to the Turbo bidens perversus and muscorum of
                    Linnaeus, constitute a very natural family, which may be termed <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pupacea,</hi> distinguished by the mouth being furnished with
                    teeth or testaceous laininae, and the last whorl nearly the same or less than
                    the preceding. Perhaps the most convenient way of dividing them is into two
                    sections, the first including the dextral, and the second the sinistral
                    shells.</p>
                <p>The dextral pupacea form two genera. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Pupa,</hi> as
                    originally constructed by Lamark, was equally faulty with many of the old
                    Linnaean genera. As it has been restricted to include dextral shells, with the
                    animal possessing four tentacula, with eyes at the tips of the two longest, it
                    can <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823733" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3733-0348"/> embrace
                    the <hi rend="italic">muscarum,</hi><hi rend="italic">sexdentatus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tridens,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">juniperi</hi> of Montagu. In
                    the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Carychium,</hi> formed by Muller, the tentacula
                    are only two in number, with the eyes placed at the base. It is represented by
                    the <hi rend="italic">T. carychium</hi> of Montagu.</p>
                <p>The sinistral pupacea form likewise two genera. The first, which is the Clausilia
                    of Draparnaud, contains sinistral shells, with the animal furnished with four
                    tentacula, with eyes at the tips of the two longest. This contains the following
                    British species, viz. <hi rend="italic">bidens,</hi><hi rend="italic">perversa,
                    biplicata, plicatula,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">labiata.</hi> The other genus,
                    called <hi rend="smallcaps">Vertigo,</hi> was formed by Muller. The animal
                    possesses only two tentacula, with the eyes on their tips. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >T. vertigo</hi> is the type of the genus.</p>
                <p>28. <hi rend="smallcaps">Helix.</hi> Linnaeus, in constructing this genus,
                    attended only to the character of the mouth being contracted or lunated, without
                    regarding the habits of the animals, or even the other forms which the shells
                    exhibited. Hence he has united globose, discoid, and turreted, terrestrial,
                    fluviatile, and aquatic shells; animals with two and with four tentacula, with
                    and without an operculum, oviparous and viviparous.</p>
                <p>The marine species of Linnaeus are few in number. The genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Jantiiina</hi> of Lamark, has been formed from the <hi rend="italic">H.
                    janthina</hi> of Linn, a species of which has lately occurred at several places
                    of the Irish coast. The opening is triangular, and there is an angular sinus at
                    the right edge. The shell, which Linnaeus terms <hi rend="italic">H.
                    haliotoidea,</hi> is completely concealed in the animal. There are many marine
                    shells inserted in the genus Helix by British writers, which either belong to
                    the restricted genus Turbo, or to the Vermicularia.</p>
                <p>The further reduction of the Linnaean helices depends on the separation of the
                    terrestrial from the fluviatile shells, and subdividing these according to the
                    characters furnished by the different groups.</p>
                <p>Among the terrestrial shells, the restricted genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Helix</hi> is by far the most extensive. It contains those shells which are
                    subglobose, with a convex spire; the opening entire, wider than long, and
                    diminished in its upper part by the projection of the last turn but one of the
                    spire. The animal is furnished with four tentacula, with eyes at the tips of the
                    two longest. The <hi rend="italic">H. ρomatia</hi> is the type of the genus.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Bulimus,</hi> as originally constructed by
                    Bruguière, was faulty in the extreme, but Lamark has new modelled it so as to
                    include those land shells which are turreted or conical, with the mouth larger
                    than broad, and having, in general, the margin reflected with age. Like the
                    Helices, they have no operculum, and possess four snbu1ated tentacula.</p>
                <p>From the Helix succinea of Muller (the putris of Montagu and Donovan, not of
                    Linnaeus) Draparnaud has formed the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Succinea.</hi>
                    The mouth is large in proportion to the size of the shell, and effuse at the
                    base with the outer lip thin, and the pillar attenuated. The H. succinea,
                    although found in damp places, is not amphibious. It never enters the water
                    voluntarily. Indeed, Muller says, “Sponte in aquam descendere nunquam vidi, a
                    contra quoties eum aquae immisi, confestim egrediebatur.” The same remark is
                    made by Montagu, and we have often witnessed its truth.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Helix</hi><hi rend="italic">pellucida</hi> of Muller has
                    been formed into a new genus by Daudebard, which he termed Helico-limax, but
                    which Draparnaud, to avoid the use of a hybrid name, changed for the term <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Vitrina.</hi></p>
                <p>The fluviatile shells, included by Linnaeus in his genus Helix, may, for the sake
                    of present convenience, be considered as forming two sections, viz. those with
                    and those without an operculum. To the former belongs the very natural genus <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Limnea,</hi> containing conical or turreted shells, with the
                    right lip joined to the left at the base, and folding back on the pillar. The
                    <hi rend="italic">H. stagnalis</hi> of Linnaeus, is the type of the genus, of
                    which we possess many British species. Two of these are truly amphibious, the
                    octona and fossaria.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Planorbis,</hi> instituted by Geoffroy or rather
                    by Petiver, is remarkable for its discoid form, the spire revolving nearly in a
                    horizontal line, so that all the whorls are obvious on both sides. Cuvier
                    observed that the <hi rend="italic">P. cornea</hi> was a sinistral shell, and it
                    remains to be ascertained whether the whorls in the other species have a similar
                    direction. We possess several British species of this genus.</p>
                <p>The operculated divisions of fluviatile helices, is more numerous than the
                    preceding, containing at least six genera.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Valvata</hi> was instituted by Muller to include
                    depressed shells with an orbicular mouth, the animal, furnished with three
                    tentacula and a plumose appendage, considered as the branchiae. The <hi
                    rend="italic">V.</hi><hi rend="italic">cristata</hi> (Helix crist. of Montagu),
                    and <hi rend="italic">piscinalis</hi> (the Turbo fontinalis of Montagu,) are
                    natives of this country.</p>
                <p>The genus, now denominated <hi rend="smallcaps">Paludina,</hi> instituted by
                    Geoffroy, and afterwards employed by Montfort, is represented by the <hi
                    rend="italic">H.</hi><hi rend="italic">vivipara</hi> of Linnaeus. The shell is
                    ovate or oblong, with a regularly elevated rounded spire. The aperture is
                    entire, with the two lips united angularly at the summit. The type of the genus,
                    together with <hi rend="italic">P. tentaeu-lata</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >acuta,</hi> are natives of Britain.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Ampullaria</hi> of Lamark, the shell is
                    globose, the base umbilicated, and the mouth longei' than broad. The <hi
                    rend="italic">H.</hi><hi rend="italic">ampullacea</hi> is the type of the
                    genus.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Helicina</hi> of Lamark, the mouth is
                    semilunar, the pillar callous and compressed below.· The <hi rend="italic">H.
                    neritella,</hi> (Lister, <hi rend="italic">Conch,</hi> tab. 61. fig. 59), is the
                    representative of the genus.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Melania</hi> of Lamark, the shells are
                    turreted, longer than broad, effuse at the base, with a twisted solid pillar.
                    The <hi rend="italic">H. amarula</hi> is the type.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Melanopsis</hi> was instituted by Daudebard to
                    include the shells termed melaniae by Olivier∙ in his voyage to the Levant. The
                    mouth is lanceolate, the pillar truncated and emarginated above with a callosity
                    at the base.</p>

                    and Bruguière into <hi rend="smallcaps">Nerita</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    >N.</hi><hi rend="italic">exuvia,</hi> and, in the latter, there is an
                    umbilicus, as in the <hi rend="italic">N. canrena.</hi> Of the restricted genus
                    nerita, we possess two species; the <hi rend="italic">littoralis,</hi> common on

                    propriety, into a distinct genus, under the title Neritina. The <hi

                    rivers.</p>
                <p>30. <hi rend="smallcaps">Halyotis.</hi> —This genus has been dismembered of those
                    species which are destitute of the perforations on the disc. These have been
                    formed into a new genus termed <hi rend="smallcaps">Stomatia.</hi></p>
                <p>31. <hi rend="smallcaps">Patella</hi> —This genus, which at first sight appears
                    so very natural, contains shells which exhibit considerable differences, both in
                    form and structure, when narrowly examined. Geoffroy, with great propriety,
                    separated the fluviatile species under the generic title <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ancylus,</hi> a genus afterwards employed by Muller. The animal is essentially
                    distinct from the marine patellae. There are two species of this genus, the <hi
                    rend="italic">lacustris</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fluviatilis,</hi> natives of
                    Britain.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Patella,</hi> as circumscribed by Lamark, has been
                    already sufficiently noticed. The common limpit may serve as the type of this
                    genus.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Fissurella,</hi> established by Bruguière, <pb

                    an opening like a key-hole, near the summit of the shell. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >F. graeca</hi> and <hi rend="italic">apertura</hi> are found on our coasts.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Emarginula</hi> is readily distinguished by the
                    slit or indentation which occurs on the posterior margin of the shell.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Capulus</hi> of Montfort, the shell is conical,
                    with the summit produced into a beak, more or less recurved, and twisted. The
                    <hi rend="italic">P. hungarica</hi> of Lister is the type.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Concholepas</hi> is furnished with an operculum,

                    >Calyptraea,</hi> in which the cavity is furnished with a spiral diaphragm. The
                    <hi rend="italic">C. equestris</hi> is the type of the genus, which is related
                    in part to the trochi. From this genus of Lamark, Montfort has separated the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Infundibulum,</hi> as possessing a central spiral pillar.
                    Sowerby has figured several species of this last genus in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mineral Conchology</hi> as occurring in a fossil state in Britain.</p>
                <p>The patella unguis now ranks as a bivalve, and constitutes the genus <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Lingula</hi> in the acephalous family brachiopoda of Lamark.
                    Linnaeus, who never saw more than one valve, placed it among the patellae.
                    Chemnitz, who examined both valves, considered it as a pinna. These writers had
                    overlooked the figure of the perfect shell, with its tube or stalk, as given by
                    Seba, vol. iii. fig. 16. No. 4. This specimen, which belonged to Seba, passed
                    into the museum of the Stadtholder, and afterwards reached, in company with the
                    spoils of the other Continental collections, the museum of Paris. Here Lamark
                    examined it, and formed his new genus. And the same specimen enabled Cuvier to
                    investigate its anatomical structure, which he has explained in detail in the
                    first volumeof <hi rend="italic">l∖ιc</hi><hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Museum.</hi> Science, in this instance, as well as several
                    others, profited by the successes of the late emperor of the French. This genus
                    is destitute of a hinge. The valves are supported on a peduncle, and the shell
                    is opened partly by the relaxation of the adductor muscle of the animal (and not
                    by the external membrane, as stated by Mr. Sowerby), and partly by the issuing
                    forth of its spiral arms, which push asunder the valves like a wedge.</p>
                <p>Another genus was constituted and termed <hi rend="smallcaps">Orbicula,</hi> from
                    the Patella <hi rend="italic">anomala</hi> of Müller, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zool.Dan.</hi> vol. i. p. 14. t. 5. The under valve is very thin, and fixed;
                    the upper is orbicular, and depressed. It is a member of the same family as the
                    preceding in the system of Lamark.</p>
                <p>32, <hi rend="smallcaps">Dentalium</hi> —This very natural genus of Linnaeus has
                    undergone no alterations, nor has our knowledge of the inhabitant been
                    satisfactorily enlarged. The Dentalium <hi rend="italic">imperforatum,</hi><hi

                    the essential character of the Linnaean genus in being “utraque extremitate
                    pervia.”</p>
                <p>33. <hi rend="smallcaps">Serrula.</hi> —This genus has undergone several changes
                    in the hands of modern conchologists. The N. <hi rend="italic">seminulum</hi>
                    has been transferred to the genus miliola, and the <hi rend="italic">S.
                    filo-granum</hi> to the tubipora. Besides these trivial alterations, the
                    character has been greatly circumscribed, so as only to include shells which
                    adhere to other bodies, and are tubular, entire and flexuous, with a simple
                    mouth, as represented by the S. contortuplicata of Linnaeus. The species which
                    are regularly spiral, discoid, and fixed, as the S. spirorbis, now constitute
                    the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Spirorbis.</hi> But as there are both dextral and
                    sinistral shells with this character, the dextral species may form the genus
                    Spirorbis, while the <hi rend="smallcaps">Heterodisea</hi> may receive the
                    reversed species.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Vermicularia</hi> is formed from those species
                    which, in appearance, resemble the spirorbis, but are not adherent, such as the
                    <hi rend="italic">S.</hi><hi rend="italic">lumbricalis.</hi> The shell at the
                    mouth is, in general, somewhat produced. There are two or three minute British
                    shells of this genus.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Siliquaria,</hi> represented by the N. <hi
                    rend="italic">anguina,</hi> is distinguished from the serpula by a longitudinal,
                    lateral, subarticulated fissure, which extends the whole length of the
                    shell.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Penicillus</hi> is formed from that curious shell
                    the <hi rend="italic">S. penis,</hi> and well known by the name of the
                    watering-pot. The disk is perforated by a number of small holes.</p>
                <p>34. <hi rend="smallcaps">Teredo</hi> —From this genus, now considered as a
                    bivalve (the tube being regarded as an accessory covering), the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Fistulana,</hi> of which <hi rend="italic">T.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">clava</hi> of Gmelin is the representative, has been separated.
                    The external tube in this genus is closed at the posterior extremity, while in
                    teredo it is open. The <hi rend="italic">S. polgthalαmia</hi> forms, according
                    to Lamark, the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Septaria,</hi> and the two genera <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Xylophaga</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Clavagella</hi> have
                    more recently been instituted.</p>
                <p>35. <hi rend="smallcaps">Sabella.</hi> This last genus of the Linnaean vermes
                    testacea has been degraded from its rank in conchology. The covering consists of
                    agglutinated particles of sand and fragments of shells, and bears no resemblance
                    to the testaceous coverings of the true mollusea. It is now placed in company
                    with the terebella, and the three preceding Linnaean genera among the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Annelides.</hi></p>
                <p>In the preceding brief review of the Linnaean genera of shells, the reader will
                    probably have been astonished at those changes which have taken place. In this
                    country we are so much accustomed to the artificial method both in zoology and
                    botany, that we often reject, without sufficient consideration, the improvements
                    which the study of the natural method has suggested. In the time of Linnaeus,
                    perhaps, the genera of the shells, with a few exceptions, were sufficiently
                    numerous and commodious to embrace all the known species; but since the science
                    has been cultivated with more zeal, in consequence, we must say, of the
                    introduction of the natural method, the number of species has increased tenfold.
                    New genera and orders, and other conventional divisions, have been formed,
                    suited to the state of improvement of the science. The merit of all these
                    improvements did not originate with Bruguière or Lamark, whose names we have so
                    often had occasion to mention. Many of the modern genera may be traced to the
                    systems which prevailed before the days of Linnaeus; systems which the Swedish
                    naturalist, in his desire to simplify, when simplicity was impracticable, too
                    incautiously disregarded.</p>
                <p>CHAP. III.—SYSTEMATICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE MOLLUSCA.'</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> successful methodical disposition of molluscous
                    animals, could not have been accomplished previous to labours similar to those
                    of Cuvier and Lamark; or until the shell and the contained animal were studied
                    as connected objects. When thus contemplated, molluscous animals admit of
                    arrangement into two great classes, or divisions, which may be distinguished
                    from each other by well-defined characters. In the one, the presence of a head
                    may be recognised, together with eyes, and even ears in some of the groups. In
                    the other, containing animals much less perfect in their organization, there is
                    no head, neither vestige of eyes or ears in any of the species. The former have
                    been termed <hi rend="italic">Mollusea</hi><hi rend="italic">Ccphala,</hi> the
                    latter <hi rend="italic">Mollusea</hi><hi rend="italic">Acephala.</hi> This
                    arrangement was first employed by Baron Cuvier, and afterwards by Lamark and
                    other modern systematical writers.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823759" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3759-0350"/>
                <p>In the last work of the former naturalist, this method is departed from, and the
                    six classes to which we have already referred, are constituted of equal rank,
                    instead of being placed in subordination to the two primary divisions under
                    which they can be suitably distributed.</p>
                <p>DIVISION I.—MOLLUSCA CEPHALA.</p>
                <p>Head distinct from the body, bearing the lips or jaws.</p>
                <p>The head, or the anterior part of the body on which Zoologists have bestowed that
                    denomination, possesses more or less freedom of motion, and, on the dorsal
                    aspect, supports either tentacula or eyes, frequently both. The animals of this
                    division exhibit so many modifications of form and structure, in all the series
                    of organs, that the positive characters which they possess in common are few in
                    number. They easily admit, therefore, of subdivision into inferior groups which
                    exhibit well-marked characters of distinction. Two of these groups occupy a
                    primary rank, and admit of the others being included under them as subordinate
                    sections. In the first of these, the animals are all inhabitants of the water,
                    and perform their progressive motion through that element by organs fitted for
                    swimming. They are destitute of any ventral disc on which to crawl. In the
                    second group, including animals which inhabit the land, as well as those which
                    live in fresh water and in the sea, progressive motion is performed by means of
                    crawling along the surface of objects, the body resting on a ventral disc termed
                    a foot.</p>

                    rend="smallcaps">—</hi><hi rend="italic">Organs of progressive motion fitted for
                    swimming.</hi></p>
                <p>The organs of motion are situate near the anterior extremity of the body, and
                    consist either of flexible tentacula or membranaceous expansions. All the
                    species reside in the sea. They are nearly of the same specific gravity with the
                    surrounding fluid in which they float about, having their motions in a great
                    measure regulated by its changes. It is, however, probable, that, by means of
                    some contractile movements, they are capable of varying their density, and of
                    rising or sinking in the water. They swim slowly, even with their utmost
                    efforts. The animals of this section belong to the classes which Cuvier has
                    termed <hi rend="italic">Cephalopoda</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pteropoda.</hi></p>
                <p>Class I—Cephalopoda.</p>
                <p>Fins in the form of tentacula, surrounding the mouth.</p>
                <p>The Cephalopoda, in reference to their external appearance, may be regarded as
                    consisting of two parts; the tunic or sac, which contains the viscera, and the
                    head, surrounded by the tentacula. The skin is usually mottled with minute
                    coloured spots, the colour varying in intensity in different spots, and even in
                    different parts of the same spots. These are confined to a thin layer on the
                    outer surface of the true skin. In a living state these spots change their
                    colour in rapid succession as if a coloured fluid was expelled from them or
                    replaced in variable quantity. The sac is, in some species, in the form of a
                    purse, destitute of any appendages, while in others, it exhibits fin-like
                    expansions. It varies considerably in its consistence: in some, it is
                    strengthened on the back internally, by corneous ribs or testaceous plates, and
                    in others, it is protected externally by spiral shells. In some species, it is
                    connected with the head by an intervening space, which may be regarded as a
                    neck, but in others, the tunic and head are continuous behind. In all, it
                    exhibits, after death, great changes of colour.</p>
                <p>On the summit of the head there is a flattened disc, in the centre of which is
                    seated the mouth. Round the mar gin of this oral disc, which is strengthened by
                    a band of muscular fibres, are placed the <hi rend="italic">arms</hi> or
                    tentacula. Beyond this circle of arms, in some species, there are situated two
                    organs, larger in their dimensions than the arms, which may be denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">feet.</hi> Both the arms and feet are covered on their central
                    aspect with numerous suckers, by which they are enabled to attach themselves to
                    different bodies, and to seize their prey; and in their axis, both a nerve and
                    artery may be observed. These arms and feet are capable of being moved, at the w
                    ill of the animal, in every direction, and are the organs by which progressive
                    motion is performed. In the space between the head and tunic in front, there is
                    an opening or <hi rend="italic">funnel</hi> with a projecting aperture. This
                    funnel opens into the cavity of the sac, and serves· both to convey water to the
                    gills, and to carry off the different excreted matters.</p>
                <p>The brain in the Cephalopoda is contained in an irregular hollow ring, in the
                    cartilaginous border of the oral disk. This cartilage is thickest on the dorsal
                    aspect, and contains the parts which have been denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >cerebrum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cerebellum,</hi> the remaining part of the
                    canal being occupied with the collar, which surrounds the esophagus. The nerves,
                    which proceed directly from the brain to the parts which they are destined to
                    influence, are few in number. From the cerebrum a few small nerves issue, which
                    go to the mouth, and the base of the feet, while some proceed to form ganglia at
                    the mouth, and others supply the feet. The cerebellum, besides furnishing the
                    collar which encircles the gullet, contributes to the formation of the large
                    ganglia which supply the arms, the optic and auditory nerves, those for the
                    funnel, the tunic, and the viscera. From the size of the animals, the ganglia of
                    the nerves are very distinctly displayed. The anastomosing branches of the
                    perves of the arms are likewise conspicuous. Each nerve, at the base of each
                    arm, sends out two filaments, one to the nerve of the arm on each side. In this
                    manner a chain of nerves is formed round the base of the arm, probably
                    calculated to enable them to act more readily in concert. From the abundant
                    distribution of nerves to the different parts, it appears probable that the
                    sense of touch exists in a tolerably perfect manner. There is no proof of the
                    development of organs for the display of the senses of smell and taste.</p>
                <p>The Cephalopoda are furnished with two eyes, one on each side of the head. The
                    external membrane on the inner side, which may be compared to the <hi
                    rend="italic">sclerotica,</hi> differs in many particulars from the covering of
                    the same name in the eyes of the vertebral animals. While it surrounds the
                    contents of the eye from the entrance of the optic nerve to the pupil, it is
                    greatly separated from the choroides. Immediately within its cavity, there is a
                    bag, with a peculiar membranaceous covering, which contains numerous glandular
                    bodies, similar to the milt of fishes, by which the eye is supported, and which
                    probably act as secreting organs (although Μ. Cuvier could not detect any
                    excretory canals), and likewise an expansion or ganglion of the optic nerve. The
                    concave or anterior surface embraces the <hi rend="italic">choroides.</hi> This
                    membrane, after enclosing the vitreous humour, forms a zone or diaphragm, which
                    may be compared to the ciliary processes, with an aperture in the centre for the
                    reception of the crystalline lens. The circular margin of this aperture is
                    lodged in a circular groove of the lens, and intimately united with it, so that
                    the lens is divided into two unequal hemispheres. Its central surface is coated,
                    as in the higher classes of animals, with the coloured mucous pigment which has
                    been denominated <hi rend="italic">pigmentum nigrum.</hi> In the cephalopoda,
                    however, it is of a purplish-red colour.</p>
                <p>The optic nerve, after entering the sclerotica, expands into a large ganglion,
                    from the peripheral surface of which, issue numerous nervous filaments. These
                    pierce the choroides by as many holes, and go to form, by their reunion, the

                    appears to unite itself with the groove *^of the lens.</p>
                <p>The vitreous humour is contained in a peculiar vesicle, having the lens seated in
                    a concavity on its external surface. The lens divides easily into two parts, the
                    line of separation being the groove which receives the ciliary ligament. The
                    separated surfaces are flat, and the outer portion is in the form of a
                    planoconvex lens. Each portion consists of a number of concentric layers of
                    variable thickness, composed of radiated fibres, becoming less and less distinct
                    towards the centre, near which the laminated and radiated appearances cease to
                    be perceptible. An imperfect representation of this structure is given
                    bySirE.Home, probably from preparations by Mr. John Hunter, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pil’d. Trans,</hi> vol. lxxxiv. tab. 5. p. 26.</p>
                <p>The conjunctiva supplies the place of a cornea, and covers directly the
                    crystalline lens, as there is no aqueous humour. This membrane, in some, is
                    continuous with the skin, but in others, there arc imperfect eye-lids formed by
                    its duplicature, previous to passing over the lens. The skin, at the opening of
                    the pupil, formed by the sclerotica, in the absence of an <hi rend="italic"
                    >uvea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">iris,</hi> is strengthened by a membrane which
                    appears to be muscular, and probably assists in the contraction or enlargement
                    of the aperture.</p>
                <p>The animals of the cephalopodous class, besides containing complicated eyes, are
                    likewise furnished with ears. These are situate in the annular cartilage which
                    supports the arms. In this cartilage, there are two cavities, in each of which
                    there is a bag filled with .a gelatinous, transparent fluid, and containing a
                    calcareous substance, differing in its consistence according to the species,
                    from the brittleness of starch to the hardness of bone. The auditory nerve
                    penetrates the walls of this labyrinth, and ramifies on the membranous bag which
                    it contains. There is no external opening, nor any apparent alteration in the
                    thickness of the investing integuments.</p>
                <p>The digestive system of the Cephalopoda exhibits several appearances by which it
                    may be distinguished. The arms which surround the mouth, seize the animals which
                    are to serve as food, and bring them to the mouth. The mouth is situated in the
                    centre of the disc, round which the tentacula are arranged. It is surrounded
                    with a slight fold of the skin, which may be compared to lips, and which is
                    rough on the central aspect. Within the lips are the two mandibles, of a deep
                    brown colour, hard, horny consistence, and in form resembling the beak of a
                    parrot. Where free, they are conicotubular, but where covered, they are open at
                    the central side. The under beak, unlike the same organ in birds, is the
                    largest, the most crooked, and embraces the upper, or the one on the dorsal
                    margin of the mouth. These jaws are merely able to open and shut, as they
                    possess no lateral motion. They are supported by the muscular bed of the mouth,
                    which serves as a mould to fill the cavity towards the point. The tongue is
                    situate between the beaks, and is armed with reflected teeth. These teeth, in
                    consequence of the undulatory motion of the substance of the tongue, expedite
                    the progress of the food into the gullet.</p>
                <p>The salivary glands are four in number, and are placed in pairs. The glands of
                    the first pair, seated on each side of the muscular bed of the mouth, are
                    divided into numerous lobes, the excretory ducts of which pour their fluid into
                    thebeginning of the gullet. The second pair, seated lower down and below the
                    eyes, are not so much divided, and send out separate canals, which unite and
                    pour their contents into the mouth.</p>
                <p>The gullet is furnished with a lateral expansion, not unlike the crop of
                    gallinaceous birds. The stomach is muscular, like the gizzard of fowls, and the
                    cuticle is thick, and separates easily from the other membranes. At the pyloric
                    opening of the stomach, there is another aperture equally large, which leads
                    into the <hi rend="italic">spiral stomach,</hi> or caecum, as it has been
                    improperly termed by some anatomists. It may with greater propriety be
                    denominated the duodenum, as it performs some of the offices of that part of the
                    gut in the higher orders of animals. This stomach is conical, closed at the
                    distal extremity, and performs about a turn and a half, like a spiral shell. Its
                    inner surface is covered with a ridge, which traverses it in a closely spiral
                    direction. The bile flows into it near the apex, and towards its base glandular
                    orifices, pouring out a thick, yellow fluid, may be observed. The intestine,
                    after leaving the pylorus, in some species, makes one or two turns, in others,
                    it proceeds directly to the anus. This opening is seated at the base of the
                    funnel, on its posterior or dorsal side.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> is of considerable size, of an orange-yellow
                    colour, and of a soft and spongy texture. It gives rise to two hepatic ducts,
                    which proceed to the extremity of the spiral stomach, where, by a common
                    orifice, they empty the orange-coloured bile which they contain.</p>
                <p>The organs of circulation consist merely of veins and arteries. The veins which
                    have their origin in the feet, mouth, and annular cartilage, coalesce, and form
                    two branches, which afterwards unite into a common trunk. This vessel, after
                    descending through part of the viscera into the abdomen, divides into two
                    branches, each of which may be considered as a <hi rend="italic">vena cava,</hi>
                    conveying the blood to the lateral hearts. Each vena cava, at its origin, is
                    joined by an equally large vessel, which empties its contents in a direction
                    nearly at right angles with the former. These veins arise in the stomach,
                    intestines, liver, and organs of generation. The vena cava receives a second
                    large vessel, nearly in the same direction as the first, which has its origin in
                    the tunic and the supports of the branchiae. From the size of the vena cava, in
                    consequence of the union of these two branches, and the appearance of muscular
                    ridges on its inner surface, it has been compared by some to an auricle.</p>
                <p>On each side, in the common cavity of the tunic, and near the gills, an aperture
                    may be observed, the entrance to a bag or cavity. Each cavity is traversed by
                    the vena cava of that side, and in its passage exhibits a curious conformation.
                    The surface of the vein is covered with spongy, glandular bodies of different
                    shapes. These, upon being pressed, pour out an opake, yellow, mucous fluid.
                    Within, these glands communicate by very wide ducts with the cavity of the vein.
                    Indeed, when air is blown into the vein, it readily passes through the glands
                    into the bag, and thence into the cavity of the tunic; and when air is blown
                    into the bag, it likewise penetrates the gland, and passes into the veins. The
                    arteries with which these glands are furnished are comparatively minute.</p>
                <p>It appears probable that these glands separate some principle from the blood, and
                    that this is conveyed away by the ejection of the water from these venous bags
                    into the common cavity. Were it practicable to analyse the yellow mucus which
                    these glands contain, some light might be thrown on the subject. Indeed, it
                    appears not improbable, that this arrangement is analogous in its functions to
                    the urinary system in the most perfect classes.</p>
                <p>Each vena cava enters its corresponding lateral heart or ventricle, through an
                    intervening valve. Each lateral heart is situate at the base of each gill, is
                    pear-shaped, black, and moderately thick, with numerous pits on its inner
                    surface. Its narrow end terminates without any valvular structure in the
                    pulmonary artery. In the genus octopus, the lateral hearts are naked; but in the
                    genera Loligo and Sepia, there is suspended from each, by a slender footstalk, a
                    spongy round body, which is concave beneath. The footstalk consists of fibres,
                    which are attached to the surface of the heart, but there is no communication by
                    ducts or vessels. The use of this organ is unknown.</p>
                <p>The animals of this class continually reside in the water, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193823785" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3785-0352"/> and respire by means of
                    gills or branchiae. These are double, one on each side, corresponding with the
                    lateral pulmonic ventricles. Each gill is connected at its opposite sides to the
                    tunic, by means of fleshy ligamentous bands. Between these, the double leaves of
                    the gills are arranged in an alternate series. Each leaf is supported by a
                    footstalk from the band, and is subdivided into smaller leaves, to expose a
                    greater surface to the water.</p>
                <p>The pulmonary artery passes along this band, sends a branch into each footstalk,
                    which, penetrating the substance of the gills, conveys the blood to its
                    different divisions.</p>
                <p>The systemic veins depart fro'm the gills at the opposite extremity. These unite
                    at the inferior band, and from each gill a vessel proceeds to the single central
                    or systemic heart or ventricle. In some of the animals of this class the
                    systemic veins are somewhat enlarged, and assume the appearance of auricles. The
                    two pulmonary, or rather the systemic veins, enter the heart at the opposite
                    side, each at the termination being furnished with a valvular organization.</p>
                <p>The systemic heart is white and fleshy, and differs according to the genera, in
                    its form, being in the Octopus semicircular, but in the Loligo and Sepia lobed.
                    Besides giving rise to a large aorta, or principal artery, two smaller ones
                    likewise proceed from its cavity. These arteries are furnished at their entrance
                    with valves.</p>
                <p>The sexes in the Cephalopoda are distinct, the male and female organs being found
                    on different individuals. There is not, however, any external mark by which they
                    may be distinguished. Μ. Cuvier found that the males of the Octopus were
                    scarcely a fifth part so numerous as the females.</p>
                <p>The male organs of generation consist of the following parts: The <hi
                    rend="italic">testicle</hi> is a large white glandular purse, containing
                    numerous fringed filaments, from which the seminal fluid is secreted. This fluid
                    passes out of the testicle by a valvular opening, into the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vas</hi><hi rend="italic">deferens.</hi> This canal is slender, and greatly
                    twisted in its course, and opens into a cavity which has been compared to the
                    <hi rend="italic">seminal vesicle.</hi> The walls of this last cavity are strong
                    and muscular, and disposed in ridges. Near the opening at the distal extremity
                    of this sac is an aperture leading into an oblong glandular body, regarded as
                    exercising the functions of a <hi rend="italic">prostate gland.</hi> Beyond this
                    lies a muscular sac, divided at the top, where it opens by two ducts, but
                    connected at the base. In this sac are numerous white thread-like bodies,
                    terminated by a filament, but unconnected with the sac. In the interior they
                    consist of a spiral body, connected at each extremity with a glandular
                    substance. When these bodies are put into water, they twist themselves in
                    various directions, and throw out at one of their extremities an opake fluid.
                    These motions are not excited by placing them in oil or spirit of wine, but they
                    may be exhibited by immersing in -water those which have been kept for years in
                    spirits.</p>
                <p>These bodies, first observed by Swammerdam, and afterwards by Needham, have been
                    regarded by some as demonstrating the truth of the vermicular theory of
                    generation; by others, they have been considered as analogous to the pollen of
                    plants, their tunic is in part soluble in water, and when they are thrown into
                    that fluid, they speedily burst, and spread their impregnating contents over the
                    eggs of the female. Although this last conjecture is plausible, and countenanced
                    by the circumstance that these vermicular bodies are only found at the season of
                    reproduction, the subject is still involved in obscurity. Are these bodies
                    produced in the testicle, and only brought to this bag when nearly ready for
                    exclusion; or, if the product of the bag itself, by what means are they
                    nourished?</p>
                <p>The male organs terminate in a cylindrical fleshy body termed the Penis. This is
                    hollow within, and ribbed with muscular bands. Near its base it receives one of
                    the ducts of the vermicular sac, continuous with the one from the prostate
                    gland, forming its canal, and toward the apex the other duct. It projects but a
                    short way into the cavity of the great bag, into which it empties its contents.
                    These pass out of the body at the funnel-form opening in the throat.</p>
                <p>The female organs of generation consist of an ovarium and oviduct. The ovarium is
                    a glandular sac, to which the ova are attached by footstalks. The opening by
                    which they issue from the ovarium is wide, and the oviduct (in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Octopus vulgaris</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Loligo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sagittata,)</hi> after continuing a short way simple, divides into
                    two branches, each having its external aperture near the anus. The oviducts are
                    furnished within with muscular bands and a mucous lining, and encircled with a
                    large glandular zone, destined, probably, to secrete the integuments of the
                    eggs. In the <hi rend="italic">Loliga vulgaris,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sepia,</hi> the oviduct continues single. Besides these organs, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Loliga vulgaris</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sagittata,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Sepia,</hi> have two large oval glandular bodies, divided by
                    transverse partitions, with their excretory ducts terminating at the anus, the
                    use of which is unknown. The eggs, of the peculiar form already noticed, pass
                    out of the funnel, after which they are supposed to be impregnated by the male,
                    according to the manner of fishes.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">inky fluid</hi> now remains to be considered, as the most
                    remarkable of the productions of this tribe of animals. The organ in which this
                    fluid is secreted is spongy and glandular. In some species it is contained in a
                    recess of the liver, which has given rise to the opinion, that the coloured
                    fluid which it secreted was bile. In other species, however, this gland is
                    detached from the liver, and either situate in front or beneath that organ. The
                    excretory canal of this gland opens in the rectum, so that the fluid escapes
                    through the funnel. It mixes readily with water, and imparts to it its own
                    peculiar colour. When dried, it is used as a pigment, and is considered as the
                    basis of China ink. It is regarded by Signior Bezio as a peculiar substance
                    which he has denominated <hi rend="italic">Melaina.</hi> It is obtained by
                    digesting the ink with very dilute nitric acid, until it become yellowish,
                    washing it well, and separating it by the filter; it is then to be frequently
                    boiled in water, one of the washings to be a little alkalized; and, finally,
                    with distilled water. The melaina is a tasteless, black powder, insoluble in
                    alcohol, ether, and water, whilst cold, but soluble in hot water; the solution
                    is black. Caustic alkalis form with it a solution even in the cold, from which
                    the mineral acids precipitate it unchanged. It contains much azote. It dissolves
                    and decomposes sulphuric acid. It easily kindles in the flame of a candle. It
                    has been found to succeed as a pigment in some respects, better than China ink.

                <p>The Cephalopoda are all inhabitants of the sea. They are widely distributed,
                    occurring in the arctic as well as the equatorial seas. In the latter, however,
                    they grow to the largest size. It is reported, that in the Indian seas, boats
                    have been sunk by these animals affixing to them their long arms, and that they
                    are dreaded by divers.</p>
                <p>The two Linnaean genera, Nautilus and Sepia, comprehend all the animals which are
                    at present considered as belonging to this class.</p>

                <p>This order is involved in the greatest obscurity. None of the recent species have
                    been subjected to an accurate examination, so that their connection with the

                    of two of the genera, to furnish some hints for those -who are fond of
                    classifying animals from their analogies. These genera are <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Sγirula</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Nautilus.</hi></p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Spirilla,</hi> the shell, which is concealed under the
                    skin of the back, is spiral, with the whorls separate, the mouth orbicular, the

                    and use of this terminal tube are unknown. The Ñ. <hi rend="italic"
                    >vulgaris</hi> is the most common species, and inhabits the seas in the West
                    Indies. In the restricted genus <hi rend="italic">Nautilus,</hi> the shell is
                    supposed to be external, and the body of the animal to be lodged in the last
                    chamber, and to be fixed by a ligament which descends into the central pipe. In
                    the shell itself, the turns of the spire are contiguous, and the last whorl
                    embraces the others on the sides. The <hi rend="italic">N.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    which the animal has been detected.</p>
                <p>The other genera which have been formed in this order depend exclusively on the
                    characters furnished by the shells; and the resemblance which these bear to the
                    preceding genera, constitutes all their claim to be included in the present
                    order.</p>
                <p>Order II—Sepiacea.</p>
                <p>Destitute of a multilocular shell.</p>
                <p>The sac is strengthened by horny or testaceous plates, unless where the habits of
                    the animal render such support unnecessary.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Head surrounded with eight arms and two feet.</hi></p>
                <p>The two feet are nearly similar in their structure to the arms, or tentacula, but
                    considerably larger in their dimensions. They have their origin on the ventral
                    side of the mouth, between that organ and the funnel. The suckers are
                    pedunculated, with their margin strengthened by a corneous ring, furnished with
                    teeth. The sac is furnished with fin-like expansions, and strengthened
                    internally by corneous or testaceous ribs or plates. The head is divided from
                    the sac on all sides by a neck. The margin of the anus is surrounded with
                    tentacula.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Sepia.</hi> The sac is furnished on each side
                    throughout its whole length with a narrow fin.</p>
                <p>The suckers are irregularly scattered on the arms and feet. The back is
                    strengthened by a complicated calcareous plate, lodged in <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> peculiar cavity. This plate has been long known in the shop of the
                    apothecary under the name <hi rend="italic">Cuttle-fish bane,</hi> which was
                    formerly much prized in medicine as an absorbent, but is now chiefly sought
                    after for the purpose of polishing the softer metals. It is somewhat ovate,
                    flatly convex on both sides, and thickest where broadest. The superior half, or
                    the one next the head, is the longest, rounded at the extremity, and thin. The
                    inferior portion becomes suddenly narrow, and ends in a point. It may be
                    considered as consisting of a dermal plate, concave on the central aspect,
                    having its concavity filled up with layers which are convex on their central
                    aspect.</p>
                <p>According to our observations, the dermal plate appears to consist of three
                    different laminae, arranged parallel to one another. The external or dorsal
                    layer is rough on the surface, and marked by obscure, concentric arches towards
                    the summit, formed by minute knobs, which become larger towards the base, where
                    they appear in the form of interrupted transverse ridges. It is uniform in its
                    structure, and the tubercles possess a polish and hardness equal to
                    porcellaneous shells, although they blacken speedily when put in the fire, and
                    contain a good deal of animal matter. On the central side of this layer there is
                    one flexible and transparent, similar to horn, and smooth on the surface. The
                    third layer is destitute of lustre; and, in hardness and structure, resembles
                    mother-of-pearl shells.</p>
                <p>The layers which fill the concavity of this dermal plate are slightly convex on
                    the central aspect, and are in part imbricated. Each layer is attached to the
                    concave surface of the dermal plate, by the upper extremity and the two sides,
                    while the inferior or caudal extremity is free. The inferior and first formed
                    layers are short, occupy the base and middle, and rise from the plate under a
                    more obtuse angle than the new formed layers, which are both the longest and the
                    broadest.</p>
                <p>Each layer, which is about one-fiftieth of an inch in diameter consists of a very
                    thin plate, the dermal surface of which, when viewed with a magnifier, exhibits
                    numerous brain-like gyrations. From the ventral surface of this plate arise
                    numerous perpendicular laminae, which, when viewed laterally, appear like fine
                    parallel threads, but when examined vertically, are found to be waved, and fold
                    upon themselves. Next the plate they are thin, and not much folded; but towards
                    their other extremity they become thicker, striated across, and more folded,
                    with irregular margins. On the thick, tortuous even ends of these laminae, the
                    succeeding plate rests, and derives from them the peculiar markings of its
                    surface. These laminae are closely set, irregularly interrupted, and
                    occasionally anastomose. Μ. Cuvier states, erroneously, <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Mem.</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">la Seiche,</hi> p. 47.)
                    that these laminae are hollow pillars disposed in a quincunx order.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">bone</hi> has been improperly applied to this
                    complicated plate; “for,” according to Mr. Hatchett, <hi rend="italic">(Phil.

                    similar to shell, and consists of various membranes, hardened by carbonate of
                    lime, without the smallest mixture of phosphate.” ∙</p>
                <p>The most remarkable species of this genus is the <hi rend="italic">Sepia
                    officinalis,</hi> which is distinguished from the others by its smooth skin. It
                    inhabits the British seas, and although seldom taken, its bone is cast ashore on
                    different parts of the coast, from the south of England to the Zetland
                    isles.</p>

                    partially with fins.</p>
                <p>The suckers are disposed on the arms and feet in a double row. The dorsal plate
                    is flexible and corneous, imbedded in the substance of the sac, and is
                    multiplied with years. Dr. Leach has described three new species of the genus
                    Loligo, which were collected by Mr. Crunch during the voyage to the Congo, in
                    that unfortunate expedition under the direction of Captain Tuckey. These species
                    belong to a group which have the suckers produced into hooked processes. In two
                    of these species, <hi rend="italic">L. leptura</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Smithii,</hi> the suckers on the arms, as well as the feet, are produced into

                <p>The same distinguished naturalist has instituted a new genus nearly allied to
                    Loligo, from two species collected during the same voyage. The following

                <p>In this genus, which was instituted by Μ. Rafinesque, the suckers are in a double
                    row, and supported on footstalks. In the specimens of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ocythoe Cranchii,</hi> procured during the expedition to the Congo, Dr. Leach
                    observed “four oblong spots on the inside of the tube, resembling the surfaces
                    for the secretion of mucus, two inferior and lateral, and two superior, larger,
                    and meeting anteriorly. On the rim of the sac, immediately above the branchiae,
                    on each side, is a small, short, fleshy tubercle, which fits into an excavation
                    on the opposite side of the sac.” <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.</hi>
                    1817.)</p>
                <p>This animal was long considered as the fabricator of the shell termed Argonauta
                    or Paper Nautilus. The observations of Mr. Cranch, the zoologist to the Congo
                    expedition, were supposed to have demonstrated that the shell is merely the
                    temporary residence of this animal, which it quits at pleasure. The body of the
                    animal does not conform in shape to the cavity of the shell, nor to all its
                    irregularities of surface; neither is there any muscular attachment between
                    them. “On the thirteenth of June,” (says Dr. Leach, when publishing the notes of
                    Mr. Cranch,) “he placed two living specimens in a vessel of sea-water; the
                    animals very soon protruded their arms, and swam on and below the surface,
                    having all the actions of the common <hi rend="italic">Polypus</hi> (octopus) of
                    our seas; by means of their suckers, they adhered firmly to any substance with
                    which they came in contact, and when sticking to the sides of the basin, the
                    shell might easily be withdrawn from the animal. They had the power of
                    completely withdrawing within the shell, and of leaving it entirely. One
                    individual quitted its shell and lived several hours swimming about, and showed
                    no inclination to return into it; and others left the shells as he was taking
                    them up in the net. They changed colour, like other animals of the class
                    Cephalopodo; when at rest, the colour was pale flesh-coloured, more or less
                    speckled with purplish; the under parts of the arms were bluish-grey; the
                    suckers whitish.” The specimens which furnished an opportunity for making the
                    preceding observations, were met with in the Gulph of Guinea, and afterwards on
                    the voyage, swimming in a small argonauta, on the surface of the sea. The

                    determined.</p>
                <p>Class II—Pterocoda.</p>
                <p>Fins formed of membranaceous expansions.</p>
                <p>This class was instituted by Cuvier, for the reception of a few genera, the
                    peculiar characters of which indicated the impropriety of suffering them to
                    remain in any of those categories which had been previously established. All the
                    species are small in size; and the attempts hitherto made to investigate their
                    internal structure, have, in a great measure, failed in explaining the functions
                    of the organs which are exhibited. The valuable papers of Cuvier, on the Clio,
                    Pneumodermon and Hyalea, include nearly all the accurate information on the
                    subject, of which naturalists are in possession.</p>
                <p>The general form of these animals is somewhat ovate. The tunic appears in some
                    genera, as the Clio and Pneumodermon, to be double, the external one soft and
                    thin, the internal exhibiting a fibrous structure, corresponding to the muscular
                    web of the skin of the higher classes. In these animals, however, the two layers
                    are unconnected throughout the greater part of their expansion. In some, as the
                    Cymbullia, the tunic is cartilaginous, while in others it is strengthened by a
                    shell. In these last, the shell in the Limacina is a spiral univalve, covering
                    the abdominal viscera, and in the Hyalea, where it serves the same purpose, it
                    approaches in character a bivalve shell. It is, however, destitute of a hinge,
                    the two valves being united together at their caudal margins, and there is no
                    appearance of a transverse adductor muscle.</p>
                <p>The organs of motion in all the genera consist of two fins, or membranaceous
                    expansions, one being seated on each side of the head. They have no foot
                    wherewith to crawl, nor any suckers by which they can adhere to objects. They
                    are, therefore, free animals moving about in the water by means of their fins,
                    and probably possessing, at the same time, a power of varying their specific
                    gravity, as they are capable of varying, to a certain extent, the form of their
                    bodies, and of enlarging or reducing their dimensions. There is nothing peculiar
                    in their nervous system.</p>
                <p>The organs of digestion differ greatly from those of the Cephalopoda, which we
                    have already considered. They are generally regarded as destitute of eyes and
                    ears. Their tentacula are either seated on the head, forming two complicated
                    branches of filaments, or spread along the margin of the tunic. There are no
                    arms for seizing the food. The mouth, however, is furnished with lips; and in
                    some there is an appearance of a tongue at the entrance of the gullet. The
                    salivary glands are two in number, lengthened, descending a considerable way
                    into the abdomen, and pouring their contents, by means of their excretory
                    canals, into the cavity of the mouth. The gullet, after being encircled by the
                    nervous collar, suffers an enlargement, which has been termed a crop, contiguous
                    to which is the stomach. Both these cavities exhibit muscular ridges on the
                    inner surface. The liver surrounds the stomach, is intimately united with its
                    contents, and pours in its bile by numerous pores. The intestine is short, and,
                    after making one or two turns, ascends and terminates in the neck near the
                    mouth.</p>
                <p>The circulating system in this class has been but very imperfectly investigated.
                    The pulmonic vessels are unknown, but systemic veins, a single auricle,
                    ventricle, and aorta, have been detected. The heart, in some, is situate on the
                    left, in others, on the right, side of the body.</p>
                <p>The aerating organs exhibit very remarkable differences. In the Clio they are in
                    the form of a fine net-work on the surface of the fins; in the Pneumodermon they
                    arc conjectured to form leaf-like ridges on the caudal extremity of the body; or
                    if these ridges are to be considered as particular kinds of fins, the gills may
                    be sought for on the membranaceous expansions of the neck. In the Hyalea the
                    branchiae form a complex band on each side of the body, at the lateral opening
                    of the shell.</p>
                <p>The animals of this class are all hermaphrodites. There is a common cavity, a
                    vesicle, penis, vas deferens, and testicle, together with an oviduct and
                    ovarium. These open near the mouth on its ventral margin. There is nothing known
                    with respect to the appearance of the eggs, the period of propagating, or the
                    form of their young.</p>
                <p>All the animals of this class inhabit the sea. Some, as the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193823824" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3824-0355"/> Clio and Limacina, frequent
                    the arctic regions, and afford the whale a great part of its sustenance. None of
                    the species have hitherto been detected in the British seas.</p>
                <p>Μ. Cuvier divides the animals of this class into cephalous and acephalous. In the
                    latter division he places the genus hyalea. The head of the animal of this
                    genus, with its inferior neck, may, however, be sufficiently recognised to
                    remove all doubt of its existence.</p>
                <p>The characters which may be employed in the classification of this group are
                    numerous; but the influence which their different forms exercise on the habits
                    of the species is still unknown. The following disposition of the genera, though
                    it has no claims to a natural division, may be useful to the student in his
                    investigations.</p>

                <p>The shell, which is very tender, makes one turn and a half, is flat on one side,
                    with a large pillar cavity on the other. The fins are two in number, one on each
                    side of the neck. When the animal swims, the head with the fins are
                    protruded.</p>

                    by two connected shelly valves.</p>
                <p>In the animals of this genus, the body is lodged between two plates or valves,
                    united at the base, where they inclose the caudal extremity. The ventral valve
                    is nearly flat, with an uneven margin, narrow anteriorly, but expanding behind,
                    and terminating in three projecting points. From the middle point four ribs
                    diverge forward, and a muscle arises, which, fixed in the superior viscera,
                    enables the animal to witlidraw into the shell. The dorsal valve is shorter than
                    the preceding, the margin flat and circular, and the middle convex outwardly.
                    The branchiae are situate in the space between the lateral margin of the two
                    valves, on each side, in a duplicature of the tunic, the sides of which are
                    furnished with filaments. The fleshy neck supports the two membranaceous
                    expansions; between which and the base the mouth is situate, surrounded by two
                    lips, and strengthened within by two fleshy cheeks. The opening of the anus and

                    Cuvier, in his <hi rend="italic">Mémoire sur</hi><hi rend="italic">l’</hi><hi

                    these to the heart. But, in his <hi rend="italic">Règne Animal,</hi> he states
                    it as the opinion of Μ. Blainville, that the fin-like expansions of the neck
                    contain the branchiae on their surface, as in the case of Clio. The rectum and
                    oviduct terminate under the right wing. Cuvier has figured and described the
                    only known species, which he terms <hi rend="italic">Pneumodermon Peronii,</hi>

                    two blunt, conical, fin-like expansions, with a fine reticulated surface,
                    considered as serving the double purpose of fins and branchiae. The anus and

                <p>This is one of the most extensive groups of molluscous animals. The marks by
                    which it is distinguished are well defined, and the external and internal
                    characters of the species have been successfully illustrated.</p>
                <p>The Gasteropoda may be considered as having the body protected dorsally by the
                    cloak, and ventrally by the foot. The <hi rend="italic">cloak</hi> is either <hi
                    rend="italic">continuous,</hi> and usually more or less arched, for the
                    reception of the viscera underneath, or it is <hi rend="italic">interrupted</hi>
                    by a projecting bag, in which are contained the principal digestive and
                    reproductive organs. This projecting bag is tapering and spiral, and always
                    protected externally by a shell. When the cloak is continuous, the surface is
                    variously marked, and frequently exhibits a particular portion more elevated
                    than the rest, in some cases concealing a testaceous plate, which has been
                    termed the <hi rend="italic">shield.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">foot</hi> situate on the ventral aspect, and in opposition
                    to the cloak, exhibits a flat, soft surface, consisting of interlaced muscular
                    fibres. Its central surface serves as a support to the viscera, while externally
                    it constitutes the organ of progressive motion. It is a <hi rend="italic"
                    >sucker</hi> rather than a foot, and enables the animal to adhere to objects
                    when at rest, and to crawl from one place to another by a succession of <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193823837" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3837-0356"/> adhesions, not
                    unlike the leech. It is also used as a fin in swimming.</p>
                <p>By the union of the cloak and foot laterally and posteriorly, a sac is formed,
                    which is open in frontforthe protrusion of the neck and head. The line of
                    junction between the cloak and foot is marked, in general, by peculiarities in
                    the condition <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the margins of both.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">neck</hi> is usually divided from the cloak by a <hi
                    rend="italic">collar,</hi> or thickened margin belonging to the cloak, or rather
                    to the shield, while in other cases it is continuous. Underneath, the neck is
                    frequently attached to the foot.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">head</hi> supports the tentacula and eyes, is free
                    dorsally, but frequently intimately connected with the foot on its ventral side.
                    The portion between the tentacula and the mouth is termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >snout, (lemußeoï</hi> the French, and its margin <hi rend="italic">le</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">chaperon).</hi> The mouth exhibits various modifications of fleshy
                    lips and corneous jaws. The insjde of the cheeks are covered in some species
                    with reflected teeth, to aid deglutition. The <hi rend="italic">tongue</hi> can
                    scarcely be detected in some of the genera; while, in others, it is a simple
                    tubercle, or a strap-shaped, spiral organ, armed with transverse rows of teeth.
                    This spiral tongue, where it is fixed to the base of the mouth, is broadest, and
                    there also the spinous processes arc strongest. The spiral part is narrowest and
                    softest, and folded up behind the pharynx. Μ. Cuvier conjectures, and apparently
                    with plausibility, that the spiral portion conies forward into the month to act
                    as a tongue, in proportion as the anterior part is worn by use and absorbed.

                <p>The organs of respiration exhibit the two modifications of lungs and gills, to
                    enable ns to divide the Gasteropoda into two classes, which we have termed
                    Pulmonifera and Branchifera. Μ. Cuvier appears to have been in some measure
                    aware of the importance of the distinction, when he instituted his order <hi
                    rend="italic">Pulmonés</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but he afterwards suffered
                    himself to be more influenced by the presence of an operculum, the shape of the
                    aperture of the shell, and the supposed separation of the sexes, than by the
                    characters of the respiratory organs.</p>
                <p>Some shells are simply tubular or conical; but the greater part are variously
                    convoluted, the volutions being termed <hi rend="italic">whorls</hi> or spires.
                    These whorls are in general visible and distinct, the boundary between each
                    being termed the <hi rend="italic">line of separation.</hi> The whorls in some
                    species,are simply placed in a lateral position, while in others the whorls are
                    formed upon a <hi rend="italic">pillar,</hi> or columella, which runs in the
                    direction of the axis of the shell, the inferior whorl in this case embracing
                    the superior one. The pillar is in some cases nearly solid, in other instances
                    tubular, with its base either open or covered. When the base of the tube of the
                    columella is uncovered, the opening is termed the <hi rend="italic">pillar
                    cavity,</hi> or umbilicus.</p>
                <p>In general, when a spiral shell is placed upon its base or mouth, with the apex
                    towards the observer, the mouth will be found situated on the right side, and
                    the whorls will be observed revolving in a direction from right to left, or
                    corresponding with the motion of the sun. These shells are termed <hi
                    rend="italic">dextral.</hi> A few species havè this order reversed, as the
                    observer will readily perceive. For upon placing the shell in the
                    above-mentioned position, the mouth will be found situated on the left side, and
                    the whorls will revolve from left to right. These shells are termed <hi
                    rend="italic">sinistral,</hi> heterostrophe, or heteroclite.</p>
                <p>Class I.—Pulmonifera.</p>
                <p>The pulmonary cavity is single and lateral. Its orifice is capable of being
                    closed at the will of the animal. The bloodvessels are spread, chiefly on the
                    walls and roof, like delicate net-work. The opening of the cavity is usually on
                    the right side, with the anus behind it, and the sexual orifice is in the front
                    near the head. In some of the genera, these openings are situate on the left
                    side. The shells of the former are denominated <hi rend="italic">dextral,
                    of</hi> the latter <hi rend="italic">sinistral.</hi> This change in the position
                    of the external openings is accompanied by a corresponding alteration in the
                    arrangement of the internal organs. The heart, for example, is always placed on
                    the side opposite the pulmonary cavity. In the dextral shells, therefore, it is
                    sinistral. In both kinds, however, all the organs preserve the same relation to
                    the back and belly, the head and tail. It is impossible, therefore, to conceive
                    a dextral animal changed into a sinistral, by any circumstance which could take
                    place at the period of hatching, as Μ. Bose was inclined to believe. This
                    arrangement of the organs must have been not merely congenital, but coeval with
                    the formation of the embryo. In some species all the individuals are sinistral,
                    while in others the occurrence is rarely met with in a solitary example. The
                    former are in their natural state, the latter ought to be regarded as monsters.
                    Where the character is permanent, it should constitute a generical
                    difference.</p>
                <p>The reproductive system of the animals of this class exhibits the sexual organs,
                    in general, united in the same individual. Mutual impregnation, however, is
                    necessary. All the species are oviparous. The eggs are either naked, as in the
                    terrestrial genera, or enveloped in a gelatinous mass, like the aquatic kinds.
                    The embryo acquires nearly all its members while in the egg, and the shell is of
                    a proportional size previous to hatching. Sir Everard Home, when treating of the
                    distinguished characters between the ova of the sepia, and those of the vermes
                    testacea that live in water, <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trails.,</hi> 1817, p.
                    297), and when referring to the ova of the vermes testacea, says, “If the shell
                    were formed in the ovum, the process of aerating the blood must be very
                    materially interfered with, for this reason, the covering or shell of the egg,
                    first drops off, and the young is hatched before the shell of the animal is
                    formed; this I have seen take ‘place in the eggs of the garden snail, but in the
                    testacea that live in water, the young requires some defence in the period
                    between the egg being hatched and the young acquiring its shell, which is not
                    necessary in those that live on land; for this purpose the ova are enclosed in
                    chambers of a particular kind.” The assertion here made, and founded on <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> considerations, that the shell is not formed until
                    after the egg is hatched, is opposed by every observation which we have been
                    able to make on the subject; and what is more surprising, it is at variance with
                    his own observations on the garden snail, the very example produced in its
                    confirmation. The eggs of a snail, laid on the 5th of August 1773, were hatched
                    on the 20th of that month, and their condition at this time distinctly stated.
                    “On the 20th,” he says, “the young were hatched, and the shell completely
                    formed.” It is much more becoming in a philosopher to observe how nature
                    operates, than to pronounce what she <hi rend="italic">must</hi> do.</p>
                <p>Order I Terrestrial.</p>
                <p>The animals of this order reside constantly on the land. When by accident they
                    fall into the water, they appear to be incapable of using their foot as a sucker
                    or as a fin, and die after a few writhings. The species in general prefer moist
                    places, and are seldom very active in dry weather. After a shower they speedily
                    leave their hiding places, and at this time they may be readily collected. The
                    eggs are hatched on land.</p>
                <p>1st Subdivision.</p>
                <p>Cloak and foot parallel, and containing the viscera between them.</p>
                <p>In this group are included those animals denominated slugs in this country. They
                    possess four retractile tentacula<pb break="no" facs="nls:193823850"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-3850-0357"/>, of unequal length, though in some cases one pair
                    is obsolete. The eyes are two in number, in the form of black points, seated at
                    the tips of the posterior tentacula.</p>
                <p>In some of the genera the cloak is furnished with a shield, which is, in general,
                    strengthened internally by a deposition of earthy matter, in the form of grains,
                    or a shelly plate.</p>
                <p>The shield in several of the genera is placed anteriorly, or the shield is placed
                    nearer the head than the tail. The group thus distinguished contains four
                    genera, two of which have compound tails, or furnished with peculiar organs,
                    while in the remaining genera the tails are simple. The mouth consists of lips,
                    which are capable of small extension, and above, the entrance is armed with a
                    concave corneous jaw, with a notch in the middle. The tongue is merely armed
                    with soft transverse ridges, pointed before, and terminated by a short
                    cartilaginous cone. There is a sensible dilatation of the gullet, which marks
                    the place of the stomach, at the under extremity of which is the rudiment of a
                    coecum at the pyloric opening. The intestine makes several folds, chiefly on the
                    liver, before it reaches the anus. The salivary glands reach to the extremity of
                    the gullet. The liver is divided into five lobes, which give rise to two ducts
                    that open into the pylorus.</p>
                <p>The circulating system consists of two venae cavae, which give out numerous
                    branches to the pidmonary cavity. The aerated blood is conveyed by several ducts
                    to a simple membranaceous systemic auricle. Between the auricle and ventricle
                    there are two valves. The ventricle is more muscular than the auricle. The
                    arteries, which take their rise from a single aorta, are characterised by a
                    peculiar opacity, and whiteness of colour, as if they were filled with milk.</p>
                <p>The organ of viscosity nearly encircles the pericardium. It consists of regularly
                    pectinated plates. Its excretory canal terminates at the pulmonary cavity.</p>
                <p>The organs of generation consist, in the female parts, of an ovarium, oviduct,
                    and uterus; and in the male, of a testicle, vas deferens, and penis, together
                    with the pedunculated vesicle; and, as common to both the sexual organs, there
                    is a cavity opening externally, in which, by separate orifices, the uterus,
                    penis, and vesicle, terminate.</p>
                <p>As it would be impracticable to give, even in the most condensed form, the
                    characters of the numerous genera which have been instituted, from our limited
                    space, we shall rather call the attention of the reader to the structure of a
                    few of the more remarkable genera.</p>

                    the cloak.</p>
                <p>This genus was instituted by Μ. le Baron D’Audebard de Férussac, in his <hi

                    liv. p. 53. The species of which it consists were formerly confounded with those
                    which now constitute the restricted genus Limax. It differs, however, in
                    possessing the mucous pore, in the pulmonary orifice being near the anterior
                    margin of the shield, with the sexual orifice underneath, and in the soft state
                    of the calcareous matter, in the shield. The author now quoted, has described
                    four species, and illustrated their characters by beautiful and expressive
                    figures. The <hi rend="italic">Limax ater</hi> (together with its variety <hi
                    rend="italic">rufus)</hi> of British writers may be regarded as the type of the
                    genus. The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Plectropiiorus,</hi> distinguished by a
                    conical protuberant shell at the termination of the cloak, was likewise
                    instituted by Μ. Férussac, and nearly resembles the preceding in form. Three
                    species have been described and figured, which, however, differ remarkably from
                    one another.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Limax.</hi> —Pulmonary
                    orifice near the posterior margin of the shield. This genus, as now restricted
                    by Μ. Férussac, differs from the Arion in the absence of the caudal mucous pore,
                    the position of the pulmonary cavity, and by the orifice of the sexual organs
                    being placed under the superior right tentaculum. The calcareous matter of the
                    shield is more solid, and appears as a shelly plate.</p>
                <p>In the following genus the shield is placed nearer to the tail than in the
                    preceding group, and is fortified internally with a subspiral plate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Parmacella</hi> Posterior extremity of the shield
                    containing the shell. The pulmonary cavity is placed underneath the shell of the
                    shield. This arrangement occasions a corresponding posterior position to the
                    heart. Along the back, from the shield to the head, are three grooves, the
                    middle one of which is double. The shield itself adheres only at the posterior
                    portion, the anterior part being free. The internal structure is similar to the
                    slugs. The only marked difference, indeed, consists in two conical appendages of
                    the sexual cavity, by which there is an approach to the species of <hi

                    which they are dependent, nearly terminal. The foot extends on each side beyond
                    the body. From the manner in which the blood is aerated, the auricle and

                    distinguish the sexes, while they are not in copulation; as, in both, the anus
                    and sexual organs are placed in a perforation, (cloaca’communis), in the under

                    however, has a thickened margin in front, destined to secrete the matter of the
                    shell. In the part corresponding with the centre of the shield in the slugs,
                    there is, (as Cuvier has characteristically termed it), a <hi rend="italic"
                    >natural rupture,</hi> through which the viscera are protruded into a conical
                    bag twisted spirally. In this bag are contained the principal viscera, the liver
                    occupying its extremity. The body of the animal is attached to the pillar of the
                    shell by a complicated muscle, which shifts its placé with the growth of the
                    animal. The mouth is furnished above with a thin-arched corneous mandible,
                    notched on the edges. The whole body, including the foot and head, are, in
                    general, capable of being withdrawn into the cavity of the shell. In two genera
                    the aperture is closed by a lid.</p>

                    however, are placed at the exterior base of the large tentacula, and are

                    the width and length nearly equal. The snails differ from the slugs chiefly in
                    the organs of reproduction. The vagina, previous to its termination in the
                    sexual cavity, is joined by the canal of the vesicle, and by two ducts, each
                    proceeding from a bundle of multiful vesicles. Each bundle consists of a stem or
                    duct, and numerous branches, with blunt terminations. These organs secrete a
                    thin milky fluid, the use of which is unknown.</p>
                <p>Connected with the sexual cavity is the bag in which the darts are produced. The
                    bag itself is muscular, with longitudinal grooves, and a glandular body at the
                    extremity. This glandular body secretes the dart, which is in the form of a
                    lengthened pyramid, consisting of calcareous filaments nearly resembling
                    asbestus. Previous to the sexual union, the two snails touch each other
                    repeatedly with the mouth and tentacula, and at last the dart of the one is
                    pushed forth by its muscular bag, and directed against the body of the other,
                    into which it enters, never penetrating through the integuments, and even, in
                    many cases, falling short of its mark. Whether the use of the dart is merely to
                    stimulate, or whether it is subservient to any other purpose, can scarcely be
                    said to be determined.</p>
                <p>The species belonging to this genus are numerous, and exhibit, in the form, the

                    the most convenient way of dividing them is into two sections, the first
                    including the dextral and the second the sinistral shells.</p>

                    >Amphibulina,</hi> is founded on a mistake, and is apt to mislead. The <hi

                    Müller says, “Sponte in aquam descendere numquam vidi, e contra quoties eum
                    aquae immisi, confestim egrediebatur.” The same remark is made by Montagu, and
                    we have often witnessed its truth.</p>
                <p>Order II—Aquatic.</p>
                <p>The aquatic pulmoniferous Gasteropoda have their residence constantly in the
                    water. They possess two tentacula only. These are usually flattened, incapable
                    of being withdrawn, and having the eyes at the internal base. The food consists
                    of aquatic plants. Respiration can only take place at the surface of the water,
                    to which the animals occasionally ascend, to expel from the pulmonary cavity the
                    vitiated air, and replenish it with a fresh supply. The sexes are united. The
                    spawn, which is in the form of a rounded gelatinous mass, containing many ova,
                    is deposited on aquatic plants under water. Previous to hatching, the foetus
                    must be aerated by means of some branchial arrangement.</p>

                    singular structure of the respiratory organs. We shall quote his own words:
                    “L’animal est pourvu de quatre filamens ou tubes qui partent de la partie
                    supérieure du cou, près du manteau; ce sont des trachées. Ces tubes sont longs,
                    blancs et très transparens, et on ne les distingue bien qu’ à la loupe. Leur
                    surface est comme rugueuse, et leur extrémité est un peu renflée. Ils sont
                    rétractiles. L’animal les fait sortir à volonté, un, deux, trois ensemble: il
                    les agite et les contourne sans cesse en divers sens: ce qui fait qu’on les
                    prendroit pour de petits vers. Je présume que par ce movement ces organes
                    séparent de l’eau l’air que y’est contenu et l’absorbent. Cet animal est très
                    sujet, ainsi que les autres gastéropodes fluviatiles, à être infesté par le <hi

                    entertained that this naturalist had been deceived by some of the parisitical
                    leeches which infest the aquatic pulmonifera, and that, instead of breathing by

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Peronia.</hi> —The body is destitute of the external
                    protection of a shell. The head is furnished with two long retractile tentacula.
                    The snout is divided into two broad appendages. Between the tentacula, towards
                    the right side, is the opening for the penis. The anus is terminal, immediately
                    above which is the entrance to the pulmonary cavity; and on the right is the
                    opening to the female organs, from which a groove runs towards the right lobe of
                    the snout. The mouth is destitute of a proboscis or jaws. The tongue is merely a
                    cartilaginous plate grooved transversely. The gullet is long in proportion, with
                    a villous surface. There are three stomachs, each distinguished by its peculiar
                    characters. The first is a true gizzard, covered internally with a cartilaginous
                    cuticle, and its walls formed of two strong muscles, with connecting ligaments.
                    The second stomach is funnel-shaped, with prominent ridges both on its external
                    and internal surface. These ridges, at their origin internally, are highest, and
                    project considerably into the cavity, acting like a valve in retarding the
                    progress of the food. The third stomach is short and cylindrical, covered
                    internally with equal longitudinal fine ridges. The intestine is nearly of equal
                    thickness throughout, and upwards of twice the length of the body. The salivary
                    glands are much branched, and pour their contents into the entrance of the
                    gullet. The liver, in the animals of this genus, is distributed into three
                    separate portions, each of which may be regarded as a distinct liver, an
                    arrangement which is not known to take place in any other animal. The first
                    liver is situate near the middle of the body, on the right side; while the
                    second is placed near the posterior extremity. The ducts enter the cardiac
                    opening of the stomach, each by a separate aperture, and seem to occupy the
                    place of the zone of gastric glands observed in birds. The third liver is placed
                    at the posterior end of the gizzard, into which it pours its contents by a short
                    duct.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable feature of the circulating system, is the position of the
                    lungs at the posterior extremity of the body, which occasions a corresponding
                    arrangement in the connecting organs. The entrance to the pulmonary cavity is
                    immediately above the anus. The vessels in which the blood is aerated, are
                    distributed on the roof and sides of the cavity. The pulmonic veins consist of
                    two receptacles, one on each side, extending nearly the length of the body,
                    which may considered as venae cavae. These receive the blood by numerous
                    vessels, and convey it directly to the lungs. The aerated blood is conveyed by a
                    systemic vein into a large auricle, seated in front of the lungs, of
                    considerable size, with the walls fortified on the interior by branched
                    ligaments. The ventricle is placed at its anterior extremity, and separated by
                    two valves. The aorta arises from the opposite side of the ventricle, its main
                    trunk passing on towards the head.</p>
                <p>The male and female organs of generation, although occurring in the same
                    individual, appear to occupy different parts of the body. The opening of the
                    male organs is at the tentacula, which leads to a cavity terminating in two
                    unequal recesses. The anterior is the smallest, and receives the termination of
                    a vessel three or four times longer than the body, which takes its rise at the
                    external base of the cavity, apparently from the cellular substance, and, after
                    a variety of convolutions in the neighbourhood of the mouth, opens into the
                    recess. The second recess is the largest, and the vessel connected with it is
                    most complicated. Its origin is in a mass which occupies a considerable portion
                    of the abdominal cavity, and which consists of a vessel forming a great number
                    of complicated convolutions, liberally suppli ed with bloodvessels. The duct
                    proceeds from this mass, undergoes for a short space a sudden thickening of its
                    walls, after which it again contracts, and, before it terminates in a perforated
                    glandular knob in the recess, it contains a pedunculated fleshy body, with a
                    sharp-pointed corneous extremity, probably capable of being protruded into the
                    recess and cavity. The parts which are considered as forming the female organs,
                    or those which are connected with the sexual cavity on the right side of the
                    anus, consist of an ovarium, divided into two lobes, each of which maybe
                    perceived to be again minutely subdivided. The oviduct is tortuous, and passes
                    through a glandular body, which, in the other gasteropoda, is regarded as the
                    testicle. The pedunculated vesicle gives out two ducts, one of which goes to the
                    testicle, the other to the uterus. It is difficult to form even a conjecture
                    regarding the uses of all this complicated sexual apparatus. The subject can
                    only be elucidated by an attentive examination of the condition of the organs at
                    different seasons of the year, and by studying, at the same time, the habits of
                    the animals.</p>
                <p>The preceding description of the characters of the genus is taken from the
                    anatomical details of a species found creeping upon the rocks under water in the
                    Mauritius, by Μ. Pérou, which Cuvier referred to the genus Onchidium of
                    Buchanan, already noticed. We have ventured to institute the genus, and to name
                    it in honour of the discoverer of the first ascertained species. Cuvier
                    conjectures that it breathes free air, and has accordingly inserted it among the
                    <hi rend="italic">pulmones</hi><hi rend="italic">aquatique.</hi> Some doubts,
                    however, may reasonably be entertained as to the truth of this supposition. It
                    would certainly be an unexpected occurrence, to find a marine gasteropodous
                    mollusea obliged to come to the surface, at intervals, to respire. It will
                    probably be found that it is truly branchiferous.</p>
                <p>Class II—Branchifera.</p>
                <p>The molluscous animals of this class are more numerous than those of the
                    preceding. They chiefly inhabit the waters of the ocean, a few genera only being
                    met with in fresh water lakes and rivers. The branchiae which constitute their
                    aerating organs, exhibit numerous varieties of form, position, and protection,
                    and furnish valuable characters for their methodical distribution.</p>
                <p>Order I—Branchiae external.</p>
                <p>The branchiae are pedunculated, and more or less plumose. They are moveable at
                    the will of the animal, and, in general, are capable of great alteration of
                    form.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Doris.</hi> —Oral tentacula two; vent without scales.
                    The cloak is covered with retractile papillae, and separated from the foot by a
                    distinct duplicature. Towards its anterior margin are placed the two superior
                    tentacula. These are retractile, surrounded at the base with a short sheath, and
                    supported on a slender stem, having an enlarged compound plicated summit. The
                    neck is short, and above the mouth there is a small projecting membrane,
                    connected at each side with the oral tentacula, which are in general minute, and
                    of difficult detection. The mouth is in the form of a short trunk, leading to
                    fleshy lips, within which the tongue is placed. This last organ is covered with
                    minute reflected hairs, and, from its motion, appears to be destined exclusively
                    for deglutition. The gullet is a simple membranaceous tube, terminating in a
                    stomach, which presents on the interior a few longitudinal folds. It is
                    furnished with a small caecum, the extremity of which receives the bile from the
                    liver. The stomach likewise receives the secretion of another gland, which is
                    not connected with the liver, in the form of a small bag, the inner surface of
                    which is covered with numerous papillae. The intestine is lodged in a groove on
                    the surface of the liver, and proceeds directly to the anus. The liver itself is
                    divided into two lobes, and gives <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823889"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-3889-0360"/> rise to numerous biliary ducts, which proceed to
                    the stomach. But it likewise gives rise to a duct which proceeds to a small bag
                    plaited on the inside, and afterwards opens on the surface at a small hole near
                    the anus. It yet remains to be determined, w hether the fluid carried off by
                    this conduit be excrementitious matter, separated by the liver, or whether the
                    gland which produces it be distinct from that organ, but so interwoven therewith
                    as to elude the observation of the anatomist.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, from the structure of the digestive organs, that the species
                    subsist on soft food, requiring neither cutting nor grinding, and in this
                    respect, differ remarkably from the species of the genus Tritonia, which were
                    formerly arranged along with them.</p>
                <p>The organs of generation differ little from the other hermaphrodite gasteropoda.
                    The vesicle furnishes two canals, one of which goes to the testicle, the other
                    to the penis. There is likewise a minute bag connected with the canal of the
                    latter. The spawn is deposited on sea-weeds and stones. It is gelatinous, of a
                    white colour, and in appearance resembles the sponge denominated <hi

                    destitute of basilar sheaths. The branchiae are in the form of plumes, or
                    imbricated productions, placed in a row on each side the back. The tentacula,
                    which are partially retractile, have a sheath at the base. In some of the
                    species there are indications of eyes. The mouth consists of two lips, which are
                    placed longitudinally, and open into a short canal. The jaws consist of two
                    corneous plates, united at the upper dorsal edge, slightly arched, and meeting
                    at their upper margin, for the purpose of cutting. Within these is the tongue,
                    which differs remarkably from the same member in the doris. In the latter, the
                    spines with which it is beset are reflected, and draw the food to the gullet,
                    while in the former, the spines are deflected, and serve to keep the food within
                    the reach of the jaws. The tongue of the doris, therefore, serves for
                    deglutition, that of the tritonia for mastication. Μ. Cuvier describes the
                    functions of both as similar. The salivary glands are placed on each side the
                    gullet, and empty their contents behind the jaws. The gullet has a few
                    longitudinal folds; the stomach is simple, scarcely differing from the gullet;
                    and the intestine proceeds almost directly to the anus, situate on the right
                    side. The liver is small, and situate behind, enveloping the stomach, and
                    intimately united with the ovarium. The organs of generation exhibit nothing
                    remarkable. The pedunculated vesicle has a simple canal. The external opening of
                    the organs of generation is situate a little before and beneath the anus. The

                    Each of the tentacula is furnished with a large funnel-shaped sheath. The foot
                    is very narrow, with a mesial groove, used in climbing up the stalks of
                    sea-weeds. The mouth is placed at the base of the tentacula, and surrounded with
                    a semicircular lip. The tongue is in the form of a tubercle, with reflected
                    points. The gullet is plaited longitudinally. The stomach is short and
                    cylindrical, with a ring of hard, longitudinal scales. The liver consists of six
                    unequal globules, and the bile is poured into the cardiac extremity of the
                    gullet. The <hi rend="italic">Scyllea</hi><hi rend="italic">pelagica</hi> has

                    back, consisting of fringed processes, alternately larger and smaller. The body
                    is ovate, with the cloak and foot continuous. The neck is distinct from the
                    foot, and is narrow. Above, the neck is continuous with the cloak, from which
                    arises a large semicircular expansion, used probably as a fin. The margin of
                    this expansion is fringed with numerous filaments, and on the upper surface,
                    within the border, is a row of conical tubercles. The true tentacula are placed
                    towards the base of this fin near the neck. Each of them consists of a small
                    fleshy cone, striated across, with a semicircular sheath behind. The branchiae
                    consist of a tapering, fleshy stalk, spirally twisted towards the summit with a
                    series of filaments on one side. They are fourteen in number on each
                    side,alternately and oppositely small and large. The anus opens in front of the
                    third -branchia on the right side. The orifice of generation is exhibited under
                    the first branchia of the same side. In front of each of the larger branchiae,
                    is a small cavity with a small filament in the centre. The mouth is situate
                    underneath the tentacula. It consists of a large funnel, covered within with
                    soft papillae, destitute of jaws or tongue. The gullet is short, the stomach
                    simple, fleshy, and covered with a thick cuticle. The salivary glands are
                    slender and branched, and open into the gullet. The intestine is likewise short,
                    and proceeds directly to the anus. The liver pours the bile into the canal at
                    the pylorus; and likewise sends out another duct, which opens externally near
                    the anus. The organs of generation are similar to the Doris. The <hi

                    and a row of compound branches on each side, decreasing in size from the base to
                    the free extremity. This stem issues from the neck near the middle, a short way
                    behind the anterior tentacula. Near this plume, but towards the right side, is a
                    single simple filament, like a tentaculum. The antertion tentacula occupy the
                    usual position, are setaceous, and have the eyes placed at the base behind. The
                    spiral shell is capable of containing the body, and the aperture can be closed
                    by a spirally striated operculum attached to the foot. The internal structure is

                    This genus differs from the others of the order to which it belongs. The back is
                    covered by a conical shell, within the cavity of which .the animal is capable of
                    withdrawing itself. The cloak is large, covering both the head and foot. It is
                    united with the shell along its superior margin. The foot is fleshy, and
                    furnished with numerous muscular filaments, which unite, in the superior part of
                    the cloak, to form a strong muscle, by which the body adheres to the shell. The
                    action of this muscle brings the shell close to the surface to which the foot
                    adheres, or removes it to a distance. The head is furnished with a large, fleshy
                    snout, supporting at the base two pointed tentacula. The eyes are placed on a
                    small elevation at the external base of the tentacula. A little way behind the
                    head, and below the cloak, on the right side, are two apertures, being the anus
                    and orifice of generation. The gills occupy the same position as in the
                    preceding genera. In some, the branchiae form a complete circle; in others, the
                    circle is interrupted anteriorly at the head.</p>
                <p>Within the trunk, the mouth is fortified by two cartilaginous cheeks, which, at
                    their union anteriorly, support the base of the tongue. This last is a most
                    singular organ. It is longer than the whole body, narrow, and covered with three
                    row’s of short reflected spines, interrupted longitudinally and transversely.
                    Its fixed end only can be exercised in deglutition, its free end being coiled up
                    the abdomen. On the upper side of the mouth is a semicircular osseous plate, or
                    upper jaw. The gullet is fìirnished with a dilatable pharynx. The stomach is
                    elliptical, with the cardia and pylorus at opposite extremities. The intestines
                    are <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823902" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3902-0361"/> variously
                    folded, and are several times longer than the body. The salivary glands are
                    minute. The liver is intimately united with the stomach and intestines. The
                    heart is situate on the left side, in the anterior part of the body. The auricle
                    receives the aerated blood from one vein when the circle of the gills is
                    complete, and by two when interrupted. This auricle is placed on the anterior
                    side of the heart. An aorta arises from each side, to convey the blood to the
                    body. The ovarium is placed underneath the liver; and, as it exhibits some
                    differences of organization, Μ. Cuvier infers that it likewise contains the male
                    organs. The species belonging to this genus are numerous, and appear to admit of
                    distribution into sections; the first having the branchial circle complete, the
                    second interrupted.</p>

                    middle and sides of the back, where they are implanted in the cloak, in an
                    imbricated manner, the posterior margin of the first valve covering the anterior
                    margin of the second. The foot is narrow. The mouth is surrounded with a
                    semicircular curled membrane, and is destitute of tentacula. The anus consists
                    of a short tube, placed at the posterior extremity of the cloak. The external
                    orifice of generation has not been detected.</p>
                <p>The mouth is capable of forming a short proboscis. The tongue is short, and armed
                    with strong, reflected spines. The gullet is short, and the stomach, which is
                    lengthened and folded, is membranaceous. The intestine is several times longer
                    than the body, and much folded. The liver is divided into numerous lobes, and
                    intimately united with the stomach and intestines. The heart is situate at the
                    posterior part of the body. The auricle is placed posteriorly, and receives the
                    aerated blood from two veins. Each vein descends along the base of the gills,
                    collecting the aerated blood from the particular side of the body to which it
                    belongs; and, what is most remarkable, when opposite the ventricle, it is
                    suddenly enlarged, and sends off a branch which communicates with it, and again
                    contracts and unites with its fellow from the opposite side, to form the
                    auricle. A single aorta arises from the anterior side. The ovarium is conical,
                    and divided into numerous lobes. Behind, two ducts seem to arise, and to proceed
                    one to each side; but it has not been determined whether they open externally.
                    No male organs have been detected; nor is there any thing accurately known with
                    regard to the peculiar nature of their hermaphroditism.</p>

                    extremity of the cloak. The body, in the animals of this genus, is ovate. The
                    foot is narrow in front. The cloak is broad, coriaceous, and destitute of a
                    shell. Towards its anterior extremity are two cavities, from which issue the
                    retractile superior tentacula, as in the genus Doris. Nearly at the posterior
                    extremity is another cavity, containing the anus. This opening, though similar
                    in situation to that of the Doris, is merely a short simple tube. The head is
                    immediately above the anterior margin of the foot, above which is the mouth,
                    having a small conical feeler on each side. Under the margin of the cloak on the
                    right side, and about half way between the mouth and the middle of the body, are
                    two openings, in a tubercle, for the organs of generation. The branchiae consist
                    of slender complicated leaves, which surround the body between the foot and the
                    cloak. The circle is interrupted at the head and at the tubercle of generation.
                    The mouth is destitute of jaws. The gullet is simple, ending in a membranaceous
                    stomach. The pylorus is placed near the cardia, and the intestine goes directly
                    to the anus. The salivary glands are small, and placed near the mouth. The liver
                    is large in proportion. The heart is situate in the middle of the back. The
                    auricle is simple, placed on the side next the tail, and supplied by the two
                    systemic veins which collect the aerated blood from the branchiae on each side.
                    There is a simple aorta arising from the opposite side of the heart. The organs
                    of generation appear to be similar to those of the preceding class; but they
                    have not as yet been minutely examined. The existence of eyes is not
                    satisfactorily determined. The animals of this genus appear to be inhabitants of
                    the tropical seas. Cuvier has given descriptions and figures of three species,
                    which differ remarkably from one another in the protuberances of the cloak.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Aplysia</hi> —Branchiae with a corneous lid. The body
                    of the Aplysia is ovate, acuminated behind, and produced before to form a neck.
                    The foot is narrower than the body. In the middle of the back is a corneous
                    plate inclosed in a bag in the skin, and on each side, and behind, there is a
                    fold by which this part may be concealed. The head is slightly emarginate, with
                    a feeler on each side. The superior feelers are situate on the neck. In front of
                    each of these is a small black point or eye. The branchiae are situate
                    underneath the dorsal plate, on the right side, and exhibit a complicated
                    plumose ridge, capable of expansion beyond the edge of the plate. The anus is
                    situate immediately behind the branchiae, and before these is the orifice of
                    generation, from which proceeds a groove along the neck to the inferior base of
                    the fore feeler, on the right side, where there is an opening for the penis.
                    Within the longitudinal lips there are two smooth, corneous plates, the
                    substitutes for jaws; the tongue is rough, as in many of the other gasteropoda.
                    The gullet is short, and suddenly expands into a large subspiral crop, with
                    membranaceous walls. To this, a gizzard with muscular walls succeeds, the
                    interior of which is armed with numerous pyramidal teeth, with irregular
                    summits, of a cartilaginous nature. The connection between these teeth and the
                    integuments is so slender, that they are displaced by the application of the
                    smallest force. They, however, project so far into the cavity, as to offer
                    resistance to the progress of the food. There is yet another stomach, armed on
                    the one side with deflected, pointed, cartilaginous teeth. At the pyloric
                    extremity are two membranaceous ridges, between which are biliary orifices, and
                    the opening into a long narrow coecum, with simple walls, which is contained
                    within the liver. The intestine is simple, and after two turns ends in a rectum.
                    The salivary glands are very long, and, as usual, empty their contents into the
                    pharynx. The liver is divided into three portions by the folds of the intestine,
                    each of which consists of several lobes. The biliary vessels are very large, and
                    open at the mouth of the coecum into the last stomach. The food of the Aplysia
                    consists of sea-weeds and minute shells.</p>
                <p>The circulating organs are remarkable. On each side the body, in the region of
                    the dorsal plate, there is a large vessel, which receives blood from different
                    parts of the body, and which likewise, by various openings, has a free
                    communication with the cavity of the abdomen. In this respect there is a
                    resemblance to the spongy, glandular bodies of the venae cavae of the
                    Cephalopoda. These two vessels, or <hi rend="italic">venae cavae,</hi> unite
                    posteriorly, and transmit their contents to the gills. The aerated blood is now
                    conveyed to an auricle, of large dimensions, and uncommonly thin walls, situate
                    beneath and towards the front of the dorsal plate, and emptying its contents
                    through a valve, into the right side of the ventricle. The aorta, which issues
                    from the left and anterior side, divides into two branches, the smallest of
                    which proceeds to the liver on the left. The larger branch is again divided, the
                    smaller branch proceeding to the stomach. The largest trunk that remains, before
                    it leaves the pericardium, has two singular bodies attached to it, consisting of
                    comparatively large vessels, opening from this aortic branch. The use of these
                    glands is unknown. The organs of generation likewise exhibit some remarkable
                    peculiarities. The <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823915"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-3915-0362"/> ovarium is situate in the posterior part of the
                    abdomen. The oviduct is tortuous in its course, passes along the surface of the
                    testicle, and, after uniting with a clavate appendage, opens into a common
                    canal. The testicle is firm, apparently homogeneous in its texture, of a yellow
                    colour, with spiral ridges on its surface. The vas deferens arises from a
                    complex, glandular body, and unites with the common canal. This common duct,
                    before it reaches the external orifice, receives the contents of the
                    pedunculated vesicle, and has attached to it a botryoidal, glandular organ, the
                    use of which is unknown, but which some suppose to be employed to secrete an
                    acrid liquor regarded as venomous. It is obvious from this structure, that the
                    seminal fluid and eggs must come in contact in the common canal, and at the
                    single orifice, provided they are both ejected at the same time. From the
                    orifice to the right fore-feeler there is a sulcus, leading to the pore
                    containing the retractile penis. This organ, like those of the other mollusea,
                    is solid. It terminates in a small filament. The external groove is the only
                    connection between it and the other sexual organs.</p>
                <p>There is a peculiar secretion of a purple fluid which here deserves to be
                    recorded. It issues from a spongy texture, underneath the free side of the
                    dorsal plate. Connected with this cellular reservoir is a glandular body of a
                    considerable size, which is supposed to secrete the coloured fluid. This gland
                    is supplied by a large branch of the glandular aorta, and gives out two very
                    large veins to the left vena cava. The fluid itself has never been carefully
                    investigated. It is not altered by the air after drying, nor is its colour
                    destroyed by acids or alkalies, although the tint is a little changed, and
                    rendered less pure. Both these reagents precipitate white flakes from the fluid.
                    This liquor is poured out by the animal when in danger or constrained, and
                    colours the water for several yards around. It ejects it readily when put in
                    fresh water; and when entangled in a net, several yards of it in the
                    neighbourhood are sometimes stained, greatly to the amazement of the
                    unsuspecting fishermen.</p>
                <p>The Aplysia has been long known in the records of superstition under the name of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Sea Hare.</hi> Its flesh, and the inky fluid it pours out,
                    have been regarded as deleterious to the human frame. Even to touch it was

                    to subdue the obstinacy of concealed pregnancy. The progress of science has
                    exposed the errors, or perhaps tricks, of the earlier observers, and proved the
                    innocence of an animal formerly invested with every repulsive and noxious

                <p>This genus differs from Aplysia, in the dorsal plate being calcareous and hard.
                    The fore part of the body is narrow.; behind it is larger, and obliquely
                    truncated. The disc thus formed is circular, surrounded with a fringe of fleshy
                    filaments. From the centre of this disc, a longitudinal slit extends forward, a
                    little way beyond the anterior margin, and contains the branchiae. The position
                    and structure of the other organs are precisely similar to those of the Aplysia.
                    This genus was instituted by Lamark, from characters derived exclusively from
                    the dorsal plate or shell. Cuvier afterwards examined a species brought from the
                    Mauritius by Peron, which he considers as the one figured by Rumphius in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Amboinshe Hariteitkamer,</hi> tab. x. No. 6, and which he has
                    consecrated to his memory, naming it Dolabella Rumphii.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Pleurobranchus</hi> —Tentacula two in number. Cloak
                    and foot expanded, between which, on the middle of the right side, the branchiae
                    are placed. The cloak is Strengthened in the middle, above the branchiae, by a
                    thin expanded subspiral shell. The neck is short, and in some contracted, with
                    the front emarginate, exhibiting the com mencement of the inferior tentacula.
                    The upper tentacula are tubular and cloven. The gills occur at the edge of the
                    dorsal plate. In front of these are the orifices of the organs of generation,
                    and the anus is situate immediately behind the gills. The mouth is furnished
                    with a short retractile proboscis. The tongue occupies both ’ sides of the
                    mouth, and is covered with spines. The gullet is enlarged into a kind of crop
                    before it enters the stomach; this is folded, and is divided by contractions
                    into three parts. The first stomach has muscular walls of moderate thickness,
                    with a single longitudinal band. The second has membranaceous walls, with
                    longitudinal internal ridges, and the third has thin and simple walls. The gut
                    is short. The salivary glands are situate at the folds of the stomach, and by
                    two canals empty their contents into the mouth. The liver is placed on the
                    stomach, and empties itself into the lower part of the crop. The heart is nearly
                    in the middle of the back. Its auricle is on the right side, at the base of the
                    branchiae; and the ventricle sends out at the opposite side three arteries.</p>
                <p>Μ. Cuvier has figured and described the Ρ. Peronii with its anatomical details.
                    Two species likewise appear to be known as natives of the British seas.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Bulla.</hi> —The head is destitute of tentacula and
                    the body of the animal, protected by a convoluted shell, is oblong, becoming a
                    little narrower in front. Below, the foot is broad, thin, and waved on the
                    margin, expanded on each side behind, and capable of being turned upwards. At
                    the posterior part of the foot, but separated from it by a groove, there is a
                    broad, membranaceous appendage, a part of which is folded upwards, and a part
                    spread over bodies, like the foot. It assists in closing the mouth of the shell,
                    and in its position and use is analogous to the operculum, in the following
                    order. Above the foot, in front, also, but separated from it by a groove, there
                    is a fat, fleshy expansion, which Cuvier terms the tentacular disc, considering
                    it as formed by the union of the inferior and superior tentacula. In the centre
                    of the disc, in the <hi rend="italic">Huila</hi><hi rend="italic">liydatis,
                    (Lin. Trans.,</hi> vol. ix. tab. 6, f. 4), Montagu observed two eyes. Between
                    this portion of the back and the posterior extremity, is the dorsal plate or
                    shell, forming the genus <hi rend="italic">Huila</hi> of conchologists. In some
                    species, this shell is covered by the integuments, while in others it is
                    exposed. But in all, the part containing it is partially concealed by the
                    animal, by means of the reflected margins of the foot, and its appendage. Along
                    the right side of the body there is a groove, formed by the foot and its
                    appendage, on one side, and the dorsal plate and tentacular disc on the other.
                    The branchiae are situate in a cavity under the shell or dorsal plate, and
                    resemble those of the <hi rend="italic">Aplgsia.</hi> Behind the gills, in the
                    lateral groove, is the anus; and in front of these, the orifice of the united
                    organs of generation. The penis is removed as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aplysia,</hi> and connected by a similar slit.</p>
                <p>The mouth is, as usual, in front, above the foot and beneath the tentacular disc,
                    both of which serve as lips. The cheeks are strengthened on each side by a
                    corneous plate. The tongue is well developed in some, as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >H. ampulla,</hi> while in the <hi rend="italic">H.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >aperta</hi> it is reduced to a small tubercle. The gullet is large, and in the
                    Z&gt;. <hi rend="italic">lignaria</hi> makes two folds before entering the
                    gizzard. This last organ is fortified by three testaceous plates, convex and
                    rough on the inner surface, and attached to strong, muscular walls. These plates
                    exhibit in the different species considerable varieties of form and markings.
                    The intestine, before terminating in the anus, makes several convolutions in the
                    substance of the liver. The salivary glands exhibit considerable differences. In
                    the <hi rend="italic">H. ampulla</hi> they are long and narrow, and their
                    inferior extremity fixed to the gizzard. In the <hi rend="italic">H.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aperta</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lignaria,</hi> they are short,
                    with the extremity free. In the <hi rend="italic">H. hydatis</hi> they are long,
                    unequal, and the extremity of the one, belonging to the left side, is forked.
                    The liver forms a part of the contents inclosed in the spire of the shell. It

                    intestine, and empties the bile into its pyloric extremity. The auricle and
                    ventricle appear to occupy the same relative position as in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aplysia,</hi> but the structure of the arteries is unknown. The
                    organs of generation have also so near a resemblance as to forbid a detailed
                    description. Some species are said to eject a coloured fluid, like the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aplysia,</hi> from the lid of the branchiae. A gland is observed
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Eulla</hi><hi rend="italic">lignaria,</hi> similar to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Aplysia,</hi> in which it is probable the fluid is
                    prepared.</p>
                <p>The species of this genus have not been sufficiently investigated in a living
                    state. When preserved in spirits, it is impossible to form a correct idea of
                    their true appearance, as exhibited when alive in sea-water, since they usually
                    exist as a shapeless mass. Cuvier has given delineations of such preserved
                    species, but they bear no resemblance to the figures of Montagu, of the same
                    species, taken from living objects. Μ. Lamark is inclined to divide the genus
                    into two, distinguishing those who have the shell concealed, by the term <hi
                    rend="italic">Bullaea,</hi> from such as have the shell in part exposed, which
                    he retains in the genus <hi rend="italic">Bulla.</hi> The shells of the genus

                    includes nearly all the marine Gasteropoda, which have spiral univalve shells.
                    It likewise contains a few species which inhabit the fresh water.</p>
                <p>The foot is usually fortified above, on its posterior extremity, with a corneous
                    plate, which acts as a lid to the shell, when the animal is withdrawn into the
                    cavity. The anterior extremity is in some of the species double. The anterior
                    margin of the cloak forms a thick band, or arch, rising from the foot, behind
                    which is the portion of the body that is always contained in the shell, and
                    which is covered with a very thin skin. Between the margin of the cloak and foot
                    is situate the head, supported on a short ñeck. The tentacula are two in number,
                    bearing eyes at their base, or on short lateral processes, which have some
                    claims to be considered as tentacula. The hood is frequently emarginate, and
                    sometimes fringed. The mouth is more or less in the form of a proboscis, in some
                    cases armed within with spinous lips, or furnished with a long narrow spiral
                    tongue, armed with spines, as in the common periwinkle. The nature of this kind
                    of tongue, the spiral extremity of which is free and lodged in the abdomen, is
                    not well understood.</p>
                <p>The entry to the gills is by a large aperture between the margin of the cloak and
                    neck, at the middle, or towards the right side. These are contained in a cavity
                    on the back of the animal, and consist of leaves arranged in one or more rows,
                    which adhere to the walls of the cavity. At the entrance of this cavity is the
                    anus and oviduct. The male and female organs are considered not only as
                    distinct, butas occurring on different individuals. The evidence in support of
                    this opinion is in many cases complete. The penis is in some external, and
                    incapable of being withdrawn, while in others it is retractile, and situate in a
                    cavity in the right tentaculnm. The body of the animal is attached to the shell
                    by means of two muscles, which adhere to the pillar near the same place, and
                    shift their position, by an arrangement not well understood, in proportion as
                    the individual increases in size. These muscles terminate in the foot and
                    mouth.</p>
                <p>The animals of this order have not been examined sufficiently in detail, to admit
                    of their distribution into natural groups, distinguished by characters founded
                    on important differences of organization. The form of the shell has been
                    resorted to, with the view of assisting arrangement. The characters thus
                    furnished would be useful and valuable, were they the index of any peculiar
                    internal structure. But, unfortunately, animals widely different in structure
                    inhabit shells of the same form, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> so that,
                    however useful the mere conchologist may find the form of the shell to be in his
                    arrangements, it can only be regarded by the zooloğist as occupying a
                    subordinate place. Without, therefore, entering into any details regarding the
                    structure of the few species which have been examined anatomically, we shall
                    merely point out the tribes and families which have been contemplated, the

                    employed in the methodical distribution of the species and genera are derived
                    from the shelly appendage of the cloak. The groups, therefore, are merely
                    artificial, temporary combinations, to a very few of which only we shall make

                    established.</p>
                <p>Family 1. <hi rend="italic">Buccinidae.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Canal short,
                    scarcely produced beyond the anterior margin of the lip, and bent towards the
                    right. The tentacula are remote, and the head is destitute of a hood. The mouth
                    has a retractile proboscis. The following genera belong to this family:
                    Buccinum, Eburna, Dolium, Harpa, Nassa, Purpura, Cassis, Morio, Ricinula, and
                    Monoceros.</p>
                <p>Family 2. <hi rend="italic">Muricidae.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Canal
                    produced, and straight. The tentacula approach the head and mouth as in the
                    preceding family. The genera are Murex, Typhis, Ranella, Fusus, Pleurotoma,
                    Pyrula, Fasciolaria, Terebra, Triton-alia,' and Turbinella.</p>
                <p>Family 3. <hi rend="italic">Cerithiadae.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Canal short
                    and recurved. Head with a hood. This family contains the marine Cerithium and
                    Strutheolaria, and the fluviatile Potamidum, Melanopsis, and Pirena.</p>
                <p>Family 4. <hi rend="italic">Strombusidae.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Canal
                    short, and bent towards the right. The outer margin of the aperture becomes
                    nal-mated with age, and exhibits a second canal, generally near the former, for
                    the passage of the head. The following are the genera: Strombus, Pterocera,
                    Hippocrenes, and Rostellaria.</p>
                <p>2d Tribe.</p>
                <p>Shell internal.</p>
                <p>This tribe consists at present of only one genus, termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sigaretus,</hi> two species of which are natives of Britain. The foot of the
                    animals belonging to this genus, or rather of the species which constitutes the
                    type, is oval, with a duplicature in front. The cloak is broad, with an
                    indentation on the left side, in front, leading to the branchial cavity. A ring
                    of transverse muscles unites the cloak with the foot. On the back is placed the
                    shell, which does not appear on the outside, as it is covered by a thick
                    cuticle. It is lodged in a sac, and united by a muscle, which adheres to the
                    pillar. The hood is produced, at each side, into a flattened tentaculum, with an
                    eye at the external base. The anus is situate at the branchial indentation on
                    the left side. The penis is situate on the right side of the neck; it is
                    external, with a crooked, blunt, lateral process near its extremity.</p>
                <p>The mouth is in the form of a short proboscis. The tongue is armed with spines,
                    and is long and spirally folded. The salivary glands are large. The stomach is
                    membranaceous, giving off the intestine near the cardia. The intestine makes two
                    folds. The liver, with the testicle in the male, and the ovarium in the female,
                    occupy the posterior part of the body, under the spire of the shell.</p>
                <p>2d Subdivision.</p>
                <p>Heart traversed by the rectum.</p>
                <p>This group includes the order Scutibranchia of Cuvier.</p>
                <p>In general form, and in the structure and position of the branchiae, the
                    resemblance to the genera of the preceding subdivision is very great. The
                    animals differ, however, in many particulars. The heart is furnished with two
                    auricles, and is perforated by the intestine. The sexes appear to be
                    incorporated in the same individual, or rather the male organs are unknown. The
                    body is protected by a shell, the aperture of which is wide, and never closed by
                    a lid.</p>
                <p>1st Tribe.</p>
                <p>Shell ear-shaped, flat, with a lateral, and nearly concealed spire.</p>
                <p>Family <hi rend="italic">Haliotìdae.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The genera of
                    this group exhibit well-marked characters in the shell. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Haliotis,</hi> the left margin of the shell is pierced by a row of holes. In
                    <hi rend="italic">Padola</hi> these holes are nearly obliterated; but there is
                    an internal groove and external ridge in the line of their direction. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Stornatia,</hi> there are neither holes nor ridges. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Halyotis,</hi> the foot is oval and large. The sides of the body,
                    all round, are ornamented with one or more rows of simple or branched filaments.
                    The shell is placed on the back with the spiral part behind, and the row of
                    holes on the left side, through which some of the filaments are protruded. The
                    animal is attached to the shell by a single large muscle. The entry to the
                    branchial cavity, which likewise contains the termination of the rectum and
                    oviduct, is on the back. The gills arc in two ridges, consisting of complicated
                    branched filaments. At the entrance of the cavity, the cloak is furnished with a
                    slit, the left margin of which rests upon the pillar of the shell. The edges of
                    this slit are furnished with filaments, which pass through the anterior holes of
                    the shell. The use of this singular arrangement is unknown. The branchial cavity
                    likewise contains the viscous organ, in common with the Pectinibranchiae.</p>
                <p>The hood is emarginate, with a long tentaculumon each side, behind which, towards
                    the side, is a cylindrical protuberance, bearing the eye at the top. The mouth
                    is in the form of a short proboscis, with two corneous plates as cheeks, and a
                    long narrow tongue extending backwards, and covered with spines. The pharynx is
                    dilatable, with internal folds. The salivary glands are very small. The gullet
                    is very short. The stomach is divided into two portions, the first of which is
                    striated longitudinally with a glandular structure, and receives a biliary duct.
                    The second is separated from the former by a valve, is smaller, with transverse
                    striae, and a double ridge. It likewise receives bile through two apertures.
                    There is another valve at the pylorus; and the intestine, after making some
                    turns, is surrounded by the heart. There is an auricle on each side, receiving
                    the aerated blood from each of the gills.</p>
                <p>2d Tribe.</p>
                <p>Shell conical, simple, or slightly revolute at the apex.</p>
                <p>A. Cavity of the shell interrupted by a testaceous plate. This division consists
                    of five genera, each of which may be regarded as the type of a family, although,
                    for the present, they are all included in one. In the Crepidula, the gills form
                    a transverse ridge on the roof of the cavity, consisting of filaments extending
                    beyond the margin. The eyes are at the base of the tentacula. There is only one
                    fluviatile genus, termed Navicella.</p>
                <p>B. Cavity of the shell entire.</p>
                <p>In the Capulus, the shell is entire, the foot is complicated on its anterior
                    margin. The shell adheres to the animal by a circular muscle, leaving an opening
                    in front, for the issue of the head and entrance to the branchial cavity. The
                    gills form a single ridge across the roof. The mouth is in the form of an
                    extended proboscis, with a deep groove above. The tentacula, which are two in
                    number, have the eyes at the external base. The anus is on the right side of the
                    branchial cavity. In the Carinaria, the foot appears to be compressed, and
                    formed for swimming. The head is covered with a group of tubercles. The mouth is
                    furnished <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823954" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3954-0365"/>
                    with a proboscis. Near the middle of the body the shell is attached. The surface
                    of the body above is closely covered with small tubercles. It is probable that
                    the species here alluded to is the same with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pterotraclica</hi><hi rend="italic">coronata</hi> of Foraskael.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fissurelladae.</hi> Shell with a slit or perforation. In the
                    Fissurella, the apex of the shell is perforated, and united to the cloak by a
                    circular muscle open in front. The cloak forms a duplicature in front for the
                    branchial cavity, which extends to the perforated apex of the shell. The gills
                    consist of two ridges; at the dorsal extremity of which is the anus. It is
                    probable that the excrements are ejected at the perforation in the apex of the
                    shell, and likewise the water which enters the branchial cavity in front. The
                    head is furnished with two tentacula, bearing the eyes at the external base. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Patella graeca</hi> and <hi rend="italic">apertura</hi> may be
                    quoted as British examples of the genus.</p>
                <p>The genus Emarginula differs from the former in the apex of the shell not being
                    perforated. Its place, however, is supplied by a slit on the anterior margin,
                    which is the entrance to the branchiae and anus. The foot is surrounded with a
                    row of filaments, and the eyes are supported on short footstalks, characters in
                    which it approaches the genus Halyotis. The <hi rend="italic">Patella</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">fissura</hi> of conchologists is considered as the type of the
                    genus.</p>
                <p>Division II—Mollusea Acephala.</p>
                <p>Destitute of a distinct head, or neck.</p>
                <p>The animals of this group are much more simple in their organization than those
                    of the preceding division. In none of the species are there any rudiments of
                    organs of hearing or of sight. They are destitute of jaws or other hard parts
                    about the mouth. They all inhabit the water, and possess branchiae. The organs
                    of the two sexes arc incorporated in the same individual, and reciprocal union
                    is unnecessary. They are either oviparous, or ovoviviparous. The presence or
                    absence of a shelly covering, furnish characters for a twofold distribution of
                    the groups.</p>

                <p>The shell in all cases is external and bivalve; and exhibits very remarkable
                    differences in the form, relative size, and connection of the valves. The cloak
                    is likewise in the form of two leaves, corresponding with the valves which
                    protect it.</p>
                <p>Order I.—Brachioγoda.</p>
                <p>Mouth with a spiral arm on each side fringed with filaments.</p>
                <p>The genera included in this group constitute the Brachiopoda of Cuvier. The lobes
                    of the cloak are free anteriorly. From the body, between the lobes, the arms
                    have their origin at the margin of the mouth. These arms are capable of folding
                    up spirally. All the species are permanently attached to foreign bodies, and
                    inhabit the sea. Their nervous and reproductive systems have received but little
                    elucidation.</p>
                <p>1st Subdivision.</p>
                <p>Shell supported on a fleshy peduncle.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Lingula.</hi> Valves equal, the apex of both attached
                    to the peduncle.</p>
                <p>The peduncle is nearly cylindrical, cartilaginous, and covered with a membrane
                    consisting of circular fibres. The valves are oval, flat, and destitute of
                    teeth, or elastic ligaments. The adductor muscles are numerous, obliquely
                    placed, and appear capable of giving to the valves a considerable degree of
                    lateral motion. The cloak is thin, and has interspersed muscular fibres. Its
                    margin is thickened, and fringed with fine hairs of nearly equal length. The
                    arms are fleshy in their substance, conical, elongated and compressed in their
                    form, and ornamented on the external surface with thick set fringes or
                    tentacula. The mouth is simple, and situate between the arms at their base.
                    There is no enlargement of the alimentary canal, which can be regarded as a
                    stomach, and the anus is a simple aperture situate on the side. There are marked
                    indications of salivary glands and a liver. The blood is conveyed to the gills
                    by two vessels, which are divided at the separation of the lobes into two
                    branches, one of these going to the half of one lobe, and another to the
                    opposite half of the other lobe. Two systemic veins occupy a similar position,
                    and return the aerated blood to the two lateral systemic ventricles. The gills
                    themselves are arranged in a pectinated form, on the inner surface of each lobe
                    of the cloak. There is nothing known of the nervous or reproductive systems of
                    this animal.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Lingula unguis</hi> is the only species of the genus, and
                    appears to be confined to the Indian seas. The valves were first figured by
                    Seba, together with the peduncle by which they are supported. Linnaeus having
                    seen only one valve, conjectured that it belonged to Patella, and named it <hi
                    rend="italic">P. unguis.</hi> Chemnitz examined both valves, without the
                    peduncle, and pronounced them connected with the genus Pinna. Bugiere, aware of
                    Seba’s figure, contemplated the formation of the new genus for its reception,
                    which Lamark executed. Μ. Cuvier afterwards dissected one of the individuals,
                    which Seba had possessed, and unfolded characters in its organization,
                    sufficient not only to warrant the construction of a new genus, but a new
                    class.</p>
                <p>Some petrifactions have recently been referred to this genus; but, in the absence
                    of all vestige of the peduncle, we do not consider the mere form of the shell as
                    furnishing characters sufficiently obvious and precise to warrant such
                    distribution.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Terebratula.</hi> Valves unequal, the peduncle passing
                    through an aperture in the largest valve.</p>
                <p>The following interesting information, from the dissections of Mr. Owen, will be
                    read with pleasure by the student of the anatomy and physiology of the
                    mollusea.</p>
                <p>The mantle adheres very closely to the valves: the lobe which corresponds to the
                    perforated valve is traversed longitudinally by four large vessels; the opposite
                    lobe is similarly traversed by two such vessels. Its margins are thickened, not
                    as in the Lamillibranchiate Bivalves from contraction, but owing to a peculiar
                    structure connected with respiration. They are puckered at regular distances,
                    the puckerings being apparently caused by the insertion of delicate <hi
                    rend="italic">cilia,</hi> which pass as far within the mantle as they project
                    out of it, but which are so minute as to be observable only by means of a lens.
                    In the interspaces of the cilia the margin of the mantle is minutely fringed,
                    and within the fringe is a canal, which extends along the whole circumference.
                    From this canal the large vessels of the mantle lobes take their origin: they
                    may be regarded as the branchial veins conveying the aerated blood to the two
                    hearts, which are situated exterior to the liver, and just within the origin of
                    the internal calcareous loop: they are accompanied in their course by much
                    smaller vessels, probably the branchial arteries. Such is apparently the system
                    of respiration in Terebra tula.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">viscera</hi> occupy a very small space near the hinge. The
                    alimentary canal commences by a small puckered mouth, situated immediately
                    between the folded extremities of the arms. It passes backwards, and expands
                    into a membranous stomach, surrounded by the liver, a bulky gland of a green
                    colour and minute follicular texture, which communicates with it by many
                    orifices. The intestine passes down to the hinge, and then turns to the right
                    side and terminates between the two mantle-lobes. No trace of a salivary gland
                    was found.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823967" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3967-0366"/>
                <p>The generation of Terebratula is that of the ordinary Bivalves. In two of the
                    larger specimens the ova had insinuated themselves between the layers of the
                    mantle, and partly surrounded the branchial vessels. When so far advanced they
                    obscure the organization of the mantle which adapts it for respiration: this
                    organization is consequently most satisfactorily observed in very young
                    individuals.</p>
                <p>The peculiar internal testaceous apparatus or loop connected with the hinge and
                    supporting the atms, possesses some elasticity, and when acted on by the
                    muscles, becomes in its reflected part sufficiently convex to press upon the
                    perforated valve and separate it slightly from the opposite one; thus
                    compensating for the absence of the thick arms of Lingula, which, in their
                    protrusion, push open the valves, and aíso for that of the elastic fibres,
                    constituting the ligament of ordinary Bivalves.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Orbicula</hi><hi rend="italic">lamellosa</hi> the same
                    intelligent observer traced aloríg the whole circumference of the valves,
                    shining cilia projecting for an extent varying from two to four lines: they are
                    consequently much longer than in Terebratula and in Lingula anatina, and are
                    rather longer than in Lingula Audebardii, Brod. On examination under a higher
                    power they are observed to be beset with smaller setae, which probably give them
                    greater power in determining the respiratory currents. The mantle is similarly
                    vascular to that of Tercbratula, there being, in the upper lobe, four principal
                    trunks (comparatively, however, much shorter than in that genus); and two in the
                    lower. These trunks terminate in sinuses, situated close, and two strong
                    tendinous membranes, which circumscribe the visceral mass, and to which the
                    mantle-lobes firmly adhere. Here the veins of both mantle-lobes join, and the
                    common trunk or sinus passes obliquely through the membrane, and may be plainly
                    seen distributing ramuli over the liver and ovary.</p>
                <p>The muscles and viscera form a rounded mass, situated in the posterior half of
                    the shell. The mouth is seated between the base of the arms. The oesophagus
                    passes obliquely through the tendinous wall of the viscera in a direction
                    towards the upper valve: it becomes slightly dilated, and is then surrounded by
                    the liver. The intestine is continued straight to the opposite end of the
                    visceral cavity, is there again contracted, makes a sudden bend upon itself, and
                    returns to the middle of the right side of the visceral belt, which it
                    perforates obliquely, and terminates between the lobes of the mantle a little
                    below the bend of the arms. The liver is of a beautiful green colour, and
                    consists of a congeries of elongated follicles, closely compacted together,
                    which communicate by numerous orifices with the stomach. As in Terebratula,
                    there is no salivary gland.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Lingula Audebardii,</hi> Brod., there is also no salivary
                    glarid; and Mr. Owen is therefore disposed to believe, that the gland described
                    as such in Lirigula anatina by Cuvier, was only a portion of the liver, from
                    which the colour had probably been removed by long maceration in spirit.</p>
                <p>In the want of salivary glands the Brachiopoda would seem to agree with the
                    ordinary Bivalves. Destitute, like them, of any hard parts about the mouth for
                    comminuting alimentary substances, glands for pouriñg in a fluid to blend with
                    the food during that operation, are not wanted.</p>
                <p>The nervous system in Terebratula was not detected by Mr. Owen. In Órbicula two
                    small ganglia were found on the side of the oesophagna next the perforated
                    valve; from which two filaments, accompanying the oesophagus through the
                    membranous wall, immediately diverge and pass exterior to the anterior shell
                    muscles, proceeding with corresponding arteries to near the heart, beyond which
                    he could not trace them. A single small ganglion is situated on the opposite
                    side of the oesophagus, but on a plane posterior to the preceding; this is
                    probably the cerebral ganglion for giving off nerves to the free spiral
                    extremities of the arms, close to the base of which it is situated»</p>
                <p>Order II Bivalvia.</p>
                <p>Mouth destitute of fringed spiral arms.</p>
                <p>The animals of this group form the class Conchifera of Lamark, the Bivalvia of
                    the older naturalists.</p>
                <p>The shells exhibit great variety of form and relative size. They arc joined
                    together at the hinge, which is either plain or toothed, and corresponds in
                    position with the back of the animal. The connection of the two valves is
                    secured by the intervention of an elastic horny <hi rend="italic">ligament,</hi>
                    the office of which is to keep the valves open. It is either external or
                    internal. The valves are closed by means of <hi rend="italic">adductor
                    muscles,</hi> intermixed with tendons, and, passing traversely through the
                    animal, adhere to the corresponding places in the inside of each shell. By the
                    contractions of these muscles the free edges of the valves are brought into
                    contact, at the same time that the ligament is compressed or stretched,
                    according as it is internal or external. The number of muscular impressions is
                    employed by Lamark in the division of the Bivalvia into two orders, <hi
                    rend="italic">Dimyaires</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Monomyaires.</hi> This
                    distinction, however, he has not attendéd to with care, as in his family <hi
                    rend="italic">Mytilacces,</hi> which he includes in his second order, or those
                    having one adductor muscle, there are obviously two adductor muscIes, although
                    the one is certainly much larger and more complicated than the other. Besides
                    these impressions of the adductor muscles, there are others connected with the
                    foot and byssus. The cloak lines the inside of the shells. In some cases it is
                    entirely open, when the border corresponding with the free margin of the shell
                    is thickened, and more or less fringed with contractile irritable filaments. In
                    other cases the cloak in front is more or less united, and even forms tubular
                    elongations, which are termed <hi rend="italic">syphons.</hi></p>
                <p>Locomotion is denied to many species of this order. Among these some are
                    immoveably cemented to rocks and stones, as oysters; a few are attached by a
                    cartilaginous ligament, as the Anomiae; while others are fixed by means of a <hi
                    rend="italic">byssus.</hi> This last organ consists of numerous filaments
                    issuing from a complicated apparatus in the breast, connected with a secreting
                    gland and with the shell by the intervention of tendinous bands. The foot is
                    seated a little towards the mouth, is usually tongue-shaped, capable of
                    considerable elongation, with a furrow on its posterior surface. This organ,
                    where a byssus is present, is considered as employed in spinning and fixing the
                    threads. λVheri there is no byssus, it either acts as a sucker, enabling the
                    animal to crawl among the surface of bodies, or as a paw, to dig holes in the
                    sand or mud. None of the species can float in the water. They either crawl or
                    leap, the last kind of motion being effected by suddenly opening and shutting
                    the valves. In securing a residence, some of the species <hi rend="italic"
                    >love</hi> into different substances by means of a rotatory motion of the shell.
                    It was at one time supposed that the dwelling was formed by a secretion
                    affecting the solution of the surrounding substance.· But the very different
                    substances penetrated by the same species, as limestone, slate-clay, and wood,
                    forbid us to entertain such a supposition.</p>
                <p>The nervous· system is here but little developed. The superior and inferior
                    ganglia, surrounding the gullet, give rise to all the nervous filaments which
                    proceed through the body.</p>
                <p>The digestive organs are scarcely less simple. The food is soft and swallowed
                    entire, and either brought to the mouth by accident, or by eddies produced in
                    the water by the opening and shutting of the shells, aided in some cases by the
                    syphons.</p>
                <p>It may be proper here to state, in order to understand the relative situation of
                    the parts, that, upon laying the animal upon its back, and opening the cloak,
                    the abdomen appears to occupy the middle longitudinally, and the branchia to be
                    arranged on each-side. The mouth is situated <pb break="no" facs="nls:193823980"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-3980-0367"/> at the anterior extremity, and consists of a
                    simple aperture entering into the gullet, or rather stomach. It is surrounded by
                    four flattened moveable tentacula, two of which in some are in part united with
                    the cloak, while in others they are free to the base. In their structure they
                    resemble the branchiae. The stomach is full of cells, the bottom of each pierced
                    with a biliary duct. A singular organ, termed the <hi rend="italic">crystalline
                    process,</hi> cylindrical, cartilaginous, and transparent, is found in some
                    species projecting into the cavity of die stomach. The liver is large, surrounds
                    the stomach, and pours out its contents by numerous openings. The intestine
                    terminates posteriorly by a tubular anus.</p>
                <p>The branchiae consist of two ribbands on each side, extending the length of the
                    body, free on the sides and margin, and striated transversely. These plates are
                    frequently of unequal size. The blood is brought to these by means of pulmonic
                    veins, without the intervention of the heart. The aerated blood is transmitted
                    to a systemic heart, consisting of one or two auricles, and a ventricle.</p>
                <p>The reproductive organs of the Bivalvia, hitherto examined, consist of an ovarium
                    occupying the sides of the body, and penetrating the membranes of the cloak.
                    They appear to have the organs of both sexes incorporated, and to propagate
                    without intercourse. Lamark is disposed to consider impregnation produced by the
                    male fluid dispersed through the water; a supposition unsupported even by
                    analogy in the animal kingdom. Many species are ovoviviparous; in which case the
                    eggs when ripe pass into the gills, where they are hatched.</p>
                <p>The methodical distribution of the Bivalvia appears to be attended with peculiar
                    difficulties, in consequence of the uniformity which prevails in the structure
                    and disposition of their organs. The characters furnished by the shell, though
                    useful in the construction of generic as well as specific distinctions, have
                    been abandoned by those who prefer a knowledge of the structure, rather than the
                    form of an animal. The characters derived from the presence of a byssus, a foot,
                    or syphons, appear to be nearly of co-ordinate importance. Μ. Cuvier gives the
                    preference to those founded upon the appearances of the syphon, by the aid of
                    which the genera may be distributed into five families, an arrangement which,
                    though liable to some objections, may be adopted with advantage. These groups,
                    however, may be considered as occupying a much higher rank, and each as
                    including numerous families.</p>
                <p>1st Subdivision.</p>
                <p>Cloak, open.</p>
                <p>There are no syphons, the anterior margin of the cloak being as open as the mouth
                    of the shell. When the valves open, the water comes immediately in contact with
                    the branchiae and mouth. The margin of the mantle has a double fringe of
                    filaments.</p>
                <p>1st Tribe.</p>
                <p>Valves closed by one adductor muscle.</p>
                <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Pectenidae.</hi> Animals free or fixed only by a byssus.
                    Furnished with a foot.</p>
                <p>Into this family, contemplated by Lamark, the following ill assorted genera may
                    be placed: Pecten, Lima, Pedum, Plagiostoma, Vulsella, Placuna, Gryphaea, Perna,
                    Gervil-lea, Inoceramus, Malleus, and Crenatula.</p>
                <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Ostreadae.</hi> Shell cemented to foreign bodies. Body
                    destitute of a foot.</p>
                <p>To this family the following genera are related: Ostrea, Anomia, Spondylus, and
                    Plicatula.</p>
                <p>2d Tribe.</p>
                <p>Shell closed by two adductor muscles.</p>
                <p>The two genera, Avicula and Meleagrina (of Lamark), form one family of this
                    tribe; the genus Pinna another; and the Arcadae a third, including Arca,
                    Pectunculus, Nucula, Cucullaea, Trigonia, and Castalia.</p>
                <p>J}d Subdivision.</p>
                <p>Cloak more or less closed, forming syphons.</p>
                <p>The further division of this group depends on the modifications of the syphons,
                    or aperture of the cloak.</p>
                <p>1st Tribe.</p>
                <p>The union of the cloak forming only one syphon. This is situate posteriorly
                    opposite the anus, and serves for the ejection of the excrements. The other
                    large opening allows the water to enter to the mouth and gills.</p>
                <p>This tribe may be divided into two families. The first, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mytildae,</hi> will include the genera Mytilus, Modiolus, and Lithodomus, which
                    are furnished with a byssus. The second, <hi rend="italic">Unioridae,</hi> will
                    embrace Unio, Hyria, Anodonta, and Iridina. They want a byssus.</p>
                <p>Μ. Cuvier is disposed to place in this group the genera Cardita, Veneri cardia,
                    and Crassatella.</p>
                <p>2d Tribe.</p>
                <p>Cloak closed posteriorly, and anteriorly forming three apertures. The first
                    serves for the passage of the byssus, and is the largest. The second admits
                    water to the branchiae and mouth; and the third is opposite the anus. The valves
                    are closed by one adductor muscle. There are only two genera belonging to this
                    tribe, Tridacna and Hippopus.</p>
                <p>In the two remaining tribes there are three openings in the cloak. Two of these
                    are posterior, and near each other; sometimes, indeed, they are tubular and
                    united. There is no byssus, but always a foot.</p>
                <p>3d Tribe.</p>
                <p>Anterior opening large, allowing the water free access to the mouth and gills,
                    and the feet freedom of motion. The structure of the animals is yet too
                    imperfectly examined to enable any one to establish families on permanent
                    characters. The attempt which Lamark has made may be considered as a complete
                    failure, independent of the wanton changes of nomenclature with which it is
                    chargeable, whilst the efforts of Cuvier have not been attended with greater
                    success. The following are the principal genera belonging to this tribe: Chama,
                    Isocardia, Cardium, Donax, Cyclas, Corbis, Tellina, Loripes, Lucina, Venus,
                    Capsa, Petri cola, Corbula, and Mactra.</p>
                <p>4th Tribe.</p>
                <p>Anterior opening small, and -not exposing the month or giUs,</p>
                <p>In this tribe the mantle is closed in front; and even when the valves are open,
                    neither mouth nor gills are visible. The anterior opening serves for a passage
                    to the foot, and the posterior openings, in the form of two long tubes, united
                    by a common membrane, serve for the entrance and exit of the water to the mouth
                    and branchiae, and the ejection of the faeces, the dorsal syphon serving the
                    latter purpose. The cuticle of the shell covers also the exposed portion of the
                    cloak, so that, when the animal is removed from the shell, it remains as a loose
                    membrane on the margin of the valves, as was first observed by Reaumur. All the
                    genera prefer concealment, burrowing in sand, mud, or wood, with the head
                    downwards, and the syphons rising to the surface. The following genera belong to
                    this tribe: Mya, Lutraria, Anatina, Glycemeris, Panopea, Pandora, Gastrochena,
                    Byssomia, Hiatella, Solen, Sanguinolaria, Pholas, Teredo, Xylo-phaga,
                    Clavagella, and Fistulana.</p>

                <p>The formation of this interesting group of animals was first publicly announced

                    Cuvier, aided by the descriptions of Ellis and Pallis, paved the way for the
                    masterly efforts of Savigny, to whom we owe the most extensive, new, and
                    accurate information yet given concerning the animals of this group. His

                <p>The covering of the animals of this group consists of an external and internal
                    sac or tunic, which are either entirely united or unconnected, except at the
                    apertures. The surface is smooth in some, and rough in others, and in a few
                    species defended by an artificial covering of agglutinated shells and sand. The
                    sacs are furnished with muscular bands, and are capable of contraction. Some of
                    the species, by means of contractile movements, float about in the water;
                    others, receiving that element into the branchial cavity, and ejecting it
                    forcibly at the opposite one, push themselves forward. Many, however, are fixed
                    during life to seaweeds and stones.</p>
                <p>The apertures of the tunic are two in number, unless in the doubtful genus
                    Mammaria. The one, frequently the largest, is destined for receiving the water
                    into the cavity to supply the mouth and gills. This is termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">branchial</hi> cavity. The other is destined for the exit of the
                    water, the eggs, and the faeces, and termed the <hi rend="italic">anal</hi>
                    opening. These apertures arc sometimes placed near each other, at other times at
                    opposite extremities of the body, and variously provided with tentacula or
                    valves.</p>
                <p>The mouth is simple, destitute of spiral arms, and opening in the anterior of the
                    cavity of the body between the branchiae, as in the other Acephala. It possesses
                    neither jaws nor tentacula. The alimentary canal is very simple, and can
                    scarcely be distinguished into gullet, stomach, and intestine. The food is soft,
                    and such as the bounty of the waves bestows. The liver adheres to the stomach,
                    and in many species is divided into distinct lobes.</p>
                <p>The circulating system appears to be reduced to a single systemic ventricle. The
                    gills cover the walls of the cavity, in the form of ridges, more or less
                    complicated, and seldom symmetrical.</p>
                <p>The reproductive organs consist of an ovarium, either simple or complicated, with
                    some additional glands, the uses of which have not been ascertained. The species
                    are considered as hermaphrodite, and independent of reciprocal impregnation.
                    They appeal <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> not only to be oviparous, but to be
                    gemmiparous and compound, many individuals being organically connected, and
                    capable of simultaneous movements. They are all inhabitants of the sea.</p>
                <p>1st Subdivision—Dichitonida.</p>
                <p>Interior tunic detached from the external one, and united only at the two
                    orifices.</p>
                <p>The branchiae are large, equal, and spread on the central walls of the inner sac.
                    The branchial orifice has an inner membranaceous denticulated ring, or a circle
                    of tentacula.</p>

                <p>Body permanently fixed to other bodies.</p>
                <p>In this tribe the branchial and anal orifices are not opposite each other, and do
                    not communicate through the branchial cavity. This cavity at its opening is
                    furnished with tentacular filaments. The branchiae are conjoined anteriorly.</p>
                <p>A. Simple.</p>
                <p>This division includes the genus <hi rend="italic">Ascidia</hi> of Linnaeus. The
                    individuals are independent of each other, and although they frequently adhere
                    together in clusters, they are destitute of a common covering, or organical
                    connexion.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Apertures furnished with four rays.</hi></p>
                <p>The animals of this group have the external tunic coriaceous, dry, opaque, rough,
                    folded, and frequently covered with extraneous bodies, or inclosing such. The
                    branchial orifice has four rays, the anal one the same, or divided transversely.
                    The branchiae are divided longitudinally into persistent regular deep folds.</p>

                <p>The peduncle, in this division, may be said to have its rise in the summit of the

                <p>The abdomen is lateral. The meshes of the branchiae are destitute of

                <p>The external tunic is here soft, easily cut, and translucent. The rays (when
                    existing) of the branchial orifice amount to eight or nine; and those of the

                    latter of these is now recorded as a British species.</p>
                <p>As connected with this group the small Ascidia, figured and described by Mr.
                    Lister in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophwal</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions</hi> for 1834, deserves particular notice, as the following
                    important observations which he has recorded, sufficiently indicate. They will
                    indeed be perused with peculiar interest by all who are practically engaged in
                    the study of molluscus animals.</p>
                <p>This compound animal occurs in groups that consist of several individuals; each
                    having its own heart, respiration, and system of nutrition, butfixed on
                    apeduncle that branches from a common creeping stem, and all being connected by
                    a circulation that extends throughout. Their parts of such transparency that
                    their interior is easily seen. Their external shape is that of a pouch,
                    compressed at the sides, and fixed at the hind part of its base upon the
                    peduncle.</p>
                <p>Its two openings are in the form of very short tubes; that of the mouth at the
                    top of the pouch, and that of the funnel in front. The longest diameter, from
                    the peduncle to the space between the openings, is about ∙085 inch.</p>
                <p>The outer covering is a tough coat, a continuation of the peduncle, more pliable
                    near the openings; lined interiorly with a soft substance or mantle, in which a
                    ramifying circulation is very distinct. A great part of the interior is occupied
                    by the branchial sac, which is subcylindrical, flattened <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193824006" xml:id="kp-eb0715-4006-0369"/> at the sides, and has its
                    axis vertical; its cavity terminating upwards in the oval opening, and being
                    closed at the bottom. It is united to the envelope, or to the mantle above and
                    behind; the juncture, beginning in front of the oval opening, extends backwards
                    on each side of it, and then downwards in two lines; between these, along the
                    middle of the back, is a vertical compound stripe, that seemed to me
                    cartilaginous. At the bottom the sac appears to be enveloped by the soft
                    substance of the mantle, but at its sides and front a vacant space is left
                    between them, that ends in the opening of the funnel. The branchial sac is more
                    com-presed towards its lower part; and here are placed, externally to it, the
                    heart on the left, and the stomach and other viscera on the right side, the vent
                    opening upwards at the front into the funnel. On its sides and front the sac is
                    perforated by four rows of narrow, vertical, irregularly oval holes or
                    spiracles, about sixteen in each row, placed at less than the diameter of one
                    apart from each other. Through these the water, which flows constantly in at the
                    mouth when its orifice is open, appears to be conveyed to the vacant space
                    between the sac and mantle, and it then escapes at the funnel. The sac seems
                    extremely thin between the spiracles; but their edges are thickened, as if
                    cartilaginous; and they are lined with closely set ciliae, which, by their
                    motion, cause the current of water. When these are in full activity, the effect
                    upon the eye is that of delicately-toothed oval wheels revolving continually, in
                    a direction ascending on the right and descending on the left of each oval, as
                    viewed from without; but the ciliae themselves are very much closer than the
                    apparent teeth, and the illusion seems to be caused by a fanning motion given to
                    them in regular and quick succession, which will produce the appearance of
                    waves, and each wave here answers to a tooth. The spaces between the rows of
                    spiracles are of much more substance than the intervals of the spiracles; some
                    ligaments are stretched from them across the side cavities to the mantle, which
                    seem intended to keep the branchial sac expanded. These spaces also support
                    finger-like processes, about eight in a row, that project nearly at right angles
                    into the central cavity.</p>
                <p>The central cavity I shall venture to call the mouth, though the mouth is said by
                    Cuvier to lie at its bottom. The large short tube at its opening ends in five or
                    six obscure indentations; it can be drawn in and closed at the will of the
                    animal, as can the opening of the funnel. At the bottom of the tube the entrance
                    of the mouth is guarded by simple tentacula, some longer, some shorter, ranged
                    subalternately: their number was not ascertained. Whatever little substances,
                    alive or inanimate, the current of water brings, flows in unless stopped by the
                    tentacula, and they do not appear fastidious, to the mouth, and lodge somewhere
                    on the sides of it. A lively animalcule will sometimes disengage himself by
                    struggling, and dart about in the cavity till he lodges on some other part; or,
                    if a morsel is found unsuitable, it is ejected by the funnel’s being closed, and
                    the branchial Sac suddenly contracted vertically. Mostly, however, whatever part
                    the food lodges on, it travels from thence horizontally with a steady slow
                    course towards the front of the cavity, Where it reaches a downward stream of
                    similar materials, and they proceed together, receiving accessions from both
                    sides, and enter at last at the bottom, the aesophagus: this is a small
                    flattened tube which carries them, flowing on in the same way, without any
                    effort of swallowing, towards the stomach. The tube takes a sharp curve upwards
                    and backwards before arriving there.</p>
                <p>It is extraordinary that these particles pass along in the mouth just behind the
                    spiracles, when the ciliae are in full activity, without being at all affected
                    by them. I have, in some positions, seemed to catch a glimpse of a membrane
                    suspended within, too transparent to be commonly seen. One may imagine the water
                    to pass to the spiracles, strain ed through the meshes of such a membrane, and
                    the food to be carried along it by invisible villi; but this is mere conjecture.
                    The projecting fingers have the effect, whether intended for such a purpose or
                    not, of detaining some prisoners more bulky than the usual food of the animal,
                    for, in several individuals, I met with small shrimp-like Crustacea confined
                    between the rows: one escaped during an observation, another, after three days,
                    seemed as lively as when first swallowed.</p>
                <p>The stomach runs backward horizontally; its fore-part had an inflated look when
                    seen from the side, and, when from below, that of possessing two lateral lobes.
                    The food after accumulating here was observed to be pressed onward to the hinder
                    portion, leaving a narrow opake line of connexion with the oesophagus; the rest
                    of the fore-part, of which the apparent volume was nearly as before, having an
                    ochreous tint; this was inferred to be the liver, enveloping the stomach above
                    and on the sides, and accords with its place in other ascidiae and mollusea. The
                    line is continued by the intestinal canal that rises and then bends forward,
                    taking the form of a reversed S, and terminates in an ascending rectum and
                    sphincter. The faeces are considerable, as might be expected, where the food is
                    taken with so little discrimination. Transparent vessels, that may be supposed
                    lactaels, ramify along a part of the intestine and meet at a collection of
                    globular bodies, from whence two flattish lobes extend backward; in others these
                    are wanting. From the meeting of the vessels two branches ran, one downwards and
                    backwards, which was lost under the stomach, the other forwards; and from the
                    direction it took, I suppose it might communicate with a main stream of blood
                    near the heart. Some individuals had not the projection above the vent
                    observable in others.</p>
                <p>But the part that struck me as most remarkable in this creature was the
                    circulation, of which a good view can be obtained through the transparent coat,
                    for the particles of the blood are numerous, and, though not uniform in size or
                    shape, are mostly between ∙00025 and ∙0002 inch in diameter, and approaching to
                    globular. They are easily measured, as in the intervals between the spiracles,
                    they pass mostly but one at a time.</p>
                <p>The creeping tube, which unites the individuals of a group, is the channel for
                    two separate currents of blood, an upward and a downward one, that are flowing
                    at one and the same'time, and that send off each branch to every peduncle: the
                    blood thus passes into the animal by one current, while another carries it back.
                    One of these canals communicates at the termination of the peduncle with the
                    heart, which is placed, as has been mentioned, near the bottom of the branchial
                    sac on the left side, and consists of a transparent ventricle, or boyan, running
                    forward and a little slopping downward, in a channel hollowed to contain it.
                    Along the whole length of the boyau a part on one side of its axis seems fixed
                    to the channel, the rest free and contractile.</p>
                <p>When the blood entered the heart from the peduncle, contraction began at the
                    middle of the ventricle, impelling onward the contents of the fore part; and the
                    contraction of the back part followed in the same direction, so as for the whole
                    to have the effect of one pulsation; the heart was then filled again by a flow
                    from the peduncle. The intervals of the pulse were pretty regular in the same
                    individual, but in different ones they varied from two seconds to one and a half
                    second. Part of the blood thus impelled formed a main upward stream along the
                    front of the branchial organ, branching off at each of the horizontal passages
                    between the rows of spitacles, and at one above them on a line with the junction
                    to the mantle on each side. All these again united and formed a downward current
                    behind. The horizontal channels were connected also by the smaller vertical
                    passages between the spiracles; the set of the current in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193824019" xml:id="kp-eb0715-4019-0370"/> the latter being upwards for
                    the two lower rows, and downwards for the two upper ones.</p>
                <p>Another larger portion of the blood, on leaving the heart, immediately divided
                    into many ramifications that spread like a network over the stomach and
                    intestines and the soft substance of the mantle. Of these a part run into the
                    horizontal passages above the branchial sac, a part into the descending back
                    stream; a large portion, after leaving the intestines, took a short course, and,
                    collecting into one channel, flowed into that stream near the bottom, and, all
                    united, then entered the peduncle and constituted the returning current that
                    went to circulate in other animals of the group.</p>
                <p>After this circulation had gone on for a while the pulsations became fainter for
                    a few beats, and the flow slower, and suddenly, with but a slight pause, the
                    whole current in all its windings was reversed. The heart gave the opposite
                    impulse; the channel in the peduncle, that before poured in the blood, now
                    carried it back, and the other the contrary, and every artery became a vein.
                    These changes continued and succeed each other alternately, the average time of
                    the currents being the same in both directions, but the period of each varying
                    within a single observation as much as from thirty seconds to two minutes. The
                    phenomenon, like the currents in the <hi rend="italic">Sertulariae,</hi> was
                    invariably met with in every animal of the species that came under my
                    notice.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, when the creeping tube or the peduncle has been injured, the
                    circulation of an individual is in consequence insulated, but without appearing
                    to impair any of its functions. I severed one at the part where it joined the
                    peduncle, when for a few seconds the pulsation ceased; it then began irregularly
                    and with considerable pauses, and increased in steadiness as it went on. At
                    first the impulse given by the heart was towards the front, and the downward
                    back stream, instead of flowing out at the wound, was poured into the hinder end
                    of the ventricle; but when the current was reversed part of the blood was driven
                    for a time through the stump of the peduncle into the water: however, it soon
                    staunched, and all the vital actions went on as before the separation, except
                    that at the beginning of every pulsation there was a slight recoil.</p>
                <p>In one case where the circulation did not extend to another animal, one channel,
                    and only one, was open in the peduncle, and in this a small current ran to and
                    fro according to the direction of the impulse given by the heart. Some animals,
                    which had probably been injured, but were still connected with other vigorous
                    ones, seemed to be in course of absorption. One was observed in which the soft
                    parts were so shrunk as to occupy a small part only of the tunic; the currents
                    of its peduncle extended into this mass, but the heart, or motion of branchiae,
                    was visible. Upon looking at the same the next day, the tunic was empty, the
                    soft matter and circulation reaching only to the end of the peduncle. I also
                    once noticed a flux and reflux of the blood in a creeping stem, where the
                    current did not communicate with any animal.</p>
                <p>In some of the last mentioned particulars this Ascidia bears a resemblance to the
                    Sertulariae, and, like them, it increases by sprouts: the two streams of the
                    stem run through the bud before its organs are developed. No proper motion was
                    seen in the particles of its blood, like that of the Sertulariae.</p>
                <p>In a sessile Ascidia, nearly half an inch in length, of which the coat was too
                    rough and opake to allow an inspection of the branchiae, the circulation was
                    distinctly visible in the mantle near the openings, and the particles in the
                    blood were only of about the same size as above.</p>

                    involved in great obscurity. The genus <hi rend="italic">Bipapìlaria</hi> of

                    setaceous tentacula. The <hi rend="italic">Mammaria</hi> of Müller has only one

                <p>The animals included under this division were formerly inserted in the genus

                    animals, many individuals united by a compound integument, and arranged
                    according to a uniform plan.</p>
                <p>In some cases, there is only one system of individuals in the mass, in other
                    cases, there are many similarly arranged and contiguous. The tentacular
                    filaments of the branchiae appear to be distinct. They are destitute of the

                    the entrance of the water into the cavity. The inner tunic is strengthened by
                    numerous transverse muscular bands, which, by contracting, diminish the diameter
                    of the cavity, and eject the water from the anal orifice, thereby propelling the
                    body through the water. The digestive organs are situate at the inner end of the
                    cavity. The mouth and rectum are simple; the former placed between the two
                    branchiae, the latter directed towards the anal orifice. The heart is contiguous
                    to the stomach, at the bottom of what may be termed the branchial sac, and is
                    enveloped in a membranaceous pericardium. The branchiae are double, not
                    incorporated with the walls of the sac, but with two folds of unequal length.
                    The largest is free in the middle, fixed at each extremity, and opposed to the
                    dorsal groove, and traverses the cavity obliquely. The other extends from the
                    base of the first to the extremity of the dorsal groove. The surface of the
                    branchiae consists of transverse vessels in a single range in some species, and
                    a double range in others.</p>
                <p>When young, many individuals often adhere, and form chains and circles. But the
                    fully grown individuals are always detached and single.</p>
                <p>This subdivision comprehends the species of the genus Salpa; they are exceedingly
                    numerous, and appear to belong to many different genera. Μ. Cuvier has given
                    indications of some of these, chiefly derived from the shape. A few are
                    furnished with an elevated crest or fin, as the Thalia of Brown; a few have both
                    extremities rounded or truncated, as <hi rend="italic">Salpa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">octofera</hi> of Cuvier; others have one extremity produced, as
                    <hi rend="italic">Holothuria</hi><hi rend="italic">zonaria</hi> of Gmelin; and
                    even both extremities produced, as <hi rend="italic">Salpa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >maxima</hi> of Forskael. The <hi rend="italic">Salapa moniliformis,</hi> so
                    common in the Hebrides, and first recorded as a native by Dr. Macculloch, in his
                    valuable <hi rend="italic">Description of the Western Isles,</hi> vol. ii. p.
                    188, and imperfectly figured in its young state, at tab. xxix. fig. 2., appears
                    to be closely allied to the S. maxima of Forskacl, and but very remotely with
                    the <hi rend="italic">S.polycratica</hi> and <hi rend="italic">confederata</hi>
                    with which it is compared. This observer states, that “It cannot bear to be
                    confined in a limited portion of water, as it died even in a ship’s bucket in
                    less than half an hour.” With us, in similar circumstances, those taken in the
                    evening were alive at noon on the following day.</p>
                <p>CHAP. IV. ON MOLLUSCOUS ANIMALS AS OBJECTS OF</p>
                <p>UTILITY.</p>
                <p>Although molluscous bodies furnish many articles of value to man, scarcely any
                    naturalist has taken the trouble to enumerate the different purposes to which
                    they have been applied, or to point out in what manner their usefulness might be
                    encreased. To the savage, shells furnish some of his most important instruments.
                    They often answer all the purposes of a knife, and are extensively employed as a
                    substitute for iron: with pieces of the more solid bivalves <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193824045" xml:id="kp-eb0715-4045-0372"/> he points his arrows, and
                    forms his fish-hooks. Even when farther advanced in civilization, the
                    canaliculated univalves sometimes constitute the rustic lamp, while the larger
                    scallops are employed by the dairy-maid to skim her milk and to slice her
                    butter. From the inother-of-pearl shell many useful and ornamental articles are
                    fabricated; and calcined shells were formerly esteemed by physicians as
                    absorbents; and are ⅛till regarded by the farmer as furnishing a valuable
                    manure.</p>
                <p>Shells thus appear to be of some importance in the arts of life; but the animals
                    contained in these shells are of far greater value. As articles of food,
                    shell-fish are extensively employed by the poor, and even hold a conspicuous
                    place at the tables of the rich. In many places, they in a great measure support
                    the children of our 'maritime population, and, in the Western and Northern
                    Islands of Scotland, have, in years of scarcity, prevented the death of
                    thousands.</p>
                <p>The kinds chiefly used in this country, as articles of subsistence, are bivalves,
                    belonging to different genera. Among these the <hi rend="italic">Oyster
                    (</hi><hi rend="italic">Ostrea edulis</hi><hi rend="italic">)</hi> holds the
                    most distinguished place. This shell-fish is very widely distributed in nature,
                    being found in the seas of Europe, Asia, and Africa. But, since the days of the
                    luxurious Romans, the oysters of Britain have been held in the highest
                    estimation. They are found on various parts of our coasts, from the southern
                    shores of England, to the sheltered bays among the Zetland Islands. They prefer
                    a rough or rocky bottom, in from five to twenty fathoms water. They are fished
                    up with a dredge and an open boat; sometimes, when in shallθλv water, with a
                    rake or tongs. They are either conveyed directly to the market, or are placed in
                    artificial ponds of sea water, where they increase in size, and acquire a fine
                    green colour. In England this process of <hi rend="italic">fattening,</hi> as it
                    is termed, is chiefly conducted at Colchester, but the oysters are obtained from
                    the little creeks between Southampton and Chichester. This fishery on the coast
                    of England is supposed to give employment to ten thousand people, so that,
                    independent of the addition which it makes to the articles of subsistence, it
                    must be regarded as a valuable nursery for seamen. As an article of food,
                    oysters are light and easy of digestion, and may be eaten in great numbers
                    without inconvenience. They are used either raw or when pickled. In the last
                    form, they are sent to different parts of the country, and even constitute an
                    article of export. In Scotland, the principal oyster fishings are in the Firth
                    of Forth; but we trust the period is not far distant, when the proprietors on
                    the western coast of Scotland and the Hebrides will propagate this shell-fish
                    more extensively on their shores and sheltered bays. Places fitted for their
                    growth are every where to be met with; they require no superintending care; they
                    would soon furnish an esteemed dish to their tables, and form a valuable
                    addition to their trade.</p>
                <p>The next shell-fish, in point of importance, as an article of food, is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mussel (Mytilus</hi><hi rend="italic">edulis).</hi> This animal is
                    equally widely distributed as the oyster, and is found upon our coast in the
                    greatest abundance. It is gregarious, being found in extensive beds, which are
                    always uncovered at low water. It is found likewise in the crevices of the
                    rocks. In this fishery women and children are chiefly employed, and they detach
                    the mussels with an iron hook from the beds or rocks to which they adhere by
                    means of fine cartilaginous threads. In this country they are conveyed directly
                    to the market; but in some places of France they arc kept for a time in salt
                    ponds, to fatten like the oyster, into which, however, they admit small
                    quantities of fresh water. The flesh of the mussel is of a yellowish colour, and
                    considered very rich, especially in autumn, when it is in reason. It is eaten in
                    this country either boiled or pickled, seldom in soup. To the generality of
                    stomachs it is difficult to digest, and to many constitutions it is
                    deleterious,</p>
                <p>It is, however, in the spring, during the spawning season, that the greatest
                    danger is to be apprehended. This noxious quality was long considered as
                    occasioned by the <hi rend="italic">pea crab,</hi> which is often found within
                    the shell of mussels. It is now with more propriety attributed to the food of
                    the mussel, which, at certain seasons, consists chiefly of the noxious fry of
                    the star-fish; and likewise to a disease to which the animal is subject in
                    spring, under the influence of which it melts away, and falls from the rocks.
                    Besides being useful to man as an article of subsistence, the mussel supplies
                    the fisherman with one of his most&lt;convenient andsuc-cessful baits. It is
                    keenly taken both by cod and haddock. To the cod-fish, however, the animal of
                    the horse-mussel <hi rend="italic">(Modiola vulgaris)</hi> is more
                    acceptable.</p>
                <p>The following unsuccessful attempt to plant a colony of mussels is recorded by
                    Mr. Stevenson in his interesting work, (p. 73,) in which he gives the details of
                    the erection of the light-house on the Bell-Rock: “When the workmen first landed
                    upon the Bell-Rock, limpets of a very large size were common, but were soon
                    picked up for bait. As the limpets disappeared we endeavoured to plant a colony
                    of mussels, from beds at the mouth of the river Eden, of a larger kind than
                    those which seem to be natural to the rock. These larger mussels were likely to
                    have been useful to the workmen, and might have been especially so to the
                    light-keepers, the future inhabitants of the rock, to whom that delicate fish
                    would have afforded a fresh meal, as well as a better bait than the limpet; but
                    the mussels were soon observed to open and die in great numbers. For some time
                    this was ascribed to the effects of the violent surge of the sea, but the <hi
                    rend="italic">Buccinum</hi><hi rend="italic">lapillus,</hi> (Purpura,) having
                    greatly increased, it was ascertained that it had proved a successful enemy to
                    the mussel. The <hi rend="italic">buccinum,</hi> being furnished with a
                    proboscis capable of boring, was observed to perforate a small hole in the
                    shell, and thus to suck out the finer parts of the body of the mussel; the
                    valves of course opened and the remainder of the fish was washed away by the
                    sea. The perforated hole is generally upon the thinnest part of the shell and is
                    perfectly circular, of a <hi rend="italic">champhered</hi> form, being wider
                    towards the outward side, and so perfectly smooth and regular as to have all the
                    appearance of the most beautiful work of an expert artist. It became a matter
                    extremely desirable to preserve the mussel, and it seemed practicable to
                    extirpate the <hi rend="italic">buceinum.</hi> But after we had picked up and
                    destroyed many barrels of them, their extirpation was at length given up as a
                    hopeless task. The mussels were thus abandoned as their prey, and in the course
                    of the third year’s operations, so successful had the ravages of the <hi
                    rend="italic">buccinum</hi> been, that not a single mussel of a large size was
                    to be found upon the rock; and even the small kind which bred there are now
                    chiefly confined to the extreme points of the rock, where it would seem their
                    enemy cannot so easily follow them.”</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Common Cockle (Cardiurn edule)</hi> would deserve a place
                    in preference even to the mussel, were it not exclusively confined to our sandy
                    coasts and bays. It is found lodged in the sand, a few inches below the surface,
                    its place being marked by a small depressed spot. Women and children easily dig
                    up this shell-fish with a small spade. Cockles are sold by measure, and eaten
                    either raw, or boiled, or pickled. They are deservedly esteemed a delicious
                    anel· wholesome food in this country, although in France they are little
                    regarded. They are in season during March, April, and May, after which they
                    become milky and insipid. They are not generally used as a bait.</p>
                <p>Two kinds of <hi rend="italic">Razor-fish (Solen</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >siliqua</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ensis)</hi> are in many places of this
                    country used as food. In Scotland they are indiscriminately termed <hi
                    rend="italic">Spout-fish.</hi> They are found ' upon most of our sandy shores,
                    buried about a foot or two below the surface, and near to the low water mark.
                    Their place is known by a small hole in the sand. As it is rather <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193824058" xml:id="kp-eb0715-4058-0373"/> a laborious operation to dig
                    them out, Bose informs us, that the fishermen of France throw a small pinch of
                    salt into their holes, which always remain open by the action of the respiratory
                    organs; that they speedily rise to the surface, and are thrown out by an iron
                    instrument made for the purpose. The fishermen believe that it is the salt which
                    they wish to avoid; but it is conjectured, with greater probability, that the
                    presence of tire salt water, which is thus formed by the solution of the salt,
                    makes the animal suppose that its hole is again covered with the tide. This
                    shell-fish was esteemed by the ancients as a great delicacy. When boiled or
                    fried, it is certainly a very palatable morsel. When kept for a few days, it
                    forms an excellent bait for haddock or cod, and may even be employed for that
                    purpose in a fresh state.</p>
                <p>Several species of <hi rend="italic">Gapers (Myoe)</hi> are used as food both in
                    Britain and on the Continent, as the <hi rend="italic">Mya</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >arenaria,</hi> known to the fishermen about Southampton by the whimsical name
                    <hi rend="italic">Old Maids.</hi> These shells reside in the mud or shingle on
                    the shore, and a few inches below the surface. In some parts of England and
                    Ireland, they are much used, but, though common in Scotland, they are never
                    sought after. Another species, <hi rend="italic">the Mya</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >truncata,</hi> is also very common on the coast It prefers a hard gravelly
                    bottom, in which it lodges near low water mark. The inhabitants of the northern
                    islands call it <hi rend="italic">Smurslin,</hi> and employ it, when boiled, as
                    a supper dish. It is not so delicate as some of the shell-fish which we have
                    noticed, but it is by no means unpalatable. The <hi rend="italic">Mya</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">declivis</hi> of Pennant is, according to that author, very
                    plentiful in the Hebrides, and eaten by the gentry of that country. We suspect
                    that he should have referred to the <hi rend="italic">Mya</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >truncata.</hi> These shells furnish very good baits to the fisherman.</p>
                <p>There are several bivalve shells, besides those which we have mentioned, employed
                    on our coasts as articles of subsistence. The <hi rend="italic">Scallop
                    (Pecten)</hi> was held in high estimation by the ancients, and still is sought
                    after in Catholic countries. The <hi rend="italic">Pecten</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >maximus</hi> is frequently used in England. It is found gregarious in
                    moderately deep water, and is taken up by the dredge. It is pickled and
                    barrelled for sale, and esteemed a great delicacy. The fishermen suppose that
                    they are taken in the greatest quantity after a fall of snow. Another species,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Pecten</hi><hi rend="italic">opercularis,</hi> is employed
                    for culinary purposes in Cornwall, where it is known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Frills</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Queens.</hi> In the Firth of
                    Forth this species is frequently dredged up along with oysters, but it is
                    thrown, by the Newhaven fishermen, to the dunghill, along with sea urchins and
                    star-fish. To this list ,we might add the <hi rend="italic">Mactra</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">solida,</hi> which is used as food by the common people about
                    Dartmouth; and the <hi rend="italic">Penus pullastra,</hi> called by the
                    inhabitants of Devonshire, Pullet, and eaten by them, and known to the
                    inhabitants of the Northern Islands by the name of Cullyock, and there used as a
                    bait. According to Bruguiere, the <hi rend="italic">Anomia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ephippium</hi> is used as food at Languedoe, and is there considered as
                    preferable to the oyster But it is now time that we turn our attention to the
                    univalve shells, in order to ascertain their value in an economical point of
                    view.</p>
                <p>The common <hi rend="italic">Periwinkle (Turbo littoreous)</hi> is, in this
                    country, more extensively used as food than any of the other testaceous
                    univalves. This shell is easily gathered, as it is found on all our rocks which
                    are left uncovered by the ebbing of the tide. Children are principally employed
                    in this fishery, and the shells are sold by measure. They are in general used
                    after being plainly boiled, and are consumed in great quantities by the poor
                    inhabitants on the coast. The <hi rend="italic">Nerita littoralis</hi> is also
                    frequently gathered along with the periwinkle, as it frequents the same
                    situations. It is, however, much smaller, and its flesh is not reckoned equally
                    good.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Limpet (Patella vulgala)</hi> is equally abundant as the
                    periwinkle, and frequents the same situations on the rocks. Although used by the
                    ancients as an article of food, it is seldom brought to market in this country.
                    Among the villages along the coast of Scotland this shell-fish is frequently
                    used, and its juice, obtained by boiling, mixed with oatmeal, is held in high
                    estimation. It is considered in season about the end of May. The chief
                    excellence of the limpet, however, is as a bait. It is very easily obtained from
                    the rocks, from which the fisherman detach it with a knife, and it is eagerly
                    seized by all the littoral fish which are sought after. To the haddock it is
                    very acceptable.</p>
                <p>Several species of <hi rend="italic">Snails (Helix)</hi> are employed for
                    culinary purposes. The largest of these, the <hi rend="italic">Helix
                    pomatia,</hi> was a favourite dish among the Romans, who fattened them with bran
                    sodden with wine. They are still used in many parts of Europe during Lent, after
                    having been fed with different hinds of herbs. This species was originally
                    imported into Britain from Italy, and turned out in Surry, where it has readily
                    multiplied. The <hi rend="italic">Helix</hi><hi rend="italic">hortensis</hi> has
                    also been employed as food. But, we believe that these two species are chiefly
                    used medicinally, being administered in consumptive cases. The small species of
                    the genus are the favourite food of the birds of the thrush kiyd, either in a
                    wild or confined state.</p>
                <p>The other univalves which we shall notice are of inferior importance as articles
                    of subsistence. The <hi rend="italic">Fusus antiquus,</hi> the largest of the
                    British turbinated shells, is frequently dredged up with oysters, and, according
                    to Pennant, “is eaten by the poor, but offener used for baits for eod, and ray.”
                    It is probably the same species which is noticed by the Rev. William Fraser, in
                    his view of the Parish of Gigha and Cara in Argyleshire, vol. viii. p. 48, <hi
                    rend="italic">of the Statistical Account of Scotland.</hi> He says it is a large
                    white welk called <hi rend="italic">hue hie</hi> or dog-welk, and used as a bait
                    for cod. The method of obtaining these shells for bait being ingenious, and
                    making us acquainted at the same time with several new habits of the animal, we
                    shall here insert it. “At the beginning of the fishing (says Mr. Fraser) a dog
                    is killed and singed, and the flesh, after rotting a little, is cut into small
                    pieces, and put into creels or baskets made of hazel-wands for the purpose.
                    These ercels are sunk by means of stones thrown into them. The flesh of the dog,
                    in its putrid state, is said ∙to attract the welk, which crawls up round the
                    sides of the basket, and getting in at the top, cannot get out again, owing to
                    the shape of it, which is something like that of the w ire mouse-trap. After the
                    first day’s fishing, the heads and entrails of the eed, with scate and dog-fish,
                    are put into the creels, which are visited every day, the welks taken out, and
                    fresh bait of the same kind put in, their being no more occasion for dog’s
                    flesh.” The <hi rend="italic">Euccinum undatum,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Purpura</hi><hi rend="italic">lapillus</hi> are also employed as bait, and in
                    years of scareity as food.</p>
                <p>This list of culinary shell-fish is far from complete, even in so far as it is a
                    British list. The uses of these molluscous animals have seldom been taken notice
                    of by conchologists since the days of Schonvelde, more attention having been
                    directed to the formation of new systems of arrangement, and to the discovery of
                    new species, than to the habits and uses of those already known.</p>
                <p>Independently of the food which we thus obtain from testaceous animals, they
                    furnish us with the <hi rend="italic">pearl,</hi> one of the most beautiful
                    ornaments of dress. This substance, equally prized by the savage and the
                    citizen, is composed, like shells, of carbonate of lime, united with a small
                    portion of animal matter. Pearls appear to be exclusively the pro- &lt; duction
                    of the bivalve testacea. Among these, all the shells having a mother-of-pearl
                    inside, produce them occasionally. But there are a few species which yield them
                    in greater plenty, and of a finer colour. The most remarkable of these is the
                    <hi rend="italic">Avicula margaritifera.</hi> This shell, which was placed by
                    Linnaeus among the mussels, is very widely distributed in the Indian seas; and
                    it is from it and another species of the same genus, termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >Avicula</hi><hi rend="italic">hirundο,</hi> found in the European<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193824071" xml:id="kp-eb0715-4071-0374"/> seas, that the pearls of
                    commerce are procured. The <hi rend="italic">Pinna,</hi> so famous for
                    furnishing a byssus or kind of thread, with which garments can be manufactured,
                    likewise produces pearls of considerable size. They have seldom the silvery
                    whiteness of the pearls from the Avicula, being usually tinged with brown. But
                    the shell which in Britain produces the finest pearls, is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alasmodon</hi><hi rend="italic">margaritiferum,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >which</hi> was placed by Linnaeus in the genus <hi rend="italic">My a.</hi> It
                    is found in all our alpine rivers. The Conway and the Irt in England, the rivers
                    of Tyrone and Donegal in Ireland, and the Tay and the Yythan in Scotland, have
                    long been famous for the production of pearls. These concretions are found
                    between the membranes of the cloak of the animal, as in the Avicula, or adhering
                    to the inside of the shell, as in the Unio. In the former case, they seem to be
                    a morbid secretion of testaceous matter; in the latter, the matter seems to be
                    accumulated against the internal opening of some hole with which the shell has
                    been pierced by some of its foes. Linnaeus, from the consideration of this
                    circumstance, endeavoured, by piercing the shell, to excite the animal to
                    secrete pearl; but his attempts, though they procured him a place among the
                    Swedish nobility and a pecuniary reward, were finally abandoned; the process
                    being found too tedious and uncertain to be of any public utility. The largest
                    pearl of which we have any notice, is one which came from Panama, and was
                    presented to Philip II. king of Spain, in 1579∙ It was of the size of a pigeon’s
                    egg. Sir Robert Sibbald mentions his having seen pearls from the rivers of
                    Scotland as large as a bean.</p>
                <p>Besides yielding us a variety of wholesome food, and valuable ornaments,
                    testaceous animals supply us with a beautiful <hi rend="italic">dye.</hi> The
                    <hi rend="italic">Purpura</hi> of the ancients, according to the opinion of
                    Rondeletius, confirmed by the observations of CuVier, was chiefly extracted from
                    the shell termed <hi rend="italic">Murex</hi><hi rend="italic">brandaris.</hi>
                    Since the introduction of the cochineal insect, the use of this dye has been
                    superseded, so that we are now in a great measure ignorant of the process which
                    the ancients employed to extract it. In Britain there are several kinds of
                    shell-fish, which furnish a dye of this sort, but these are seldom sought after.
                    Cole, in 1685, published a method of obtaining it from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Purpura</hi><hi rend="italic">lapillus,</hi> to which Montagu, in the
                    supplement to <hi rend="italic">Testacea</hi><hi rend="italic">Brittanica,</hi>
                    has added several important directions. When the shell is broken in a vice,
                    there is seen on the back of the animal, under the skin, a slender longitudinal
                    whitish vein, containing a yellowish liquor. When this juice is applied to
                    linen, by means of a small brush, and exposed to the sun, it becomes green,
                    blue, and purple, and at last settles in a fine unchangeable crimson. Neither
                    acids nor alkalies affect its colour, and it may be conveniently employed in
                    marking linen, where an indelible ink is desirable. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scalaria</hi><hi rend="italic">clatkrus (Turbo clathrus</hi> of Linnaeus) also
                    furnishes a purple liquor of considerable beauty, but it is destructible by
                    acids, and gradually vanishes by the action of light. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Planorbis</hi><hi rend="italic">corneus</hi> likewise yields a scarlet dye, but
                    of still less permanency than the scalaria, as all attempts to fix it
                    have'hitherto proved ineffectual.</p>
                <p>We cannot conclude this chapter without remarking, that the study of molluscous
                    animals rises in importance as we perceive its utility. When <hi rend="italic"
                    >we</hi> are told, that searching for shell-fish, and conveying them to the
                    market, give employment to a British population of upwards of 10,000; that these
                    animals furnish nourishing food to innumerable families, and in years of
                    scarcity prevent the horrors of famine; we will be disposed to regard with a
                    favourable eye the labours of that naturalist who examines the structure and
                    economy of those animals, that, from a knowledge of their nature, he may render
                    them still more subservient to our purposes.</p>
                <p>Even when considered as objects of amusement, molluscous animals are not devoid
                    of interest. In the preceding division of our subject, we have considered them
                    as applicable to various useful purposes, and expressed our regret, at the same
                    time, that no one qualified for the task had ever bestowed on economical
                    conchology an attentive examination. We cannot therefore consider the present
                    condition of the science as the result of the labours of its practical admirers.
                    The lovers of this study, as an agreeable amusement, have at all times been
                    numerous, from the days of Laelius and Scipio to the present time; and it is to
                    their exertions as collectors, that the science is principally indebted for its
                    present state of improvement. The colours of shells are often so intensely
                    vivid, so finely disposed, and so fancifully variegated, that, as objects of
                    beauty they rival many of the esteemed productions of the vegetable kingdom. In
                    their forms they likewise exhibit an infinite variety. While some consist merely
                    of a hollow cup or a simple tube, others exhibit the most gracefùl convolutions,
                    and appear in the form of cones, and spires, and turbans; and in another
                    division, shaped like a box, all the varieties of hinge are exhibited, from that
                    of simple connexion by a ligament to the most complicated articulation. The
                    forms of shells are indeed so various, and many of them so elegant, that a
                    celebrated French conchologist warmly recommends them to the attentive study of
                    the architect. “Or,” says Lamark, “comme l’extrême diversité des parties
                    protubérantes de la surface de ces coquilles, ainsi que la régularité et
                    l’élégance de leur distribution, ne laisse presque aucune forme possible dont la
                    nature n’of fre ici des examples; on peut dire que l’architecture trouvéroit
                    dans les espèces de ce genre <hi rend="italic">(Cerithium)</hi> de même que dans
                    celles des pleurotomes et des fuseaux, un choix de modèles pour l’ornement des
                    colonnes, et que ces modèles seroient très dignes d’être employés.” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Annales du Mus.</hi> vol. iii. p. 269.) In this country, however,
                    no such recommendation is necessary, as many of our beautiful ornaments of
                    stucco, particularly for chimney-pieces, are copied from the univalve testacea,
                    and are greatly admired.</p>
                <p>But shells, even with all their beauty and elegance, would never have acquired so
                    much importance in the eyes of amateurs, had their forms been as difficult to
                    preserve as the external coverings of the higher classes of animals. It is both
                    a tedious and a difficult operation to preserve a quadruped, <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> bird, or a fish, as a specimen for the cabinet, and even when the task
                    is completed, it is but of temporary duration. A slow but certain process of
                    dissolution is going on, which, though invisible for a time to the owner,
                    gradually destroys the finest collection of these objects. The very changes of
                    the atmosphere, combined with the attacks of insects, accelerate the destructive
                    process. But with shells the case is very different. Composed of particles
                    already in natural combination, they do not contain within themselves the seeds
                    of dissolution, so that for ages they remain the same. Besides, all that is in
                    general necessary to prepare a shell for the cabinet, is merely to remove the
                    animal. When the shell is covered with foreign matter, we must wash it away with
                    a brush in soap in water; and it is frequently necessary to steep the shell for
                    some time in fresh water, to extract all the salt water which may adhere to it.
                    After being properly dried it is fit for the shelf of the cabinet, and stands in
                    no need of anxious superintendence.</p>
                <p>Amateurs are seldom contented with the simplicity of nature. Vitiated in their
                    taste by a fashion which abides by no rules, they attempt to improve even her
                    most elegant productions, and delight to exhibit in their cabinets some of the
                    efforts of their art. As such are in search of innocent amusement, we mean not
                    to dispute about the propriety of their conduct, but rather shortly to mention,
                    for their edification, the method generally in use to improve the beauty of
                    testaceous objects. Many shells, it is true, naturally possess so fine a polish,
                    that no preparation is considered as necessary before placing them in the
                    cabinet. Such are the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193824084"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-4084-0375"/><hi rend="italic">Cypreae, Olivae,</hi> and the
                    greater number of what is termed <hi rend="italic">porcellaneous shells.</hi> In
                    general, however, it happens that, when shells become dry, they lose much of
                    their natural lustre. This may be very easily restored, by washing them with a
                    little water, in which a small portion of gum arabic has been dissolved, or with
                    the white of an egg. This is the simplest of those processes which are employed,
                    and is used not only by the mere collector, but by the scientific conchologist.
                    There are many shells of a very plain appearance on the outside, by reason of a
                    dull epidermis or skin with which they are covered. This is removed by soaking
                    the shell in warm water, and then rubbing it off with a brush. When the
                    epidermis is thick, it is necessary to mix with the water a small portion of
                    nitric acid, which, by dissolving a part of the shell, destroys the cohesion of
                    the epidermis. This last agent must be employed with great caution, as it
                    removes the lustre from all the parts exposed to its influence. The new surface
                    must be polished with leather, assisted by tripoli. But, in many cases, even
                    these methods are ineffectual, and the file and the pumice-stone must be
                    resorted to, in order to rub off the coarse external layers, that the concealed
                    beauties may be disclosed. Much address and experience are necessary in the
                    successful employment of this last process. But it must be confessed that the
                    reward is often great. When thus prepared, even the common mussel is most
                    beautiful.</p>
                <p>The arrangement of shells in a cabinet must depend, in a great degree, on the
                    taste and fortune of the collector. If ornament is the object in view, it will
                    be indispensably necessary to have the shells placed in glass cases, where they
                    may be distinctly seen. But where a collection of shells is formed for
                    amusement, they may be kept in drawers, each species placed in a paper case, or
                    in a cup of wood, glass, or porcelain, with a label attached, intimating its
                    name, and the place from whence it was obtained. In this manner, both univalves
                    and bivalves may be conveniently disposed. But as many of the former are very
                    small in size, it is often necessary to fix them on pieces of card, that they
                    may be preserved, and rendered easier of inspection. When neighbouring species
                    are thus brought together, they can be easily examined with a lens.</p>
                <p>About the end of the sixteenth century, many individuals began to form
                    collections of testaceous bodies. The first museum of this kind, of any
                    consequence, was begun by Benedict Ceruto, and afterwards augmented by
                    Calceolari. An account of the specimens contained in it was published by Olivi,
                    in 1585, and, in 1622, Chiocco published plates of the shells. After this
                    period, in proportion as collections of testaceous bodies became numerous,
                    various works on shells made their appearance. These were not published for any
                    scientific object, but merely to teach collectors the names of the different
                    specimens in their museums. As works of this sort, we may mention the <hi
                    rend="italic">Historia Naturalis</hi> of Johnston; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gazophylacium Naturae</hi> of Petiver; <hi rend="italic">theAmboin-she
                    Fariteitkamer</hi> of Rumphius; and the <hi rend="italic">Wondertoonel</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">der</hi><hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> of Vincent. To this list we
                    might add many modern works, which are termed Systems of Conchology.</p>
                <p>From the labours of this class of conchologists the science has derived many
                    important advantages. A taste for the study has been widely extended; the shells
                    of distant countries and shores have been brought together; and numerous
                    engravings of these bodies have been published. In this manner the labours of
                    the man of science have been greatly facilitated, and our knowledge of nature
                    enlarged.</p>
                <p>The formation of a collection of shells is absolutely necessary to the successful
                    prosecution of the science of conchology. To accomplish this, much care and
                    attention are requisite. Shells must be sought for in their natural situations,
                    and obtained, if possible, with the animal alive. After the animal has remained
                    dead in the shell for any length of time, it loses its lustre and transparency,
                    and becomes less valuable, either as an object of beauty or curiosity. Hence the
                    collector must explore the sea-coast, the land, and the fresh water, in search
                    of the testaceous animals which they support, for the purpose of obtaining in a
                    perfect state their calcareous coverings.</p>
                <p>The sea contains more species of shells than either the land or the fresh waters,
                    and presents to the conchologist an extensive field for observation. Many
                    species of marine shells frequent the sea-shore, adhere to rocks, stones, or sea
                    weed, or lodge in the clay or sand. These are termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >Littoral</hi> shells, and are seldom found in deep water. The littoral shells
                    are easily collected at ebb tide. Those which burrow in the mud or sand may be
                    detected by a small depression which they leave on the surface as they retire
                    below it. Other shells live in deeper water. To collect these the dredge must be
                    employed; and if the shells be put into sea water after they are brought up, the
                    animals may afterwards be examined with ease. Such collectors as have not the
                    advantage of a dredge, should examine the refuse of fishing boats, and traverse
                    the sea shore, and search the rejectamenta, especially after a storm of wind.
                    The roots of the larger <hi rend="italic">Fuci,</hi> especially <hi
                    rend="italic">F.</hi><hi rend="italic">digitatus,</hi> which grows sometimes in
                    four or five fathoms water, frequently contain a treasure of the rarer
                    shells.</p>
                <p>During the ebb of stream tides, the conchologist ought to be very diligent. The
                    rocks are then uncovered, and under the projecting ledges of the strata he will
                    find many species of shells in very perfect state.</p>
                <p>In rocky shores it will prove a useful employment to turn over the stones which
                    are scattered in the pools, near low water, and on the under side of these he
                    will find a rich harvest of Chitons and Cingulae.</p>
                <p>In the tufts of <hi rend="italic">Corallina officinalis,</hi> a number of the
                    smaller shells are found concealed, likewise among the smaller Fuci and
                    Confervae. When these bodies are brought from the shore, and put into a glass of
                    sea water, the smaller shells will soon be perceived by their motions.</p>
                <p>When vessels which have been long at sea come into dock to be cleaned, their
                    bottoms are often covered with shells, and with sea-weed, containing numerous
                    rare vermes. To such situations the conchologist should resort; and in these he
                    will often be successful in finding the objects of his pursuit. In illustration
                    of this remark, we may mention the circumstance of the vessel employed at the
                    Bell Rock as a floating light, having had her bottom covered with mussels three
                    inches and a half in length, and upwards of one inch in breadth, although she
                    had only been afloat three years and seven months. She was moored the 11 th July
                    1807, and removed the 1lth February 1811. Previous to being moored, she was
                    completely caulked and pitched. The sand on the shore likewise yields many of
                    the smaller species of shells, and should be carefully examined with the
                    microscope.</p>
                <p>When sea shells are obtained, they should be plunged into boiling water, to
                    facilitate the extraction of the animal, and afterwards soaked in it for some
                    time to remove the salt. They should then be cleaned with a brush, and all
                    extraneous matter removed. When the shells are not soaked in fresh water, the
                    salt remaining soon attracts moisture, which speedily destroys the ligaments and
                    epidermis.</p>
                <p>The land shells are more within the reach of the scientific collector. To obtain
                    these, he has only to examine the crevices of rocks, the trunks of trees,
                    decayed wood, moss, and brushwood. In summer, after a shower, the land shells
                    are most easily procured. The animals come forth to feed on the moistened blade,
                    and at that time, from their motion, may be very readily perceived.</p>
                <p>The land shells are very easily preserved. Almost all that is required is the
                    extraction of the animal.</p>
                <p>The fresh water shells, though less difficult to procure than the sea shells,
                    require more trouble than the land shells. A <pb break="no" facs="nls:193824097"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-4097-0376"/> piece of gauze spread over a ring attached to the
                    end of a staff, forms a very convenient net for fishing fresh water shells. By
                    means of this net in the drought of summer, almost all the different species of
                    fresh water shells may be obtained with ease.</p>
                <p>The fresh water shells are frequently covered over with slime or mud, which must
                    be removed by a brush; and the animal may be extracted after the shell has been
                    plunged in boiling water.</p>
                <p>Before closing our remarks on the important group of animals to which we have
                    been directing the attention of the reader, we shall dedicate a few paragraphs
                    to a brief notice respecting <hi rend="smallcaps">Fossil Shells.</hi></p>
                <p>Besides the shells which are found on the land and in our lakes, rivers and seas,
                    and termed <hi rend="smallcaps">Recent Shells,</hi> there are relics of many
                    species found in our marl pits and limestone rocks, always somewhat altered, and
                    which are denominated <hi rend="smallcaps">FossilShells.</hi> While the shells
                    of the former class have been eagerly sought after, few conchologists, previous
                    to the beginning of the present century, directed their attention to the
                    condition and distribution of the fossil species. Nearly six hundred species of
                    recent shells have been described as natives of Britain, while the fossil
                    species furnished by the strata of the different formations, and which have been
                    accurately described, fall greatly short of that number. There is, however,
                    reason to believe that the fossil species are even more numerous than the
                    reefent ones.</p>
                <p>It would have been a plfeasant task for us to have entered into the details of
                    this most important subject, but our limits permit us only to trace its
                    outlines. Our remarks, however, we trust, will prove useful to those who are
                    entering this fruitful field of investigation, and will embrace some
                    observations on the systematic characters, condition, situation, and
                    distribution of these organic remains.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Systematical History of Fossil Shells.</hi> —The
                    determination of the characters of fossil shells is attended with no
                    inconsiderable amount of difficulty. The changes which they have undergone, and
                    their union, in many cases, with the substance of the rock, having become
                    incorporated with it, prevent us from ascertaining, with any degree of accuracy,
                    the peculiar marks by which the species can be characterised. No trace of the
                    animal remains to aid us in the investigation, so that all our distinctions must
                    depend upon the characters furnished by the shell. This circumstance should
                    prevent us from placing much confidence on the conclusions which have been drawn
                    with respect to the resemblance between fossil species, and those which still
                    exist in a living state»</p>
                <p>The difficulty of determining the fossil species, and the reluctance to form new
                    genera, rendered the descriptions of the older writers nearly unintelligible,
                    although their figures are still useful to refer to. Lamark, aware of the
                    imperfection of the characters of the genera of recent shells, as connected with
                    this subject, and possessing a rich cabinet of the fossil species found in the
                    neighbourhood of Paris, devoted much timé to the illustration of this subject,
                    and with great success, as his various papers published in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">du Museum,</hi> abundantly testify. In this
                    country, Parkinson, in his work entitled <hi rend="italic">Organic Remains of a
                    Former World,</hi> has added Some important illustrations of the genera of
                    Lamark, and has given some good descriptions of the species found in our rocks.
                    Mr. Sowerby, in his <hi rend="italic">Mineral Conchology,</hi> (published in
                    numbers), has given excellent figures of the British fossil shells; but we
                    regret to add, that he has displayed too great anxiety to constitute species;
                    and that the rocks in which they are found imbed-ed are but imperfectly
                    characterised. But as the figures are well executed, they will prove highly
                    useful to the British mineralogist, by enabling him to refer to them with
                    confidence, and to give names to those species which he meets with in the course
                    of his investigations*</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chemical Hístory of Fossil Shells^·</hi> When we consider
                    the elements of which shells are composed, and the nature of their combination,
                    we might be ready to expect that fossil shells would differ but little in
                    structure from recent species. But the case is widely different. In many
                    instances the confused foliaceous structure which prevailed in the recent shell,
                    has given place to a new arrangement of the particles, and the fossil shell
                    exhibits a foliated crystalline structure. Here solution and precipitation have
                    taken place in the same spot, or the results have been effected by the slow
                    operation of the corpuscular forces. In some cases the calcareous matter of the
                    shell has become impregnated with foreign ingredients, or has totally
                    disappeared, leaving in its place ferruginous or siliceous depositions. But the
                    most curious circumstance in the chemical history of these fossils, is the
                    preservation of the animal matter of the shell in its original form and order of
                    arrangement, even when the calcareous matter of the shell has been changed into
                    compact or granular limestone. This very important fact we owe to the ingenuity
                    of Mr. Parkinson, who, by treating the shell for a length of time with greatly
                    diluted acid, abstracted the calcareous matter, and obtained a distinct view of
                    the cartilaginous membranes of the shell. The student will in general observe,
                    that the cavities of those shells, which present an external opening, are filled
                    with the same sort of matter as the rock in which they are enclosed, while the
                    cavities, of the multilocular testacea, for example, which have no external
                    communication, are filled with matter invariably of a crystalline structure,
                    even when not different from the substance of the tock.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Geognostic History of Fossil Shells.—</hi> It appears
                    evident that the advancement of this branch of conchology must, in a great
                    measure, depend on the accurate discrimination of the fossil species, and the
                    relations of the rocks in which they are contained. It is only within the last
                    twenty years, therefore, that our knowledge of this branch of the subject has
                    been acquired. The members of the Wernerian and geological societies have
                    contributed largely to our stock of knowledge: but much yet remains to be
                    brought to light. The following notices may be regarded as embracing the
                    principal facts which have been ascertained.</p>
                <p>In those ancient strata upon which all the others are incumbent, and which are
                    called <hi rend="italic">primitive,</hi> no remains of shells, or other relics
                    of organized bodies, have hitherto been detected. These rocks are therefore
                    supposed to have received their arrangement previous to the creation of animals
                    and vegetables, or to have beeħ so much altered as to have all traces of
                    organisms obliterated if such existed. In that group of rocks which rests upon
                    the primitive strata, and to which mineralogists give the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">transition,</hi> fossil shells, as well as the remains of
                    vegetables, have been observed. The shells exhibit such striking peculiarities
                    of form, and bear so remote a resemblance to the recent kinds, that they are
                    considered as the remains of species which do not now exist in a living state on
                    the globe. They are much changed in their texture, and in general intimately
                    united with the contents of the stratum. They are chiefly found in the beds of
                    limestone, sometimes also in the greywacke and clay slate. In the numerous and
                    ill-characterised series of strata which are incumbent on the transition class,
                    and to which some mineralogists attach the term <hi rend="italic">floetz,</hi>
                    the remains of shells are much more numerous. In the older members ¢f this
                    class, such as the red sandstone and independent coal formations, the shells,
                    though in a few instances different in form from those of the preceding class,
                    appear to have belonged to one epoch. They are dissimilar to the recent species,
                    and no longer exist in a living state. In the newer members of this class, such
                    as the gypsum and chalk rocks, the species, in some examples,bear amuch closer
                    resemblance to theexist-ing races, and several species cannot be distinguished,
                    it is alleged, from them, by any satisfactory charact ers furnished by <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193824110" xml:id="kp-eb0715-4110-0377"/> the shell. The
                    fossil species found in the rocks of the older members of the class are greatly
                    altered in their texture, and, in many cases, intimately united with the
                    substance of the beds; the shells belonging to the newer members are much less
                    altered in their form and texture, separate more readily from the surrounding
                    rocks, and appear like recent shells somewhat weathered. The shells are found in
                    nearly all the different kinds of rock, but are more numerous in the calcareous
                    strata. In the <hi rend="italic">recent</hi> or superficial strata, fossil
                    shells are frequently to be met withThe species which here present themselves
                    bear so close a resemblance to the existing kinds, that conchologists are
                    disposed to consider them as the relics of animals which still exist. In many
                    cases, the prototypes may be found on the neighbouring shore or lake, but in
                    other instances they must be sought for at a greater distance. These shells are
                    found in beds of gravel and sand, and likewise in great abundance in shell
                    marl.</p>
                <p>It appears, then, that the shells in the older strata differ specifically from
                    those which the newer strata contain; and that they have belonged to molluscous
                    animals, which no longer exist in a living state on this globe; that, in the
                    newer strata, the fossil shells bear a closer resemblance to existing species;
                    and that in the last formed strata, remains of species actually existing are to
                    be met with.</p>
                <p>In this geological distribution of the remains of testaceous animals we may
                    likewise perceive that, in the older strata, the inequivalved shells are more
                    numerous than the other kinds; and that the canaliculated univalves are seldom,
                    if ever, to be met with in the transition or older members of the Floetz series,
                    but that they become more numerous in the newer members of the Floetz rocks, and
                    in the alluvial strata. Circumstances of this kind have induced geologists to
                    conclude that different formations could be discriminated by the petrifactions
                    which they contain. From the difficulty of distinguishing the fossil species,
                    however, joined with our ignorance of their geographical distribution, some
                    mineralogists have not permitted their conclusions to be much influenced by this
                    rule.</p>
                <p>It will likewise be observed, that the shells in the newer strata are but little
                    changed, whilst those in the older rocks are greatly altered in their texture,
                    and in part obliterated. The same power which rendered the rock compact or
                    crystalline, has likewise exerted its influence on the imbedded remains. In the
                    newest strata, this power has scarcely begun to operate; so that the imbedded
                    shells still retain in perfection their original characters.</p>
                <p>In examining a limestone quarry, for example, the student will perhaps be
                    surprised to find petrifactions of shells in the bed of limestone, while, in the
                    sandstone covering, he witnesses impressions of plants unaccompanied with
                    shells. In order to gain more correct ideas on this subject, let him repair to a
                    marl bog, and he will there find the bed of marl abounding in shells, while in
                    the bed of sand below, on which it rests, or of peat moss, which covers it, he
                    will find exclusively the remains of vegetables. Here let him study the subject,
                    while the strata are yet recent, and while lapidification is only commencing.
                    There is, however, this difference between the shells in the marl and those in
                    the limestone, that individuals of the former species still exist, while no
                    living examples of the latter are known.</p>
                <p>Geographical History of Fossil Shells As the geographical distribution of recent
                    shells is a branch of conchology to which few have devoted their attention, and
                    about which very little is known, we can scarcely expect to find the
                    geographical distribution of the fossil species more fully illustrated. We know,
                    with regard to the recent shells, that some species which are found in the bays
                    of Norway and Greenland occur also on the shores of the Mediterranean, and that
                    the British Isles have several species in common with Africa and the West
                    Indies. Still we know not, with any degree of accuracy, the geographical range
                    of any one species. Geologists ought, therefore, to exercise a great degree of
                    caution in drawing conclusions concerning the original situation of those shells
                    which they find in a fossil state. When a fossil shell is discovered in the
                    strata of this country, which bears a close resemblance to the recent shells of
                    distant seas; many inquirers, without waiting until they have established the
                    identity of the species, and without any precise information with regard to the
                    geographical distribution of that species, conclude that this fossil shell must
                    have been brought from these distant seas, and conveyed to its present situation
                    by some mighty torrent. Instances of this mode of reasoning could easily be
                    pointed out in the writings of British and Continental mineralogists.</p>
                <p>In every country there are particular animals and vegetables, which indicate, by
                    their mode of growth and rapid increase, a peculiar adaptation to the soil and
                    climate of that district. Hence we find a remarkable difference in the animals
                    and plants of different countries. Many shell-fish have indeed a very wide range
                    of latitude, through which they may be observed; but we know, that the same
                    molluscous animals which are natives of Britain, are not found, as a whole, as
                    natives of Spain, while the molluscous animals of Africa differ from both. If
                    the same arrangement of the molluscous animals always prevailed in the different
                    stages of their existence, then we may expect to find the fossil shells of one
                    country differing as much from those of another, as the recent kinds are known
                    to do, so that every country will have its <hi rend="italic">fossil,</hi> as
                    well as its <hi rend="italic">recent</hi> testacea. Few observations
                    illustrative of this branch of the subject have hitherto been published.</p>
                <p>It has often been remarked, that the fossil shells (and the relics of other
                    animals and plants) found in the strata of this country, are very different in
                    their appearance from those shells of the mollusea which at present exist in the
                    country, but that they bear a close resemblance to the existing species of the
                    equatorial regions. This very important observation has led some to conclude,
                    that the mollusea which lived in this country at the period of the formation of
                    the strata in which they are now enclosed, were influenced by different physical
                    circumstances, from those by which the forms of the recent kinds are regulated;
                    while others have imagined that those shells once lived in the equatorial
                    regions, and that a mighty deluge transported them to their present situation.
                    This last conclusion can never be admitted by those who have witnessed the
                    perfect preservation of the different parts of fossil shells, their valves,
                    spires, protuberances, and delicate spines, still unbroken. Though these species
                    no longer exist in a living state in this country, nor on the globe, we must
                    admit the conclusion of Werncr, with regard to fossil plants, that they lived
                    and died in the country where their relics are now found.</p>
                <p>It would form a very curious subject of inquiry to ascertain the character of
                    those fossil shells which are found in the strata near the equator. If they
                    likewise differ from the recent species of those seas, and if, in appearance,
                    they resemble or differ from the productions of arctic regions, we might then
                    speculate, with more success, upon those mighty revolutions which have taken
                    place on the earth’s surface, and trace in the miner al*kingdom the proofs of
                    those changes which animals and vegetables have experienced. In the meantime, we
                    would recommend the examination of the laws which regulate the physical and
                    geographical distribution of recent shells and molluscous animals, as the most
                    suitable preparation for investigating the condition of those extinct races, the
                    memorials of which are preserved in strata, differing from one another in
                    structure, in position, and in composition.</p>
