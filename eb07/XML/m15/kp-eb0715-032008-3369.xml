                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">MOLDAVIA</label>, a principality nominally under the Turkish
                    government. It was the ancient Transalpine Dacia, and received the name it now
                    bears in the fourteenth century, from the principal river which drains it. It
                    extends in east longitude from 25. 13. to 28. 26., and in north latitude from
                    45. 24. to 48. 17., occupying 17,017 square miles. It is bounded on the north
                    and the east by the Russian province of Podolia, from which it is divided by the
                    river Pruth, and in part by the Danube; on the south by Wallachia, and on the
                    south and west by the Austrian provinces of Transylvania and Gallicia. Its great
                    divisionsare into Upper and Lower Moldavia, the former being subdivided into
                    four, and the latter into nine circles. It is difficult to determine the precise
                    amount of the population; some authorities state it as low as 300,000, and
                    others, especially Camperhausen, make it to be near 600,000, since a part of the
                    country has been transferred to Russia. The people are mostly of the Wallachian
                    race, but there are intermixed with them many Greeks, Armenians, Jews, gipsy
                    slaves, and Hungarians. The prevailing religion is that of the Greek church,
                    which has an archbishop, threebishops, 87 monasteries, and 931 churches. The
                    Catholics do not exceed 12,000, and have 13 churches, forming a part of the
                    diocese of Nicooli. There is a seminary for education at the capital, Jassy, but
                    very little attention is paid to the instruction of the mass of the people. The
                    government is conducted by a delegate from Turkey, called a waiwode, who
                    purchases the office. He must be a Greek; and, after being installed, he has a
                    most unlimited degree of power, by the exercise of which he seeks to reimburse
                    himself for the price of his purchase. This viceroy, as well as his wife, is
                    considered as of princely rank, and maintains a court and army; but he is
                    subject to sudden recall, and to heavy payments, at the will of the capricious
                    or greedy cabinet of Constantinople. There is scarcely any written law; but what
                    is by courtesy called justice is administered by the divan, of which the
                    Archbishop of Jassy is president, and the other members are the several higher
                    public functionaries<pb break="no" facs="nls:193823382"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-3382-0321"/>. In each circle there is an inferior court, from
                    which appeals can be made to the divan. The waiwode has a body-guard of 400 men,
                    and a force of 3000 military, chiefly Arnaut Greeks, who are regularly
                    trained.</p>
                <p>The Carpathian Mountains, on the western frontier, send out spurs, which
                    gradually diminish in height as they approach the eastern side, and present the
                    appearance of a beautifully undulating country. The soil is stony on the east,
                    but gradually improves in fertility as it approaches the rivers; and the greater
                    part is abundantly productive, amply rewarding the labour which is applied to
                    it, notwithstanding the excessive heat of the summers, and the intense cold of
                    the winters. The corn is excellent, especially the summer or hard wheat. The
                    wine is good, and produced in abundance. Excellent cattle are fattened in the
                    meadows; and good flax, hemp, hone; <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>, wax, and all
                    kinds of fruits, are most abundant. There is little of trade or manufactures, as
                    each family produces and consumes the necessaries of life in filth and idleness,
                    and seems to require none of the gratifications of civilized man, whilst they
                    indulge all the lower passions of our nature with little moral restraint.</p>

                    work formed of large stones laid in the sea by means of coffer-dams, extended
                    either in a right line or an arc of a circle, before a port, which it serves to
                    close; to defend the vessels in port from the impetuosity of the waves, and to
                    prevent the passage of ships without leave. It is frequently fortified.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mole</hi> is also sometimes used to signify the harbour
                    itself, which it serves to form and defend.</p>

                    tower on a square base, insulated, encompassed with columns, and covered with a
                    dome. The mole of the Emperor Hadrian, now the castle of St Angelo, was the
                    greatest and most stately of all the moles. It was crowned with a brazen
                    pine-apple, in which was a golden urn containing the ashes of the emperor.</p>
