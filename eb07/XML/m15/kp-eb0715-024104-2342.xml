                <p>I.—ANCIENT MINES.</p>
                <p>Scripture ascribes the discovery of brass (or copper) and iron, at least that of
                    the methods of working them, to Tubal Cain, who lived before the Flood. But ere
                    these metals could have been subjected to the skill of the antediluvian
                    artificer, the metalliferous ore must have been extracted from the earth, and
                    subjected to some metallurgic process, however rude; in other words, the
                    invention ascribed to Tubal Cain implies the previous existence of mines and
                    mining. This, however, has occasioned some perplexity, and produced considerable
                    speculation as to the causes, whether accidental or other, which led to the
                    discovery of mines. The method of discovering these is still a matter of so much
                    difficulty, that it cannot but appear surprising, how men totally unacquainted
                    with the nature of metals should first have come to think of digging them out of
                    the earth in the shape of ore, and then applying heat to disengage them from the
                    extraneous matter with which they have almost always been found combined.</p>
                <p>According to the prevailing opinion of the ancients, this discovery was made by
                    accident. Lucretius describes it as the result of the burning of woods or
                    forests, which, melting the veins of metals in the earth over which the
                    conflagration passed, revealed to men the existence of substances previously
                    unknown, and also indicated the method by which these might be converted into a
                    state capable of being applied to useful purposes. Aristotle, who is of the same
                    opinion with Lucretius, informs us, that some shepherds of Spain set fire to the
                    woods, in consequence of which the earth became heated to such a degree by the
                    flames that the silver near the surface melted and flowed into a mass, which was
                    afterwards discovered in a fissure occasioned by an earthquake. The same story
                    is told by Strabo, who ascribes to this accident the discovery of the silver
                    mines of Andalusia. Cadmus, who first introduced letters into Greece, is said to
                    have been also the original discoverer of gold; but this has been contested by
                    some mythologists, who attribute the honour of the discovery to various other
                    fabulous personages; as Thoas of Thrace, Mercury the son of Jupiter, and Pisus a
                    king of Italy, who, having left his native country, and gone into Egypt, was
                    elected king of the latter after the death of Mizraim, and, on account of this
                    alleged discovery, was denominated the Golden God. The discovery, not only of
                    gold, but also of all the other metals, is by Aeschylus attributed to
                    Prometheus, whose story, clouded as it is by fable and romance, seems to
                    countenance such a supposition. The copper mines of Cyprus were originally
                    discovered by Cinyra the son of Agryopa; and Hesiod ascribes to the Dactyli
                    Idaei the discovery of the iron mines of Crete, the modern Candia. According to
                    several ancient authors, the invention of the method of extracting tin from its
                    ore was made by Medacritus, in the islands of the Cassiterides, and by him
                    communicated to the natives. It is highly probable, indeed, that these and all
                    other similar <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822355" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2355-0242"/>
                    discoveries or inventions were the result of accident rather than of research or
                    investigation. Chance disclosed the hidden treasure, and a happy thought enabled
                    some shrewd observer to turn the casual disclosure to account. Even in modern
                    times, we know that many mines have been discovered in this manner; as, for
                    example, in sea-cliffs rent by the violence of the waves, amongst broken and
                    craggy rocks, by the washing of the tide or by floods, by torrents of water
                    issuing from hills or mountains, by the wearing down of roads, and sometimes by
                    volcanic eruptions. The ingenuity of man consists in taking advantage of those
                    occasions when either nature or fortune puts it in his power to extend his
                    knowledge, or to add to his wealth and comfort.</p>
                <p>Our information respecting ancient mines is, we regret to say, extremely scanty
                    and imperfect. The subject has not been specially treated of by any ancient
                    writer with whose works we are acquainted; and the detached notices which occur
                    in the classical authors have not received that anxious and critical examination
                    which is indispensably requisite in order to arrive at just and accurate
                    conclusions. To the general truth of this remark, however, there is one
                    distinguished exception, in Boeckh’s <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on the
                    Silver Mines of Laurion,</hi> appended to his very learned and interesting work
                    on the <hi rend="italic">Public Economy of Athens.</hi> In a short compass, all
                    that can be gleaned from the ancient authors has been carefully brought
                    together, and treated with a degree of critical ability which has enabled the
                    author to throw much new light upon a subject that had almost entirely escaped
                    the researches of preceding inquirers.</p>
                <p>The mines (μέταλλα) belonging to the state of Athens were partly native and
                    partly foreign. But the most considerable were the silver mines of Laιιrion,
                    from which the nation derived no ordinary advantages, since, by the resources
                    which they supplied, Themistocles first raised the naval power of Athens to a
                    state of consequence and efficiency. These mines extended from coast to coast,
                    in a line of about seven English miles, from Anaphlystus to Thoricus∙ The
                    working of them had been commenced at an early period, and appears to have been
                    very profitable in the time of Themistocles; but they became less productive in
                    the age of Socrates and Xenophon, and before that of Strabo they had been so
                    entirely exhausted, that all further mining was discontinued. The ores extracted
                    contained silver and lead, with zinc, and probably copper, but no gold, or at
                    least not enough to allow the ancients, with their imperfect processes of
                    separation, to disengage it with profit. At Thoricus spurious emeralds occurred
                    in combination with the ore; cinnabar was also found there, and occasionally a
                    substance which afterwards came to be much prized in dyeing. The mines were
                    worked by means of shafts and adits, and whole masses were removed, so that
                    supports alone were left standing. The processes of fusion carried on in the
                    furnaces appear to have been the same as those employed in the other mines which
                    were worked in ancient times. The state was the sole proprietor of the mines;
                    but they were never worked at the public expense; nor did the state ever let
                    them for a term of years, like other landed property. They were always granted
                    to private individuals in fee-farm; and these leases were transferred from one
                    person to another by inheritance, sale, and other kinds of legal conveyance. The
                    sale of the mines, or rather of the right of working them, was managed by the
                    poletae; and this right was purchased at an appointed price; in addition to
                    which the possessor paid the twenty-fourth part of the net produce as a
                    perpetual tax. The purchase-money was paid directly to the state, but the
                    contingent rents were very probably let to a farmer-general. The amount of the
                    money obtained from both sources necessarily depended upon a variety of
                    circumstances, such as the number of mines let in the course of the year, the
                    comparative richness or poverty of the veins worked, and the degree of activity
                    with which the business of mining was carried on. When Themistocles proposed to
                    the Athenians to apply the funds obtained from the mines to the building of
                    ships, instead of dividing it as before amongst, the people, the annual receipts
                    appear to have amounted to thirty or forty talents, although the accounts
                    relating to this point are extremely indistinct and uncertain.</p>
                <p>Citizens and isoteles were alone entitled to the possession of the mines. The
                    number of the possessors was evidently considerable, and, like the
                    agriculturists, they were considered as a separate class of producers; sometimes
                    they possessed several shares, sometimes they had only one. The common price of
                    a single share was rather more than a talent; and occasionally several partners
                    occur as the joint possessors of a mine. The manual labour was performed by
                    slaves either belonging to the possessors of the mines or hired from others; but
                    although the cheapness of their labour diminished the expenses of mining, the
                    improvements of art in facilitating or abridging the processes of labour were
                    necessarily retarded., The security of this species of possession was guaranteed
                    by severe laws, and the rights of the state were strictly maintained. 1here was
                    a mining law (μεταλλ∕κoς <hi rend="italic">νομοςf</hi> and a particular course
                    of legal proceedings in cases relating to mines <hi rend="italic">{δι∙ και
                    μετaλλικαι'),</hi> which, for the greater encouragement of the proprietors of
                    mines, were in the time of Demosthenes annexed to the monthly suits. The mines
                    were also free from property taxes, and did not subject the possessor to the
                    performance of liturgies, nor were they transferred in the exchange <hi
                    rend="italic">(αντιδοσις)</hi> of property; immunities which did not arise from
                    any wish to encourage the working of the mines, but were founded solely upon the
                    particular nature of the tenure by which they were held. They were considered as
                    public property let to usufructuary possessors in consideration of a fixed rate
                    of payment, like the duties paid by the farmers; and no property, except such as
                    was freehold, and exempted from rent or duty of any kind, subjected the holder
                    to liturgies and property taxes.</p>
                <p>That Athens usurped the possession of the mines belonging to her subject allies,
                    cannot be assumed in conformity with the general system of her foreign policy;
                    and we must suppose that these everywhere remained the property of the persons
                    to whom they had belonged previously to the dominion of Athens. The mines of
                    Thrace, however, appear to have formed an exception, and to have been
                    immediately dependent upon Athens; indeed it is probable that they were let in
                    the same manner as the Athenian mines, although we have no certain information
                    on this point. The Thracian gold mines had been first worked by the Phoenicians,
                    along with the mines of Thasos; and afterwards they were carried on by the
                    Thasians of Paros. The gold mines of Scapte Hyle upon the mainland brought to
                    the state of Thasos an annual revenue of eighty talents; those of Thasos were
                    less productive, though notwithstanding they yielded a large sum. When the
                    Athenians had established themselves in Thrace, they entered into a contest with
                    the Thasians for the possession of the mines and harbours of the mainland; Cimon
                    captured thirty-three ships in a naval engagement, besieged and reduced Thasos,
                    and thus obtained for his country the coast, together with the gold mines.
                    Scapte Hyle, and other cities of the mainland, were likewise conquered by the
                    Athenians; but Boeckh conjectures that the gold mines were partly granted to the
                    Athenians in fee-farm, whilst those of the ancient possessors remained in
                    undisturbed occupation. If as many of the names of proprietors of the Thracian
                    as of the Laurion mines had been preserved, we should have been able to speak
                    with more certainty on this point; but the utmost extent of our knowledge is,
                    that Thucydides possessed gold <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822368"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-2368-0243"/> mines in Thrace; and with regard to him it is
                    doubtful in what manner he acquired such a property, the account most deserving
                    of credit being that he obtained them by marriage with a lady of Scapte Hyle,
                    whose predecessors had perhaps been long in possession of them.<note

                <p>Of all the metals, copper is that which is most frequently found pure in the ore;
                    and for this reason probably it was also the first amongst them all that was
                    wrought. This appears to have been the case in ancient Rome, where at first
                    there was no coined money <hi rend="italic">{pecunia signata),</hi> commodities
                    being either exchanged by barter, or for a certain weight of uncoined brass <hi
                    rend="italic">(aes rude),</hi> used as a measure of value. To avoid singularity
                    of expression, we use the word “brass” for what in reality was bronze, or copper
                    rendered fusible by an admixture of zinc or of tin; a metal which was in general
                    use, because masses of it were so easily transformed by fusion that nobody
                    incurred loss by the process. The copper mines of Tuscany, especially in the
                    country about Volterra, although now perhaps exhausted, appear to have been at
                    one time immensely productive; and to this must be added the produce of the
                    mines in Cyprus, now ascertained to have been enormous, and the influx of which
                    into Italy is attested by the Latin name of’copper <hi rend="italic"
                    >{cuprum).</hi> The dependence of that island upon the Phoenicians in very
                    remote times opened a way for this metal to the Punic markets; and Carthaginian
                    vessels must have brought it into Italy. The low price consequent upon such
                    plenty agrees with every thing that is known concerning the quantity of brass
                    money, and its value in the times anterior to the introduction of silver money,
                    which took place about the commencement of the first Punic war. In fact, it was
                    long a remarkable and distinguishing peculiarity of the nations inhabiting the
                    middle of Italy, that they employed copper or bronze in heavy masses, and not
                    silver; whereas in the southern provinces, and along the coast as far as
                    Campania, silver money was usually employed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Anciently Spain yielded an abundant supply of the precious metals, which her
                    quicksilver served to refine. The Asturias, Galicia, and Lusitania, yielded,
                    according to Pliny, twenty thousand pounds of gold annually. Silver was found in
                    still greater quantities, and of the very best quality. “Argentum reperitur

                    and the Romans appear to have derived immense supplies. It is even said that the
                    single mine of Belbel yielded Hannibal three hundred pounds a day; and we
                    further learn, that after Spain had been reduced to complete subjection by the
                    Romans, these proud conquerors drew from it upwards of an hundred and ten
                    thousand pounds of silver in the space of nine years, or at the rate of about
                    twelve thousand four hundred pounds annually. Strabo also informs ns, that
                    neither gold, silver, copper, nor iron, were found in such quantities, or so
                    excellent in quality, in any part of the known world, as in Turdetania.<note

                <p>These notices of the ancient mines are no doubt scanty and meagre; but the want
                    of precise information upon this subject, which is only adverted to in the most
                    cursory manner by the ancient writers, renders it impossible to give any more
                    ample or satisfactory account, either of the localities of the mines, the
                    methods employed in working them, or the processes, rude enough no doubt, by
                    which the metal was separated from the ore. Such being the case, we shall
                    therefore take leave of this part of the subject, and proceed to give as ample
                    details as our limits will admit, of the mines presently worked in Great Britain
                    and Ireland, upon the continent of Europe, in the republic of Mexico and in the
                    different states of South America.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> 11</hi> ∙—BRITISH MINES.</p>
                <p>The mineral riches of Great Britain are immense, and, in some respects, superior
                    to those of any other country. If it cannot boast of gold and silver mines,
                    which are sometimes found in the poorest countries, it possesses a species of
                    mineral wealth which is of still more importance to a manufacturing nation. It
                    commands an inexhaustible supply of excellent coal, which is extensively
                    diffused; its tin mines are the most productive of any in Europe; it has also
                    very valuable mines of copper, lead, manganese, and other substances; and its
                    salt springs, and strata of fossil salt, are alone sufficient to supply the
                    whole world for an indefinite period. 1he most valuable minerals are situated in
                    the western and northern parts of England, and in the southern and middle parts
                    of Scotland. But the English mines are by far the most important, as will appear
                    from subsequent details. In the meanwhile we shall commence our notices of the
                    different minerals with that of coal.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Coal Mines.</hi></p>
                <p>It is scarcely possible to exaggerate the advantages which England derives from
                    her immense beds of coal. In this climate fuel ranks amongst the principal
                    necessaries of life; without an abundant supply of it the country would be
                    uninhabitable; and it is to the coal mines that we are indebted for a
                    sufficiency of this indispensable article at a cheap rate. Nor is the advantage
                    here stated the only one which we derive from these mines. They are the
                    principal source of our manufacturing and commercial prosperity; and their
                    products constitute the <hi rend="italic">materia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >prima</hi> of our superiority in all the more extensive and important
                    departments of industry. Since the invention of the steam-engine, coal has
                    become of the highest importance as the means of generating the moving power;
                    and no nation, if scantily supplied with this mineral, however favourably it may
                    be circumstanced in other respects, can ever expect to rival those which are so,
                    in most branches of manufacturing industry. To what else are we to ascribe the
                    astonishing increase of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, in England,
                    not to mention Glasgow and Paisley in Scotland, and the comparatively stationary
                    or declining state of Canterbury, Winchester, Salisbury, and other towns, except
                    to the abundance and cheapness of coal in the north, and its scarcity, and
                    consequent high price, in the south? The citizens of Manchester, Glasgow, and
                    the other places similarly circumstanced, are enabled, at a comparatively small
                    expense, to put in motion the most powerful and complicated machinery, and to
                    produce results which are altogether beyond the reach of those who do not
                    possess the same command of this mineral. Coal has been happily defined “hoarded
                    labour ;” and it might, with equal justice, be denominated concentrated power.
                    By means of it our manufacturers are supplied with a power of easy control yet
                    of boundless energy, and are enabled to overcome difficulties insurmountable by
                    those who happen to be less liberally supplied with this truly invaluable
                    mineral.</p>
                <p>It is uncertain when coal began to be first used as fuel, although, as early as
                    the year 1281, Newcastle seems to have had some trade in this article. In the
                    reign of Edward I. its <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822381"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-2381-0244"/> use was prohibited in London, on account of the
                    smoke, which was supposed to be injurious; and afterwards this prohibition was
                    renewed at different periods, but without any effect. But experience proved that
                    the smoke was not deleterious; the growing scarcity of timber, and the
                    superiority of coal as an article of fuel, secured its ascendency; and since the
                    reign of Charles I. it has become almost the only description of fuel which is
                    used in the capital, and in most other towns and districts of the kingdom.
                    Excepting in certain parts of Ireland and the Highlands of Scotland, where peat
                    is employed as a substitute, its use is now nearly universal.</p>
                <p>The consumption of coal in Great Britain is immense. It has been estimated at
                    15,580,000 tons annually, exclusively of exports to foreign countries; but this
                    estimate, Mr M*Culloch thinks, is greatly under the mark. According to him, the
                    consumption of Great Britain may be estimated at the rate of about a ton of coal
                    for each individual, exclusively of the consumption in iron-works and other
                    great branches of manufactures. This gives 16,500,000 tons for what may be
                    denominated general or domestic consumption; although, to be within the mark, we
                    shall take it at only 15,000,000 tons. If to this be added the quantities of
                    coal consumed in the making of iron, the cotton manufacture, the woollen, linen,
                    and silk trades, the smelting of copper ores, brass and copper manufactures,
                    salt-works and limeworks, the total annual consumption of coal in Great Britain
                    may be moderately estimated at upwards of 22,000,000 tons. Thus,</p>

                <p>If we suppose that the above quantity, in which no allowance is made for the coal
                    consumed in the manufacture of hardware and cutlery, costs the consumer at an
                    average about seven shillings a ton, then 22,700,000 tons will be worth in all
                    nearly eight millions sterling a year.</p>
                <p>The importance of coal as a necessary of life, and an indispensable auxiliary in
                    manufactures, has attracted attention to the question as to the probable
                    duration of the supply, or the period when the exhaustion of the coal mines may
                    be anticipated. But the investigations hitherto made as to the extent and depth
                    of the different coal formations, and the degree to which they are capable of
                    being worked, do not afford sufficient data for even an approximate solution of
                    this question. Vague and unsatisfactory as they are, however, these inquiries
                    leave no room for doubt that many centuries must elapse before posterity can
                    experience any serious inconvenience from a diminished supply of this mineral.
                    According to Mr Taylor, the coal fields of Durham and Northumberland are
                    adequate to furnish the present annual supply for seventeen centuries to come.
                    The extent of these coal fields he estimates at 732 square miles. But, taking
                    the workable coal strata at an average thickness of twelve feet, the contents of
                    one square mile will be 12,390,000 tons, and of 732 square miles 9,069,480,000
                    tons; or, deducting one-third part for loss by small coal, interceptions by
                    dikes, and other interruptions, 6,046,320,000 tons,—a quantity sufficient to
                    supply the present demand of 3,500,000 tons for a period of 1727 years. It is
                    evident that this estimate of the quantity of coal in Durham and Northumberland
                    can be only a rough approximation, especially as the south-eastern coal district
                    of Durham is yet almost unexplored, and there is also a considerable extent of
                    coal field in the northern and south-western districts of Northumberland, which
                    is nearly in the same situation; but it is sufficient to satisfy the public that
                    no apprehension need be entertained as to this valuable mineral being exhausted
                    for a great many generations to come. Dr Buckland, it· is true, considers Mr
                    Taylor’s estimate as greatly exaggerated; but in his examination before the
                    committee of the House of Commons, he quotes with approbation a statement in
                    Bakewell’s Geology, that the coal fields in South Wales are alone sufficient to
                    supply the whole present demand for coal in England for a period of two thousand
                    years to come.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    passage in question is as follows: “Fortunately we have in South Wales,
                    adjoining the Bristol Channel, an almost exhaustless supply of coal and
                    iron-stone, which are yet nearly unwrought. It has been stated that this coal
                    field extends over about 1200 square miles, and that there are twenty-three beds
                    of workable coal, the total average thickness of which is ninety-five feet; and
                    the quantity contained in each acre is 100,000 tons, or 65,000,000 tons per
                    square mile. If from this we deduct one half for waste, and for the minor extent
                    of the upper beds, we shall have a clear supply of coal equal to 32,000,000 tons
                    per square mile. Now, if we admit that 5,000,000 tons from Northumberland and
                    Durham mines are equal to nearly one third of the total consumption of coal in
                    England, each square mile of the Welsh coal field would yield coal for a hundred
                    years’ consumption; and as there are from 1000 to 1200 square miles in this coal
                    field, it would supply England with fuel for 200'» years, after all our English
                    coal mines are worked out.” See also Treatise on the Collieries and Coal Trade,
                    London, 1835.</p></note> Besides, in the west riding of Yorkshire, there are
                    many extensive coal fields hitherto untouched. In Staffordshire, the coal strata
                    are of immense magnitude, and the bed round Dudley is no less than thirty feet
                    thick. In the present slovenly mode of working the coal, more than two thirds is
                    left in the mine and wasted;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>BakewelΓs Geology, p. 183, 4th ed.</p></note> but were any
                    thing like a scarcity of coal apprehended, this wasteful practice would be
                    stopped, and means adopted for clearing out the contents of the mines. For all
                    practical purposes, therefore, the supply of coal may be considered as quite
                    unlimited.</p>
                <p>The coal fields of Scotland are of great extent and value, indeed sufficient of
                    themselves to furnish the whole empire with an adequate supply of this mineral
                    for a long series of years. Coal is found in several districts of Scotland, as
                    in Dumfriesshire and Roxburghshire, in the more southern counties; but the great
                    field of Scotch coal stretches from south-west to north-east across the centre
                    of the kingdom; and it is to be found in greater or smaller quantities in the
                    counties of Haddington, Edinburgh, and Linlithgow, Stirling, Clackmannan,
                    Kinross, Fife, part of Perth, Ayr, Renfrew, Lanark, Dumbarton, and part of
                    Argyle. Its average breadth is thirty-three miles, and its length upon the
                    mainland of Scotland ninety-eight miles; so that its total area is 3234 square
                    miles. If from this we deduct 360 miles for the space covered by the Frith of
                    Forth, there will remain 2874 square miles of territory, in most parts of which
                    coal is found at different depths and of various qualities, whilst in about
                    600,000 acres of the same space it maybe worked with advantage. The depth of
                    coal varies, but in general it seems to be rather nearer the surface in the
                    western than in the eastern division of the country. There is also a great
                    variety in the number of its seams or strata, as well as in their thickness. The
                    greatest thickness in the island is at Quarrelton, where five contiguous strata
                    are upwards of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822394" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2394-0245"
                    /> fifty feet thick. Seams less than eighteen inches are not deemed equivalent
                    to the expense of working them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Coal has been discovered in greater or less quantity in seventeen counties of
                    Ireland; but the quality is in general bad, and, according to Mr Wakefield,
                    “there is no vein of coal yet discovered in Ireland which can come into general
                    consumption.” Indeed, almost all the coal used in Dublin, Belfast, and other
                    towns, is imported from England and Scotland. The principal coal districts of
                    Ireland are those of Leinster, Munster, Connaught, and Ulster; the former
                    districts containing carbonaceous or stone coal, the “slaty glance” of Werner,
                    and the latter bituminous or blazing coal. The Leinster district is situated in
                    the counties of Kilkenny, Queen’s County, and Carlow, and extends a short
                    distance into that of Tipperary, being the principal site of the carbonaceous
                    coal. The Munster district occupies a very considerable part of Limerick and
                    Kerry, and a large portion of Cork; it is by much the most extensive in Ireland.
                    The Connaught district is next in importance to those of Leinster and Munster,
                    and may perhaps be found to deserve the first place, when its subterranean
                    treasures shall have been more fully explored. The coal, which is of the
                    bituminous species, seems to be particularly adapted to the purposes of
                    ironworks; and the gray pig-metal made at Arigna is reckoned to be as well
                    smelted as any in the empire. The Ulster district, which is comparatively of
                    trifling importance, commences near Dungannon, in Tyrone, and extends to Coal
                    Island and the neighbourhood of Cookstown. Besides these districts, there are
                    others of less consequence. Bituminous coal has been found near Belturbet in
                    Cavan, and Ballycastle in Antrim; but the Antrim coal district is not very
                    extensive, although the collieries have been wrought for a number of years. The
                    coal is slaty, and resembles that which is found in Ayrshire, the accompanying
                    rocks being likewise similar. These are all the coal districts of Ireland.<note

                <p>Accidents in coal mines are very frequent, and arise principally from explosions
                    of inflammable gas, but partly also from the presence of carbonic acid gas or
                    choke damp, and partly from other causes. The returns of these casualties are by
                    no means complete; yet, defective as they are, it appears from them that 2070
                    persons lost their lives in coal mines during the twenty-five years immediately
                    preceding 1835. By an explosion which took place in one of the northern coal
                    mines, more than a hundred men and boys were in a moment destroyed. In many
                    instances not one of those employed in mines where explosions have occurred has
                    survived to tell how the accident arose. Nor have the causes of these
                    explosions, and the means of obviating them, been yet subjected to the continued
                    or searching investigation of scientific men. During the eighteen years which
                    have elapsed since the introduction of Sir Humphry Davy’s safety-lamp, more
                    explosions have taken place in the northern mines than during the preceding
                    eighteen years. This, however, is ascribed not so much to the instrument having
                    disappointed the expectations of the inventor, as to the fact that, by means of
                    it, dangerous, or “fiery mines,” have been wrought, which must otherwise have
                    been long ago abandoned. But it has nevertheless been very clearly established
                    that, in certain circumstances, especially when exposed to a current of air, the
                    safetylamp is no protection at all. In working the more dangerous, or “fiery
                    mines,’’ a vigilant and continued attention is required, which can scarcely <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> be expected from ordinary workmen, and especially
                    from boys; whilst, on the other hand, the smallest neglect may produce an
                    explosion, and occasion the instant death of hundreds. At present, it seems to
                    be the opinion of the most experienced miners that efficient ventilation is the
                    only thing which can be depended on. But as this indispensable security is, in
                    many instances, too little attended to, it becomes a question whether the
                    legislature should interfere, to the extent at least of prohibiting the working
                    of “fiery mines,” until they have been so ventilated that, with the exercise of
                    ordinary precaution, imminent danger may be avoided. “It is useless,” as Mr
                    M*Culloch observes, “to trust any thing to the disinclination of the pitmen to
                    engage in dangerous mines. By daily exposure to danger, they become habituated
                    to, and careless about it; and, besides, they are apt to trust implicitly to the
                    reports of <hi rend="italic">viewers</hi> and others, who are quite as much
                    interested in getting the coal brought cheaply to the pit mouth as in the
                    security of the mine.”</p>

                    also of the machinery required for both purposes, the reader is referred to the

                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Iron Mines.</hi></p>
                <p>Iron, which is one of the most useful, is also one of the most abundant of the
                    metals. Of all minerals, indeed, it is the most universally diffused, and exists
                    in every different state, the native alone excepted, in which metallic ores are
                    found. Its presence may be detected in every kind of soil, and in every species
                    of rock, in a greater or smaller proportion; and it is to be met with in every
                    region of the earth. But the black or deep-brown oxides of iron, that is, the
                    ores of iron which contain a large proportion of metal, combined with a small
                    proportion of oxygen, belong exclusively to primitive rocks, of which they
                    constitute an integral part; whilst, on the other hand, the ores of iron
                    composed of the red oxide are generally found amongst secondary rocks, or, if
                    met with in primitive rocks, exist only in veins, without forming a constituent
                    part of these formations, as in the case of the black or deep-brown oxides. The
                    primitive and some of the secondary rocks are the chief repositories of iron
                    ores; but as to iron stones, they are found only amongst the secondary rocks,
                    and sometimes also in alluvial soil. The ores of iron are richer, purer, and
                    more abundant in the northern than in the southern regions of the earth. As
                    there are few countries in the world which do not contain mines of iron, so in
                    most of them some progress has been made in extracting the ores, and converting
                    them to the various useful purposes for which this metal is above all others
                    adapted from its peculiar qualities. But this double process can only be carried
                    on to any extent, or with any degree of success, in those countries where fuel
                    exists in almost equal abundance with the ore.</p>
                <p>Iron has been wrought in England since the time of the Romans, by whom works were
                    established in the Forest of Dean, in Gloucestershire. In Kent and Sussex,
                    counties well supplied, not only with iron ore, but also with timber, the only
                    species of fuel then used in the furnaces, works were also established at a very
                    early period. But the production of iron was long retarded, from the nature of
                    the fuel employed in smelting. Complaints were early made of the destruction of
                    timber by the iron-works. In the reign of Elizabeth, the decrease of timber
                    excited a great .deal of attention; and, in 1581, an act was passed prohibiting
                    the manufacturers of iron from using any but small wood, and establishing new
                    works in any place within twenty-two miles of the city of London, and fourteen
                    of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822407" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2407-0246"/> the river
                    Thames, as also in several parts of the county of Sussex. Soon afterwards,
                    Edward Lord Dudley invented a process for smelting iron ore with pit-coal
                    instead of timber, and obtained a patent for his invention, which was exempted
                    from the operation of the act 21 James I. c. 23, setting aside monopolies; but
                    the works of the inventor were destroyed by an ignorant rabble, and he was
                    nearly ruined by his efforts to introduce and perfect a process which has
                    eventually proved of immense benefit to the country. For many years, indeed, the
                    invention seems to have been forgotten; and it was not till about 1750 that the
                    growing scarcity of timber, coupled with the increasing demand for iron,
                    succeeded in drawing the attention of some ingenious persons to Lord Dudley’s
                    process. Necessity is always the mother of art. This process was now revived;
                    and, about the time mentioned, iron was made at Colebrookdale, and in some other
                    places, by means of pitcoal, and proved to be of as good a quality as that made
                    with timber. From this period the business steadily increased, though at first
                    its progress was comparatively slow; and the great demand for iron occasioned by
                    the late war gave an extraordinary stimulus to the manufacture, which has now
                    become one of vast importance and great value. In 1740, the quantity of pig-iron
                    produced in England amounted to about 17,000 tons, produced by fifty-nine
                    furnaces. In 1750, it had increased to 22,000 tons; in 1788 to 68,000 tons,
                    produced by eighty-five furnaces; in 1796 to 125,000 tons, produced by 121
                    furnaces; in 1806 to 250,000 tons, produced by 169 furnaces; and in 1820 to
                    about 400,000 tons. From inquiries made by government and others during several
                    years preceding 1832, it appears that the total quantities of iron produced in
                    Great Britain in the years 1823, 1825, 1828, and 1830, were, in 1823, 469,561
                    tons, by 277 furnaces; in 1825, 618,236 tons, by 259 furnaces; in 1828, 703,184
                    tons, by 278 furnaces; and in 1830, 678,417 tons, by 376 furnaces.</p>
                <p>Supposing that the total quantity of pig-iron produced in Great Britain amounts
                    to 700,000 tons a year, and that at an average it is worth L.6 per ton, its
                    total value will be L.4,200,000; and if to this be added L.l,200,000 for the
                    labour expended in converting pig-iron into bar-iron, the manufacture will be
                    worth about five millions and a half annually. The increased production of iron
                    has led to its exportation in large quantities, and at the same time reduced the
                    imports of foreign iron from about 34,000 tons to not more than 16,000 tons,
                    consisting principally of Swedish iron for the purpose of being manufactured
                    into steel. The total number of persons for whom the iron manufacture provides
                    subsistence has been estimated at from 207,000 to 240,000.</p>
                <p>The iron-works of South Wales ana Monmouthshire are comprised in a range of
                    country extending in the direction of north-west and south-east about
                    twenty-five miles from the one extremity to the other. The works at Hirwain in
                    Brecknock, and Aberdair in Glamorgan, form the extreme points to the westward.
                    But the great seat of the manufacture is Merthyr Tydvil, from which there is a
                    continued line of furnaces, at Ðowlais, Ro∙mney, Tredegar, Howey, Beaufort,
                    Nantyglo, Blaenafon, Varteg, Abersychan, and Pontypool, forming the principal
                    range in that direction. About the middle of last century, Merthyr Tydvil was an
                    insignificant village. In 1755, the lands and mines for several miles round the
                    village, were let for ninety-nine years at a rent of L.200 a year. In 1831, the
                    population of Merthyr Tydvil exceeded 22,000; Tredegar, which, at the beginning
                    of the present century, was an uninhabited district, has now a population of
                    about 7000 souls; and in several other places the increase has been equally
                    rapid. The Staffordshire iron-works, including those of Warwickshire, are
                    principally situated in the district which extends from Wolverhampton round by
                    Walsall to Birmingham, and thence round by Dudley. The principal seat of the
                    works in Shropshire is Colebrookdale, where the improvement of the manufacture
                    commenced, as above stated.</p>
                <p>In Scotland, almost all the iron-works, with the exception of those at Carron
                    contiguous to the Forth, and at Muirkirk in Ayrshire, are situated upon the
                    Clyde, at no great distance from Glasgow. In June 1835, there were in blast
                    twenty-nine furnaces, the annual produce of which was estimated at 75,000 tons;
                    but there were then in preparation six additional furnaces, calculated to
                    produce 13,000 tons a year. The proprietors of the Clyde ironworks have recently
                    begun to employ the <hi rend="italic">hot-blast,</hi> or air heated to a high
                    temperature, instead of the cold blast, or a stream of common atmospheric air,
                    in working their furnaces; and this discovery (for some account of which see the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Glasgow)</hi> promises to be of material
                    importance, by economising fuel, and also improving the quality of the iron
                    produced. It has been adopted at several works in England, as well as in France.
                    Iron was formerly produced in considerable quantities in various parts of
                    Ireland; but, owing to the scarcity of timber, the works were subsequently in a
                    great measure abandoned. Attempts, however, have recently been made to revive
                    them at Arigna and other places, though not as yet with any very decided
                    success.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Tin Mines.</hi></p>
                <p>Tin is exclusively produced in Cornwall and in Devonshire, but chiefly in the
                    former. The tin mines of Cornwall appear to have been worked from the remotest
                    antiquity; in fact, those early navigators, the Phoenicians, are supposed to
                    have traded thither for tin; and from this it has been inferred that the
                    discovery of tin in Cornwall must have been made at least 2400 years ago. But it
                    is supposed that the only ore then worked was <hi rend="italic">stream tin,</hi>
                    which is most accessible, and at that period probably existed in great
                    abundance; nor is it probable that mining, or digging the ore from the veins,
                    was known or practised until about the tenth century of the Christian era. In
                    more modern times the business of mining has been prosecuted with various skill
                    and success. During the reign of Elizabeth, the processes were improved by some
                    German miners, who were brought over to assist in working the mines. The ores of
                    tin are not numerous. It is chiefly found in the state of oxide, or in
                    combination with other metallic ores, particularly that of copper. They are
                    generally distributed in veins, which are at no great distance from the surface.
                    The tin ore occupies the whole space of the vein, and is closely attached to the
                    granite rock, which itself often contains the ore disseminated throughout its
                    whole substance. Tin also exists in accumulated masses or <hi rend="italic"
                    >stockzverks.</hi> The general direction of the veins is from east to west, or
                    nearly so; and, if not interrupted or deranged by vertical strata, they preserve
                    the same course in traversing a considerable tract of country. In some places
                    tin and copper veins are united, and run parallel to each other; the tin ore
                    forming one side, and the copper ore the other, of the double vein. The annual
                    produce of the tin mines fluctuated a good deal during the last century. On an
                    average of ten years ending with 1834, it may be taken at about 4500 tons, worth
                    from L.65 to L.80 a ton. In 1834, the exports did not exceed 468 tons, the
                    foreign market being principally supplied with tin from the island of Banca.</p>
                <p>All tin produced in Cornwall is subject to a duty of L.4 per ton, payable to the
                    Duke of Cornwall; and that raised in Devonshire is subject to a similar duty of
                    L.l. 13s. 4d. per ton. This duty, which produces from L.15,000 to L.20,000 a
                    year, is felt to be a serious grievance, not only <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193822420" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2420-0247"/> from its amount, but from
                    the vexatious manner in which it is collected. The miner, whatever his orders
                    may be, is not allowed at once to cast the metal into the form required by his
                    customer, but is obliged, in the first instance, to melt it in the shape of <hi
                    rend="italic">blocks.</hi> He is then obliged to convey it some eight or ten
                    miles to one of the <hi rend="italic">coinage towns,</hi> where a small piece is
                    struck off one of the corners, impressed with the arms of the duchy, and the
                    duty paid; after which it has to be carried back before it can be shipped, to
                    the place whence it was taken to be coined. The ceremony of coinage is only
                    performed quarterly; and hence, if the demand for tin be ever so pressing in the
                    interval between the stated coinages, the miner cannot supply it. There are
                    likewise certain fees payable on coinage, particularly if it take place during
                    the Christmas and Ladyday quarters; so that if to the duty of L.4 per ton be
                    added these charges, and a reasonable allowance for expense of carriage,
                    trouble, and inconvenience, the whole may be estimated at L.5 per ton. A tax at
                    once so oppressive and vexatious cannot but prove detrimental to the working of
                    the mines.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Copper Mines.</hi></p>
                <p>This metal is of much more importance than tin, on account of its tenacity,
                    ductility, and malleability, as well as the numerous alloys and combinations
                    which it forms with other metals, and which render it susceptible of being
                    applied to many of the most useful purposes of life. It exists in almost all the
                    different states of metallic ores, being found in those of native copper, alloy,
                    sulphuret, oxide, and also in that of a salt. It is most abundant in Cornwall,
                    where it is produced upon a very large scale, owing to the richness of the
                    mines. These are in veins which traverse the country, frequently accompanying
                    those of tin, and running in the same direction, which is generally from east to
                    west. They are nearly in a vertical position, some of them being from four to
                    five feet in thickness; and at a depth varying from 400 to 600 feet, they
                    continue to be equally productive. The copper ores of Cornwall are chiefly
                    yellow ore or iron pyrites, and vitreous copper ore; and they are commonly
                    accompanied with other metallic ores, as those of lead, zinc, and cobalt, and
                    also with fluor spar, lime spar, barytes, and quartz. Native copper is not an
                    unusual production; it is generally found in that part of the vein which is
                    nearest the surface, and which is the least rich in other ores. Sometimes,
                    however, it is met with at a considerable depth, as in Cook’s Kitchen Mine,
                    which yielded several tons of copper fit for immediate fusion.<note

                    Introd. p. 8.</p></note> Malachite, and many of the varieties of arseniate of
                    copper, are likewise found in these mines.</p>
                <p>As the ores of copper and tin frequently occur intermixed, it may be supposed
                    that the former were wrought, to some extent, at as early a period as the
                    latter. But this does not appear to have been the case; and it is only since the
                    beginning of the eighteenth century that the superior importance of the copper
                    mines began to be understood, and that they were worked with spirit and success.
                    From 1736 to 1745, they furnished annually about 700 tons of metal; and from
                    1756 to 1765 they yielded 1800 tons. In 1775 the produce increased to 2650 tons
                    a year; in 1798 it exceeded 5000 tons; and at present (1837) it amounts to about
                    12,000 tons. Besides Cornwall, other parts of the kingdom supply considerable
                    quantities of copper. The famous mines in Parys Mountain, in the island of
                    Anglesey, were discovered in 1768. From the peculiar site and disposition of the
                    mineral, it was not necessary to work it, like the Cornish mines, by shafts and
                    levels, but to dig at once into the sides of the mountain, which was composed
                    chiefly of copper ore, and to extract it as if from an open quarry. The ore was
                    obtained by blasting, and for a time the supplies of it were abundant beyond all
                    precedent, forming a vast source of wealth to the adventurers and proprietors.
                    But for many years past the productiveness of these mines has been declining,
                    and they now yield comparatively little. The Parys Mountain is supposed to have
                    furnished in all 85,000 tons of pure metal, which, at L.90 a ton, must have
                    produced the enormous sum of L.7,650,000. At present the entire produce of the
                    mines of Anglesey and Wales does not exceed 900 tons a year. Previously to 1770
                    the mine of Ecton, in Staffordshire, was one of the most productive in the
                    kingdom. It is supposed to have been worked at a very early period, and at one
                    time a thousand persons were employed in the works. The operations were latterly
                    carried on at a depth considerably exceeding 200 fathoms.</p>
                <p>From a statement published in the Transactions of the Cornwall Geological
                    Society, and which appears to be authentic, we learn that the produce, in pure
                    metal, of the copper mines of Great Britain and Ireland, during the five years
                    ending with the 30th June 1827, that is, in 1823, 1824, 1825, 1826, and 1827,
                    was, respectively, 9715, 9836, 10,350, 11,069, and 12,381 tons. Owing to the
                    want of coal the Cornish copper ores are not smelted on the spot, but are
                    shipped at the port nearest the mine for Swansea, where the principal smelting
                    companies have their establishments. The copper produced in Ireland is also
                    conveyed to Swansea to be smelted. Hence, if we take an account of the copper
                    sold in Cornwall, at Swansea, Devon, and Anglesey, we shall obtain a pretty
                    accurate estimate of the total produce of the different mines of the empire. But
                    such an account has been furnished in papers published by the Board of Trade,
                    containing the total sales of each year from 1820 to 1834 both included. From
                    this it appears that the total produce of copper may at present be estimated at
                    about 14,000 tons a year, worth from L.90 to L.100 a ton, or from L.1,260,000 to
                    L.1,400,000. The exports amount to between 8000 and 9000 tons, partly wrought
                    and partly manufactured, more than half of which is shipped for the East Indies
                    and China, and the remainder for France and the United States. Copper is
                    exempted from the tax laid on tin, and consequently from the oppressive
                    regulations to which we have already alluded as growing out of it.</p>
                <p>The number of the tin and copper mines of Cornwall is not exactly known, because
                    old workings are frequently given up, and new ones opened, whilst, in many
                    instances, those which were formerly abandoned are again brought into activity.
                    The number of mines at present wrought, however, may be estimated at 140, the
                    greater proportion of which consists of copper mines. The veins or lodes vary in
                    thickness from three inches to thirty feet. The excavations are sometimes
                    wrought to a very great depth. In the consolidated mines there is a shaft, in
                    the parish of Gwennap, between Truro and Redruth, which is 265 fathoms deep. Two
                    large steam-engines are not unfrequently employed upon one mine; and there are
                    instances where the sinking of the shaft, and a single engine with its
                    apparatus, have cost upwards of L.10,000. The power of steam-engines at present
                    employed in the Cornish mines is probably equivalent to that of from 45,000 to
                    50,000 horses. The mines in Cornwall are generally undertaken by companies of
                    adventurers. If the mine be upon a waste it is the property of the king, as Duke
                    of Cornwall, to whose agents the adventurers apply for a lease; if it be private
                    property its owners are of course applied to, and it is usually let for
                    twenty-one years, or for such portion of that <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193822433" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2433-0248"/> time as the workings shall
                    be proceeded in. The rent varies, according to circumstances, from one eighth to
                    one thirteenth of the ores raised. The miners are sometimes paid by the piece,
                    and sometimes by a certain per centage upon the ores raised by them. They
                    relieve each other by turns, each set generally continuing in the mine for eight
                    hours; but when working at the bottom of deep shafts they relieve each other
                    every six hours.</p>
                <p>Tin and copper mining, like that of the precious metals, is exceedingly
                    precarious. There is no certainty beyond the actual moment. Veins which promise
                    much when first opened sometimes fall off below and occasion immense loss to the
                    adventurers, or continue to be wrought in hopes of improvement, but with little
                    or no profit; whilst, on the other hand, mines and veins which, at the outset,
                    promised little or nothing, come in time to yield very large profits. Hence, if
                    great losses often occur, enormous fortunes are sometimes realised. Crennis
                    copper mine returned a clear profit to the adventurers of L.84,000 in one year;
                    and Huel yielded nearly L.130,000, after defraying every necessary outlay. The
                    expense of working some of the large mines is very great. In that of Huel Vor,
                    3000 lbs. of candles and 3500 lbs. of gunpowder are consumed in a month. The
                    total amount of capital employed in connection with the tin and copper mines of
                    Cornwall has been estimated at L.2,440,000; and the total number of persons to
                    whom they afford occupation directly or indirectly is supposed to be 76,000. The
                    miners and others engaged in the tin mines of Cornwall and Devonshire are under
                    the especial protection of the Stannary Courts, which were established about
                    five hundred years ago, and have not undergone any material alteration since the
                    reign of Charles II. These courts are held by the lord warden of the stannaries;
                    and no miner or other person really engaged in the mines can be sued in any
                    other court except upon pleas of land, life, or member. From the Stannary Courts
                    no writ of error lies to any court in Westminster Hall; but an appeal may be
                    taken to the privy council of the Duke of Cornwall.<note anchored="true"

                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Lead Mines.</hi></p>
                <p>With the exception of iron, lead is perhaps the most abundant of the metallic
                    substances found in Europe. The most common ore of this metal is the sulphuret
                    or galena, which occurs massive, or crystallized in various forms, and is met
                    with not only in primitive, but also in secondary mountains, being generally
                    deposited in veins or extensive beds. The rocks in which it is most commonly
                    distributed are gneiss, mica, schistus, limestone, and greywacke; and the
                    mineral substances which constitute the matrix or <hi rend="italic">gangue</hi>
                    are quartz, bärytes, lime spar, and fluor spar. The ores of lead are likewise
                    accompanied by a great number of other metallic substances, particularly by some
                    of the ores of zinc, as blende and calamine, iron and copper pyrites, sparry
                    iron ore, and red vitreous silver ore.</p>
                <p>1he lead mines of Great Britain are numerous and important. That the mines of
                    Derbyshire were wrought in the time of the Romans, is evident from the blocks of
                    lead which have been found with Roman inscriptions on them.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A block of lead of this kind was discovered
                    on Cromford Moor in the year 1777, with the following inscription :—“The sixth
                    legion inscribes this in memory of the Emperor Hadrian.” Another block was
                    fourni at Matlock Bank in 1783. inscribed thus :—“The property of Lucius
                    Aruconius Verecundus, merchant of London.” The weight of this block was 841bs. A
                    third block, weighing 1⅜ cwt., was subsequently discovered at Matlock, and upon
                    it was found this inscription :—Tι. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cl. Tr.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Lut.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Br. Exarg.,</hi> probably meaning
                    Tiberii Claudiani Triumviri Lutudarï Britannorum Exargentaria. The Saxons and
                    Danes, it is also supposed, were engaged in working the lead mines of
                    Derbyshire.</p></note> But, excepting in these, it does not appear that lead was
                    obtained any where in England until theyear1289, when it was discovered in
                    Wales; and the fact having transpired that silver was found intermixed with the
                    Welsh ores, this gave a fresh stimulus to’the business. ^ In other respects,
                    however, the discovery of silver was of no avail, as the quantity obtained
                    proved altogether insufficient to defray the expense of separating it from the
                    lead. At present the most productive lead mines are situated in Allendale and
                    other parts of Northumberland; in Aldstone Moor and its vicinity in Cumberland;
                    in the western parts of Durham; in the hundred of High Peak in Derbyshire; in
                    some parts of Flintshire; at Leadhills and Wanlockhead, and on the confines of
                    Dumfriesshire and Lanarkshire, in Scotland.</p>
                <p>It is not easy, for want of returns, to arrive at a correct estimate of the
                    annual produce of these mines; but in the aggregate it must be very
                    considerable, amounting probably to between 45,000 and 50,000 tons. The foreign
                    lead imported is almost all re-exported; and hence the supply obtained from our
                    own mines must not only be sufficient to satisfy the home consumption, which is
                    very great, but, as our exports exceed our imports by from 10,000 to 14,000
                    tons, to furnish this quantity in addition. Lead has declined in price since the
                    year 1820, owing to the increased supplies obtained from Spain, and the
                    comparatively cheap rate at which these are furnished. This metal is raised in
                    different parts of Ireland, as in the county of Wicklow, at Carne in Wexford,
                    and in Armagh and Donegal; but some of the lead mines which were formerly
                    wrought in Kerry and Mayo have been abandoned.</p>
                <p>The mineral called <hi rend="italic">black lead</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >plumbago</hi> is found at Borrowdale in Cumberland, where mines of it have been
                    wrought since the days of Queen Elizabeth, and furnish the best material
                    hitherto discovered for making pencils. Formerly the proprietors of these mines
                    enjoyed a complete monopoly of the market; and by occasionally shutting them up,
                    and thus diminishing the supply of the mineral, they kept its price at a high
                    level, and realised large profits. But, latterly, plumbago has been imported in
                    considerable quantities from Mexicoand Ceylon; and, although inferior in
                    quality, yet, being cheaper than the English, it has superseded the latter for
                    most purposes, except the best kind of pencils. The lead is not found in veins,
                    butin detached pieces; it is often lost, and the miners are frequently engaged
                    for a long time in seeking at random for a new supply. The quality of the
                    mineral differs materially, the lightest being the best. It is cut into the
                    proper form for pencils by the manufacturers of Keswick and London.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Salt Mines.</hi></p>
                <p>No country is better supplied than England with beds of fossil or rock salt, and
                    also with brine springs. The latter, which occur at Northwich, Winsford,
                    Middlewich, and other places adjacent to the Weaver in Cheshire, and at
                    Droitwich in Worcestershire, have been known and wrought from a remote era. But
                    it was not until a comparatively recent period that the beds of fossil salt were
                    discovered, the first of them having been met with in 1670, about thirty-four
                    yards below the surface, in searching for coal in the vicinity of Northwich. In
                    1779 a second bed of fossil salt was discovered near Lawton, about forty-two
                    yards below the surface; and others have since been found in different parts of
                    the surrounding country. These beds, or strata, are generally of very great
                    thickness; and, upon cutting through the indurated marl at the bot∙</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822446" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2446-0249"/>
                <p>tom of the first stratum, another of still greater thickness has sometimes been
                    discovered below it. In one instance a third bed has been pierced, of
                    twenty-five yards, without reaching the lower surface of the stratum. There are
                    also beds of fossil salt at Droitwich; but as these have not been wrought,
                    comparatively little is known respecting them.</p>
                <p>Rock salt, when dug from the mine, is seldom of such purity as to admit of its
                    being used without undergoing some process of refining. The largest portion of
                    the salt produced in Cheshire, and nearly the whole of that produced in
                    Worcestershire, are obtained from the brine springs. In Cheshire, the brine
                    being pumped up from deep wells, is collected in reservoirs, and, being
                    saturated by means of crushed rock salt, is thence conveyed into large, broad,
                    shallow pans, placed over furnaces, where the water which holds the salt in
                    solution is evaporated, and the salt rendered fit for use. Different qualities
                    of salt are produced, according to the mode in which the heat is applied, and
                    the process of evaporation conducted. Animal jelly, butter, and other foreign
                    substances, are sometimes employed to assist in clearing the brine, and in
                    granulating the salt. Salt has been obtained from the brine pits at Droitwich
                    for at least a thousand years. When these are dug to a sufficient depth, the
                    brine ascends to the .surface. But the quantity of white salt made here is very
                    inferior to that produced in Cheshire, and this place does not furnish any
                    supplies of fossil salt. Part of the rock salt of Cheshire is refined at
                    Newcastle and other places.</p>
                <p>The consumption of salt in this country is immense. In those provinces of France
                    which had purchased an exemption from the <hi rend="italic">gabelle,</hi> Necker
                    estimated the consumption at 19; lbs. for each individual; but, from the
                    difference of our food and habits, the consumption of the people of this country
                    may be estimated a little higher, or at 22 lbs. each person. On this
                    supposition, and taking the population at 16,500,000, the entire consumption of
                    Great Britain, exclusively of Ireland, will amount to 363,000,000 lbs., or
                    161,000 tons. But, besides this, between 11,000,000 and 12,000,000 bushels,
                    equivalent to about 300,000 tons, are exported to the United States and the
                    British North American colonies, to Holland and Belgium, Russia, Denmark, and
                    other countries. In ancient Rome salt was subject to a duty <hi rend="italic"
                    >(vectigal salinarum)</hi>; and it has generally been heavily taxed in modern
                    times. The <hi rend="italic">gabelle,</hi> or code of salt laws, formerly
                    established in France, was most oppressive, and its severity had no
                    inconsiderable share in bringing about the Revolution. In this country the
                    duties upon salt, which were first imposed in the reign of William 1II.,
                    amounted, in 1798, to 5s. a bushel, and were subsequently increased to 15s. a
                    bushel, or about forty times the cost of the article taxed. So exorbitant a duty
                    was productive of the worst effects, occasioning a great deal of smuggling; and,
                    the opihion of the public having been strongly expressed against it, the tax was
                    finally repealed in 1823.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Mines of Manganese and Zinc.</hi></p>
                <p>Manganese, a mineral substance of considerable consequence in the arts, exists
                    chiefly in the state of oxide, and sometimes in that of carbonate. The ores
                    appear under a great variety of forms, and it has hitherto been found extremely
                    difficult to reduce them to the metallic state; but it is easy to detect a large
                    quantity by means of the blowpipe, the action of which, with the addition of
                    borax, and a little nitre, produces a violet-coloured glass. This mineral is
                    found at Upton-Pyne in Devonshire, and in the Mendip Hills, Somersetshire, from
                    which it is obtained in quantities sufficient to meet the demand. In Scotland,
                    the ores of manganese have not been discovered in such abundance as to become an
                    object of pursuit.</p>
                <p>Zinc has never been met with in the metallic state. It exists in the form of
                    sulphuret, in that of oxide, and also in the state of carbonate. The ores of
                    zinc are very common in several of the lead mines of Great Britain, where the
                    metal is found sometimes in the form of blende, or sulphu∙ ret, and sometimes in
                    that of calamine, or oxide. It is obtained from the mines of Derbyshire,
                    particularly at Castleton, Cromford, Bonsal, and Wirksworth; but Flintshire and
                    the Isle of Man furnish ores of the best quality. At Leadhills, in Scotland,
                    blende, and some of the varieties of calamine, ate frequently met with. The
                    blende is occasionally found in great abundance; sometimes it occurs in detached
                    masses, and sometimes it occupies the whole vein, to the exclusion of the lead
                    ore.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Stone and Slate Quarries.</hi></p>
                <p>The stone quarries of England are not of any great value or importance. The
                    principal are situated in the Isle of Portland, and in the neighbourhood of
                    Bath. The annual produce of the Portland quarries may be estimated at about
                    18,000 tons. From them have been obtained the stones employed in the
                    construction of St Paul’s, and in that of most other public buildings in London.
                    The quarries of Gateshead Fell, near Newcastle, furnish the grindstones
                    universally known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Newcastle grindstones.</hi>
                    Scotland is distinguished for the number and excellence of its quarries. But
                    those of Craigleith, Cullalo, Fifeshire, and some others, are amongst the most
                    celebrated. The general beauty of the houses in the New Town of Edinburgh
                    attests the excellency of the stone of which they are built, and which has been
                    principally furnished by the Craigleith quarry. Large quantities of granite are
                    shipped from Aberdeen for London, where it is employed in various public works,
                    and likewise in paving the streets. The Liverpool docks have been partly
                    constructed of granite brought from Kirkcudbrightshire.</p>
                <p>The principal slate quarries in Great Britain are situated in Caernarvonshire.
                    Those belonging to Mr Pennant are the most extensive and valuable, furnishing
                    employment for about 1500 men and boys. The other slate quarries in
                    Caernarvonshire and North Wales employ generally about 1800 men and boys. There
                    are also extensive quarries in different parts of South Wales, at Ulverstone in
                    Lancashire, and in other places. The principal slate quarries of Scotland are in
                    the island of Easdale, and at Ballachulish in Argyleshire; but, speaking
                    generally, they do not furnish slates of the same size and smoothness as those
                    obtained from the Welsh quarries.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>III.—CONTINENTAL MINES.</p>
                <p>Most of the mineral and metallic substances which abound in Great Britain and
                    Ireland have also been discovered, and to a certain extent excavated, in one or
                    other of the countries of the continent of Europe; and the latter likewise
                    afford a variety of mineral products which, as compared with those of Great
                    Britain, are peculiar to themselves<pb break="no" facs="nls:193822459"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-2459-0250"/>. In addition to coal, iron, tin, copper, lead,
                    zinc, manganese, &amp;c. they furnish, in greater or less quantities, gold,
                    silver, mercury, and various other metals or mineral substances, some of which
                    are equally valuable and useful. We shall therefore endeavour to give a short
                    account, first, of those minerals and metals which they possess in common with
                    this country; and, secondly, of those which are comparatively peculiar to
                    themselves, or, in other words, what are not found at all, or only to a very
                    trifling extent, in Great Britain and Ireland.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Coal Mines.</hi></p>
                <p>Before the war of the Revolution, England supplied the maritime parts of France
                    with coal. But the declaration of hostilities having put an end to this trade,
                    and thus deprived these parts of their ordinary supply, the rulers of France
                    directed their attention to the improvement of her internal resources; and,
                    amongst other objects of research, the discovery of coal was too important to be
                    neglected. Wherever any favourable indications presented themselves, the attempt
                    was accordingly made, and it appears in many cases to have been prosecuted with
                    considerable success. Indeed an inspection of the map of France, on which the
                    coal districts are delineated, would lead us to suppose that one half of that
                    country contains coal; but there are many circumstances which tend to show that
                    the extent of the coal strata is much more limited, and that the representations
                    which have been made on the subject, in certain official documents, are greatly
                    exaggerated. In a report addressed to the consular government, it is stated that
                    coal is wrought in forty-seven departments, and that sixteen others afford
                    indications of the same mineral. But of the forty-seven departments in which
                    coal mines are stated to be wrought, reports of the products of thirty-four only
                    were obtained; and, from the estimated annual amount of coal produced in these
                    departments, it appears evident that the total annual produce of the coal mines
                    of France, at the period referred to in the report, could not have exceeded
                    5,000,000 tons. That a considerably larger supply has since been obtained,
                    cannot admit of any reasonable doubt; but, whether from the comparative
                    barrenness of the mines, the difficulty of working them, or inferiority of skill
                    and less perfect machinery, to say nothing of the relative quality of the coal
                    produced, it appears that, even at the present day, English coal might be
                    exported to France and sold at a price considerably lower than French. The coal
                    which has been found in the southern parts of France is very generally of an
                    inferior quality, the best mines being those which are situated in the
                    department of Aveyron, on the banks of the Lot and the Dordogne. In the central
                    parts it is met with in greater abundance, though not always of a good quality;
                    and the coal on the eastern frontier seems to be of no great importance. In the
                    western parts, the mines of Montrelais have long furnished a considerable supply
                    to the country situated upon the banks of the Loire. But the richest coal mines
                    in the kingdom occur in that part of France which lies between Calais and the
                    Rhine; indeed the produce of the coal mines of the North amounts to nearly three
                    fourths of that of the whole kingdom. The most important coal fields in this
                    part of the country are those of Boulogne, Jemappes, and Anzin.</p>
                <p>No coal has yet been discovered in any part of Spain or Italy, nor have any
                    indications of the existence of that mineral presented themselves in either of
                    these countries. But in several parts of Germany, and in Bohemia, there are
                    valuable mines, some of which yield coal in considerable abundance. The northern
                    countries of Europe are, for the most part, entirely destitute of this species
                    of fossil fuel. Coal is indeed found in several parts of the Russian empire, but
                    it is of so bad a quality as to be almost unfit for use. Some appearances of
                    this mineral were observed by Olivier on the shores of the Black Sea; pit-coal
                    has also been met with in the vicinity of the Donetz; and to the north of
                    1aganrog there is an immense stratum, twenty-four feet in thickness, consisting
                    of slate coal of very inferior quality.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Iron Mines.</hi></p>
                <p>The iron manufacture of France has been very greatly extended since the
                    commencement of the Revolution, and is protected by high duties, which secure to
                    the native manufacturer the almost exclusive possession of the French market.
                    The iron ores are chiefly met with in the vicinity of the Pyrenees, being
                    deposited in veins, some of which are from six to eight feet in thickness; and
                    iron stones are also abundant in France, particularly in those departments where
                    coal strata prevail. Latterly, great exertions have been made by the French
                    government to encourage and extend the native manufacture of iron;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is evinced in the able
                    Report made to the director-general of mines in France, by M. Dufrenoy, on the
                    use of hot air in the iron-works of England and Scotland (Paris, 1834, and
                    London, 1836). It is not a little singular, that we sould be indebted to a
                    foreigner for the first detailed account of the progess of an invention which
                    had its birth in Scotland, and which has in that country been attended with
                    signal success.</p></note> but the metal produced is still vastly inferior in
                    quality to the English and Scotch, and is at the same time considerably higher
                    in price. The principal iron mines of Spain are situated in the provinces of
                    Biscay and Catalonia; and the ores from which the metal is extracted consist of
                    the sparry kind, together with red and brown haematites. Many parts of Germany
                    have long been celebrated for the abundance and excellence of the iron extracted
                    from the native ores, particularly in Styria, Carinthia, and Franconia.</p>
                <p>The island of Elba possesses one of the richest iron mines in the world, the
                    existence of which appears to have been known from the earliest times. The ore
                    is chiefly of the specular kind, and the mass constitutes an entire mountain,
                    which is surrounded by others consisting of granite, of wfiich the island is
                    almost wholly composed. This mountain, which is called Rio, is about 500 feet in
                    height, and three miles in circumference; and its surface is covered with a
                    reddish ochry earth, which in some places is several feet in thickness, and full
                    of small shining scales of iron ore. Beneath this covering, the mass of the
                    mountain consists of metallic ore, or rather, it is composed of accumulated
                    masses, thrown together without any order or stratification. These masses are
                    deposited in an ochry substance, which may be considered as their matrix; and,
                    besides the specular ore, which predominates, other species and varieties are
                    occasionally met with. The iron mines of Elba were wrought in the time of the
                    Romans, by means of excavations carried into the mountain; but now the ore is
                    extracted by the ordinary process of quarrying. It has been conjectured by some
                    that the mass of iron ore in the island of Elba is part of a great vein of
                    immense extent running into the adjacent continent.</p>
                <p>The iron mines of Sweden have long been celebrated on account of the rich ores
                    which they afford, and the superior quality of the iron which is thence
                    obtained. The most remarkable are those of Danemora, distant four Swedish miles
                    from Upsal, and which were first discovered in 1470. The mines are in primitive
                    rocks, and the ore is said by some to be found in enormous masses, though,
                    according to others, it is deposited in the form of a great vein. It is wrought
                    to the day, and the greatest depth is less than <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193822472" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2472-0251"/> a hundred fathoms. From 1200
                    to 1500 persons are constantly employed in the different operations connected
                    with these mines. The mountain of Taberg in Smaland is almost entirely composed
                    of iron ore; it consists of a great number of veins running in a vertical
                    position, parallel to each other; and the ore is a mixture of the specular kind
                    with clay and small grains of felspar, thus exhibiting the appearance of
                    porphyritic rock. The mines of Arendal in Norway furnish abundance of iron ore
                    mixed with garnets and other minerals which are found only in primitive rocks.
                    The Ural Mountains, so rich in other metallic ores, contain also mines of iron,
                    from which is derived the greater part of that metal employed in Russia. In one
                    part of Siberia, iron is extracted from an ore consisting of ferruginous fossil
                    wood imbedded in clay and sand.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Tin Mines.</hi></p>
                <p>That portion of the west of France which is, as it were, projected between
                    Cornwall in England and Galicia in Spain, has been supposed to afford
                    indications of tin, probably from some similarity in geological structure; but,
                    in point of fact, none has yet been discovered. Ores of this metal have,
                    however, been found in Galicia, and on the frontiers of Portugal, where, in the
                    year 1787, a mine was opened, and veins, some of them six feet in thickness,
                    began to be wrought. These veins were included in granite. Tin mines were
                    formerly wrought in the north of Portugal, and traces of the ore are still
                    visible. At Marienberg in Germany a mine is wrought, in a vein about six feet
                    thick, which runs from east to west, like those of Cornwall, with an inclination
                    of about 70°. The mountain in which the tin mines of Ehrenfriedersdorf are
                    situated, contains, within a space of about a hundred fathoms, a great number of
                    parallel veins, running in the same direction, and some of them almost in
                    contact with one another; so that, in the thickness of about three fathoms,
                    there are sometimes found four or five veins, the hanging side of one vein
                    forming the ledger side of the other. These veins traverse a rock of
                    argillaceous schistus, but none of them has been wrought to any great depth.
                    There are also tin mines at Altenberg, Geyer, and Zinnwald, which, with that
                    just mentioned, produce annually about 4000 cwt. of metal. The tin mines of
                    Platte in Bohemia are, as usual, in granite, and the veins traverse the rock in
                    a direction approaching to that of east and west. In the Kaff Mountain there is
                    a tin mine in which iron ore is found at the top of the vein, and tin at a
                    greater depth; and it has been conjectured that, were the mining operations
                    carried to a still lower depth, silver ores would be found. But the most
                    remarkable tin mine of Bohemia is that of Schlackenwald, where the ore is
                    deposited in the form of accumulated masses or Stockwerks. One of these masses,
                    shaped like an inverted cone, is of very considerable magnitude, being from
                    ninety to a hundred fathoms in thickness. It is surrounded by gneiss, and the
                    mass itself is composed of granite, in which are disseminated grains of tin ore.
                    This mine has been wrought for more than five centuries, and has been carried to
                    a depth of about a hundred fathoms; but the ore is so disseminated in the rock,
                    that it requires ten thousand quintals to yield from thirty-five to forty
                    quintals of tin.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The tin
                    of the East Indies, particularly that of. the island of Banca, is considered as
                    purer than the tin of Europe. Great quantities of the former are now imported.
                    The mines of Banca have already yielded more than 4,000,000 lbs. of metal and
                    the veins are still far from being exhausted.</p></note></p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Copper Mines.</hi></p>
                <p>The copper mines of France do not appear to be of any great importance. Those of
                    Bigorre, in the western Pyrenees, are now nearly exhausted, and the mines of
                    Languedoc are not productive; the most valuable are those of Chessy and St Bel
                    near Lyons, the annual produce of which is between 3000 and 4000 quintals of
                    copper. The ore found at the latter place consists chiefly of copper pyrites,
                    which yields only about three per cent. The copper mines of Spain are situated
                    on the frontiers of Portugal, but appear to be of as little consequence as those
                    of France. The ore is copper pyrites, affording from four to six per cent, of
                    metal. There is a tradition that one of these mines was wrought in the time of
                    the Carthaginians. Germany contains some valuable copper mines, amongst which
                    may be mentioned those of Hesse, where the ore is deposited in a bituminous
                    stratum of marl schistus, from four to eight inches in thickness, but of great
                    extent. The ore contained in this stratum or bed consists chiefly of copper
                    pyrites; but vitreous copper ore, and red oxide of copper, are sometimes met
                    with. Of the Hessian mines, the most considerable is that of Riegelsdorf, which
                    yields annually about 2500 quintals of copper. There are similar mines at
                    Frankenberg near Cassel, at Bieber in Hanau, at Eisleben in the county of
                    Mansfeld, and also in the district of Magdeburg. In Hungary there are some
                    valuable copper mines, particularly those of Herengrund near Neu-sohl, where the
                    mineral is found in the form of gray copper ore, deposited in beds of
                    considerable thickness, amongst a breccia of micaceous schistus.</p>
                <p>But one of the most extensive and most productive copper mines in the world is
                    that of Fahlun, in the province of Dalecarlia, in Sweden. The mining district
                    occupies a space of nine leagues in length by two and a half in breadth, and is
                    surrounded by a reddish granite, which becomes of a finer grain as it approaches
                    the centre of this space, and is then succeeded by a micaceous rock dividing
                    into rhomboidal fragments. The principal mass, which is of enormous dimensions,
                    consists of iron and copper pyrites lying in a vertical position from north-west
                    to south-east along the valley in which it is deposited. Here there is an
                    immense opening or gulf 840 feet in length, 720 in breadth, and 240 in depth,
                    which was produced in the year 1687, by the falling in of the superincumbent
                    mass, in consequence of the unskilful manner in which the subterranean
                    operations had been conducted. In this celebrated mine the mass of ore is
                    described as lying in the form of an inverted cone, and the excavation has been
                    carried to a depth of more than 200 fathoms; but it is supposed that this is
                    nearly the utmost extent to which the mass of ore penetrates the earth, as
                    latterly the operations have been conducted upon a more limited scale than in
                    former times. It was in this mine that Gustavus Vasa, when driven from his
                    throne, worked for a time, to procure the means of subsistence. In the mine of
                    Garpenberg, which is about eighteen leagues from that of Fahlun, there are
                    fourteen veins in a vertical position, and all parallel to one another, being
                    situated in a quartzose micaceous schistus, which is also disposed parallel to
                    the veins.</p>
                <p>In Siberia there are two principal mines of copper, which are both situated in
                    the extensive chain of the Ural Mountains. One of these, that of Goumechefski,
                    about fourteen leagues to the south-west of Katherineberg, is in the central
                    part of the chain, in a kind of plain, upon the border of a lake, surrounded by
                    primitive mountains. The vein is nearly in a vertical position, being disposed
                    between a bed of primitive white marble and an argillaceous schistus in astate
                    of incipient decomposition. The matrix of the ores is a clay of different
                    colours, and they consist <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822485"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-2485-0252"/> chiefly of native copper in grains and small
                    masses, with some vitreous copper ore; whilst the fissures and cavities are
                    encrusted with malachite, some beautiful specimens of which have been obtained.
                    The length of the vein is about 200 fathoms, and its thickness varies from one
                    to ten fathoms. The ore yields only between three and four per cent, and the
                    amount of copper annually produced is about 4000 quintals. The other Siberian
                    mines are those of Tourinski, on the river Touria, at the eastern base of the
                    Ural chain, and about a hundred leagues north of Katherineberg. The vein is
                    included in a bed of white marble, which in thickness does not exceed four
                    fathoms. The matrix of the ores is clay, but it is rich, and often exhibits a
                    beautiful appearance, being varied with veins of blue and green steatites, red
                    oxide of copper, fragments of malachite, gray ore, and not unfrequently native
                    copper. The ore yields from eighteen to twenty per cent., and the annual produce
                    is about 20,000 quintals.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Lead Mines.</hi></p>
                <p>France possesses considerable mines of lead, particularly those of Poullaouen and
                    Huelgoet, in the department of Finisterre, which have been worked into two
                    parallel veins included in primitive rocks. There are also mines of lead in the
                    Vosges, where the galena is disseminated in a thick vein of decomposed granite;
                    in the department of Sambre and Meuse, where the veins traverse limestone nearly
                    in a vertical position; and in other places, where, in their distributions and
                    productions, the mines are analogous to those of Great Britain. The produce of
                    the French mines is about 30,000*quintals of lead annually. There are many
                    valuable mines of lead in Germany, particularly in Saxony and the Hartz. Lead
                    ore is also obtained, from the mines of Hungary and Bohemia, which sometimes
                    yield a considerable proportion of silver. The mines of Bleyberg, in Carinthia,
                    where galena is the prevailing ore, furnish the finest specimens of molybdate of
                    lead. At Tarnowitz in Silesia there is a remarkable deposition of lead ore, the
                    beds in which it is distributed reposing on horizontal strata of compact
                    limestone, which contains petrified shells, and is impregnated with bituminous
                    matter. The lead ore is deposited in veins, in rounded masses, and in small
                    grains. The only appearance of lead in the immense chain of the Ural Mountains,
                    so rich in other mineral productions, is in the state of chromate, or red lead,
                    which was first discovered in Siberia, and the principal repository of which is
                    the gold mine of Beresof. It is found in a small vein of ferruginous quartz,
                    traversing a gneiss rock of a reddish colour.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Mines of Zinc and Manganese.</hi></p>
                <p>In a lead mine about six leagues from Cherbourg in France there is a vein of
                    calamine four fathoms in thickness; and in the neighbourhood of Aix-la-Chapelle
                    there is a prodigious mass of calamine imbedded between two rocks, composed of
                    micaceous schistus and sandstone, intermixed with very hard quartz. The ore is
                    extracted by sinking shafts, from the lower extremities of which galleries have
                    been driven, some of them to a very considerable extent. When the ore is
                    exhausted on this level, the shafts are sunk deeper, and a new series of
                    operations is commenced. An immense mass of blende, or sulphuret of zinc, was
                    discovered by Dietrich in the Pyrenees; and ores of this metal are not uncommon
                    in other parts of France. A pure calamine, containing neither iron, lead, nor
                    sulphur, was found near Alcaraz in La Mancha, Spain, and was extracted for the
                    purpose of being employed in the manufacture of brass carried on in the vicinity
                    of that place; but the work appears to have been latterly discontinued. Some
                    ores of zinc abound in the mines of Saxony, and in those of the Hartz, where
                    they are found in considerable quantities, and also in peculiar repositories. A
                    mass of blende, similar to that observed in the Pyrenees, was discovered in the
                    Hartz, unmixed with any other metal, and capable of affording any quantity of
                    ore.</p>
                <p>France possesses some valuable mines of manganese, particularly that of
                    Romanèche, in the department of Saone and Loire, which is situated on the
                    eastern declivity of a chain of primitive mountains, stretching from
                    north-northeast, and composed of granite, limestone, and a siliceous sandstone.
                    The manganese is incumbent on the granite, forming neither a bed nor a vein, but
                    being deposited in a kind of accumulated mass, about ten fathoms in its greatest
                    breadth, and nearly two hundred in length. The thickness of this mass of
                    manganese varies from seven to fifteen feet, and the greater part of it is free
                    from admixture with other minerals, except fluor spar of a deep violet colour,
                    with which it is sometimes found combined. Manganese is also found in other
                    parts of France, as in the Cevennes, where it occurs in a matrix of granite; in
                    the department of the Vosges and the Moselles; and in the neighbourhood of
                    Perigueux, in the department of Dordogne. The manganese mine in the valley of
                    Aoste, Piedmont, has been described by Saussure in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Voyages.</hi> It is situated in a mountain of gneiss, the beds of which are
                    nearly horizontal; and the ore is supposed to be deposited in the form of a
                    large mass rather than in that of a bed or vein. This mine affords fine
                    specimens of the carbonate of manganese, crystallized in the form of rhomboidal
                    prisms, and of a beautiful purple-red colour. Ores of this metal are not
                    uncommon in various parts of Germany. The carbonate has been found in the gold
                    mine of Nagyag, and in Other auriferous mines of Transylvania. In the Ural
                    Mountains there is a siliceous sandstone, which is entirely penetrated with
                    manganese, disposed in a dendritical form, throughout the whole mass of the
                    stone.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Mines of Pock Salt.</hi></p>
                <p>Fossil salt is usually found alternating with beds of clay, accompanying gypsum,
                    sandstone, and limestone; sometimes in considerable beds, but often in detached
                    masses, and also in veins. Mines of rock salt occur in Hungary, the southern
                    part of Germany, at Vic in France, and also at VVielizka in Poland. The last of
                    these are of prodigious extent, and afford annually about 2,000,000 cwt. of this
                    fossil product, without any appearance of exhaustion.</p>
                <p>Having thus noticed the various mineral products which the continent of Europe
                    possesses in common with Great Britain, and also indicated their respective
                    localities in the different countries, we now proceed, in conformity with our
                    plan, to give some account of those which may be considered either as peculiar
                    to the Continent, compared with Great Britain, or which occur there in
                    sufficient abundance to be extracted from their ores, and for this reason come
                    within the scope of the present article.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Mines of Gold and Platina.</hi></p>
                <p>Gold, though one of the scarcest metals, is almost universally distributed. It is
                    most frequently found disseminated, or in detached grains, or in a dendritical
                    form, and sometimes it occurs in a crystallized state. It is often met with in
                    primitive mountains, where-it is usually distributed in veins, and occasionally
                    disseminated in the rock itself. The gangue or matrix of gold, that is, the
                    substances which accompany it, consist of quartz, felspar, limestone, pyrites,
                    some of the ores of silver, and galena; and it is also found in combination,
                    with manganese, cobalt, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822498"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-2498-0253"/> and nickel. In a Siberian mine, gold has been
                    discovered surrounded by muriate of silver. It is likewise common to alluvial
                    soil, where it is disseminated in grains, along with siliceous, argillaceous,
                    and ferruginous sands, which form the component parts of certain soils. It is
                    further met with in the sands of many rivers, particularly after floods. Most of
                    the auriferous sands are of a black or reddish colour, and consequently are
                    ferruginous; a circumstance which, taken in connection with the gold of alluvial
                    soil, has led some to suppose that its presence is owing to the decomposition of
                    auriferous pyrites.</p>
                <p>Platina exists in the metallic state, and is usually found in the form of small,
                    flat, or rounded grains. Its colour is a light steel gray, or silver white; it
                    is ductile, and in thin plates flexible; but it is infusible without addition.
                    Platina was first known in Europe about the year 1748, and, until Vauquelin
                    detected this metal in a gray silver ore from the mine of Guadalcanal in Spain,
                    it was found only in South America, where it occurred in alluvial soil covered
                    with rounded masses of basalt. It is now found in considerable quantities on the
                    European side of the Ural chain. Platina is accompanied with particles of gold
                    and iron, and with another ore containing osmium and iridium; and it forms the
                    alloy of rhodium and palladium.</p>
                <p>Ιhe principal mines of gold and platina in Europe are those belonging to Russia;
                    but before proceeding to give some account of these, we shall shortly advert to
                    the different localities where gold has been found and wrought in some of the
                    other countries of the Continent.</p>
                <p>In several parts of France gold has been found, although in exceedingly small
                    quantities. In the year 1781, a vein of gold was discovered at Gardette, in the
                    valley of Oysans, which is situated in the department of the Isère. This vein
                    consisted of quartz, which traversed a gneiss mountain, and contained auriferous
                    sulphuret of iron, besides some fine specimens of native gold; but the quantity
                    obtained was found insufficient to defray the expense of operations. Many of the
                    rivers, as the· Rhone, the Rhine, the Garonne, and others of smaller note,
                    furnish auriferous sand. Veins of auriferous sulphuret of iron traversing gneiss
                    rocks have been discovered at the foot of Mount Rosa in Piedmont; and the sands
                    of some of the rivers, as well as various parts of the soil, on the south side
                    of the Apennine Mountains, are likewise auriferous.</p>
                <p>It has been said that the mineral wealth of Spain and Portugal is now almost
                    exhausted; but it would perhaps be nearer the truth· to state, what is
                    undoubtedly the fact, that, in these countries, the search for mineral treasures
                    has long been in a great measure abandoned. From the earliest times the
                    Peninsula has been celebrated as a repository of gold, which was found, not only
                    in the alluvial soil and in the beds of rivers, but also in regular veins, and
                    which might still be discovered in considerable quantities, were it not afforded
                    in much greater abundance by various parts of Africa and South America. This
                    precious metal was collected in the Peninsula by the Phoenicians, and afterwards
                    by the Romans, who, according to the statements of the ancient writers, obtained
                    annually from Portugal, and from Galicia and the Asturias, 30,000 marcs, or
                    240,000 ounces, of gold.</p>
                <p>Amongst the places of Europe which are most, remarkable for mines of gold, and
                    also for auriferous sands, may be mentioned Schemnitz and Kremnitz in Hungary.
                    The gold of Schemnitz is accompanied by silver, lead, and iron pyrites, the
                    native matrix being quartz. The mines of Nagybanya, Kapnik, Felsoebanya,
                    Wiszbanya, and Olapos-janya, all yield gold; whilst those of Nagyag, Korosbanya,
                    Voeroespatah, Boitza, Csertesch, Fatzbay, Almas, Porkura, 3otschum, and
                    Stonischa, furnish chiefly gold and copper. The gold mine of Nagyag furnishes
                    gold in combination vith native tellurium. The whole produce of the Hungarian
                    mines amounts to 5200 marcs or 3250 lbs. troy of gold. At Edelfors in Sweden
                    native gold and auriferous iron pyrites are deposited in a vein of brown quartz
                    traversing a mountain of schistose hornstone. Gold is also met with disseminated
                    in the rock itself.</p>
                <p>We come now to the gold and platina district of Russia, of which Humboldt has
                    given a description in a letter to his friend Arago. “We spent a month,” says
                    he, “in visiting the gold mines of Borisoosk, the malachite mines of
                    Goumeselvoki and of l’agilsk, and the washings of gold and platinum. We were
                    astonished at the <hi rend="italic">pepitas</hi> (water-worn masses) of gold,
                    from two to three pounds, and even from eighteen to twenty pounds, found a few
                    inches below the turf, where they had lain unknown for ages. The position and
                    probable origin of these alluvia, mixed generally with fragments of greenstone,
                    chlorite slate, and serpentine, was one of the principal objects of this
                    journey. The gold annually procured from the washings amounts to 6000
                    kilogrammes. The discoveries made between 59 and 60 degrees of N. latitude, are
                    important. We possess the teeth of fossil elephants enveloped in these alluvia
                    of auriferous sand. Their formation, consequent on local irruptions and
                    levellings, is perhaps even posterior to the destruction of the large animals.
                    The amber and the lignites, which we discovered on the eastern side of the Ural,
                    are decidedly more ancient. With the auriferous sand are found grains of
                    cinnabar, native copper, ceylamites, garnets, little white zircons as brilliant
                    as diamonds, anatase, alvite, and other stones. It is very remarkable, that in
                    the middle and northern parts of the Ural, the platinum is found in abundance
                    only on the western European side. The rich gold washings of the Denidor family
                    at Nijneï-Tagilsk are on the Asiatic side, on the two acclivities of the
                    Bartiraya, where the alluvium of Vilkni alone has already produced more than
                    2800 lbs. of gold.</p>
                <p>“The platinum is found about a league to the east of the line of the separation
                    of waters (which must not be confounded with the axis of the high summits) on
                    the European side, near the course of the Oulka, at Sukoi Visnia; and at
                    Martian, Μ. Schevetsov discovered chromate of iron, containing grains of
                    platinum, which an able chemist at Katherineberg, Μ. Helm, has analysed. The
                    washings of platinum are so rich that a hundred poods (about 400 lbs. Russian)
                    of sand afford thirty, and some fifty, solotnicks; whilst the rich alluvia of
                    gold at Vilkni, and other gold washings on the Asiatic side, do not give more
                    than one and a half to two solotnicks of platinum to a hundred poods of sand. In
                    South America, a very low chain of the Cordilleras, that of Cali, also separates
                    the auriferous and non-platiniferous sands of the eastern declivity (Popayan)
                    from the sands of the isthmus of the Raspadura of Choco, which are very rich in
                    platinum, as well as gold. We possess pepitas of platinum many inches in length,
                    in which M. Rose has discovered beautiful groups of crystal of that, metal.</p>
                <p>“As to the greenstone porphyry of Laya, in which Μ. Engelhardt observed little
                    grains of platinum, we have examined it on the spot with much care; but the only
                    metallic grains which we have been able to detect in the rocks of Laya, and in
                    the greenstone of Mount Belayr-G&lt;ara, have, appeared to Μ. Rose, to be
                    sulphuret of iron; this phenomenon, however, will be a subject for new research.
                    Osmium and iridium have also a peculiar locality, not amongst the rich
                    platiniferous alluvia of Nijneï-Tagilsk, but near Belemboyevski and Kichtem. I
                    insist upon the geognostical characters drawn from the metals which accompany
                    the grains of platinum at Choco, Brazil, and in the Ural.”</p>

                    at the Russian mint; the produce of private mines in the Ural is included in the
                    return.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the year
                    182G, when Professor Engelhardt undertook a scientific journey into the Uralian
                    Mountains, he remarked that the sands in the neighbourhood of Koushra, and those
                    at the platina mines at Nijneï-Toura, strikingly resembled the Brazilian sands,
                    in which diamonds are found. Baron Humboldt, during a subsequent residence in
                    the same country, confirmed this resemblance; and examinations having been made,
                    by his advice, a young countryman employed in washing the auriferous sands on
                    the grounds of the Countess Porlier, discovered, on the 20th June 1830, a
                    diamond which is nothing inferior to those of Brazil; and soon afterwards many
                    others were found superior in weight to the first. Thus Russia has added this
                    source of riches to those which of late years she has obtained from the gold and
                    platina mines of the Ural chain of mountains {<hi rend="italic">Revue

                    to 10,000 poods in all, is not included in the above table. Since 1834, a very
                    considerable quantity of gold has been obtained by the washings on the Altai
                    Mountains. The mines of these mountains occur in the districts of Kolyvan,
                    Zmeof, Tcherepanofsky, Smenofsky, Nicoaisky, Philipofsky, and some others,
                    which, besides gold and silver, produce also a considerable quantity of iron,
                    copper, and lead.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Mines of Silver.</hi></p>
                <p>The silver mines hitherto discovered in France do not appear to be of any great
                    importance. The mine of Allemont, in the department of the Isère, is situated
                    near the summit of a lofty mountain, composed of beds of gneiss and primitive
                    limestone, inclined in different angles to the west. The veins are numerous, and
                    run in all directions. The ores are native silver, sulphuret of silver, red
                    silver, and a small quantity of muriate of silver; they are accompanied by
                    different ores of cobalt, antimony/nickel, &amp;c.; and the matrix is usually
                    clay mixed with iron, lime spar mixed with asbestos, and some other minerals.
                    Indications of silver have also been observed in the Vosges, where, in a vein of
                    gray copper ore, has been found a certain proportion of this precious metal.</p>
                <p>The silver mines of Spain are by far the oldest which are known. They were
                    wrought in the time of the Romans; and, trom the remains of the old workings, it
                    would appear that the operations had been carried on to a great extent. The mine
                    of Guadalcanal, in the Sierra Morena, upon the confines of Andalusia and
                    Estremadura, was formerly very rich, but seems to be now nearly exhausted. The
                    ore which it yields is red silver found in a matrix of compact carbonate of
                    lime.</p>
                <p>The mining territory of Freyberg in Saxony abounds with veins of silver, or with
                    lead containing a considerable proportion of that metal. The veins traverse
                    gneiss rocks, and are generally of quartz, lime, and fluor spar; the metallic
                    ores are argentiferous sulphuret of lead, red silver ore, and argentiferous gray
                    copper ore. The richest of the Saxon mines, that of Himmelfurst, is situated two
                    miles south-east of Freyberg. The elevation of the surface above the level of
                    the sea is 1346 feet, and that of the bottom of the mine 263, so that its depth
                    is 1083 feet, or 361 yards. There are five veins in this mine. The principal
                    vein <hi rend="italic">(teichflacke)</hi> is from one foot six inches to three
                    feet in width; the others are from six to twelve inches wide. The direction of
                    this vein is nearly north and south, and its “underlie” is west about three feet
                    per fathom. Some of the other veins intersect it. The ores consist of
                    argentiferous sulphuret of lead, native silver, sulphuret of silver, and red
                    silver; and their produce is from six to seven ounces of silver per quintal of
                    100 lbs., equivalent to 3∣ or 4½ parts of metal in 1000 parts of ore, or from
                    ∣ths to nearly one half per cent. The veinstone is quartz, pearl spar, and
                    calcareous spar; and the ores are accompanied by blende, spathose iron, and a
                    little iron and arsenical pyrites. The <hi rend="italic">Frankenshacht</hi> is
                    180 fathoms, and the adit at this shaft is 47 fathoms in depth. The quantity of
                    silver ore produced annually is stated at 630 tons, yielding 6160 lbs. troy of
                    silver, valued at about L.18,000. The total cost of the mine is L.9500, and the
                    clear profit of the proprietors L.3500. About 700 miners are employed, of whom
                    550 work under ground. The ores are delivered to the government reduction works
                    in the neighbourhood of Freyberg, where they are partly smelted and partly
                    amalgamated.</p>
                <p>The mines of Schemnitz and Kremnitz in Hungary have long been celebrated, not
                    only for their richness, but also for the immense extent to which the operations
                    have been carried. The rocks traversed by these veins are composed of an
                    argillaceous gray stone, mixed with quartz, schorl, or particles of lime spar,
                    and sometimes called metallic rock. There are three principal veins, the course
                    of which is nearly from north to south; they run parallel to the river Gran,
                    following even the windings of its channel. The dip or inclination of these
                    veins is generally from west to east, at an angle varying from 30° to 70°. One
                    of the capital veins alluded to, called the Spitaler vein, is joined at a
                    particular part by an argillaceous white vein which runs along with it on the
                    hanging side, and from the point of junction the latter is found to produce
                    silver. In this vein Baron Born discovered a petrified porpites or simple
                    madrepore included in sound sinople, a mineral resembling red jasper. This
                    petrifaction was found at a depth of about eighty-nine fathoms, in a level
                    driven on the vein. The second great vein at Schemnitz exhibits nearly the same
                    general characters as the first in regard to the distribution and nature of its
                    productions. In the hanging side, to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822537"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-2537-0256"/> wards the first vein, it contains lead ores; and
                    on the ledger side there is a layer of clay from one to four feet thick, in
                    which are imbedded nodules of lead ore, yielding from two to five ounces of
                    silver. The third great vein is more irregular in its formation than the two
                    others, sometimes rising vertically, and sometimes dipping in a contrary
                    direction from east to west. The ores of this vein are not very rich in silver,
                    but some of them afford a considerable proportion of gold. This mine appears to
                    have been wrought from a very early period, and the mining operations have been
                    carried to a vast extent. The gallery or level, called the Emperor Francis’s
                    Gallery, is that by which the whole of the mine¾ are drained and cleared of
                    water; it is carried through hard rock, and must have been a work of immense
                    labour and difficulty, being about five English miles in length. This gallery
                    was begun in 1748, and finished in 1765. The mountains around Kremnitz are
                    composed partly of the metallic rock already described, and partly of primitive
                    trap. At this place there is also a gold mine established on a large and rich
                    vein, which at the depth of 160 fathoms continued to be productive. The rock is
                    a white solid quartz, mixed with fine auriferous red and white silver ore. There
                    are also mines at Königsberg, a town some miles to the north-west of Schemnitz.
                    The vein is a gray quartz mixed with auriferous pyrites.</p>
                <p>The circle of Saaz in Bohemia abounds in various metallic ores, amongst which
                    those of silver greatly predominate. The prevailing rocks are gneiss and
                    argillaceous schistus. The veins at Katherineberg traverse gneiss, and run
                    generally in a north and south direction, parallel to the mountain in which they
                    are situated. But there are also some powerful veins which cross the mountain,
                    particularly one, which seems to be insensibly blended with the mountain rock,
                    and whose ores are rich silver and copper pyrites, with fluor spar, blende,
                    various copper ores, and sometimes native silver and copper. Joachimsthal, a
                    place in the same circle, is also celebrated for its mines. The prevailing rocks
                    are gray, micaceous, and quartzose clay slate, and the surrounding mountains
                    have a gentle declivity towards the south, but run in lofty ridges to the east,
                    north, and west, and are intersected by deep valleys; an inequality of surface
                    which enables the miners to open numerous galleries converging to the south, and
                    also towards the valley in which stands the town of Joachimsthal. The whole
                    galleries and works of this district are divided into six different fields, and
                    are drained by two deep drifts or levels; one of these runs in a direct line
                    1600 fathoms, and, including its several branches, is 4500 fathoms in length;
                    the other runs in a direct line 1500 fathoms, and its total length extends to
                    5600 fathoms. The depth of the former under the summit of the mountain is 170,
                    and that of the latter 190 fathoms; but the operations in the mines have been
                    carried to a much greater depth; indeed, excepting those of the Tyrol, they are
                    considered as amongst the deepest in the world. The metallic veins of this
                    mining district are disturbed by dykes of red porphyry or trap, called by the
                    miners <hi rend="italic">combs.</hi> The course of these dykes is very
                    irregular, and their thickness varies from a few inches to forty fathoms; they
                    also unite with metallic veins, and, either running parallel or crossing them,
                    improve, disturb their course, or render them barren. It has been observed that
                    those dykes which run from north to south commonly disturb the course of the
                    metallic veins, which they traverse in a cont⅛ry direction. A dyke of this
                    description, crossing one of the principal veins of the district, was discovered
                    on the sole of one of the great levels, where the thickness was not less than
                    from thirty to forty fathoms. At this place, which is 150 fathoms below the
                    surface, and 3000 fathoms distant from the door of the gallery, an entire tree
                    was discovered.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>At the
                    time when this discovery took place, the tree in question was supposed to be a
                    production of the antediluvian world. The exterior appearance, the fibrous
                    structure, the concentric circles, the ramification of the substance into round
                    branches the soft unpetrified bark which adhered to them, and something like
                    leaves found in different parts of it, left no doubt, in the minds of those who
                    had an opportunity of observing it, that it was a vegetable production converted
                    into stony matter. Its specific characters, in as far as these were observed,
                    have not been stated. The tree found in Craigleith quarry, also at a great depth
                    below the surface, was supposed to have belonged to the coniferous species. Soon
                    after the discovery of the former, part of the level gave way, and the water
                    increasing, rendered it impossible afterwards to examine the spot.</p></note>
                    The thickness of the veins varies from one inch to two feet, and the veinstones
                    are a whitish or bluish clay, argillaceous slate, and reddish hornstone or
                    petrosilex. The ores found in this district are, native silver, vitreous silver
                    ore, red silver ore, and white silver ore. The silver mines of Berestadt were
                    formerly rich in native silver, and other ores of that metal.</p>
                <p>The silver mines of Stahlberg in Sweden are situated about twenty-eight English
                    miles from Upsal. The ore is an argentiferous galena, in a compact limestone,
                    and produces a marc or a marc and a half of silver per quintal. These mines have
                    been wrought to the depth of 150 fathoms; and the annual profits at an average
                    amount to about L.4000, of which one eighth is paid to the state. The silver
                    mine of Königsberg in Norway is represented as much richer than any of those in
                    Sweden. The mountains are composed of strata nearly vertical; their general
                    direction is from north to south, with an inclination towards the east; and they
                    are generally parallel to each other, but sometimes take a wavy or zigzag
                    course. Some of the strata are composed of mica mixed with garnets and lime
                    spar; others consist of a grayish-white quartz mixed with fine black mica, a
                    httle carbonate of lime, and reddish hornstone; some are composed of alternate
                    layers of quartz and mica, and others of a ferruginous rock. The veins cut these
                    strata transversely, and are from half an inch to two feet and a half in
                    thickness. The ores are chiefly native silver, enormous masses of which have
                    sometimes been found,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Of

                    The matrix of the ore is granulated limestone, sometimes foliated or mixed with
                    fluor spar and oxide of iron. This mine is most productive in that part where
                    the veins traverse the strata of ferruginous rock. The greatest depth to which
                    the operations have been carried is about 160 fathoms, and the annual produce
                    was at one time nearly 5000 lbs. of silver.</p>
                <p>We have already, under the former head, adverted to the mineral riches of that
                    part of the Altaï chain of mountains which is included in Asiatic Russia. The
                    silver mines of Zmeof are situated between the rivers Obi and Irtisch, in a
                    tract extending from 50 to 52 degrees of north latitude. I he annual produce of
                    these mines is stated at 60,000 marcs of silver, which is alloyed with about
                    three per cent, of gold. The mines of Nertschink in Dauri or Daouria, near the
                    river Amur, yield argentiferous galena, producing annually about 36,000 marcs of
                    silver, containing about one and a half per cent, of gold.</p>

                    spots.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It appears rather
                    singular that a country so rich in almost every variety of mineral produce as
                    Great Britain should be entirely destitute of quicksilver, more especially as
                    the coal formation, in which that metal is most commonly found, is here so
                    largely developed. There is, however, a passage in Bishop Watson’s Chemical
                    Essays, in which be mentions the circumstance of quicksilver having been found
                    in a native state at Berwick-upon-Tweed; and the same thing is stated in the
                    Commercial Magazine (vol. ii. p. 204), and also in Williams’ Natural History of
                    the Mineral Kingdom (vol. ii. p. 378). This discovery is said to have been made
                    in digging out clay for the foundation of a house in the street called Hyde
                    Hill, in the town of Berwick; and it appears to have taken place more than half
                    a century ago. The clay being dug out, lay for some time where it had been
                    deposited, and the mercury was observed to exude from the small fissures or
                    cracks which were formed in it as it dried, being apparently distributed
                    throughout the whole mass of the clay. Many years afterwards, when some workmen
                    penetrated into the same bed of clay, it appeared to be impregnated with
                    mercury, which ran out in small globules. It is remarkable that so important a
                    mineralogical fact did not attract more attention, and lead to some examination
                    of the bed of clay, which appeared to be thus impregnated with quicksilver in
                    the native state.</p></note> The ores of this metal exist in various states, as
                    in that of native mercury, alloy, or amalgam; in that of sulphuret or cinnabar,
                    which is sometimes impregnated with a bituminous clay; and in that of salt, or
                    muriate of mercury. The ores of mercury are but rarely met with in primitive
                    mountains, the greater proportion being found in secondary rocks, as in
                    bituminous schistus, compact limestone, ferruginous sandstone, and sometimes
                    even in ferruginous clay; and these ores are usually distributed in large
                    confused masses, seldom in regular veins. The metallic ores which usually
                    accompany those of mercury are sulphuret of lead, sulphuret of zinc, haematites,
                    iron pyrites, silver, and various ores of copper.</p>
                <p>The principal mines of quicksilver on the continent of Europe are those of
                    Almaden in Spain, Idria in Carniola, and the Palatinate, or that part of the
                    Bavarian dominions which is westward of the Rhine.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mines of Almaden</hi> —The most ancient mine of quicksilver
                    known in the world is that of Almaden in Spain. According to Pliny, it was
                    wrought five hundred years before the commencement of the common era; and in his
                    time 10,000 lbs. of cinnabar (sulphuret of mercury) were transported to Rome,
                    for the purpose of being employed in painting. This celebrated mine, or rather
                    cluster of mines, is situated in a branch of the Sierra Morena, upon the
                    confines of Andalusia, about fifteen leagues to the north of Seville. The hill
                    which contains it is about a thousand fathoms in length, six hundred in breadth,
                    and a hundred and twenty in height. It is composed of the same materials as the
                    neighbouring mountains, which consist of sandstone; and its surface exhibits two
                    inclined planes, which, uniting at the summit, form a crest of rock, that is
                    entirely bare, and spotted with sulphuret of mercury. The village of Almaden,
                    from which the mines take their name, is built chiefly on the cinnabar itself.
                    The two principal veins, which traverse the mountain longitudinally and
                    intersect it vertically, are from two to fourteen feet in thickness, and throw
                    out branches in different directions; but towards the middle of the mountain
                    they unite, and form a mass of mineral about a hundred feet in thickness. The
                    veinstones are of the same sandstone as that of which the mountain itself is
                    composed. The more finely-grained matrix affords the greatest quantity of
                    cinnabar; and some of the ore is so extremely rich as to yield nearly ten ounces
                    of mercury in each pound; but from other ores only three ounces can be
                    extracted. The sides of the vein are formed of a black slate in a state of
                    decomposition, and frequently contain a good deal of cinnabar, as well as large,
                    round, and flat masses of pyrites, exhibiting internally some spots of cinnabar.
                    In other parts, there have been discovered veins of aluminous schistus and iron
                    ore, running in the same direction with the mountain, and yielding specimens of
                    ore, in which the iron, the sulphur, and the quicksilver are found closely
                    combined. This fact, which has been noticed in other mines of mercury, shows
                    that nature sometimes produces combinations which cannot be effected by any
                    known process of art. Previously to the year 1752, the annual produce of the
                    mines of Almaden amounted to be tween 5000 and 6000 quintals of mercury, which
                    was exported to Mexicofor the purposes of amalgamation, in extracting gold and
                    silver, particularly the latter, from their ores. About that period, the
                    quicksilver mines of Guancavelica in Peru being nearly exhausted, the mercury
                    required for amalgamation in South America was exported from Almaden; so that
                    the annual amount of quicksilver extracted from this grand reservoir increased
                    from 6000 quintals to 16,000, 18,000, and even 20,000 quintals. At the present
                    day, the mines of Almaden continue to be by far the most productive in the
                    world.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mines of Idria</hi> —The celebrated quicksilver mines in the
                    vicinity of Idria, in Carniola, are situated about eight leagues from Trieste,
                    on the boundary of the province of Friuli. The town of Idria, which gives name
                    to the mines, stands in a deep valley which is surrounded by lofty mountains <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> limestone, and exhibits a dark-coloured slate included
                    between two beds of limestone, rising to the surface at an angle of from 45°
                    to75°. The ores, consisting of native mercury and cinnabar, are deposited in
                    this schistus, which is about sixty feet thick, and of very considerable extent.
                    The position of the metalliferous stratum is variously inclined, and sometimes
                    horizontal^ The depth of the principal shafts by which the ores are brought up
                    exceeds 120 fathoms. The colour of the schistus from which the ore is obtained
                    varies in different parts of the mine. When it is of a whitish hue, it is poor
                    in metal, but when the colour changes to a blackish shade, the ore yields about
                    sixty per cent. The metallic bed is sometimes intersected by vertical strata,
                    which, according as they are hard or soft, produce opposite effects; for, in the
                    former case, the ore in a great measure disappears, but when they are softer and
                    more brittle than the metalliferous bed itself, the ore becomes more abundant.
                    In some places there occurs a hard slaty rock, containing small shining
                    globules, and yielding little more than two per cent, of quicksilver, called <hi
                    rend="italic">coral ore;</hi> and in others there are found small veins of coal
                    impregnated with ore, and affording about the same proportion of pure mercury.
                    The mines of Idria were discovered in the year 1497. The mountain in which they
                    were first established has been exhausted, and the operations are now carried on
                    in an opposite mountain, whence, it is said, a supply of mercury to almost any
                    extent might be obtained; but the quantity extracted is limited to between 3000
                    and 4000 quintals, which are mostly retained for home consumption, being used
                    for the amalgamation of the gold and silver ores, which are found in greater
                    abundance in the Austrian states than in any other country in Europe, except
                    Russia, which, however, derives part of her supplies from her Asiatic
                    dominions.</p>
                <p>The following particulars respecting the mines of Idria are extracted from
                    Silliman’s <hi rend="italic">Journal,</hi> to which they appear to have been
                    communicated by an officer of the American navy, who had made a pedestrian tour
                    through Germany, and had, in the course of his travels, visited Idria.</p>
                <p>“The mines have nothing corresponding to the ideas of terror which we are apt to
                    connect with such places, except the atmosphere, which throughout the mine must
                    be strongly impregnated with mercurial vapour, and is constantly<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193822563" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2563-0258"/> producing salivation amongst
                    the workmen. Having descended by 727 steps, reaching to a depth of 120 fathoms,
                    we arrived at the region where the cinnabar is chiefly procured. The mining
                    operations are chiefly carried on in galleries, the friable nature of the rock
                    seldom admitting of larger chambers. The cinnabar is in strata of from two to
                    six inches in thickness, and of a variety of colours, from dark to light red,
                    the quicksilver being sometimes mixed with it, and sometimes occurring in the
                    intervening strata of earth or stone. Sometimes the cinnabar is of a brilliant
                    red, and once I found it in small crystals, but such specimens are rare; it is
                    generally of a dull .red colour, and the stone is so brittle, that nothing 'more
                    than a pickaxe is required. The strata affording the quicksilver appear to have
                    no particular direction, and occupy about one third or one half of the entire
                    mass of the rock. Proceeding a short distance, however, we came to the galleries
                    where the cinnabar is less common, and the quicksilver is the chief object of
                    search. It occurs here sometimes imbedded in a friable rock, sometimes in a kind
                    of earth in appearance and hardness resembling talcose slate, but principally in
                    the former. Generally it is in particles too minute for the naked eye, but often
                    wþen the rock is broken small globules present themselves, varying from a size
                    just large enough to be seen, up to that of a common pin’s head. These globules
                    are not distributed at random throughout the mass, but the substance in which
                    they occur forms strata usually about one inch or two in thickness.”</p>
                <p>The traveller, descending still lower, soon came to the richest part of the mine.
                    Here the gangue or matrix consists almost entirely of talcose earth, and the
                    globules are so large that when it is broken they roll out and fall to the
                    bottom of the gallery. The labourers are relieved every four hours, being
                    unable, from the state of the atmosphere, to work longer than this at one time.
                    In the other parts of the mine they work eight hours. The total number employed
                    in the mine is 360, divided into three companies, each of which works eight
                    hours. Their pay is only from fifteen to seventeen kreutzers a day, the usual
                    pay of day-labourers in Germany. Several of them appeared to be suffering from
                    the effects of the mercury. Having returned to the upper mine, the traveller
                    next proceeded to examine the washing-rooms, which are situated a few hundred
                    yards from the mines.</p>
                <p>“The gangues containing the metal are carried to this house; and if the ore is of
                    the earthy kind, it is broken up, and thrown upon large sieves, by means of
                    which the loose or native quicksilver, called <hi rend="italic">her e
                    Jungfrau,</hi> or virgin quicksilver, is separated from the earth; the latter is
                    then cast into shallow boxes, open at the ends and a little inclined, and a
                    gentle stream of water being made to pass over it, a rake is used, and the
                    earthy matter is carried off. There are seven of these boxes in succession, and
                    by the time the residuum reaches the last of them, it resembles a heavy gray
                    powder, and is sufficiently pure to be carried to the vapour furnace. The stony
                    fragments require only a slight washing to cleanse them from the outward earthy
                    impurities.</p>
                <p>“The furnace is half a mile lower down the valley, and at the extreme end of the
                    village. It consists of a circular walled building, about forty feet diameter by
                    sixty in height, on each side of which there is a continuous range of chambers
                    ten or twelve feet square, and nearly as many in height; by means of small
                    square openings in the partition wails, the air is allowed to pass from the
                    centre building to the remotest. Each has also a door communicating with the
                    external air. These buildings are all of stone, and are plastered within. The
                    gangue, after being prepared in the washing-house, as already described, is
                    removed to this edifice, and placed in earthen pans four inches deep and fifteen
                    in diameter, which are piled up so as to fill the centre building. The doors of
                    the chambers are then carefully walled up; and a strong fire having been lighted
                    under the centre building, the quicksilver rises in the form of vapour, and
                    passing into the small chambers, is there condensed by the cold atmosphere
                    around them. Some of the gangue is brought here in the form of the native rock.
                    The expansive power of the vapour, together with the heat of the fire, is
                    sufficient to cause the rock to disintegrate, and thus to allow the escape of
                    the quicksilver. When this process is over, the doorways of the chambers are
                    once more opened, and the quicksilver, which is found chiefly adhering in drops
                    to the sides and ceiling, is scraped off, and running into a hollow in the
                    floor, is taken thence to the cleaning and bottling room. It appears to act on
                    the mortar of the chambers, for I found the latter flaky, and the crevices all
                    filled with small globules.</p>
                <p>“The cleaning process is very simple, a piece of canvass being merely spread over
                    a funnel, and the quicksilver being made to pass through this, comes out
                    sufficiently pure. That intended for home consumption is then tied up in
                    sheep-skins, while that for exportation is put in iron bottles, large enough to
                    contain sixty-eight pounds. The furnace is kept in operation only during the
                    winter months, and then the vapour which escapes from it is a serious annoyance
                    to the town; they have a blast three times every fortnight.”</p>

                    of Kreuznach, a town on the southern frontier of the Prussian territory, and
                    they lie chiefly between that place and Wolfstein. This elevated range forms the
                    northern prolongation of the primary chain of the Vosges, and rises to its
                    greatest altitude in the porphyritic summit of the Donnersberg or Mont-Tonnerre.
                    They are entirely within the Bavarian dominions, being in the immediate vicinity
                    of Bingart, Nieder Moschel, Ober Moschel, and Alzens. They are stated to have
                    been worked for about five centuries; and both the excavations below, and the
                    immense piles of attle on the surface, prove that some have been wrought to a
                    considerable extent. The working indeed has never been given up for any length
                    of time; but this part of Germany having been the theatre of the early campaigns
                    of the French revolutionary army, the mines were for a time suspended, and have
                    never since been effectually resumed. Prior to this period their produce must
                    have been considerable, as they were reported, by a commission of French
                    engineers, to have yielded annually 67,000 lbs. of quicksilver.</p>
                <p>The deposits of quicksilver are chiefly worked in the sandstone formation, but in
                    some places these appear to extend into the slate. The sandstone is of a pale
                    brownish or grayish colour, usually very compact, and approaching the nature of
                    hornstone. In some of the mines, strata of a much softer description, and of an
                    argillaceous nature, are contained in the sandstone. The quicksilver occurs
                    neither in a bed nor in a vein, but forms rather what may be termed a
                    metalliferous channel of ground, of considerable breadth and extent. The
                    direction of these channels approaches that of north and south, but in some
                    mines there are two or more crossing one another. Their breadth is quite
                    undefined, but they are worked from five to six feet in width, and appear to
                    descend almost perpendicularly into the rock. In these channels exist thin
                    fissures, called <hi rend="italic">klefts,</hi> which, although in themselves
                    unproductive, seem to be chiefly depended upon by the miners in guiding their
                    researches. The quicksilver is mostly found in the joints of the rock, which, in
                    the vicinity of the <hi rend="italic">hlefts,</hi> appear to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193822576" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2576-0259"/> be more or less filled with
                    it to an indefinite extent; but whether it is of contemporaneous formation with
                    the rock, or deposited in cracks which had subsequently opened in it, has not
                    been ascertained. The depth to which the quicksilver extends is also unknown,
                    but none of the mines in this district exceeds 300 feet in depth. The ore is
                    cinnabar, which varies from a bright to a dull red colour, traversing the mass
                    of the rock in all directions, sometimes very abundantly; but its distribution
                    does not appear to follow any general law, or to be exclusively limited to any
                    particular strata. Rich specimens often occur, containing, along with cinnabar,
                    a good deal of native quicksilver disseminated in small globules; but these bear
                    a very small proportion to the poorer ores, or rather the masses of rock
                    containing thin veins of cinnabar. Rich stones of ore, such as are often found
                    in the more productive parts of the deposits, yield from five or six to eighteen
                    or twenty per cent, of quicksilver, and picked specimens as much as fifty or
                    sixty per cent.; but, taking the general average of the stuff raised from the
                    mines, the produce does not probably exceed three per cent.</p>
                <p>In the vicinity of Bingart the mines are situated on the declivity of the
                    mountain, at an elevation of about a thousand feet above the valley, and are
                    consequently worked chiefly by adits, which enter the mines at depths varying
                    from twenty to thirty lachters. In some of the mines the workings above the
                    adits are considerable, and “sinks” have penetrated to a depth of nearly twenty
                    lachters below. These mines have been opened chiefly in the sandstone, but one
                    of them appears to extend into the slate.</p>
                <p>The Stahlberg mine is situated near Ober Mðschel. It is very ancient, and has
                    been extensively worked, the depth being near 300 feet, and the longitudinal
                    extent of the excavations considerable. It is situated on elevated ground, and
                    drained by an adit, which is driven into the workings nearly at the deepest
                    point; but there are no shafts, access being afforded by levels driven into the
                    side of the mountain. The mine is still worked to some, extent, and produces a
                    good deal of cinnabar. The prevailing rock is a compact sandstone or hornstone,
                    occasionally containing softer argillaceous strata. The great magnitude and
                    extent of the excavations, and the very peculiar manner in which they have been
                    formed, render the appearance of this mine exceedingly picturesque. The
                    excavations consist of a series of irregular chambers fantastically over-arched,
                    and communicating with one another. The height is often considerable, and the
                    width is in some cases twenty or thirty feet. The access to these chambers, and
                    also from one to another, is by rude staircases hewn out in the solid rock, thus
                    furnishing a novel and easy mode of subterranean communication. The unusual
                    light and the broad shadows produced by the lamps of the miners, the spacious
                    but irregular excavations, and the perspective of the rude winding steps by
                    which the various chambers of the mine are entered, form altogether a striking
                    and picturesque scene. See the annexed sketch.</p>
                <p>The present operations are chiefly confined to breaking down old pillars and
                    masses of rocky ore left standing in various parts of the mine; and even from
                    these sources considerable produce is obtained.· The cinnabar is generally
                    disseminated throughout the rock, but abounds rather more in some strata than in
                    others. The miners here are but little affected by the mercurial vapours, owing
                    to the spaciousness, dryness, and good ventilation of the workings, with the
                    easy mode of access to them.</p>
                <p>The Landsberg mine is about three miles distant from that of Stahlberg, being
                    situated on the declivity of a lofty mountain, covered with wood, and crowned
                    with the ruins of an ancient castle. It is equally extensive with the Stahlberg
                    mine, and has been worked in a similar manner, although at present the
                    operations are carried on upon a limited scale. The mode here practised of
                    reducing quicksilver is one of the simplest operations in metallurgy, consisting
                    merely in a process of distillation.</p>
                <p>The furnace in which it is performed is about twenty-four feet in length, twelve
                    in breadth, and six or seven in height; fires are placed at each end, and the
                    heat, passing first through the body of the furnace, goes off by a crossflue in
                    the middle. Forty-eight iron retorts, twenty-four on each side, are arranged in
                    the interior of the furnace, in two rows one above the other, so as to be
                    exposed to the heat in its passage from the fires to the cross-flue in the
                    middle by which it escapes; and the necks of the retorts pass through apertures
                    in the wall, so that smaller retorts upon the outside of the furnace can be
                    luted on to them. This will be better understood by reference to the annexed
                    sketches, the first of which represents an end view, and the second a cross
                    section of the furnace.</p>
                <p>In fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> represents the body of the furnace

                    large retorts arranged in the body of the furnace in which the ore is exposed to
                    heat, thus:</p>
                <p>From this explanation of the construction of the furnace, the process of
                    reduction will be easily understood. The ore, after being carefully picked and
                    broken, to separate the worthless matter, is put into the large iron retorts,
                    together with a certain quantity of pulverized lime, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193822589" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2589-0260"/> and exposed to a moderate
                    heat, which soon drives off any moisture that may be contained in it. The outer
                    set of retorts is then luted on, and a much stronger heat applied, which, being
                    continued for several hours, at length volatilizes the quicksilver, and drives
                    it in the form of vapour into the small retorts outside, where it soon becomes
                    condensed, and assumes the metallic form.</p>
                <p>The Bavarian mines are now in the possession of an English company, and are
                    therefore likely to be worked with spirit and success. They possess the
                    advantage of being drained to a great extent by levels, and are therefore almost
                    free from water, whilst coal for the reduction of the ore may be obtained in
                    their immediate vicinity. From the nature of the deposits, it appears that they
                    are capable of yielding an immense mass of rock more or less impregnated with
                    quicksilver; and from the ease with which this produce may be obtained, and the
                    occasional richness of some portions of the mass, these mines appear to offer a
                    very fair field for enterprise.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Near Selvena, in the territory of Sienna, in Italy, cinnabar has been discovered;
                    it is distributed in irregular masses, and forms thin veins in a clay mixed with
                    argillaceous marl, but does not appear to be of much importance. There are two
                    mines of mercury at Zalathna, in Transylvania. The ore of the one is cinnabar,
                    which is extracted from a vein in a matrix of quartz and lime spar, traversing a
                    black argillaceous slate and sandstone. The ore of the other mine is granulated
                    cinnabar, included in a vein which runs in limestone. The annual produce of
                    these mines amounted, according to Baron Born, to about 6000 lbs. of pure
                    quicksilver.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Born’s

                <p>IV. MEXICAN MINES.</p>
                <p>Mexico although it contains a variety of metals, as iron, lead, copper, tin,
                    zinc, antimony, arsenic, and manganese, is chiefly celebrated for its gold and
                    silver mines, particularly the latter, which, for the most part, yield also a
                    proportion of gold. According to Humboldt, there are in New Spain no less than
                    three thousand mines of the precious metals, divided into thirty-seven
                    districts, each of which had formerly a council of mines called <hi
                    rend="italic">a deputation.</hi> The ores are generally disposed in layers, and
                    masses are comparatively of but rare occurrence. At present, in all the mines,
                    the veins of ore are chiefly worked; and these occur in the primitive and
                    transition rock. But of the different kinds of rock in which veins are found,
                    the porphyries are considered as affording the richest ore. At the beginning of
                    the present century, Humboldt conjectured that, in the northern part of Mexico
                    particularly in the Sierra Madre, great mineral wealth would be discovered in
                    the rocks of secondary formation; and this conjecture has been confirmed by
                    subsequent inquiry and examination. “The Sierra Madre,” says Mr Ward, “has been
                    traversed seven times between Oaxaca and Chihuahua, by a very spirited and
                    intelligent English^traveller, Mr Glennie, whose opinion of its riches confirms
                    all that had been surmised in earlier days; and his conviction of the advantages
                    to be derived from mining speculations in that direction has induced the
                    directors of the United Mexican Company to entrust him with the formation of an
                    establishment at Jesus Maria (one hundred leagues west of Chihuahua, upon the
                    slope of the Sierra Madre), which I consider as a step towards that revolution
                    in the mining affairs of Mexico the probability of which, in the course of
                    twenty or thirty years, I cannot but look forward to.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mexicoin 1827, vol. II. p. 135. Mr Ward’s
                    work, here referred to, will be found to contain the most ample information on
                    the subject of the mines of Mexico He has treated the subject in four sections,
                    embracing almost every point of any importance connected with it. In the first
                    he gives a comparative statement of the produce of these mines during a double
                    term of fifteen years before and since the revolution of 1810, with an account
                    of the exportation of specie during the same period. The second section treats
                    of the mining system of Mexicobefore 1810; the changes which occurred from that
                    time till 1823, when the idea of foreign companies was first suggested; the
                    number of these companies established in Mexico the extent of the undertakings
                    in which they are engaged; the difficulties with which they have to contend; and
                    their progress and condition in 1827∙ In the third, Mr Ward discusses the
                    question, whether the large capitals which have been invested in the mines by
                    British subjects are likely to be productive of adequate returns, and within
                    what period, to the adventurers; and also whether those returns are likely to
                    make the general produce of the country equal or even exceed the annual average
                    amount derived from the mines before the year 1810; to each of which he gives a
                    very confident answer in the affirmative. And, in the last section, he makes
                    some general observations on Mexicoas a mining country, and considers the
                    probability of her being enabled, by her mineral treasures, to multiply her
                    commercial relations with Great Britain, and also to acquit herself of the
                    obligations arising from loans contracted in that country. Much of the
                    information contained in these sections is, no doubt, purely commercial; but
                    there is also a great deal which has an immediate relation to the subject under
                    our immediate consideration; and in Mr Ward’s Personal Narrative there will also
                    be found many interesting details respecting the principal mines and mining
                    districts of Mexico</p></note> The gold and silver ore obtained in Mexicobeing
                    much more remarkable for its abundance than its richness, there can be little
                    doubt that if the layers and veins of the Sierra Madre should prove much more
                    productive than those which have been worked upon the table-land, the
                    consequence must be such as Mr Ward has anticipated.</p>
                <p>The great mining districts of New Spain, arranged according to the proportional
                    quantities of silver which they yield, have been classified by Humboldt thus
                    :—Guanaxuato, in the intendancy of the same name; Catorce, in the intendancy of
                    San Luis Potosi; Zacatecas, in that of the same name; Real del Monte, in the
                    intendancy of Mexico Bolanos, in that of Guadalaxara; Guarismey, in the
                    intendancy of Durango; Sombre rete, in that of Zacatecas; Tasco, in the
                    intendancy of Mexico Batopilas, in that of Durango; Zimapan, in the intendancy
                    of Mexico Fresnillo, in that of Zacatecas; Ramos, in the intendancy of San Luis
                    Potosi; and Parral, in that of Durango. But, from various causes, particularly
                    the suspension of mining operations consequent on the revolution of 1810, and
                    still more from the recent application of British capital to the working of the
                    Mexican mines, this arrangement would require certain modifications to render
                    it, in all respects, applicable to the actual circumstances of New Spain. At the
                    beginning of the present century, for instance, the richest of all the Mexican
                    mines was that of Valenciana; but at the present time the most productive mines
                    are those of Veta Grande. To exhibita view of the change which, from whatever
                    cause or causes, has since taken place; to indicate results which can only be
                    appreciated in juxtaposition; and, at the same time, to convey, in a condensed
                    form, other information which can scarcely fail to prove interesting; we shall
                    here introduce a comparative table, showing at one view the points both of
                    similarity and of contrast in these two celebrated mines.</p>

                    The greater part of the gold of Mexicois found in the veins of silver ore,
                    either native or mixed with silver, from which it is separated by washing; the
                    proportion being seldom more than 1 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ounce in the
                    100 lbs. The silver supplied by the veins of this country is extracted from a
                    great variety of ores, which, from the nature of their mixture, bear some
                    analogy to those of Saxony, the Hartz, and Hungary. The greatest quantity is
                    derived from the sulphuret of silver, from arsenical and antimonial gray copper,
                    from muriate of silver, from prismatic black silver, and from red silver ore.
                    Amongst these ores we do not include native silver, because it is not found in
                    sufficient abundance to form any considerable proportion of the total produce of
                    the Mexican mines. Sulphuret of silver and black prismatic silver are common in
                    the veins of Guanaxuato and of Zacatecas, as well as in those of Real del Monte.
                    The richest gray copper ore is that of the Sierra de Pino, and the mines of
                    Ramos. The antimonial gray copper ore is found at Tasco, and in the mine of
                    Rayas, south-east from Valenciana. The muriate of silver, which seldom occurs in
                    the veins of Europe, is very abundant in the mines of Catorce, Fresnillo, and
                    the Cerro San Pedro, near the town of San Luis Potosi. That of Fresnillo is
                    frequently of an olive-green, passing into a deeper shade of the same colour. In
                    the veins of Catorce the muriate of silver is accompanied with molybdate and
                    phosphate of lead. The red silver ore constitutes a principal part of the wealth
                    of Sombrerete, Cosala, and Villalta, in the province of Oaxaca; and from the
                    famous mine La Veta Ne-gra, near Sombrerete, more than 425,000 lbs. troy of
                    silver have been extracted in the space of little more than six months. The true
                    white silver ore is very rare in Mexico but its grayish white variety, rich in
                    lead, is found in the intendancy of Sonora, where it is accompanied with
                    argentiferous galena, red silver, brown blende, quartz, and sulphate of barytes.
                    The martial pyrites found at Pachuca yields as much as three marcs of silver to
                    the hundredweight of ore. In some parts the operations of the miner are directed
                    to a mixture of brown oxide of iron and native silver, disseminated in particles
                    imperceptible to the naked eye. This ochreous compound formed the object of
                    considerable operations at the mines of Angangueo, in the intendancy of
                    Valladolid, and at Yxtepexi, in the province of Oaxaca.</p>
                <p>Native silver is much less abundant in America than is generally supposed; yet it
                    has been found in considerable masses, sometimes weighing considerably more than
                    400 lbs. avoirdupois, in the mines of Batopilas, in New Biscay. In the veins of
                    Mexico as well as in the mountains of Europe, native silver is constantly
                    accompanied by <hi rend="italic">glaserz</hi> or prismatic silver, particularly
                    in the mines of Sombrercte, Madrono, Ramos, Zacatecas, Hapujaha, and Sierra de
                    Penos. Throughout Mexico the ore, though infinitely more abundant, is much
                    poorer than in Europe. The average proportion of silver obtained from the common
                    ore is stated at from 0∙0018 to 0∙0025; in other words, sixteen hundred ounces
                    of ore contain only from three to four ounces of silver. “The great mass of
                    Mexican ore is so poor,” says Garces, in his work on Amalgamation, “that the
                    three millions of marcs of silver which the kingdom yields in good years are
                    extracted from ten millions of quintals of ore, partly by heat, and partly by
                    amalgamation.” Indeed, from the vast quantity of silver which Mexicohad for
                    centuries poured into the circulation of Europe (sometimes amounting, previously
                    to the revolution of 1810, to between four and five millions sterling annually),
                    the most extravagant notions were at one time entertained respecting the riches
                    of the Mexican mines; and even the best-informed and the most scientific of
                    travellers, Baron Humboldt, confesses that he had been misled by this erroneous
                    opinion, and was surprised to find that the silver ores of Mexicowere, as
                    already stated, even poorer than those of Europe, and that the mean produce of
                    the whole mass extracted from the mines was only about one part of metal in four
                    hundred of ore, or about <hi rend="italic">one quarter per cent.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> a proportion which probably does not differ much from that
                    which is obtained at the present time.</p>
                <p>Of the whole mass of the Mexican ores, a small part only, not perhaps above one
                    fifth, is sufficiently rich in metal to render it adapted to the process of
                    smelting; and the remainder is therefore submitted to that of amalgamation, a
                    method which is costly, from the loss both of mercury and of the precious metals
                    which attends it. Much has been done by the English mining companies to lessen
                    this double evil; but a great deal still remains to be effected, and the high
                    price of quicksilver renders any further amelioration of the process a matter of
                    the first importance to all parties concerned in the working of the Mexican
                    mines.</p>
                <p>This process, as actually performed, has been described by Gamboa in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Commentaries on the Mining Ordinances of Spain</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but, from the complicated nature of the operation itself,
                    the obscurity of the technical terms employed, and the difficulty of
                    distinguishing the various changes, chemical and mechanical, which are effected,
                    a description in which the whole subject is as much as possible simplified, and
                    these changes traced in succession as they occur, may not be unacceptable or
                    uninteresting to the reader. The account which follows is more particularly
                    applicable to the process as performed at the extensive hacienda of Sauceda,
                    belonging to the Bolanos Company, because of it very minute information has been
                    received; but it will nevertheless be found to correspond in almost every
                    respect with the general practice pursued in the various mining districts of

                    the air and moisture the magistral is decomposed, and its sulphuric acid set
                    free. The sulphuric acid, thus liberated, rapidly combines with the water
                    contained in the moist <hi rend="italic">lama,</hi> and great heat is thus
                    evolved, which favours the decomposition of the ores, and the subsequent

                    with its base sulphate of soda, or Glauber salt. Owing to its strong affinity
                    for silver, the muriatic acid liberated from the saltierra combines with the
                    silver of the ores, and forms muriate or chloride of silver, whilst the portion
                    in excess unites with the copper and iron of the <hi rend="italic"

                    then thoroughly incorporated with the mass, thus forming amalgam. When the first
                    portion of quicksilver is supposed to have been quite taken up, a second supply
                    is added, called <hi rend="italic">el cebo.</hi> Finally, a third quantity of

                    process the earthy impurities are kept in a state of suspension, and finally
                    carried away by the refuse water, which flows off at the top.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chemical Changes.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The lime appears
                    to act by combining with any portion of the sulphuric acid which may be in
                    excess, and thus forming sulphate of lime or gypsum. The superabundant portion
                    of sulphuric acid being thus taken up, the evolution of heat by its absorption
                    of water is prevented, and the <hi rend="italic">torta</hi> consequently cools.
                    The mercury, owing to its strong affinity for silver, readily combines with it,
                    forming an amalgam, the muriate appearing to have been previously decomposed by
                    the iron of the <hi rend="italic">magistral.</hi> Owing to the necessarily
                    imperfect contact of the minute particles of the two metals, the formation of
                    the amalgam is very gradual; hence the mercury is added at intervals, so as to
                    take up the remaining particles of silver, to insure which it is always greatly
                    in excess. During the washing in the <hi rend="italic">lavadero,</hi> the
                    muriates of copper and iron, and the sulphates of soda and lime, being all

                    which is suspended over a vat, and the uncombined quicksilver, owing to its
                    weight, filters through. The pure amalgam, now termed <hi rend="italic">pella

                    >marquetas.</hi> In this form it is taken to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >quemadero,</hi> and built up into a cylindrical pile, with a hole down the
                    centre. The pile of amalgam, or <hi rend="italic">pina de plata,</hi> is then
                    placed on a copper stand, the above aperture opening a communication with the
                    reservoir of cold water below. A large inverted crucible, called the <hi

                <p>It appears, however, that the export of the precious metals from Mexicoin 1834
                    amounted to upwards of twenty-one millions, to which must be added the legal and
                    clandestine exports by Matamoros, supposed to be about two millions, and the
                    smuggled treasure from Vera Cruz and the smaller ports, estimated at one million
                    and a half; so that about twenty-five millions of dollars in gold and silver,
                    equal to L.5,000,000 sterling, were, in 1834, shipped to foreign countries,
                    although the coinage of all the mints of the republic during that year was only
                    12,040,811 dollars, as shown by the above return, or L.2,400,000. A large
                    proportion of this export was for the United States. “The produce of the Mexican
                    mines,” says Mr O’Gorman, “has evidently increased to a great extent,
                    notwithstanding the exorbitantly high price of quicksilver, which has prevented
                    the reduction of ores of low quality for the last two years; and the riches
                    lately discovered in the mines of Fresnillo, and again at Zacatecas, promise a
                    still greater augmentation of silver.”</p>
                <p>V. <hi rend="smallcaps">south</hi> AMERICAN MINES.</p>
                <p>Under this head it will not be necessary for us to enter into any lengthened
                    details, because ample information on the subject of the mines of South America
                    will be found in the various articles of this work especially devoted to the
                    description of the different countries, or states, into which that great
                    continent is now divided, particularly in the accounts given of Bolivia, Brazil,
                    Buenos Ayres, Chile, Colombia, Peru, &amp;c. to which accordingly the reader is
                    referred. There are few regions of the earth so remarkable for their mineral
                    riches as the vast primitive chain of mountains called the Cordilleras,
                    throughout which nature has distributed ores of the precious metals in greater
                    abundance than in almost any other part of the world; although these are for the
                    most part placed at an elevation which renders the working of them equally
                    difficult and expensive. The most important mines are those of silver; but gold,
                    quicksilver, copper, and lead are also extracted, some of them in very
                    considerable quantities.</p>
                <p>In Chile, especially in the province of Coquimbo, there are several mines of
                    silver, and some important ones of copper. The Chileno mines are mostly situated
                    in the interior of a hilly country of difficult access, to which the conveyance
                    of fuel and materials is enormously expensive, and whence the transport of the
                    produce to the places of embarkation is attended with much difficulty. The
                    Chileno miners are described as very expert in following the course of a vein,
                    though entirely ignorant of any thing like science, and even unable to explain
                    the rules by which they are guided in pursuing their operations. The various
                    processes followed in the reduction of the ores are also rude and simple; but
                    being extremely economical, they are perhaps better adapted to the circumstances
                    of the country than those which are employed in less difficult and more
                    accessible regions. The greater proportion of the gold found in Chile is
                    obtained from the auriferous sulphuret of iron, or gold pyrites, which is
                    generally met with in high and lofty ridges, such as those of Illapel and
                    Petorca. Some portion, however, is obtained from veins of rock, where very small
                    grains of gold are disseminated in syenite, so minute as not to be visible to
                    the naked eye, or from an ochreous decomposing syenite, distributed in veins,
                    throughout which native gold is disseminated in thin flakes. Silver is found
                    principally in limestone, or calcareous syenite; and it also occurs in beds of
                    quartz, amongst which it is disseminated in the metallic state. But towards
                    Copiapo it is generally found in lead ores, principally argentiferous galenas;
                    and towards the south it occurs mineralized with sulphur. Copper is most
                    frequently found in the state of sulphuret called bronze, but sometimes in that
                    of carbonate, or sulphuret and carbonate intermixed.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The richness of the silver mines of Potosi, now included in the territory of
                    Buenos Ayres, may be judged of from the fact, that since the period of their
                    discovery in the year 154o, upwards of 1300 millions of dollars have been coined
                    there. These mines are situated in an insulated mountain, about eighteen miles
                    in circumference, which rises to an immense height, in the form of a sugar-loaf
                    or cone; it is about an hundred leagues distant from the South Sea, near the
                    sources of the river La Plata, is chiefly composed of a yellow, firm,
                    argillaceous slate, and is full of veins which traverse the mountain in all
                    directions, and are filled with ferruginous quartz, which constitutes the matrix
                    of the silver ores. These consist principally of native silver and vitreous
                    silver ore, the latter of which, on the first discovery of the mine, yielded
                    about half its weight of pure silver; but the produce is much less now than
                    formerly, all the richer veins having been wrought out and exhausted. Copper,
                    lead, and tin, are also found in Buenos Ayres, the last occurring in beds of
                    sand or clay, from which it is obtained by washing. On the opposite chain, in a
                    level district, are the silver mines of Guantajaya, famous for the large masses
                    of solid silver which they formerly yielded, and one of which weighed about 800
                    lbs.</p>
                <p>In Peru there are forty districts particularly famous for their gold and silver
                    mines. Gold is chiefly found in the provinces of Guailas and Pataz, and silver
                    in the districts of Guantajaya, Pasco, and Chota. The celebrated mines of Pasco,
                    which, some thirty years ago, produced considerably more than two millions of
                    dollars annually, had, like most of those of South America, been very
                    negligently managed until, in 1816, miners from Cornwall began to work them by
                    means of steam-engines. These mines are properly in the ridge of Yauricoha, and
                    are situated at the great height of 13,500 feet above the level of the sea. The
                    distance of the village of Pasco from Lima is about fifty-eight leagues. The
                    only persons capable of being employed at so great an elevation, where the
                    barometer is always below nineteen inches, arc the Indians of the country, who,
                    being bred upon high table-lands, can alone respire without inconvenience the
                    attenuated atmosphere of so lofty a region. The riches of the metalliferous bed
                    of Yauricoha are at no great depth below the surface, the greater proportion of
                    the pits being somewhat less than 100 feet, and none of them exceeding 400 feet
                    in depth. The length of this bed is about 16,000 feet, its breadth 7200 feet,
                    and its thickness somewhat less than 100 feet. The number of mines does not
                    exceed an hundred. The mineral bed consists of a porous ironstone, throughout
                    which fine silver is disseminated; but patches of a friable white argillaceous
                    earth about ten inches in thickness are sometimes met with in the midst of the
                    large bed, and are often so rich as to yield from 200 to 1000 marcs per caxon.
                    The consequence has been, that many miners, instead of following the bed
                    regularly, have perforated it at random in search of these very uncertain
                    riches, and, from carelessness, have endangered the existence of the whole mine.
                    In fact, it is these perforations which are now denominated mines. The mines of
                    the pfovince of Chota now furnish above 40,000 lbs. troy of silver annually. The
                    quicksilver mine of Guancavelica in Peru is the only one of this kind in the New
                    World. It is about fifty leagues to the eastward of Lima, being situated near
                    the summit of one of the Cordilleras. This mine, which, for a period of two
                    centuries, afforded annually from 7000 to 8000 quintals of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193822654" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2654-0265"/> mercury is now nearly
                    exhausted. The cinnabar of Guancavelica is disseminated in a sandstone similar
                    to that of Almaden in Spain, being distributed in an immense accumulated mass,
                    without the form of bed or vein; but the ore has become so poor that fifty
                    quintals do not now yield more than six or eight pounds of mercury.</p>
                <p>In the province of Guantajaya, there are mines of rock or fossil salt. To the
                    north of the province of Chota, the Cordilleras are by no means so rich in
                    metals. In New Granada, however, there are several silver mines; at Aroa, in
                    Caraccas, there is a copper mine which yields from 1400 to 1600 cwt. of metal
                    annually; and at Santa Fe de Bogota rock-salt and pit-coal are found. For an
                    account of the gold and diamond mines or districts of Brazil, the reader is
                    referred to the article under that head.</p>
                <p>It now only remains to endeavour, by means of the tabular returns obtained from
                    the British consular agents in South America, to exhibit a view of the actual
                    produce of the gold and silver mines of that country. The following is an
                    account of the gold, silver, and copper, raised from the mines in the province
                    of Coquimbo, in Chile, distinguishing the different ports and mining districts
                    from which the metals have been exported and remitted by land during the year
                    ending the 31st December 1831 :—</p>

                <p>The total value of the different quantities above stated, estimated in the
                    currency of Chile, amounted to 2,379,539 dollars. The quantity of gold actually
                    raised from the mines, however, is said to be much greater than that here
                    stated; but no accurate account of the quantity extracted could be procured,
                    owing to the circumstance of the article being chiefly exported in a clandestine
                    manner, in order to avoid the duties, which are about four per cent. <hi

                    are comparatively of but little avail, as far as gold is concerned.</p>

                <p>From a return of the silver coined in Peru between the 1st of January and the
                    3Ist of December 1834, it appears that the total amount of the coinage in 1834
                    exceeded the total amount of the coinage in 1833 by 18,586 marcs, which are
                    equal to 121,764 dollars, or L.24,352. 8s.; thus showing that the working of the
                    silver mines in that country is at length proceeding with increased spirit,
                    activity, and success. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Mines,
                    Military,</hi> denote subterraneous galleries or passages excavated under the
                    walks or ramparts of fortifications, and intended to be blown up by
                    gunpowder.</p>
                <p>The gallery or passage of a mine is commonly about four feet square, and at the
                    end of this is the chamber or <hi rend="italic">fourneau</hi> the mine, which is
                    a cavity of about five feet in width, the same in length, and about six feet in
                    height; and here the gunpowder is stowed. The saucisson of the mine is the
                    train, for which there is always a small aperture left.</p>
                <p>Two ounces of powder have been found, by experiment, capable of raising two cubic
                    feet of earth; consequently 200 ounces, that is, twelve pounds eight ounces,
                    will raise 200 cubic feet, or sixteen feet less than a cubic toise; because 200
                    ounces, joined together, have proportionally a greater force than two ounces,
                    from being an united force.</p>
                <p>All the turnings which a miner employs to carry on his mines, and through which
                    he conducts the saucisson, should be well filled with earth and dung; and the
                    masonry, in proportion to the earth to be blown up, should be as three to two.
                    The entrance of the chamber or <hi rend="italic">fourneau</hi> of the mine ought
                    to be firmly shut with thick planks, in the form of a St Andrew’s cross, so that
                    the enclosure be made secure, and the void spaces filled up with dung or
                    tempered earth. If a gallery be formed below or on the side of the chamber, it
                    must absolutely be filled up with the strongest masonry, half as long again as
                    the height of the earth; for this gallery will not only burst, but likewise
                    obstruct the effect of the mine. The powder should always be kept in sacks,
                    which must be opened when the mine is charged, and some of the powder strewed
                    about. The greater is the quantity of earth to be raised, the more decided will
                    be the effect of the mine, supposing it to have the due proportion of powder.
                    Powder has the same effect upon masonry as upon earth; that is, it will
                    proportionally raise either with the same velocity.</p>
                <p>The branches which are carried into the solidity of walls seldom exceed three
                    feet in depth, and two feet six inches in width, or thereby. This species of
                    mine, when properly formed, is calculated to blow up the strongest walls.</p>
                <p>The weight of a cubic foot of powder should be about 80 lb.; one foot one inch
                    cube should weigh 100 lb., and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822680"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-2680-0267"/> one foot two inches and {<hi rend="superscript"
                    >11</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">12</hi>ths, 150 lb.: on the other hand, 200 lb. of
                    powder will be one foot five inches cube; but there is a diversity in this,
                    according to the quantity of saltpetre contained in the gunpowder.</p>
                <p>If, when the mines are formed, water be found at the bottom of the chamber,
                    planks are laid there, upon which the powder is placed, either in sacks or
                    barrels of 100 lb. each. The saucisson must have a clear passage to the powder,
                    and should be laid in an <hi rend="italic">auget</hi> or wooden trough, through
                    all the branches. When the powder is placed in the chamber, the planks are laid
                    to cover it, and others again across these, then one is placed across the top of
                    the chamber, which is shaped for that purpose; and between it and those which
                    cover the powder, props are placed, which shore it up, some inclining towards
                    the outside, and others to the inside of the wall, all the void spaces being
                    filled up with earth, dung, bricks, and rough stones. Afterwards planks are
                    placed at the entrance of the chamber, with one across the top, upon which are
                    buttressed three strong props, the other ends of which are likewise propped
                    against another plank situated on the side of the earth in the branch; and these
                    props being well fixed between the planks with wedges, the branch should then be
                    filled up to its entrance with the before-mentioned materials. The saucissons
                    which pass through the side branches must be of exactly the same length with
                    that in the middle, to which they are joined. The part which readies beyond the
                    entrance of the mine is that which conveys the fire to the other three; and if
                    the saucissons be of equal length, the mines will spring together.</p>
                <p>From a great number of experiments, it appears that the force of a mine is always
                    towards the weakest side, so that the disposition of the chamber of a mine does
                    not at all contribute to determine this effect; that the quantity of powder must
                    be greater or less in proportion to the greater or less weight of the bodies to
                    be raised, and to their greater or less cohesion; that the entonnoir of a
                    mine,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>That is, the
                    cavity, aperture, or hole which remains after the explosion.</p></note> if
                    rightly charged, is a cone, the diameter of whose base is double the height
                    taken from the centre of the mine; that when the mine has been overcharged, its
                    entonnoir is nearly cylindrical, the diameter of the upper extreme not much
                    exceeding that of the chamber; and that, besides the shock of the powder against
                    the bodies it takes up, it likewise crushes all the earth which borders upon it,
                    both underneath and sidewise.</p>
                <p>To charge a mine so as to produce the most advantageous effect, the weight of the
                    matter to be carried must be known; that is, the solidity of a cone whose base
                    is double the height of the earth over the centre of the mine. Thus, having
                    found the solidity of the cone in cubic fathoms, multiply the number of fathoms
                    by the number of pounds of powder necessary for raising the matter it contains;
                    and if the cone contain matters of different weights, take a mean weight between
                    them all, due regard being always had to their degree of cohesion. As to the
                    disposition of mines, there is but one general rule, which is, that the side
                    towards which the miner would determine the effect be the weakest; but this
                    varies according to occasions and circumstances.</p>
                <p>The calculation of mines is generally built upon the hypothesis, that the
                    entonnoir of a mine is the frustum of an inverted cone, the altitude of which is
                    equal to the radius of the excavation of the mine, and the diameter of the whole
                    lesser base is equal to the line of least resistance; and although these
                    suppositions are not quite exact, yet the calculations of mines deduced from
                    them have proved successful in practice; for which reason this principle should
                    be followed until a better and more simple be found out. Μ. de Vallière found
                    that the entonnoir of a mine was a paraboloid, which is a solid generated by the
                    rotation of a semiparabola about its axis; but as the difference between these
                    two solids is very insignificant in practice, that of the frustum of a cone may
                    be used.</p>
                <p>The mines of a fortress are denominated <hi rend="italic">counter-mines,</hi> the
                    gallery of which runs under the covered way, along the outer margin of the
                    fosse. From this, ramifications (<hi rend="italic">rameaux</hi>) extend under
                    the glacis, whence little passages are formed on both sides, so as to afford
                    means for listening and discovering the subterranean proceedings of the enemy.
                    Galleries made within a fortification, before a place is attacked, and from
                    which branches are carried in different directions, are generally about four
                    feet in width and about five in height. The earth is supported from falling in
                    by arches and walls, as these galleries are intended to remain for a
                    considerable time; but when mines are to be used as soon as formed, the
                    galleries are only three feet or three feet and a half in width, and five feet
                    in height, and the earth is temporarily supported by wooden frames or props.</p>
                <p>A word or two now respecting the <hi rend="italic">globe de compression.</hi>
                    Suppose a large globe of earth, homogeneous in all its parts, with a certain
                    quantity of powder lodged in its centre, so as to produce a proper effect
                    without bursting the globe; it is evident that, by the ignition of the powder,
                    the explosion will act equally all round, and the particles of earth, being
                    porous, will compress each other in proportion as the expansive force increases
                    the dimensions of the chamber. The particles of earth next to the chamber will
                    communicate a portion of their motion to those adjoining, and the latter to
                    those immediately beyond them; and this communication will continue in a
                    decreasing proportion, until the whole force of the explosion be spent; but
                    beyond that limit the particles of earth will remain in the same state as
                    before. Thus the particles of earth which have been acted upon by the force of
                    the explosion will form a globe, and to a certain extent drive all before them.
                    This is the <hi rend="italic">globe de compression</hi> invented by Belidor. Its
                    object is, without any explosion perceptible at the surface, to shake the
                    ground, and to destroy the hostile mines in the immediate neighbourhood.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fougasses</hi> are a sort of small mines constructed before the
                    weakest parts of a fortification, as the salient angles and the faces when not
                    defended by a cross fire. <hi rend="italic">Treffle mines</hi> are mines with
                    two chambers only. <hi rend="italic">T-mines,</hi> so called from their
                    resemblance to the letter T, are double mines having four lodgments. Double
                    T-mines have eight lodgments and four doors, whilst triple T-mines have twelve
                    lodgments and six doors. Double treffle mines have four lodgments and eight
                    doors; triple treffle mines have six lodgments and twelve doors.</p>
                <p>Subterranean warfare has many peculiarities, and requires a rare union of skill,
                    and courage, and perseverance. Sappers and miners are usually armed with pistols
                    and cut-Iasses for their defence, when there is a chance of their meeting a
                    hostile counter-mine; and if a combat ensue, the dead and the wounded are passed
                    backwards from the most advanced workmen to those behind, until the mine is
                    cleared. Balls made of all kinds of substances which produce an offensive stench
                    when ignited, are also lighted, in order to stop the enemy, whenever the mine
                    permits the party who set fire to the ball to effect an easy retreat from the
                    mine. Sometimes mines are excavated in the field, for the purpose of blowing up
                    such of the enemy as can be allured to the spot. In these cases, a small body of
                    men is commonly placed immediately above the mine, to induce the enemy to attack
                    with a superior force; if the stratagem succeed, the mine is instantly sprung
                    <hi rend="italic">(on</hi><hi rend="italic">fait jouer</hi><hi rend="italic">la
                    mine),</hi> and, from the very nature of the operation, both parties are
                    sometimes sacrificed.</p>
