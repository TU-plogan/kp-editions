                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Diving</hi> is the art of descending under water to
                    considerable depths, and of remaining there some time, so as to be able to
                    collect valuable articles, such as pearls (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pearl
                    Fishing),</hi> sponges, coral, and other submarine productions, from the bottom
                    of the sea or rivers, or property from the sunken wrecks of vessels.</p>
                <p>This art is one of great utility, but is attended with peculiar difficulties,
                    owing to the very limited powers which man naturally possesses within the liquid
                    element. On the surface he may no doubt continue a long time floating or
                    swimming, and hence arises the wonderful art of navigation. But the moment he
                    plunges within the mass he is cut off from the vital air, and life is speedily
                    extinguished. The necessity of a constant supply of air for the support of life
                    is shown by simply attempting to withhold it by shutting the mouth and nostrils.
                    No one can continue holding in the breath in this manner much longer than a
                    minute or a minute and a half. If we begin to hold after having made an
                    expiration, we cannot do it longer than a quarter of a minute; but if we take a
                    large inspiration, and fill the lungs, this supply is found to last longer; so
                    that we can readily hold breath a full minute, and, with practice and great
                    exertion, some may even continue to do so two minutes. Now this is exactly what
                    the diver must do to remain alive under water; and accordingly we find that in
                    general a person cannot remain longer than half a minute without the danger of
                    suffocation, and the most practised divers not above two minutes; such is the
                    necessity for fresh air continually present in the lungs.</p>
                <p>The nature and cause of this necessity for air has been illustrated by the
                    discoveries of modern chemistry. These have proved that it arises from a certain
                    chemical action which the atmosphere exerts on the blood as it passes through
                    the lungs, and which is continually going on, and cannot for a moment be
                    intermitted. The nature of this action is not yet exactly understood, but the
                    object of it undoubtedly)s to purify the blood, as it becomes vitiated by
                    circulating through the system. For this purpose, the air inspired into the
                    lungs, and coming there into contact with the blood, imparts to it its oxygen, a
                    small portion of which is supposed to combine with the blood, and to give it
                    renewed vigour; but by far the greater portion combines with the carbonaceous
                    matter of the blood, and carries off this impurity in the shape of carbonic acid
                    at each expiration. This is proved by a very simple experiment. Let a person,
                    for instance, respire by means of a pipe into a bag or bladder of air of the
                    capacity of a gallon or more; he will breathe freely enough at first, but in a
                    very short time with great difficulty, and at last will feel the sense of
                    suffocation the same as in holding the breath in the ordinary way. If the air in
                    the bladder be now examined, it will be found to have entirely changed its
                    nature; it will no longer support the flame of a candle, but extinguish it, the
                    moment it is immersed, thus showing the loss of oxygen. Hence arises that sense
                    of closeness and oppression which is felt in crowded assemblies, where, as
                    generally happens, the ventilation is imperfect. The same air being breathed
                    again and again, becomes unfit for respiration, and produces those unpleasant
                    sensations which are usually felt. A very curious and interesting set of
                    experiments on respiration were made by Messrs Allen and Pepys, and narrated in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1808. The following
                    bears particularly on the present subject.</p>
                <p>“Three hundred cubic inches of common air contained in one of the mercurial
                    gasometers were respired. In less than a minute it became necessary to take
                    deeper and deeper inspirations, and at last the efforts were so violent that the
                    glass was in danger of being broken. A great sense of oppression and suffocation
                    was now felt in the chest, vision became indistinct, and after the second minute
                    the attention of the operator seemed to be withdrawn from surrounding objects,
                    and fixed upon the experiment. A buzzing in the ears took place, as in breathing
                    nitrous oxide; and after the third minute there was left only sufficient
                    recollection to close the gasometer after an expiration; after which he became
                    insensible, having made thirty-five inspirations. The expired air contained ten
                    per cent, of carbonic acid, four of oxygen, and eighty-six of azote.”</p>
                <p>With 300 cubic inches of air, then, in the gasometer, the operator began to be
                    insensible in the space of two minutes; and if we suppose that the lungs, which
                    were in their natural state at the commencement of the operation, contained 100
                    cubic inches of atmospheric air, then it would follow that 200 inches each
                    minute would be necessary to support life, so as to remain at the same time
                    quite sensible. Hence, supposing the lungs to contain, with a full inspiration,
                    250 cubic inches, which is a pretty large allowance, it would follow that a man
                    might hold breath, or remain under water, a minute and a quarter, which agrees
                    very well with what occurs in ordinary cases. But a very curious fact has been
                    mentioned to us by Professor Faraday of the Royal Institution, London, and was
                    first noticed to him by a gentleman connected with the Asiatic Society, a fact
                    which may often be of great importance, not only in diving, but in cases of
                    fire, and of accidents in brewers’ vats, &amp;c. The lungs in their natural
                    state are charged with a large quantity of impure air, being a portion of the
                    carbonic acid gas which is formed during respiration, but after each expiration
                    still remains lodging among the involved passages of the pulmonary vessels. In
                    proof of this, it is only necessary to breathe by a small pipe, or roll of
                    paper, into a common water bottle, throwing away the first portion of the
                    expiration, and propelling the last into the lower parts of the vessel. Then
                    insert this over a taper, and it will be instantly extinguished. Now, by
                    breathing hard for a short time, as one does after taking any violent exercise,
                    this impure air is expelled, and its place is filled up with atmospheric air.
                    The consequence is, that if we then take a full inspiration, the breath can
                    easily be held for two minutes. This experiment any one can make. On trying it
                    in the ordinary way, we could hold breath for about three quarters of a minute,
                    but this with great difficulty. We then made eight to ten forced respirations,
                    and on closing the mouth and nostrils felt no inconvenience even on the first
                    trial, till after a minute and a half, but continued, however, to the end of the
                    second minute. The knowledge of this fact might be of essential use in diving,
                    and, we have no doubt, might often be the means of saving life; for if in the
                    ordinary way we can only remain a single minute under water, of what importance
                    is it to be capable of doubling the time? A single minute in these cases must be
                    invaluable. Whether the professed divers are aware of this circumstance or not,
                    we do not know; but it is probable, at any rate, that in many cases the exertion
                    induced by swimming may have the effect of clearing the lungs. Another curious
                    fact illustrative of the same principles occurred to Mr Brunell in descending to
                    examine the breach which the river had made in the Tunnel under the Thames.
                    Having lowered<pb break="no" facs="nls:193323915" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3915-0060"/>
                    the diving-bell nearly thirty feet to the mouth of the opening, this was found
                    too narrow to admit the bell, so that no further observation could be made on
                    the state of the Shield and other works, which were perhaps eight or ten feet
                    deeper. Brunell, therefore, laying hold of the end of a rope, left the bell, and
                    dived himself down the opening; his companion in the bell being alarmed at the
                    length of his stay, now about two minutes, gave the signal for pulling up; and
                    the diver, unprepared for the signal, had hardly time to catch hold of the rope
                    which he had let go, and was surprised on coming up to find that so much time
                    had elapsed. On descending again, he found that he could with ease remain fully
                    two minutes under water. The reason evidently was, that the atmosphere in the
                    bell being condensed by a column of water nearly thirty, feet in height,
                    contained nearly double the quantity of air in the same bulk, and thus nearly a
                    double supply in the lungs.</p>
                <p>Besides the difficulty of holding the breath, another arises in diving,
                    particularly at considerable depths, from ^the external pressure of the fluid on
                    the chest, and on every cavity of the body. On the chest this tends to compress
                    it together, and to expel the air out of it, and thus increases greatly the
                    difficulty of holding the breath. At each foot of descent this pressure will
                    increase upwards of sixty lbs. on every square foot of the body; and if we
                    suppose the chest to expose half a square foot, we have, at the depth of fifteen
                    feet, a force equal to the weight of 450 lbs. loading the chest, and tending to
                    propel the included air. A very great muscular exertion, therefore, will
                    evidently be required to resist this enormous strain; nor is it practicable, by
                    any breastplate or other contrivance, to defend the chest from this pressure, as
                    this, to do any good, would require to be so large, and of such strength, as
                    greatly to obstruct the free motions of the diver. It is this pressure of the
                    deep water, and the violent exertion necessary to overcome it, that, causes, in
                    divers who go down frequently, the eyes to become blood-shot, and brings on a
                    spitting of blood.</p>
                <p>The art of diving having always in it, and particularly during the infancy of
                    science, something of the marvellous, the most extraordinary accounts have been
                    given, by different authors, of the feats of some of the most noted divers. The
                    most singular of these is that given by Kircher, of the Sicilian diver <hi
                    rend="italic">Nicoo Pesce,</hi> taken, as he states, from the archives of the
                    kings of Sicily.</p>
                <p>“In the times of Frederick king of Sicily,” says Kircher, “there lived a
                    celebrated diver, whose name was <hi rend="italic">Nicholas,</hi> and who, from
                    his amazing skill in swimming, and his perseverance under water, was surnamed
                    the <hi rend="italic">Jish.</hi> This man had from his infancy been used to the
                    sea, and earned his scanty subsistence by diving for corals and oysters, which
                    he sold to the villagers on shore. His long acquaintance with the sea at last
                    brought it to be almost his natural element. He was frequently known to spend
                    five days in the midst of the waves, without any other provisions than the fish
                    which he caught there, and atc raw. He often swam over from Sicily into
                    Calabria, a tempestuous and dangerous passage, carrying letters from the king.
                    He was frequently known to swim among the gulfs of the Lipari islands, noway
                    apprehensive of danger.</p>
                <p>“Some mariners out at sea one day observed something at some distance from them,
                    which they regarded as a sea monster; but upon its approach it was known to be
                    Nicholas, whom they took into their ship. When they asked him whither he was
                    going in so stormy and rough a sea, and at such a distance from land, he showed
                    them a packet of letters which he was carrying to one of the towns of Italy,
                    exactly done up in a leather bag, in such a manner as that they could not be
                    wetted by the sea. He kept them thus company for some time in their voyage,
                    conversing and asking questions; and after eating a hearty meal with them, he
                    took his leave, and, jumping into the sea, pursued his voyage alone.</p>
                <p>“In order to aid these powers of enduring in the deep, nature seemed to have
                    assisted him in a very extraordinary manner; for the spaces between his fingers
                    and toes were webbed, as in a goose; and his chest became so very capacious that
                    he could take in, at one inspiration, as much breath as would serve him for a
                    whole day.</p>
                <p>“The account of so extraordinary a person did not fail to reach the king himself,
                    who commanded Nicholas to be brought before him. It was no easy matter to find
                    Nicholas, who generally spent his time in the solitudes of the deep; but at
                    last, after much searching, he was found and brought before his majesty. The
                    curiosity of this monarch had been long excited by the accounts he had heard of
                    the bottom of the Gulf of Charybdis; he now therefore conceived that it would be
                    a proper opportunity to have more certain information. He therefore commanded
                    our poor diver to examine the bottom of this dreadful whirlpool, and, as an
                    incitement to his obedience, he ordered a golden cup to be flung into it.
                    Nicholas was not insensible of the danger to which he was exposed, dangers best
                    known only to himself, and therefore he presumed to remonstrate; but the hopes
                    of the reward, the desire of pleasing the king, and the pleasure of showing his
                    skill, at last prevailed. He instantly jumped into the gulf, and was as
                    instantly swallowed up in its bosom. He continued for three quarters of an hour
                    below, during which time the king and his attendants remained on shore anxious
                    for his fate; but he at last appeared, holding the cup in triumph in one hand,
                    and making his way good among the waves with the other. It may be supposed he
                    was received with applause when he came on shore; the cup was made the reward of
                    his adventure; the king ordered him to be taken proper carc of; and, as he was
                    somewhat fatigued and debilitated by his labour, after a hearty meal he was put
                    to bed, and permitted to refresh himself by sleeping.”</p>
                <p>The diver then, according to the account, gave a narrative of the wonders he had
                    seen, which so excited the curiosity of the monarch, that he again tempted the
                    diver to a second and fatal descent. After plunging into the whirlpool, he was
                    never more heard of.</p>
                <p>But to return to more authentic statements, these on. the whole agree very well
                    with the views already stated.; Among the pearl divers at Ceylon and other parts
                    of the' East, instances have been known of a diver remaining six 1 minutes under
                    water; but these are very rare; the ordinary time seldom exceeds a minute, and
                    sometimes it is a minute and a half, or two minutes. There are generally ten
                    divers in each of the boats belonging to the fishery; five descend into the sea
                    at a time, and the other five remain above to recruit their strength. In order
                    to hasten their descent, a large stone is used, with a rope attached to it,
                    which the diver seizes with the toes of his right foot, while he grasps a bag of
                    net-work with those of the left. He then seizes another rope with his right
                    hand, and keeping his nostrils shut with his left, plunges into the water, and
                    soon reaches the bottom. Then hanging the net round his neck, he speedily
                    collects the oysters, and resuming his former position, he makes a signal to
                    those in the boat, and is immediately hauled up, and the stone which assisted
                    his descent is pulled up afterwards.</p>
                <p>The divers are all Indians, who are accustomed to this seemingly dangerous
                    occupation from their infancy, and who fearlessly descend to the greatest
                    depths. They will frequently make from forty to fifty plunges in a day; but the
                    exertion is so extremely violent, that in coming up they <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193323928" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3928-0061"/>discharge water, and
                    sometimes blood, from their mouths, cars, and nostrils. Some of them rub their
                    bodies with oil, and stuff their ears to prevent the water from entering; but
                    the greater part use no precautions whatever. They take no food while in the
                    boats, nor till they return on shore and have bathed themselves in fresh water.
                    The only danger to which they are exposed is from meeting, while at the bottom,
                    with the ground-shark, which is a common inhabitant of those seas, and of which
                    the divers are under dreadful apprehensions; some of them indeed are so expert
                    as to avoid this enemy, even when they remain under water for a considerable
                    time; but the uncertainty of escaping is so great, that, in order to avert the
                    danger, they consult, before they begin, their priests or conjurors, in whom
                    they place implicit confidence.</p>
                <p>Dr Halley relates, as a remarkable circumstance, that he observed a Florida
                    Indian diver at Bermudas, who could remain two minutes under water. He states,
                    that the divers for sponges in the Archipelago are in the practice of taking
                    down in their mouths a piece of sponge dipped in oil, and by this are enabled to
                    dive longer than others who have none. It is not easy to conceive how this can
                    assist the diver’s breathing; for the introduction of any foreign substance into
                    the mouth must necessarily diminish the quantity of air he can take down. But it
                    has been lately said that the real object of taking oil in their mouth is to
                    calm those small waves on the surface of the sea which prevent the light being
                    so steadily transmitted to the bottom as is necessary to enable the divers to
                    find the small objects they search for without delay. By ejecting a little oil
                    from their mouths, it rises to the surface, and spreading upon it, calms the
                    waves in a most remarkable manner, and gives a brilliant light at the
                    bottom.</p>
                <p>Many nations, and particularly the savages in the South Sea and other islands,
                    are remarkable for the expertness they acquire by habit in diving and moving
                    about in the water. Being accustomed to it from their infancy, the clement
                    þecomes so natural to them that they seem to have the use of all their faculties
                    in the water the same as on the dry land. According to the accounts of voyagers,
                    they ape such expert divers, that when a nail or other piece of iron -was thrown
                    overboard, they would instantly jump into the sea after it, and never fail to
                    recover· it. On one occasion a, smith’s anvil is said to have fallen overboard.
                    Not being able to bring this up, the islanders notwithstanding contrived to
                    bring it ashore, by descending a great many times to the bottom, and rolling it
                    over and over till it reached the land.</p>
                <p>Such is the length to which diving has been carried by the natural powers of the
                    body alone. But from the curious and difficult nature of the object, and the
                    many important purposes to which the art might be employed, ingenious men were
                    led to the invention of various contrivances for the use of the diver, which
                    have greatly extended his powers and the usefulness of the art. A multitude of
                    these contrivances of different descriptions have been brought forward by
                    mechanical projectors for the last two hundred years. They all resolve
                    themselves into three different kinds.</p>
                <p>lĵŕ, Water-tight armour or dresses for the body, so strong as to protect it from
                    the external pressure of the fluid; and, along with this, the means of supplying
                    the diver with fresh air, so as to enable him to remain any time under
                    water.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">%dly,</hi> Water-tight vessels of metal for inclosing the
                    diver, and of such capacity as to contain a supply of air for a limited period
                    of perhaps half an hour or an hour or more, and giving him also the use of his
                    hands an&lt;⅛arms externally by a sort of flexible sleeves.</p>
                <p>3&lt;7Zy, The diving-bell, which, from its simplicity, safety, and perfect
                    efficiency, has now almost entirely superseded every other, though there is no
                    doubt that in many cases these may still be of considerable utility in
                    subservience to the bell.</p>
                <p>In regard to dresses or armour, a number of different plans of this kind are
                    detailed in Leopold’s <hi rend="italic">Theatrum Machinarum Hydraulicarum.</hi>
                    At depths of twelve or fifteen feet these may often be of essential use; but
                    beyond this they become inapplicable, owing to the great pressure on the limbs
                    of the diver, which must either be exposed, or covered only with a flexible
                    material, not to impede his motions; and in that case the pressure, acting on
                    all sides like a ligature, is liable to obstruct the circulation of the blood in
                    the limbs, and to drive it from these into those parts of the body within the
                    armour, causing extreme pain. In any great depth, also, the necessary strength
                    of the armour renders it unwieldy; and it is extremely difficult, if not
                    impracticable, to fit it tightly on every part; while the smallest opening, by
                    admitting water, may endanger the life of the diver.</p>
                <p>One of the best of these contrivances is perhaps that: proposed by M. Klingert,
                    and described in a pamphlet≈ published at Breslau in 1798. The harness or armour
                    is made of strong tin-plate, in the form of a cylinder, with a round end to
                    inclose the head and body, and, for the convenience of putting it on, is made in
                    two parts, the headpiece or helmet, and the body. Besides this, there is a
                    leather jacket, with short sleeves, and a pair of drawers of the same, which are
                    made water-tight, buttoned on the metal part where they join, and made tight
                    with brass hoops, going round the leather and the metal upon the outside. The
                    chief peculiarity in this machine is the mode in which fresh air is supplied,
                    and respiration effected. This is done by two distinct flexible pipes proceeding
                    from the inside of the helmet to the surface of the water; the one is for
                    inhaling the air, and terminates in an ivory mouth-piece, which the diver may
                    embrace with his lips and inhale the air; the other enters the helmet at the
                    same place, and opens merely into the inside of the machine, so as to allow the
                    foul air to be discharged. The diver, therefore, draws in the fresh air by the
                    mouth, and discharges it into the helmet by the nostrils; and from the interior
                    of the machine it is propelled by the act of inspiration, the expansion of the
                    chest contracting the space between it and the armour, and forcing out exactly
                    as much air as is drawn in, keeping up always a due equilibrium. This is
                    certainly a very ingenious arrangement; for, if there were no second pipe to
                    discharge the air, the expansion of the chest would compress the air round the
                    body of the diver, and, unless this were of large capacity, which would be
                    inconvenient, would create a difficulty in the operation. The construction of
                    the apparatus will be understood from the drawing, fig. 1, Plate CLXXXIX., which
                    is a front view of the diver, and by the following description: A is the
                    helmet-piece, fifteen inches in height, and the diameter adapted to the size of
                    the body of the diver; BB is the lower part of the cylinder, of the same
                    diameter, and of such a height as to meet the other at the dotted line C; <hi
                    rend="italic">ddC</hi> is the jacket, and <hi rend="italic">ffE</hi> the
                    drawers; these are attached to the cylinder by buttons, as seen; and <hi
                    rend="italic">a, c, bb</hi> are the three brass hoops fitted over each joint to
                    make it water-tight; the hoops are made of brass-plate, with their ends turned
                    up, and fitted with screws, by means of which they can be drawn very tight upon
                    the leather. The cylinder has holes for the arms, one half in the upper piece
                    and one half in the lower; and when the jacket is fastened on, it binds the
                    upper and lower parts of the cylinder together. It is fastened at the arms with
                    brass screw hoops, <hi rend="italic">dd,</hi> and the <pb break="no"

                    represent the breathing pipes, the first for drawing in the air, the second for
                    discharging it; these are united to a little metal cylinder, which screws on the
                    helmet at the aperture <hi rend="italic">g;</hi> this is shown more particularly
                    at fig. 2, where a partition will be observed in the cylinder dividing the fresh
                    air compartment from the other, the one terminating in the ivory mouth-piece <hi
                    rend="italic">v,</hi> the other just entering the machine at <hi rend="italic"
                    >t.</hi> W is a small reservoir at the lower part of the pipes, for condensing
                    any air, or receiving what may penetrate through the pipes. To resist the
                    external pressure of the water on the limbs, the leather drawers have a framing
                    of iron within them, represented at fig. 3; this consists of a semicircular
                    piece <hi rend="italic">ll,</hi> also seen at <hi rend="italic">ll,</hi> fig. 1,
                    extending between the legs of the diver, and fastened to the lower extremity of
                    the cylinder at the front and back; also two irons <hi rend="italic">nn</hi>
                    outside the thighs, which are jointed to the cylinder, and extend down to <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> where they are attached to a hoop surrounding the thigh;
                    there is another hoop for each thigh farther up at <hi rend="italic">q</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> these hoops are farther connected by irons, which at the
                    upper end arc fitted to slide upon the semicircular hoop, as at <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and by this means, though the
                    frame-work is very strong, the diver is at liberty to walk, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ww</hi> are weights hooked on the cylinder, to keep the diver down. P is a
                    small pump for discharging any leakage water which may penetrate through the
                    joints.</p>
                <p>When the different parts of the machine have been fitted to the body of the
                    diver, and the proper weights are attached, he enters the water till it rises as
                    high as his eyes, while the end of the pipe is held by an assistant above the
                    surface; and if he finds that he can breathe freely, and no water is forced into
                    the pipe, he may venture to go deeper; and, stopping for some time, to ascertain
                    whether respiration be not inconvenient from the want of fresh air, he may
                    advance to still greater depths, while he makes the proper signals by means of
                    the rope which is secured to one of his arms, or by speaking through the pipe.
                    By this kind of exercise for some time,· the diver acquires confidence and ease
                    for conducting the necessary operations. When he is desirous of ascending he has
                    only to unhook the weights attached to the apparatus, or to fix them to a rope
                    let down for the purpose, that they may not be lost, and as he is then lighter
                    than the same bulk of water, he rises to the surface.</p>
                <p>By following these directions, any one may be able to use the apparatus, and dive
                    to moderate depths, in a very short time. In one of the trials upon the Oder,
                    near Breslau, the diver was a huntsman taught by the author; the water was of
                    considerable depth, and the current strong,and there were a great number of
                    spectators present. He sawed through the trunk of a tree which was lying at the
                    bottom; he showed also that he could have fastened sunk bodies to a rope in
                    order to be drawn up, and that in case any impediment should prevent the use of
                    the saw, the trunks of trees might be hewed to pieces by an axe. On the whole,
                    this apparatus, or one similar, might certainly be of great use in many cases,
                    particularly in hydraulic works, where the diving-bell and the machinery
                    connected with it might not be attainable. The water-proof cloth of Mackintosh
                    might also be. substituted with good effect for the leather.</p>
                <p>Another mode of supplying air to the diving apparatus has been adopted in some
                    cases. This consists in forcing the fresh air into the machine by a bellows or
                    pump, till its elastic force is equal to the pressure of the water. The foul air
                    may in this case be suffered to escape into the water through a valve, or may be
                    conducted to the surface by a pipe. Of this kind is the apparatus contrived by
                    Mr Tonkin, and employed for some time in raising parts of the wreck of the
                    Abergavenny East India ship, which was unfortunately lost off Weymouth in 1804.
                    It consisted of a body of copper with iron boots, put together and jointed in
                    the manner of coats of mail; the whole is then covered with leather, and
                    afterwards with canvass to distinguish it under water. The arms are made of
                    strong water-proof leather; and the place for sight is about eight inches
                    diameter, glazed over with a plate of glass an inch thick. The diver is sunk in
                    this machine by means of weights, fastened equatorially round the waist of it;
                    and he is suspended by a rope, by means of which his situation is changed at
                    pleasure. A flexible air-tube communicates with an air-vessel in the boat above.
                    Through this tube the diver gives his instructions and obtains his supply of
                    fresh air. This machine was used with very good effect in a depth of water of
                    near seven fathoms, and enabled the diver to direct the operations of several
                    curious machines, such as saws for clearing away the ship’s decks, and making
                    sufficient openings to give him access to the treasure below, as well as tongs,
                    &amp;c. for taking up the heavy goods by tackle in the vessel above.</p>
                <p>In regard to the second kind of diving machines, that proposed by Borelli is only
                    curious as showing the low state of physical knowledge in his time. He proposed
                    to have a copper vessel, or vesica as he terms it, about two feet diameter, to
                    contain the diver’s head, and to be fixed to a habit of goat skin for the body.
                    Within the vessel there were pipes contrived to produce a circulation of air, by
                    which Borelli supposed that the objections to other diving machines from the
                    want of air would be obviated; “the moisture,” as lie says, “by which it is
                    clogged in respiration, and by which it is rendered unfit for the same use
                    again, being taken from it by its circulation through the pipes, to the sides of
                    which it would adhere, and leave the air as free as before.” It also contained
                    an air-pump, by means of which the diver could raise or lower the apparatus, by
                    condensing or rarefying the air, on the principle of the air-bladder of
                    fishes.</p>
                <p>Mr Martin, in his <hi rend="italic">Philosophia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Eritannica,</hi> mentions an apparatus contrived by <hi rend="subscript">
                    t</hi> an Englishman, consisting of strong <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    leather, so prepared that no air could pass through. It fitted to his arms and
                    legs, and had a glass window placed in the fore part of it. When dressed in this
                    apparatus, which was large enough to contain half a hogshead of air, he could
                    walk on the ground at the bottom of the sea, and enter the cabin of a sunk ship
                    to take out the goods. The inventor is said to have himself used this machine
                    very extensively in recovering wrecks, and with such success as to have acquired
                    considerable property by it. We are not informed of the depths to which he
                    descended.</p>
                <p>Mr Klingert, the inventor of the water armour, also contrived a diving chest, of
                    the form of a hollow cylinder, to' be used along with it. This contained
                    fifty-eight cubic' feet of air, which, he estimated, would last two hours. It
                    was suspended from a boat, but could be raised and depressed independently of
                    this by a pump compressing or dilating the included air. Thus the ballast is so
                    adapted to the size of the machine, as to make it sink so far that only a cubic
                    foot of it remains above water. In this state an additional weight of a hundred
                    pounds will depress it below the surface, or make it sink to the bottom. The
                    effect of adding extra weights is produced by diminishing the volume of
                    contained air, by condensing it into a smaller space. To accomplish this, a
                    large cylinder is applied in the bottom of the vessel, and provided with a
                    piston, which, by a rack and pinion, can be moved from one end of the cylinder
                    to the other, when the diver turns a handle, coming through the side of the
                    machine, and communicating motion by a worm and wheel to the pinion of the rack
                    before mentioned. The lower end of the cylinder is open to the water, and the
                    upper end opens <pb break="no" facs="nls:193323954" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3954-0063"
                    />within the machine; therefore, when the diver turns the handle in the
                    direction to raise up the piston in its cylinder, it necessarily diminishes the
                    bulk of the included air, and the machine will sink; but on depressing the
                    piston in the cylinder, it will ascend again. The inventor proposed to furnish
                    the machine with two small oars to move it in the water, and an anchor or
                    grapnel to make it fast whilst the diver walks about on the bottom, within the
                    limits of the length of the pipe, to examine sunk bodies, and discover the best
                    mode of raising them. To prevent danger from any accident happening to the
                    machine, the diver is to be provided with the means of quickly detaching the
                    pipes from the machine, and retaining a sufficiency of air in the armour to
                    carry him to the surface when he throws off the weight suspended from his
                    girdle.</p>
                <p>Another diving machine or chest was invented by Mr Rowe in 1753, and is
                    represented in Plate CLXXXIX. fig. 4. It consists of a trunk or hollow copper
                    vessel AB, soldered or riveted together with strength proportioned to the depth
                    of water where it is to be fixed. It contains the diver’s body, and also a
                    sufficiency of air for the time he intends to dive. He enters with his feet
                    first at the open end A, which is then closed by a lid or cover screwed on by a
                    number of screw bolts passing through the flanches. The vessel is bent at F, for
                    the bearing of the diver’s knees, and has a sufficiency of leaden ballast at B
                    to sink it in the right position. There are two hoops surrounding it, which, at
                    the same time that they strengthen it, afford points of suspension by a bar,
                    which is attached to them, and is pierced with several holes to admit a span
                    upon the rope, which is so adjusted as to suspend the whole, with the diver in
                    it, nearly in the position of the figure, when he will be in a convenient
                    posture for working with his arms, which come through openings C in the vessel,
                    to which sleeves E, of very strong leather, arc attached by a hoop or ring,
                    screwed to the vessel with the leather between them. The sleeves are lined with
                    cloth, and the edges round the holes are defended by soft quilting, from hurting
                    the diver’s arms by the pressure, as well as to prevent the sleeves and his arms
                    being thrust inwards. D is an aperture covered by a strong lens, for the diver
                    to see through. At H and G are two other openings in the upper part of the
                    vessel, covered by screw caps, which are removed when fresh air is to be
                    introduced into the machine by the nose pipe of a pair of bellows being applied
                    to force fresh air into one, and drive out the foul air at the other. The lower
                    opening is also of use to pump out any water which may leak through at the
                    joints, though this is as much as possible prevented by fitting leather into the
                    joints of the cover and the caps before they are screwed tight. The mass of lead
                    F is fastened to the lower side of the vessel in a line between the diver’s
                    arms, by means of hoops. On this the whole rests if it comes to the ground, and
                    remains in a proper position for the diver to work, and fasten ropes to any
                    thing which is to be drawn up, as shown in fig. 5.</p>
                <p>If the water be very deep, the diver must wear a kind of saddle on his back,
                    which, having a ridge touching the top part of the vessel withinside, enables
                    him to keep his arms properly out of the apertures, otherwise he would not have
                    strength to resist the pressure acting upon the surface of the arms and sleeves,
                    which forces them into it with a weight proportional to the quantity of surface
                    exposed, and to the depth of water. The diver gives his instruction to those
                    above by a small line, which is laid through a staple at the side of the
                    machine, and has a handle always hanging in reach of the diver’s hand. The upper
                    part of this line is held by a person in the boat or ship above, to whom any
                    signal is given, by the diver snatching or twitching the line a certain number
                    of times, as has before been agreed upon. This is immediately felt by the person
                    above, who gives orders accordingly. The size of the vessel is such that he can
                    continue at the bottom about half an hour, without any pipes or other supply,
                    and will be enabled to do many things very readily, such as recovering moorings,
                    chains lost in rivers or harbours, hooking ropes for weighing up lost anchors,
                    or any other purpose where there is free access to the object sought; though in
                    entering and searching the wrecks of ships, it would be less convenient than
                    some others which we shall describe.</p>
                <p>Besides the above, several other projects of a similar kind have been proposed,
                    not only with means within it-∣ self of raising and lowering the vessel, but
                    with contrivances in the shape of screw arms for moving it when under water in
                    any direction; but none with much success. This is said to have been tried in
                    the reign of King James I. by a famous English projector, Cornelius Drebell,
                    who, we are told by Mr Boyle, made a submarine vessel, which would carry twelve
                    rowers besides the passengers; and that he had also discovered a liquid which
                    had the singular property of restoring the air when it became impure by
                    breathing. This last circumstance, with the number of persons inclosed in the
                    machine, and the imperfect state of mechanics at the period alluded to, render
                    the whole story extremely improbable, though it shows clearly that the idea had
                    been entertained, and perhaps some attempt made. The celebrated Bishop Wilkins,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Mathematical Magic,</hi> takes up the scheme of
                    Drebell, and, with all the sanguine facilities of a projector, describes the
                    benefits of these submarine enterprises. The submarine vessel of Mr Bushnell of
                    Connecticut, in America, constructed in 1787, though very complex, appears to
                    have been a curious and ingenious machine, and to have promised success if
                    persevered in, according to the accounts published of it. It was intended to act
                    chiefly as an engine of war, by advancing under water towards an enemy’s ship,
                    and fixing in the bottom of it a magazine of powder, which, by peculiar
                    contrivances, was intended to take fire after the machine had got to a
                    sufficient distance to be out of danger. But if this be the only use of such a
                    machine, its failure need not be regretted. Let us now turn, then, to the most
                    important of all diving machines yet contrived, namely, <hi rend="smallcaps">The
                    Diving-Bell.</hi></p>
                <p>The principle of the diving-bell is extremely simple. Let any one insert a wine
                    glass in a tumbler of water; on sinking it to the bottom, the inside of the
                    glass will be observed to remain nearly full of air, so that any small object
                    within the glass will remain perfectly dry, the included air being confined on
                    all sides, and by its impenetrability excluding the water from its place. If
                    this experiment be made with a pretty large bell-glass, inverted over a taper
                    floating on the surface of the water in a still larger vessel, the taper will be
                    observed to descend with the glass to the bottom; and though surrounded on all
                    sides with water, it will be found to remain perfectly dry, and to continue
                    burning for some time. Conceive then a vessel of wood or metal, in the shape of
                    a wine-glass or truncated cone, but so large as, when inverted, to admit several
                    persons within it, sitting, for instance, on a board along one of the sides. Let
                    the whole then be suspended by a rope or chain over the side of a vessel, with a
                    jib pulley and crane, to lower or raise the machine at pleasure. Then, on the
                    machine being lowered and loaded with sufficient weight to sink it, the persons
                    may all descend to a great depth in the sea, without being wetted in the
                    smallest<pb break="no" facs="nls:193323967" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3967-0064"/>
                    degree; and there is nothing to prevent them remaining any time in this
                    situation, and moving about and doing operations at great depths.</p>
                <p>The above, then, was the original construction of the diving-bell; and the great
                    advantage of it, and what distinguishes it above every other similar invention,
                    and renders it vastly superior, is, that being perfectly open below, the divers
                    can get out and in with the utmost facility. This invention, according to
                    Professor Beckmann, is generally assigned to the sixteenth century; and “I am of
                    opinion,” says he, “that it was little known before that period. We read,
                    however, that in the time of Aristotle divers used a kind of kettle, to enable
                    them to continue longer under the water; but the manner in which it was employed
                    is not clearly described. The oldest information which we have of the use of the
                    diving-bell in Europe is that of John Taisnier, who was born in Hainault in
                    1509, and had a place at court under Charles V., whom he attended on his voyage
                    to Africa. He relates in what manner he saw, at Toledo, in the presence of the
                    emperor and several thousand spectators, two Greeks let themselves down under
                    water, in a large inverted kettle, with a burning light, and rise up again
                    without being wet. It appears that this art was then new to the emperor and the
                    Spaniards, and that the Greeks were caused to make the experiment in order to
                    prove the possibility of it.”</p>
                <p>“When the English in 1588 dispersed the Spanish fleet called the Invincible
                    Armada, part of the ships went to the bottom, near the Isle of Mull, on the
                    western coast of Scotland; and some of these, according to the account of the
                    Spanish prisoners, contained great riches. This information excited, from time
                    to time, the avarice of speculators, and gave rise to several attempts to
                    procure part of the lost treasure. In the year 1665, a person was so fortunate
                    as to bring up some cannon, which, however, were not sufficient to defray the
                    expenses. Of these attempts, and the kind of diving-bell used in them, the
                    reader will find an account in a work printed at Rotterdam in 1669, and entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">G. Sinclari</hi><hi rend="italic">Ars</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nova</hi><hi rend="italic">et magna gravitatis et levitatis.</hi> In the year
                    1680, William Phipps, a native of America, formed a project for searching and
                    unloading a rich Spanish ship sunk on the coast of Hispaniola; and represented
                    his plan in such a plausible manner, that King Charles II. gave him a ship, and
                    furnished him with every thing necessary for the undertaking. He set sail in the
                    year 1603; but being unsuccessful, returned again in great poverty, though with
                    a firm conviction of the possibility of his scheme. By a subscription, promoted
                    chiefly by the Duke of Albemarle, the son of the celebrated Monk, Phipps was
                    enabled, in 1687, to try his fortune once more, having previously engaged to
                    divide the profit according to the twenty shares of which the subscription
                    consisted. At first all his labour proved fruitless; but at last, when his
                    patience was almost entirely exhausted, he was so lucky as to bring up, from the
                    depth of six or seven fathoms, so much treasure, that he returned to England
                    with the value of L.200,000. Of this sum he himself got about sixteen, others
                    say twenty thousand, and the duke ninety thousand pounds. After he came back,
                    some persons endeavoured to persuade the king to seize both the ship and the
                    cargo, under a pretence that Phipps, when he solicited for his majesty’s
                    permission, had not given accurate information respecting the business. But the
                    king answered, with much greatness of mind, that he knew Phipps to be an honest
                    man, and that he and his friends should share the whole among them, had he
                    returned with double the value. His majesty even conferred upon him the honour
                    of knighthood, to show how much he was satisfied with his conduct. We know not
                    the construction of Phipps’s apparatus; but of the old figures of a
                    diving-machine, that which approaches nearest to the diving-bell is in a book on
                    fortification by Lorini; who describes a square box bound round with iron, which
                    is furnished with windows, and has a stool affixed to it for the diver. This
                    ingenious contrivance appears, however, to be older than that Italian; at least
                    he does not pretend to be the inventor of it.</p>
                <p>“In the year 1617, Francis Kessler gave a description of his water-armour,
                    intended also for diving, but which cannot really be used for that purpose. In
                    the year. 1671, Witsen taught, in a better manner than any of his predecessors,
                    the construction and use of the diving-bell; but he is much mistaken when he
                    says that it was invented at Amsterdam. In 1679 appeared, for the first time,
                    Borelli’s well-known work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Motu
                    Animalium</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in which he not only described the
                    diving-bell, but also proposed another, the impracticability of which was shown
                    by James Bernoulli. When Sturm published his <hi rend="italic">Collegium
                    curiosum</hi> in 1678, he proposed some hints for the improvement of this
                    machine, on which remarks were made in the <hi rend="italic">Journal des
                    Sçavansy</hi> The diving-bell, as hitherto used in the above simple form, is
                    liable to two great defects, viz.</p>
                <p>1. The elasticity of the included air prevents it from resisting entirely the
                    entrance of the water into the lower part of the bcll. The water, by the
                    universal law of fluids, presses the bell on all sides, in proportion to the
                    depth of the immersion. This pressure therefore it exerts upwards on the bottom
                    of the bell, and against the included air; but the air being extremely
                    compressible, yields to the pressure, and is contracted into a smaller volume,
                    allowing the water to enter and occupy the lower portion of the bell. Such is
                    the effect of this pressure, that at the depth of thirty-three feet the air
                    becomes compressed into half its volume, and the bell fills half full of water;
                    and the same proportion at cvery other depth. But,</p>
                <p>2. The air within the bell, by continued respiration, becomes speedily unfit to
                    support life; and the whole apparatus therefore must be raised from time to
                    time, to receive a fresh supply. Suppose that only two persons descend in the
                    bell at a time, we have seen that a supply of two hundred cubic inches of air
                    per minute is absolutely necessary for each person to keep in life and
                    sensibility. But in order to breathe freely, at least double that quantity would
                    be required; say for two persons half a cubic foot per minute. If then we have a
                    bell six feet long, and four feet average diameter, this would contain about
                    seventy cubic fleet, and would last upwards of two hours. So that for at least
                    one hour or more respiration might be carried on with all manner of freedom.</p>
                <p>At great depths, such as twenty, thirty, forty, and sixty feet, where the usual
                    pressure on the body from the atmosphere above is doubled and tripled, amounting
                    in the latter case to nearly forty pounds in every square inch, one would
                    imagine that respiration, and indeed the whole system of the body, would be
                    deranged under so thick and confined an atmosphere. But experience proves that
                    no great inconvenience arises from this circumstance; and the reason is, that
                    the air pressing into every cavity within the body, as well as externally, the
                    pressure is exactly balanced; so that the effect of the actual increase is
                    rendered nearly insensible. The only particular sensation felt in descending in
                    the bell is a severe pain in the ears, particularly at first. This increases a
                    little as we descend, but, after resting at the bottom, goes entirely off. It
                    arises from the effect of the condensed air acting externally on the tympanum of
                    the car, before the air within the tympanic cavity has acquired the same density
                    to counterbalance it. The tympanum on the outside communicates directly with the
                    atmosphere, the pressure of which therefore acts instantaneously. But on the
                    inside the tympanum bounds <pb break="no" facs="nls:193323980"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-3980-0065"/>the tympanic cavity; and this has no communication
                    with the external air, excepting by the Eustachian tube, which leads from the
                    cavity into the mouth. Through this tube, therefore, the condensed air must pass
                    from the mouth, to supply what is necessary within the cavity for restoring the
                    same equilibrium within and without. But the Eustachian tube is a long and
                    narrow passage; at its commencement in the ear it has a bony structure, but
                    towards its termination in the mouth, behind the nostrils, it becomes soft and
                    fleshy, so as readily to close the passage, particularly with any pressure
                    acting externally. It admits therefore an easy passage from the ear to the
                    mouth; but when any pressure arises in the opposite direction, it acts in some
                    degree like a valve, shutting the passage, until the increasing pressure again
                    forces it open. Some time then elapses before all this can be accomplished; and
                    during this time the external air pressing with full force on the tympanum,
                    produces the pain which is felt. When the Eustachian tube opens, it is generally
                    all of a sudden, and with a slight explosion or pop, which is followed by
                    instant relief from the pain. This relief may often be produced by filling the
                    mouth, or gulping the air and pressing it into the tube.</p>
                <p>Different accounts have been given of this effect on the ears in the diving-bell;
                    but the above seems the most accurate, and what really takes place. The effect,
                    indeed, may be shown experimentally by shutting the mouth and nostrils, and
                    exhausting the air from them by the action of the lungs. The air in the tympanic
                    cavity immediately rushing through the Eustachian tube into the mouth, the
                    external air acts on the tympanum, and produces a slight sensation of deafness,
                    such as is felt in the bell. But, instead of exhausting the air, attempt to
                    compress it, and force it through the tube into the internal ear; at first no
                    effect is produced: but after exerting a considerable pressure, a slight pop is
                    felt, and a little pain in the ear, which is just the sudden opening of the
                    tube.</p>
                <p>The great inconveniences of the diving-bell already mentioned were completely
                    removed by the labours of the celebrated and ingenious philosopher Dr Halley,
                    who about the year 1715 introduced the grand improvement of supplying it with
                    fresh air for any length of time without raising the bell out of the water. This
                    he effected by letting down from the vessel from which the bell was suspended,
                    barrels of fresh air, which, by means of pipes, discharged their contents into
                    the bell; while the foul air escaped by a small cock in the top of the bell. In
                    this manner the air within the bell was kept perfectly fresh, and for any length
                    of time. Another remarkable advantage arose from this plan. The force of the air
                    in the barrels was made to discharge the whole of the water out of the bell,
                    which the elasticity of the included air had hitherto allowed to enter and
                    partially to fill the cavity. This was easily done by stopping the cock at the
                    top, and letting down the barrels below the level of the bell, by which means
                    the air included in them received a sufficient preponderating pressure to enter
                    the bell and drive out the water. In this manner the whole cavity of the bell
                    became available for working; and, what was of still more importance, the diver
                    could with ease descend and walk on the bottom of the sea, the feet being only
                    slightly immersed. The following is the interesting account which Dr Halley
                    gives of his arrangements:</p>
                <p>“The bell I made use of was of wood, containing about sixty cubic feet in its
                    concavity, and was of the form of a truncated cone, whose diameter at the top
                    was three feet, and at the bottom five. This I coated with lead so heavy that it
                    would sink empty; and I distributed the weight so about its bottom, that it
                    would go down in a perpendicular direction, and no other. In the top I fixed a
                    strong but clear glass, as a window, to let in the light from above; and
                    likewise a cock to let out the hot air that had been breathed; and below, about
                    a yard under .the bell, I placed a stage, which hung by three ropes, each of
                    which was charged with about one hundredweight to keep it steady. This machine I
                    suspended from the mast of a ship by a sprit, which was sufficiently secured by
                    stays to the mast head, and was directed by braces to carry it overboard clear
                    of the ship’s side, and to bring it again within board, as occasion
                    required.</p>
                <p>“To supply air to this bell when under water, I caused a couple of barrels, of
                    about thirty-six gallons each, to be cased with lead, so as to sink empty; each
                    of them having a bung-hole in its lowest parts to let in the water as the air in
                    them condensed on their descent, and to let it out again when they were drawn up
                    full from below. And to a hole in the uppermost part of these barrels I fixed a
                    leathern trunk or hose well liquored with bees-wax and oil, and long enough to
                    fall below the bung-hole, being kept down by a weight appended; so that the air
                    in the upper part of the barrels could not escape, unless the lower ends of
                    these hose were first lifted up.</p>
                <p>“The air-barrels being thus prepared, I fitted them with tackle proper to make
                    them rise and fall alternately, after the manner of two buckets in a well; which
                    was done with so much ease, that two men, with less than half their strength,
                    could perform all the labour required; and in their descent they were directed
                    by lines fastened to the under edge of the bell, which passed through rings on
                    both sides of the leathern hose in each barrel; so that, sliding down by these
                    lines, they came readily to the hand of a man who stood on the stage on purpose
                    to receive them, and to take up the ends of the hose into the bell. Through
                    these hose, as soon as their ends came above the surface of the water in the
                    barrels, all the air that was included in the upper parts of them was blown with
                    great force into the bell, whilst the water entered at the bungholes below, and
                    filled them; and as soon as the air of one barrel had been thus received, upon a
                    signal given, that was drawn up, and at the same time the other descended, and,
                    by an alternate succession, furnished air so quick, and in so great plenty, that
                    I myself have been one of five who have been together at the bottom in nine or
                    ten fathom water, for above an hour and a half at a time, without any sort of
                    ill consequence; and I might have continued there as long as I pleased, for any
                    thing that appeared to the contrary. Besides, the whole cavity of the bell was
                    kept entirely free from water, so that I sat on a bench which was diametrically
                    placed near the bottom, wholly dressed, with all my clothes on. I only observed
                    that it was necessary to be let down gradually at first, as about twelve feet at
                    a time; and then to stop and drive out the air that entered, by receiving three
                    or four barrels of fresh air before I descended further. But being arrived at
                    the depth designed, I then let out as much of the hot air that had been breathed
                    as each barrel would replenish with cool, by means of the cock at the top of the
                    bell; through whose aperture, though very small, the air would rush with so much
                    violence as to make the surface of the sea boil, and to cover it with a white
                    foam, notwithstanding the weight of the water over us.</p>
                <p>“Thus I found that I could do any thing that required to be done just under us;
                    and that, by taking off the stage, I could, for a space as wide as the circuit
                    of the bell, lay the bottom of the sea so far dry as not to be over shoes
                    thereon. And, by the glass window, so much light was transmitted, that when the
                    sea was clear, and especially when the sun shone, I could see perfectly well to
                    write or read, much more to fasten or lay hold on any thin&lt;r under us that
                    was to be taken up. And, by the return<pb break="no" facs="nls:193323993"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-3993-0066"/> of the air-barrels, I often sent up orders
                    written with an iron pen, on small plates of lead, directing how to move us from
                    place to place as occasion required. At other times, when the water was troubled
                    and thick, it would be as dark as night below; but in such cases I have been
                    able to keep a candle burning in the bell as long as I pleased, notwithstanding
                    the great expense of air necessary to maintain flame. This I take to be an
                    invention applicable to various uses, such as fishing for pearls, diving for
                    coral or sponges, and the like, in far greater depths than has hitherto been
                    thought possible. Also for the fitting and placing of the foundations of moles,
                    bridges, &amp;c. in rocky bottoms, and for the cleaning and scrubbing of ships’
                    bottoms when foul, in calm weather, at sea. I shall only intimate, that by an
                    additional contrivance, I have found it not impracticable for a diver to go out
                    of an engine to a good distance from it, the air being conveyed to him with a
                    continued stream, by small flexible pipes; which pipes may serve as a clue to
                    direct him back again when he would return to the bell.”</p>
                <p>Plate CLXXXIX., fig. 5, represents the construction and operations of Dr Halley’s
                    bell as thus described.</p>
                <p>In 1721, shortly after the above experiments were made, Dr Halley contrived
                    additional apparatus, to enable the diver to go out from the bell to a
                    considerable distance, and stay a sufficient time in the sea, and walk about on
                    the bottom, with full freedom to act as occasion required. Considering that the
                    pressure being greater on the surface of the water in the bell than on any other
                    surface which was higher than, that in the bell, the air would pass by a pipe
                    from the bell into any cavity for air; where the surface of the water was
                    higher, he concluded that a man, by putting on his head a bell or cap of lead,
                    made sufficiently heavy to sink empty, and in form resembling the bell itself,
                    might keep his head dry, and might receive a constant stream of air from the
                    great bell, so long as the surface of the water in the cap was above the level
                    of that in the bell, by means of a flexible pipe which he would carry coiled on
                    his arm.</p>
                <p>In pursuance of this idea he procured pipes to be made, which answered all that
                    was expected from them. They were secured against the pressure of the water by a
                    spiral brass wire, which kept them open from end to end, the diameter of the
                    cavity being about the sixth part of an inch. These wires being coated with thin
                    glove leather, and neatly sewed, were dipped into a mixture of hot oil and
                    bees-wax, which, filling up the pores of the leather, made it impenetrable to
                    water; several thicknesses of sheep’s entrails were then drawn over them, which,
                    when dry, were covered with paint, and then the whole defended with another coat
                    of leather to keep them from fretting. Several of the pipes were as much as
                    forty feet long, the size of a half inch rope. One end of a pipe being fixed in
                    the bell at some height above the water, the other end was fastened to a cock
                    which opened into the cap. The use of the cock was to stop the return of the air
                    whenever there was occasion to stoop down or go below the surface of the air in
                    the bell, which occurred as often as there was occasion to go out or return into
                    the machine. The diver, therefore, when he has descended to the bottom in the
                    great bell, puts on his cap with the pipe hanging on his arm like the coil of a
                    rope. As soon as he leaves the bell, he opens the cock in the pipe, and walks on
                    the bottom of the sea, giving out the coils of his pipe as it is required; and
                    this serves as a clue to direct him back again to the great bell, from whence he
                    derives his supply of air by means of the pipe.</p>
                <p>The weight of a man being very little more than that of his bulk in water, he
                    could not act with any strength, nor stand with any firmness, especially if
                    there is any current, without a considerable addition of weight; the leaden caps
                    were therefore made to weigh about half a hundredweight, to which was added a
                    girdle for the walst, formed of large weights of lead nearly of as great weight
                    in the whole; also two clogs of lead for the feet, of about twelve pounds each.
                    With this accession of weight Dr Halley found a man could stand well in an
                    ordinary stream, and even go against it. It is necessary for the diver to be
                    provided against the cold of the water, which, though it could not be removed so
                    that a man could endure it long, yet it was much eased by wearing a waistcoat
                    and drawers made close to the body, of that thick woollen stuff of which
                    blankets are made. This becoming full of water, would be a little warmed by the
                    heat of the body, and keep off the chill of new cold water coming on.</p>
                <p>When the water is not turbid, things are seen sufficiently distinct at the bottom
                    of the sea; but a small degree of thickness makes perfect night in a moderate
                    depth of water. To obtain an open view from the leaden caps, which, from their
                    use, the doctor called caps of maintenance, he at first used a plain glass
                    before the sight, but soon found that the vapour of the breath made such a dew
                    on the surface of the glass that it lost its transparency. To remedy this, he
                    found it necessary to prolong that side of the cap which was before the eyes,
                    and thereby enlarge the prospect of what was beneath.</p>
                <p>Another plan of the diving-bell was proposed by Mr Martin Triewald, F. R. S. and
                    military architect to the king of Sweden, which, for a single person, is in some
                    respects thought to be more eligible than Dr Halley’s, and is constructed as
                    follows. AB, fig. 6, is the bell, which is sunk by lead weights DD hung to its
                    bottom. This bell is of copper, and tinned all over in the inside, which is
                    illuminated by three strong convex lenses P, with copper lids to defend them.
                    The iron ring or plate below the bell serves the diver to stand on when he is at
                    work, and is suspended at such a distance from the bottom of the bell by the
                    chains, that when the diver stands upright, his head is just above the water in
                    the bell, where the air is much better than higher up, because it is colder, and
                    consequently more fit for respiration. But as the diver must always be within
                    the bell, and his head of course in the upper part, the inventor has contrived,
                    that even there, when he has breathed the hot air as well as he can, he may, by
                    means of a spiral copper tube <hi rend="italic">bc,</hi> placed close to the
                    inside of the bell, draw the cooler and fresher air from the lowermost parts;
                    for which purpose a flexible leather tube, about two feet long, is fixed to the
                    upper end of the copper tube; and to the other end of this tube is fixed an
                    ivory mouth-piece, by which the diver draws in the air, at the same time
                    expiring by the nostrils. This bell may be supplied with fresh air by barrels,
                    the same as Dr Halley’s.</p>
                <p>The next improvements introduced in the construction of the diving-bell were
                    those by Mr Spalding of Edinburgh, and for which the Society of Arts voted him a
                    reward. These are certainly deserving of attention,' although they do not appear
                    to have afterwards been adopted in practice. Mr Spalding had, in the two
                    preceding years, acquired considerable experience in the management of a bell on
                    Dr Halley’s plan, which he had constructed in the hopes of recovering some of a
                    considerable property which had been lost in a ship wrecked on the Scares, or
                    Fern Islands, in 1774, in the night, when all the crew perished. Some of the
                    light goods were thrown on shore, and it was proposed to recover the rest by
                    diving, the remainder of the owners giving up the management of the whole to Mr
                    Spalding. His first experiments were made in depths of five, six, and eight
                    fathoms, in Leith Roads; and having in these made his apparatus <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193324006" xml:id="kp-eb0708-4006-0067"/>tolerably perfect, he sailed
                    for Dunbar, thirty miles distance, in an open longboat, sloop-rigged, and of
                    about six or eight tons burthen. By a mistaken account he had been informed the
                    bottom of the Fox ship of war lay there; but upon his arrival, the oldest seaman
                    in the place could give him no intelligence; and as that vessel had perished in
                    the night with all on board, somewhere in Dunbar Bay, and by storms, so long
                    before as thirty years, it was thought to be sanded up. In order to gratify the
                    curiosity of some friends there, he still determined to descend where it might
                    be thought probable her bottom lay; but in seven and eight fathoms water he
                    found nothing but a hard sandy bottom, from which he was led to conjecture that
                    the proprietors of the valuable effects which were on board that vessel might
                    have found their account in sweeping for her. Being informed that a vessel,
                    which was thrown up by accident in the river Tay, near Dundee, with a large
                    quantity of iron, lay within two fathoms of the surface at low water, he
                    determined to make trial there, and accordingly sailed across the frith to that
                    place, about fifteen leagues distant from Dunbar. Here he went down three
                    different times, changing the ground at each going down, and at last fell in
                    with a stump of the wreek, sunk five fathoms deep at low water to a level with
                    the soft bed of the river, which is composed of a light sand intermixed with
                    shells. The principal parts of this wreek were supposed to have been carried
                    away by an immense body of ice the year before. He found that the muddiness of
                    the river occasions a darkness at only two fathoms from the surface that cannot
                    be described; and from the smallness of his machine, which contained only
                    forty-eight English gallons, it was impossible to have a candle burning in it,
                    which would consume the air too quickly for any man to be able to work, and at
                    the same time pay attention to receiving the necessary supplies of air.</p>
                <p>These trials were only preparatory to his views at the Scares, hoping to acquire
                    experience which would enable him to surmount the dangerous difficulty of the
                    unequal rocky bottom which he expected to meet with; but in the preceding
                    trials, and different alterations of the machinery, so much time þad been lost,
                    that the weather became stormy, and he was obliged to wait at Bamborough Castle
                    some time till the weather became more favourable. He then sailed to the Scares
                    with his brother, three sailors, and two pilots. It was four in the afternoon,
                    about high water, when he went down at a small distance from the place where he
                    judged the wreck to lie. The depth was about ten fathoms. He fortunately
                    alighted on a flat part of the rock, within a small space of a dreadful chasm,
                    and had just gone two steps with his machine, when the terror of the two pilots
                    was so great, that, in spite of his brother, they brought him up very
                    precipitately, before he had in any degree examined around him. On coming into
                    the boat, they remonstrated on the danger of the machine being overturned either
                    on the wreek or the rocks, and also on the impossibility of raising any of the
                    weighty goods with so small a purchase in an open boat, and in a place where, at
                    this season, no large vessel would venture to lie, as the nights were then so
                    long, and only two passages for a small vessel to run through, in case of a gale
                    of easterly or southerly wind; one of the passages being extremely narrow, and
                    both of them dangerous.</p>
                <p>“Convinced from this,” says Mr Spalding in his account, “that with an open boat
                    nothing could be accomplished, and that, except in June and July, no man would
                    risk himself with me in a sloop, to continue a few days and nights at anebor
                    there, I was obliged to abandon my project; yet 1 determined to take a view of
                    the guns of a Dutch ship of war lost in the year 1704; and as they lay two or
                    three miles nearer the land, I could execute this design with less difficulty,
                    especially as the weather continued still favourable. Having procured all the
                    intelligence possible, we went to the place, where I went down four different
                    times, but could find no marks of any wreck, notwithstanding my walking about in
                    five and six fathoms water, as far as it was thought safe to allow the rope to
                    the bell, continuing generally twenty minutes each time at the bottom. On this
                    occasion I was obliged to carry a cutting hook and knife, and clear away the sea
                    weeds, which at this place are very thick and strong; without this method I
                    could not move about. At the fifth going down, each trial being in a different
                    place, I was agreeably surprised to find a large grove of tall weeds, all of
                    them from six to eight feet high, with large tufted tops, mostly in regular
                    ranges, as far as the eye could reach, a variety of small lobsters and other
                    shell-fish swimming about in the intervals.” He then discovered the place where
                    ohe of the cannons lay; but was too much exhausted, by having been down at
                    intervals for near three hours, to attempt bringing it up.</p>
                <p>In these descents Mr Spalding found out two very serious dangers attendant on the
                    use of the bell on Dr Halley’s plan. These are, 1. By Dr Halley’s construction,
                    the sinking or rising of the bell depends entirely upon the people who are at
                    the surface of the water; and as the bell, even when in the water, has a very
                    considerable weight, the raising of it not only requires a great deal of labour,
                    but there is a possibility of the rope breaking by which it is raised, and thus
                    every person in the bell would inevitably perish. 2. As there are, in many
                    places of the sea, rocks which lie at a considerable depth, the figure of which
                    cannot possibly be perceived from above, there is danger that some of their
                    ragged prominences may catch hold of one of the edges of the bell in its
                    descent, and thus overset it before any signal can be given to those above,
                    which would infallibly be attended with the destruction of the people in the
                    bell, especially as it must always be unknown, before trial, what kind of a
                    bottom the sea has in any place.</p>
                <p>To obviate these defects, Mr Spalding introduced a balance-weight suspended below
                    the bell, and which, when it reached any rocky or uneven ground, settled down
                    first, and then the bell being made too light to sink without the weight,
                    remained suspended and free from danger; and for the purpose of raising or
                    levelling the bell without aid from above, he divided with an air-tight
                    partition the upper portion of the bell from the lower. The former was capable
                    of being filled either with water or air at pleasure, and of thus increasing or
                    diminishing the buoyant effect at pleasure, on the same principle as the
                    air-bladder in fishes.</p>
                <p>Plate CLXXXIX. fig. 7, represents these arrangements, which will be understood
                    from the following description: ABCD represents a section of the bell, which is
                    made of wood; <hi rend="italic">ee</hi> are iron hooks, by means of which it is
                    suspended by ropes QBFe, and QAERe, and QS, as expressed in the figure; <hi
                    rend="italic">cc</hi> are iron hooks, to which are appended lead weights, that
                    keep the mouth of the bell always parallel to the surface of the water, whether
                    the machine, taken altogether, is lighter or heavier than an equal bulk of
                    water. By these weights alone, however, the bell would not sink; another is
                    therefore added, represented at W, and which can be raised or lowered at
                    pleasure by means of a rope passing over the pulley, and fastened to one of the
                    sides of the bell at M. As the bell descends, this weight, called by Mr Spalding
                    the <hi rend="italic">balance-weight,</hi> hangs down a considerable way below
                    the mouth of the bell; In ease the edge of the bell is caught by any obstacle,
                    the balance-weight is imn⅛ediately lowered down, so that it <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193324019" xml:id="kp-eb0708-4019-0068"/>may rest upon the bottom. By
                    this means the bell is lightened, so that all danger of oversetting is removed;
                    for, being lighter without the balance-weight than an equal bulk of water, it is
                    evident that the bell will rise as well as the length of the rope affixed to the
                    balance-weight will allow it. This weight, therefore, will serve as a kind of
                    anchor, to keep the bell at any particular depth which the divers may think
                    necessary; or, by pulling it quite up, the descent may be continued to the very
                    bottom.</p>
                <p>By another very ingenious contrivance, Mr Spalding rendered it possible for the
                    divers to raise the bell, with all the weights appended to it, even to the
                    surface, or to stop at any particular depth, as they might think proper; and
                    thus they could still be safe, even though the rope designed for pulling up the
                    bell was broken. For this purpose the bell is divided into two cavities, both of
                    which are made as tight as possible. Just above the second bottom EF, arc small
                    slits in the sides of the bcll, through which the water entering as the bell
                    descends, displaces the air originally contained in this cavity, which flies out
                    at the upper orifice of the cock GIL When this is done, the divers turn the
                    handle G, which stops the cock; so that if any more air was to get into the
                    cavity AEFD, it could no longer be discharged through the orifice H, as before.
                    When this cavity is full of water, the bell sinks; but when a considerable
                    quantity of air is admitted, it rises. If, therefore, the divers have a mind to
                    raise themselves, they turn the small cock <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> by which a
                    communication is made between the upper and under cavities of the bell. The
                    consequence of this is, that a quantity of air immediately enters the upper
                    cavity, forces out a quantity of the water contained in it, and thus renders the
                    bell lighter by the whole weight of the water which is displaced. Thus, if a
                    certain quantity of air is admitted into the upper cavity, the bell will descend
                    very slowly; if a greater quantity, it will neither ascend nor descend, but
                    remain stationary; and if a larger quantity of air is still admitted, it will
                    rise to the top. It is to be observed, however, that the air which is thus let
                    out into the upper cavity must be immediately replaced from the air-barrel; and
                    the air is to be let out very slowly, or the bell will rise to the top with so
                    great velocity that the divers will be in danger of being shaken out of their
                    seats. But, by following these directions, every possible accident may be
                    prevented, and people may descend to great depths without the least apprehension
                    of danger. The bell also becomes so easily manageable in the water, that it may
                    be conducted from one place to another by a small boat with the greatest ease,
                    and with perfect safety to those who are in it.</p>
                <p>Instead of wooden seats used by Dr Halley, Mr Spalding made usc of ropes
                    suspended by hooks <hi rend="italic">bbb,</hi> and on these ropes the divers may
                    sit without any inconvenience. I and K are two windows made of thick strong
                    glass, for admitting light to the divers. N represents an air-cask with its
                    tackle, and NP the flexible pipe through which the air is admitted to the bell.
                    In the ascent and descent of this cask the pipe is kept down by a small weight
                    appended, as in Dr Halley’s machine. F is a small cock by which the hot air is
                    discharged as often as it becomes troublesome. Fig. 5 is a representation of the
                    whole diving apparatus, which it is hoped will be readily understood without any
                    further explanation. Two air-barrels are represented in this figure; but Mr
                    Spalding was of opinion that one air barrel capable of containing thirty gallons
                    is sufficient for an ordinary machine.</p>
                <p>An improvement has been suggested on Mr Spalding’s plan of raising or lowering
                    the bell, by shutting up the upper bell entirely, and forming it into a magazine
                    of condensed air, which being charged by two air-pumps within the bell, could be
                    let off at pleasure, and filling the lower bell, would displace the water and
                    increase the buoyancy.</p>
                <p>The last great improvement on the diving-bell, and what stands next in importance
                    to that of Halley, and has; brought the machine to that perfect state in which
                    it’ is now so successfully employed, was introduced by the∣ celebrated engineer
                    Mr Smeaton. This consisted in sub-&lt; stituting for the air-barrels of Halley a
                    forcing air-pump,] by which a continued stream of air was poured into' the bell
                    without any farther trouble or apparatus than a man or two to work the pump. It
                    was about the year 1779, in the repairs of the foundations of Hexham Bridge,
                    that Mr Smeaton first tried the use of the diving-bell; and this was the first
                    attempt indeed to introduce it into the operations of engineering, where it has
                    since rendered such essential service. The piers of the bridge having been
                    undermined by the violence of the current sweeping away the gravel from under
                    the floor timbers of the caissons by which they were founded, it occurred to
                    Smeaton that by means of the diving-bell the cavities under the foundations
                    might be filled up with rough stones, rammed and wedged firmly together. His
                    diving-bell consisted of a square box or chest of wood, three and a half feet
                    long, two feet broad, and four feet high. The pump for supplying it with air was
                    fixed on the top of the bell, and worked by a handle at one side. The depth of
                    the river being small, it was not intended to go down so as to cover the whole
                    of the bell, else the air-pump would have required to be removed; it was only
                    necessary to sink the mouth of the bell down to the level of the caisson bottom.
                    With the assistance of this machine Mr Smeaton succeeded in underpinning the
                    foundations of some of the piers. The calamitous accident which followed in
                    1782, when the whole structure was carried away by a sudden and violent flood,
                    only proved the great insufficiency of the natural bed of the river.</p>
                <p>In 1788 Mr Smeaton constructed a second diving-bell, for the operations
                    contemplated at Ramsgate harbour, on a much more substantial and improved plan;
                    and this is the model on which all the succeeding diving machines have been
                    formed. Instead of the usual form of a bell or conical inverted tub of wood,
                    sunk by weights attached to the outside, this consisted of a square chest of
                    cast iron, four and a half feet long, four and a half feet high, and three feet
                    wide, affording sufficient room for two men at a time to work under it. Instead
                    of the weights applied externally, the bell itself was cast of such thickness,
                    particularly at the bottom, that its own weight, viz. fifty cwt., was more than
                    sufficient to sink it when full of air. The pump also for supplying fresh air
                    was placed in a boat by itself, on which several hands were stationed, to keep
                    the pump continually in action. The air from the pump was conveyed to the
                    machine by a flexible tube, which allowed the bell to be moved up or down, or ip
                    any direction, independent of the motion of the boat. From the above dimensions,
                    the bell would always contain about fifty cubic feet of air, which, from what we
                    have already shown, would be sufficient to support life for two persons for
                    about an hour, independent of any supply from above; so that any idea of danger
                    from this source is completely removed. It was in clearing the foundations for
                    the advanced pier at Ramsgate that it occurred to Mr Smeaton the operation might
                    be facilitated by the diving-bell. A large quantity of stones had been thrown
                    in, to secure the old pier head; and it seemed doubtful whether they could be
                    got up in nine and ten feet water by the usual method of tongs from the barges.
                    The diving-bell was found to answer completely the object intended. In the
                    course of two months the foundations w ere cleared; and it was computed that of
                    160 tons of stone raised out of the foundation, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193324032" xml:id="kp-eb0708-4032-0069"/>about 100 stones, many of
                    them above a ton each, were brought up by the diving-bell, without which a full
                    season would have been lost.</p>
                <p>The pier, which was afterwards built on the foundation thus cleared, was founded
                    by caissons, but in the course of years was found to require renewal in some
                    places, and in others to be protected by an apron or outside wall of
                    regularly-built masonry; and here a new application of the diving-bell arose in
                    the building of this wall under water. For this purpose the bcll is suspended by
                    powerful tackle to the extremity of a long wooden frame, which rests on the top
                    of the pier, the one end projecting over the pier, and the other running back
                    and turning on a centre pin, which is fixed in a heavy stone on the pier. The
                    frame thus sweeping with a long radius, and the weight of the whole being borne
                    by a roller running along near the edge of the pier on a cast-iron plate or rail
                    in the segment of a circle, the bell is capable of having a considerable motion
                    right or left along the wall, and the block of the tackle being moveable along
                    the frame, the bell is by this means shifted out or in from the wall at
                    pleasure; and by these two motions can be set in any required position within
                    the sweep of the apparatus. The directions for moving it are given by the
                    divers, and communicated to those who have charge of the apparatus above, by
                    merely striking with a hammer on the inside of the bell. From the great facility
                    with which water conducts sound, the strokes of the hammer are heard at a great
                    distance, and have a peculiar character, which is not easily mistaken for any
                    other. To convey various directions, the divers have established a sort of
                    language from the number of blows of the hammer. One blow, for instance, denotes
                    more air; two, stand fast; three, heave up; four, lower down; and so on. The
                    first operation in the building is to clear and level the foundation. If this be
                    loose materials, they are removed by dredging, in the usual manner; but wherever
                    rock occurs, it is done by the bell, with two men in it, being let down to the
                    bottom, which, at Ramsgate, is a hard chalk rock. When it stands thereon, it
                    lays the chalk dry to the level of the bottom edge of the bell; but if the
                    surface is uneven, the bell cannot descend so low but that it will leave six or
                    eight inches of water on the bottom. The surface of this water is the level they
                    work to, and by cutting away every eminence which rises above the water, they
                    soon obtain a perfectly level surface. They work with a small pick, made
                    something like a narrow adze, for this purpose; and the work proceeds rapidly,
                    for the chalk is not very hard. When they have accumulated as much rubbish as
                    becomes inconvenient, they give three knocks on the bell to order the people to
                    draw it up, till they, standing on the bottom, find themselves knee deep; then
                    two knocks to stand fast. They now take in a shallow basket which has been
                    previously let down from above, and fill the rubbish into it, then snatch it to
                    order it to be drawn up, and strike four times on the bell, that they may be
                    lowered down to proceed with their work. Having in this manner hewed away the
                    surface till the water, standing equally all over it, shows it to be a perfect
                    level plane, they give orders to be removed to a new situation, yet at such a
                    small distance that part of the surface they before levelled is still beneath
                    the bell, in order that both may be brought to one plane. Thus continuing the
                    work, they get all the rock prepared for the stone-work, without any other level
                    than the water.</p>
                <p>The foundation being thus levelled, the stones are in the mean time all prepared
                    and jointed, either square or with dovetails. These are first hoisted from the
                    pier by means of a crane, and let down to their places in the work, as nearly as
                    can be done, by the crane. As each stone is thus laid, the divers direct
                    themselves right or left, up or down, until they be exactly over the stone; then
                    making fast a strong chain to the lewis of the stone, the other end of which is
                    attached to a ring in the top of the bell, they give the signal to heave, and
                    the bell, with the stone under it, are both suspended by the tackle, and being
                    moved right or left until it cover exactly over its place in the wall, it is
                    then let down, and the chain being detached, the operation proceeds with another
                    stone in the same manner, until the wall be completed. No cement is generally
                    used to unite the stones; their own weight, and the accuracy of the joints,
                    being sufficient to hold them together.</p>
                <p>Since the completion of Ramsgate harbour, the diving-bell has been applied with
                    great success to various other operations of a similar kind in different parts
                    of the kingdom, and particularly at Dublin, Donaghadee, and other harbours in
                    Ireland, and at Holyhead and Portpatrick on this side the channel. Plate
                    CLXXXVIII. contains drawings of the bell and machinery used for the harbour of
                    Houth, near Dublin, under the direction of the late eminent Mr Rennie, and with
                    which the foundations of the picr wall were laid with success at very
                    considerable depths below water.</p>
                <p>Fig. 1 is a section showing the machine and the bell viewed in the direction of
                    the length of the wall which is to be erected, and fig. 2 is an elevation of the
                    same as it appears when viewed from the sea. A is the bell, which is made of
                    cast iron. It is suspended by strong chains passed through eyes rr, fig. 5,'and
                    through the ring mof a tackle B. FF, figs. 1 and 2, are strong beams supported
                    in a horizontal position by cross beams G, resting at one end on the shore, and
                    the other ends supported by a scaffolding L of piles firmly braced. On the beams
                    F two iron railways are laid for the wheels of two carriages to run upon; one of
                    these carriages contains the tackle which suspends the bell, and the other has a
                    similar tackle to hoist the large stones, which are to be laid on the wall X.
                    Each carriage runs with four wheels <hi rend="italic">aa</hi> upon the railways
                    F, and has a smaller or upper carriage running upon it in a transverse
                    direction; and this upper carriage contains the windlass purchase tackle, by
                    which the bell or the stone is raised. Thus F ’ is the timber frame of the
                    principal carriage, on the top of which are railways for the wheels <hi
                    rend="italic">dd</hi> of the upper carriage, of which D is the frame; and C is
                    the roller or barrel to wind up the rope or fall of the great purchase tackle B,
                    which is suspended from the frame of the carriage, and bears the weight of the
                    bell. On the end of the barrel is a large cog-wheel M, which is turned round by
                    a pinion fixed on the axis N of a second wheel 0, and this is turned by a
                    pinion, to which the handles H are applied. By turning these, two men can raise
                    or lower the bell with ease. In order to move the bell in either direction, the
                    wheels <hi rend="italic">aa</hi> of the lower carriage E are provided with cogs
                    at one edge, and pinions <hi rend="italic">b</hi> work in the teeth of these;
                    both pinions <hi rend="italic">b</hi> are fixed on the same axis, which extends
                    across the frame; and wheels <hi rend="italic">c</hi> are also fixed on each
                    extremity of the axis. These wheels have holes or mortises in them to receive
                    handspikes or levers, by which they can be turned round, and will then move the
                    lower carriage and the bell along the railways FF, in the direction of the
                    length of the wall, which is to be built as shown by X. In like manner the
                    wheels <hi rend="italic">dd</hi> of the upper carriage are provided with cogs
                    and pinions <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> on the end of which are the capstan head
                    <hi rend="italic">f</hi> to receive handspikes, when it is required to move the
                    upper carriage and the bell in a transverse direction. By means of these two
                    motions in transverse directions, the bell or the stone can be suspended over
                    any required spot in the wall, and lowered down thereupon as the men in the bell
                    direct. Fig. 5 is a section of the bell, and fig. 6 a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193324045" xml:id="kp-eb0708-4045-0070"/>plan to show the apertures
                    <hi rend="italic">nn</hi> for the lenses which give light. Two men descend
                    together, a scat 5 being fixed across on each side of the bell. The air-pipe is
                    screwed on at <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> and proceeds to the air-pump as shown in
                    fig. 1. The pump is placed on the top of the scaffold G; it has two barrels 11,
                    which are worked by a lever K, by one or two men; they act as forcing pumps, and
                    the air which is thrown down escapes from the lower edge of the bell, and rises
                    up through the water in bubbles. By this means the air in the bell is at·all
                    times quite fresh and pure.</p>
                <p>The stones which are to be used in building the wall are prepared on shore, and
                    fitted to each other. When all is prepared, these stones are lowered down the
                    bank by a capstan to the position <hi rend="italic">w.</hi> The rope of the
                    machine is then attached, and by the aid of both ropes the stone is lowered down
                    upon the wall. The divers then descend in the bell, and the two carriages are
                    brought close together, by which means the bell will hang partly over the stone
                    W, fig. 2, so that the men can guide it into its place on the wall X, and make
                    signals to those above to direct them which way to move the stone, and where to
                    lower it. The bell was also employed, in the first instance, to clear the
                    foundation for the walls. It was then lowered quite down on the bottom, and the
                    men worked the rock to a level surface. In many parts it was requisite to blast
                    it with gunpowder. The divers bored the hole in the rock, and placed the powder
                    in a tin cartridge, which was well secured in the hole, by running in small
                    fragments of stone. A small tin pipe was affixed to the canister, long enough to
                    reach up above the surface of the water. When all was prepared, the bell was
                    drawn up out of the way, and a nail or other small piece of iron heated red hot
                    was dropped into the tin pipe, thereby to descend to the powder.</p>
                <p>Figures 3 and 4 represent a vessel which was fitted up under the direction of Mr
                    Rennie, to carry a diving-bell of cast iron. This vessel was used in Plymouth
                    Sound, and the bell was swept over the bottom to discover and take up old
                    anchors, &amp;c. The bell A is suspended over the bow of the vessel, by a strong
                    tackle ç, from the extremity of a pair of shears; that is, two masts DB, DB,
                    fig. 4. The fall or rope of the tackle <hi rend="italic">q</hi> is drawn up by a
                    windlass at C. There is also another strong tackle GH, extended between the head
                    of the mast I and the top of the shears D. This is drawn by the windlass F. The
                    use of this is to raise the shears upright, and bring the bell on board. A
                    platform S is fixed on the deck to lower it upon when out of use.</p>
                <p>The diving bell has lately been employed with success in improving the navigation
                    of the Clyde between Glasgow and Greenock, by raising up and removing out of the
                    bed of the river a number of large stones which obstructed the channel, and
                    could not be so readily got out by any other means. The bell is constructed
                    similarly to that in fig. 3, but instead of being let down at the end or side of
                    the barge, has a well constructed in the middle of the vessel itself, in which
                    it is made to rise and fall by strong chains, tackling, and cranes. Recently a
                    second barge and bell have been constructed, and are now employed on the river
                    for the same purpose. The management of the vessel and bell requires six or
                    seven hands. The whole can be moved with great facility to different parts of
                    the river, and moored wherever their assistance is required.</p>
                <p>Such, then, is an account of the construction and uses of the different diving
                    machines, and particularly the diving-bell; and we have no doubt that the
                    principle, as it is susceptible of it, may yet be still more extensively
                    applied, and in various other ways. The only disadvantage attending the machine
                    in its present form is the expense and cumbrous nature of the apparatus, which
                    prevents its use in many cases where it might be of real service; so that it is
                    only in some great and extensive public work that it can ever be thought of. It
                    is to be hoped, therefore, that the skill and ingenuity of our mechanicians may
                    yet succeed in introducing the machine in a more accessible and manageable
                    form.</p>
