                    the reception of ships, either for their security or for the convenience of
                    building or giving them repairs. This word has been derived by some, absurdly
                    enough, from the Greek <hi rend="italic">beγj&gt;μaι,</hi> to receive. That we
                    had it, along with almost the whole of our seaterms, from the northern
                    continental nations, is sufficiently obvious. Thus in Flemish it is <hi
                    rend="italic">doh</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> Teutonic, <hi rend="italic"
                    >doch</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> Swedish, <hi rend="italic">docha;</hi>
                    Suio-Gothic, <hi rend="italic">docha</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> perhaps
                    originally from <hi rend="italic">dehhen,</hi> to cover, protect, secure,
                    inclose. The <hi rend="italic">dock</hi> for inclosing the prisoner in a court
                    of justice is evidently from the same origin.</p>
                <p>Docks for the reception of ships are of two kinds, <hi rend="italic">wet</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">dry.</hi></p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">wet dock</hi> may either have gates to retain the water in
                    it, so that ships shall constantly remain afloat, or be left open for the tide
                    to flow into and ebb out of it at pleasure, either leaving it dry at low water,
                    or with a certain depth of water remaining in it, according to its construction
                    and situation with regard to the low-water mark, and to the ebbing of the sea at
                    spring or neap tides. A wet dock, without 'gates, is generally distinguished by
                    the name of a <hi rend="italic">basin,</hi> which, however, is sometimes
                    indiscriminately applied to a wet dock, whether with or without gates.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">dry</hi><hi rend="italic">doch</hi> either becomes dry by the
                    ebbing of the tide when the gates are left open, or by shutting the gates at low
                    water, and pumping out whatever water may remain in it at that time, by the
                    power of men, horses, wind, or, which is now most commonly performed in the
                    king’s dock-yards, by the steam-engine.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">wet</hi><hi rend="italic">doch,</hi> therefore, may be
                    defined to be “a basin of water, in which ships may be kept afloat at all times
                    of the tide a <hi rend="italic">dry</hi><hi rend="italic">doch,</hi> a
                    “receptacle in which every part of a ship can be examined, and its defects
                    repaired.” Ships may also be conveniently built in dry docks, and floated out by
                    opening the gates; though, in all dockyards, there are places set apart for this
                    purpose, under the name of <hi rend="italic">slips.</hi> A wet dock is called by
                    the French <hi rend="italic">un</hi><hi rend="italic">basin</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> a dry dock, <hi rend="italic">une</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The digging out the earth, and building the surrounding walls of masonry to
                    prevent the sides falling in, and the preparation of the mortar and puzzolana,
                    in the construction of a wet dock, are attended with great labour and expense.
                    The two wet docks or basins of Cherbourg (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Breakwater),</hi> which aτe probably the finest specimens that exist in the
                    world, are estimated to have cost three millions sterling. The labour of
                    excavation may sometimes be spared, and a series of wet docks or basins
                    conveniently made by turning the course of a tide-river through an isthmus, and
                    placing a pair of gates at each end of the old channel. In this way were the new
                    docks of Bristol constructed out of the bed of the Avon.</p>
                <p>Wet docks are an improvement in navigation and commerce of the utmost importance,
                    but of very modern date in this country; indeed, they owe their introduction
                    entirely to a spirit of individual enterprise in commercial speculation.
                    Liverpool might still have remained a poor fishing village but for its
                    convenient docks, which not only produce to the town and corporation a large
                    revenue, but ensure to the merchant every possible facility in refitting,
                    loading, and discharging his ships, whatever their burden or their cargo may be,
                    without being exposed to the risk of losing both ship and cargo in a rapid
                    tide-river; and, at all events, to an unavoidable delay, occasioned by distance,
                    the weather, or the state of the tides.</p>
                <p>Hull is also greatly indebted for the extension of its commerce to its docks. Its
                    old wet dock contains an area of ten acres nearly, and has accommodated at one
                    time 130 sail of such vessels as frequent that port.</p>
                <p>London, though unquestionably the first city in the world for its opulence, its
                    commerce, and public spirit, and possessing within itself the powerful internal
                    means of supporting docks, and all other conveniences that trade and shipping
                    may require on the most extensive plans; London has been the last to try the
                    experiment of docks, except in the case of two spirited individuals, Mr Perry at
                    Blackwall, and Mr Wells at Greenland Dock, both private ship-builders.
                    Notwithstanding the total inadequacy of legal quays, which subjected the
                    merchants to incalculable losses and delays, and in many cases proved absolutely
                    ruinous; notwithstanding the effect of the heavy, expensive, and fatal
                    embarrassments experienced regularly on the arrival of the West India fleets,
                    and the annual losses, by plunder in the river, on West India produce, which
                    alone were calculated to amount to L. 150,000 to the proprietor, and L.50,000 to
                    the revenue, and more than the double of those sums, including other branches of
                    commerce; it was not till the year 1799 that prejudices and private interests
                    were so far removed as to enable the merchants concerned in the West India trade
                    to obtain an act of parliament to carry into execution a plan of docks, quays,
                    and warehouses, for the convenience of that trade on the Isle of Dogs. Since
                    that time the London Docks, St Katharine Docks, and various others, have been
                    completed, to the incalculable benefit of the shipping interest and the commerce
                    of the metropolis.</p>
                <p>The docks of Liverpool were the first of the kind that were constructed in this
                    kingdom, by virtue of an act of parliament passed in 1708; and from that period
                    the town of Liverpool has rapidly raised itself from a poor fishing village, and
                    a port for coasting vessels, to be the second commercial town and port in the
                    empire; and the plan of improvements now carrying into execution for the
                    enlargement and better arrangement of the docks will, when completed, render it,
                    for convenience and appearance, in this respect the very first, not London even
                    excepted.</p>
                <p>It appears from a statement, apparently authentic, that in the ten years ending
                    with 1808, the number of ships which entered these docks was 48,497, tonnage
                    4,954,204; and the dock duties received L.329,566; and that, in the following
                    ten years ending in 1818, the number of ships was 60,200, the tonnage 6,375,560,
                    and the amount of duties L.666,438. It may also be observed, that this
                    extraordinary increase has taken place since the abolition of the slave trade,
                    which, it was asserted, would be the ruin of Liverpool.</p>
                <p>The docks of Hull have also been advantageous, though in a less degree, to the
                    wealth and prosperity of this trading town. The docks at Leith afford security
                    and convenience to the increased commerce of the capital of Scotland.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">West India Docks</hi> on the river Thames commenced in
                    February 1800, and were opened in August 1802. They consist of an outward and a
                    homeward-bound dock, and communicate by means of locks with a basin of five or.
                    six acres on the end next to Blackwall, and with another of more than two acres
                    at the end next to Limehouse, both of which basins communicate with the Thames.
                    The outward-bound dock is about 870 yards in length, by 135 in width, containing
                    consequently an area of more than twenty-four acres; the homeward-bound dock is
                    of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193324123" xml:id="kp-eb0708-4123-0076"/>same
                    length, and 166 yards in width, its area being little short of thirty acres; and
                    the two together will contain with ease at least 500 vessels of from 250 to 500
                    tons. The whole are surrounded with a high wall, and, as a security against
                    fire, the moment that a ship enters the dock the crews are discharged, and no
                    person whatever is allowed to remain on board, or within the premises, the gates
                    of which are closed at a certain hour. They are surrounded by immense
                    warehouses, which are estimated to contain nearly 10,000 hogsheads of sugar, and
                    an immense quantity of rum. The sum authorized by parliament to be raised for
                    completing these docks and warehouses was L.1,200,000, and the total expense was
                    probably not far short of one million and a half; yet on this capital the
                    subscribers have been receiving from a very short period after their opening ten
                    per cent., which, by the terms of the act, is not to be exceeded, and the term
                    granted is limited to twenty-one years; but, like most other property, these
                    docks have been greatly depreciated in value, and at present barely pay eight
                    per cent.</p>
                <p>The next set of docks that were undertaken for the advantage of the trade of the
                    capital was the <hi rend="italic">London Dochs.</hi> These docks are situated in
                    Wapping, and are appropriated for the reception of all ships arriving in the
                    port of London with wine, spirits, tobacco, and rice on board, but not
                    exclusively, ships having on board other cargoes being admitted, on the payment
                    of certain fees. The act of parliament for incorporating the dock company was
                    passed in 1800, authorizing them to raise a capital of L.1,200,000; but such was
                    the number of houses to be purchased (we believe not less than twelve hundred)
                    occupying the site of the dock, that this capital, by subsequent acts, was
                    extended to L.2,200,000, the dividends on which are limited, as in the West
                    India Docks, to ten per cent. The great dock is 420 yards in length, and 230
                    yards in width, covering an area of twenty acres. A basin of three acres nearly
                    connects it with the river. The warehouses are very magnificent; and the tobacco
                    warehouse is the grandest and most spacious building of its kind in the world,
                    being capable of containing five and twenty thousand hogsheads of tobaceo, and
                    the vaults underneath as many pipes of wine. This single building, under one
                    roof, is said to occupy upwards of four acres of ground. These docks were opened
                    in February 1805.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">East India Docks,</hi> for the exclusive reception and
                    accommodation of the East India ships, were the last in succession. The act for
                    the incorporation of the company was passed in July 1803, authorizing them to
                    raise a capital of L.200,000, which was afterwards increased to L.600,000, the
                    dividend, as in the ease of the two others, to be limited to ten per cent. These
                    docks are situated at Blackwall. That for the reception of homeward bound ships
                    is 470 yards in length by 187 in width, containing a surface of rather more than
                    eighteen acres; the outward-bound dock is 260 by 173 yards, and is consequently
                    something more than nine acres. An entrance basin of three acres nearly, and a
                    spacious lock, connect them with the Thames.</p>
                <p>A dry dock, requiring to be perfectly water-tight, demands the greatest care in
                    its construction. It is sometimes lined all round with wood, but more generally
                    with masonry, mostly of hewn granite. The expense is very considerable, as the
                    foundation, by means of piles or otherwise, must be well secured, all leakage
                    prevented, and the culvers or drains properly constructed, to let in and carry
                    off the water without its undermining the quays or piers. The cost of a complete
                    dry dock will vary probably from L.20,000 to L.100,000, according to the size of
                    the ships it is intended to admit, and the nature of the ground on which it is
                    to be constructed. A dry dock may be <hi rend="italic">single,</hi> or made to
                    contain only one ship; or <hi rend="italic">double,</hi> to contain two ships;
                    but the former is the most common, because most convenient.</p>
                <p>As it is of the utmost importance to preserve the water <hi rend="italic">in</hi>
                    a wet dock, and to keep it <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of a dry dock, it may be
                    proper to describe the different kinds of <hi rend="italic">gates</hi> which are
                    in use for this purpose.</p>
                <p>The most common, and on the whole, perhaps, the best and most convenient, are
                    swinging gates, which open in the middle, and he flat, one part against each
                    wharf or sidewall of the passage leading into the dock or basin. The elevation
                    of this kind of gate is represented in Plate CCIII. fig. 3. This kind of dock
                    gate requires to be made of great strength, with sound timber and good iron, and
                    the gudgeons on which the hinges turn to be well secured into the stone
                    abutments. Care also must be taken to make the bottom of the passage and the
                    bottom of the gates perfectly plane and parallel, to prevent leakage, and give
                    facility to their opening and shutting, which is usually assisted by rollers
                    fixed in a groove, and performed by means of a small capstern on each pier.
                    Attached to the top of the gates is usually a foot bridge with railing, which,
                    separating in the middle, opens and shuts with the gates.</p>
                <p>The most simple, but by no means the most effective contrivance for keeping out
                    the water, is the wicketgate, of which the plan and elevation are represented in
                    Plate CCIII. fig. 5 and 6. It consists of three parts, which, when opened, are
                    removed separately. This gate is rarely made use of unless where the abutments
                    are not sufficiently strong, or their foundation sufficiently secure, to bear
                    the weight of a pair of swinging gates.</p>
                <p>A third kind of gate consists of a floating dam or cais-soon, first introduced
                    into this country by General Bentham, and first applied to the great new basin
                    in Portsmouth dock-yard. They are built somewhat in the shape of a Greenland
                    fishing-boat, sharp at the two ends, narrow, and deep in proportion to the depth
                    of water at the entrance of the dock. The keel fits into a groove at the bottom
                    of the passage, and the two slanting ends rise and fall in corresponding grooves
                    cut into the two abutments. Of this kind of gate, fig. 1 and 2, Plate CCIII.
                    represent the plan and elevation. By letting in the water, the cais-soon sinks
                    in the grooves, and acts as a closed gate; and by pumping out the water, or
                    letting it out to a certain depth, the dam floats as the tide rises, and the
                    narrow part, rising to the top, is readily disengaged from the grooves, and
                    easily floated away as a boat. The advantages of these floating dams, as stated
                    by General Bentham, are, that they are cheaper of construction than the gates
                    heretofore in use for closing docks or basins; that they occupy less space, are
                    more easily repaired, and one and the same dam is capable of being used, as need
                    may require, in different places at different times. These caissoons have also
                    the advantage of serving as bridges of communication for loaded carriages across
                    the entrances they close, and they require much less labour than gates in
                    opening or shutting up passages into docks or basins, since their occasional
                    buoyancy may be obtained without pumping water or unloading ballast.</p>
                <p>Fig. 7 represents a plan, and fig. 4 a sectional elevation, of a dry or graving
                    dock, into which ships arc taken to have their defects examined and repaired,
                    coppered, &amp;c. and in which, if necessary, as already observed, ships may be
                    built.</p>
                <p>When a ship is brought into a dry or graving dock, she gradually subsides as the
                    water flows out, till her keel rests upon the line of square blocks which are
                    placed to receive it along the middle for the whole length; and on <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193324136" xml:id="kp-eb0708-4136-0077"/> these blocks she
                    is kept steady and upright by a number of shores or poles on each side, one of
                    their ends being placed on the <hi rend="italic">altars</hi> or steps of the
                    dock, the other under the ship’s bends and bottom. As a ship under repair
                    generally requires something to be done to the main or false keel, or at any
                    rate these parts require to be inspected, sometimes to shift the main keel, or
                    to add to the whole length of the false keel, it was always found necessary in
                    such cases to remove the blocks in order to get at the bottom of the ship; but
                    this operation could not be performed without the more serious one of first <hi
                    rend="italic">lifting</hi> bodily the ship clear of all the blocks, and
                    suspending her as it were in the air. This process was performed by driving
                    wedges simultaneously under the ends of all the shores that supported the ship;
                    an operation that required from four to five hundred men to enable them to
                    suspend a ship of the first rate. When the San Josef, a large three-decker,
                    required her bottom to be examined in 1800, the assistance of almost every
                    artificer in the dock-yard was found necessary to perform this process of
                    lifting her; nor was this the only inconvenience; the ship, thus suspended,
                    suffered very material injury by the pressure of her own enormous weight against
                    the ends of the shores that supported her, such as forcing in her sides,
                    straining the knees and all her fastenings, breaking the treenails, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>To remedy these glaring inconveniences and very serious injuries that ships thus
                    placed were apt to sustain, and to effect a saving of time and expense in the
                    operation, Mr (now Sir Robert) Seppings, then master shipwright, and afterwards
                    surveyor of the navy, contrived, sixteen or eighteen years ago, an improvement,
                    as ingenious as it is simple, by which twenty men will suspend the largest ship
                    in the navy, or rather, which amounts to the same thing, will disengage any one
                    block that may be required, in the space of two or three minutes, without the
                    necessity of suspending her at all; and, as a first rate in dock sits upon about
                    fifty blocks, these twenty men will clear her of the whole of these blocks in
                    about two hours; and as the saving of a day in completing the repairs of a ship
                    is frequently the saving of a whole spring tide, the docking and undocking of a
                    ship may make, and frequently has made, by this new method, the difference of a
                    fortnight in the time of equipping her for sea.</p>
                <p>The block of Mr Seppings, instead of being one solid piece, consists of three
                    wedges, or, more properly speaking, of one obtuse wedge and two inclined planes,
                    which, when put together and placed under the ship’s keel, appear as under, when
                    viewed in the direction or line of the κeel, where G is the wedge on which the
                    keel rests, having its obtuse angle equal to 170°, and HH are the two inclined
                    planes, each having an acute angle of 5°. The wedge is of hard wood, having its
                    two sides lined with iron; the two inclined planes are of cast iron. When one of
                    these blocks is to be disengaged from under a ship’s bottom, nothing more is
                    required than a few smart blows alternately on the two sides of the two inclined
                    planes, when they fly out, and the middle part or wedge drops; and the facility
                    of thus disengaging any of the blocks is in proportion to the quantity of
                    pressure upon that block. The strokes are usually given by a kind of catapulta
                    or battering-ram, being a thick spar or pole moving on a pair of wheels, as KK.
                    This simple contrivance to get at any part of a ship’s bottom by removing in
                    succession all the blocks, without the necessity of lifting the ship, which the
                    removal of any one block required to be done by the old method, is now
                    universally adopted in all the dock-yards; and the lords of the admiralty marked
                    their sense of the great utility of the improvement, by bestowing on Mr Seppings
                    a reward of L.1000 for the invention.</p>
                <p>Another very material improvement, recently introduced into his majesty’s
                    dock-yards, is that of covering the dry docks and building slips with roofs. The
                    rapid decay of our ships of war by that species of disease known by the name of
                    the <hi rend="italic">dry rot</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> attracted
                    very general attention; its effects were well known, but a variety of opinions
                    were entertained as to its causes and its cure. It was quite obvious, however,
                    that exclusion of air and moisture were the two great operating causes in giving
                    activity to the progress of the disease (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Dry Rot);</hi>
                    and that a ship in dock, stripped of her planking, and open to the weather in
                    every part, alternately exposed to frost, rain, wind, and sunshine, must at
                    least have her timbers differently affected, some swelled and water-soaked,
                    others shrunk with heat, and others rifted with the wind and frost; and, if
                    closed up with planking in this state, might be expected, at no great distance
                    of time, to exhibit symptoms of decay. The workmen, too, in the open docks or
                    slips, suffered from the vicissitudes of the weather no less than the ships, and
                    their labour was frequently suspended, to the great detriment of the naval
                    service. The measure of roofing over the docks and slips bad long and repeatedly
                    been suggested, but, either from prejudice or a false economy <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, it was only very recently carried into practice, but
                    is now almost universal in all the yards. These roofs are generally constructed
                    so as to be capable of having the sides and ends occasionally closed, according
                    to the quarter from which the wind may blow; and by this contrivance the timber
                    is prevented from rifting, as it is liable to do, by the action of a thorough
                    draught of wind, and the health of the artificer is prevented from injury. The
                    light is admitted through numerous windows placed in the roof. These roofs are
                    in general supported on a row of wooden pillars, and covered with slate, some
                    with plates of iron, and others with shingle. Plate CCIII. fig. 8, exhibits the
                    transverse section of a roof thrown over the head of the dock at Plymouth, in
                    which the Foudroyant is repairing; its span, from A to A, being 95 feet 4
                    inches, and the extreme width, from B to B, 125 feet 4 inches, supported, on the
                    principle of trussing, without a single beam. Another of the same kind was built
                    over the Prince Regent at Chatham, whose span was 100 feet, and the extreme
                    width 150 feet. These immense roofs were constructed after a plan of Mr
                    Seppings. The cost of one of the dimensions above mentioned was from L.6000 to
                    L.7000, which, great as it may appear, must be amply repaid by the superior
                    quality and durability of the ships built under it; but the same roof, with
                    little or no repair, will, in all probability, serve as a covering for eight or
                    ten different ships in succession. General Bentham, who, in his statement of <hi

                    >Navy,</hi> seems to claim to himself all the inventions and improvements which
                    have been introduced into the dockyards for the last twenty years, carries his
                    invention beyond a mere covering, and proposes to house over the docks and slips
                    so completely as to afford “means of heating, warming, ventilating, and
                    artificially lighting the interior at pleasure; the introduction of boilers or
                    steamkilns for bending the planks within the inclosure; the introduction of
                    machinery for assisting in various operations, particularly the more laborious
                    ones; the providing room for carrying on all the shipwright’s work within the
                    building; besides a variety of lesser works, such as it is found very
                    inconvenient during the building or repairing of a ship to have executed, for
                    example, in a smith’s or carpenter’s shop at a distance.” Such buildings would
                    not only be enormously expensive, but, in the present crowded state of the
                    dock-yards, utterly impracticable. With regard to the invention of covered docks
                    and slips, they have been used in Venice from time immemorial; and it appeared,
                    from the evidence given by Mr Strange, the consul at that port in the year 1792,
                    before the commissioners of land revenue, that two-and-twenty large ships had
                    been under covered slips, some of them for sixty years nearly. At Carlscrona,
                    also, there are several covered docks, and both Mr Nicholls and Mr Snodgrass
                    strongly recommended the building of ships under cover nearly thirty years
                    ago.</p>
                <p>Among other experiments which have recently been making in the dock-yards for
                    facilitating and expediting the repairs of ships, one may be mentioned, of which
                    many persons are sanguine enough to think that the successful result is likely
                    to be attended with most important benefits to the naval service. It is that of
                    hauling up ships of war, of any dimensions, on building slips, instead of taking
                    them into docks. It is no uncommon practice, at various ports of this kingdom,
                    where there are neither artificial basins nor natural harbours, to haul vessels
                    of the burden of fifty to two hundred tons, or probably larger, upon the beach,
                    by means of capstans, to give them repairs; in like manner, most of the large
                    fishing smacks are hauled up for security in tempestuous weather; but the
                    practicability of hauling up ships of war, especially of the larger classes, was
                    a matter of some doubt. Several frigates had, at various times, been hauled upon
                    slips, when the docks were all occupied; and the ease with which the operation
                    was performed induced the officers of the dockyard to propose the hauling up of
                    a line-of-battle ship. The Kent, of 74 guns, was selected for this purpose. It
                    was necessary, in the first place, to take her into a dock, to have proper
                    bilgeways prepared, and to be stripped, so as to be made as light as possible,
                    her weight being, according to a calculation made from the water she displaced
                    when afloat, about fourteen hundred tons. To heave up this weight fourteen
                    capstans were employed, and the number of men to work these were as under:</p>

                <p>The time occupied in hauling her up, after all the purchases were brought to
                    bear, was forty minutes. The expense of preparing her, and the loss and wear and
                    tear of the materials, was estimated at somewhere about L.2000.</p>
                <p>The advantages which slips are supposed to possess over dry docks are many and
                    important. They can be constructed at one twentieth part of the expense; they
                    occupy less space; they can be constructed on a steep or a shelving shore; and
                    ships can be hauled upon them either in spring or neap tides; whereas a dry dock
                    can only be made in particular situations, and, when made, ships can only be
                    docked and undocked in certain states of the tides; from which circumstance a
                    considerable delay and inconvenience are frequently experienced. It should be
                    recollected, however, that a large ship must necessarily go into a dock
                    preparatory to her being hauled up on a slip.</p>
                <p>It has been considered as not at all impossible, as was suggested some time ago
                    by Mr Perring, the ingenious clerk of the check in Plymouth dock-yard, that the
                    whole ordinary may hereafter be laid up on slips, which, if housed over, would
                    unquestionably be the best means of increasing their durability, and preserving
                    them from partial decay. Nor is it certain that in the end it would not be the
                    most economical mode of preserving them. The expense, as appears from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Estimates of the Ordinary of the Navy</hi> for the year 1817, is
                    L. 187,000 for harbour victuals, harbour moorings and riggings, &amp;c. besides
                    L. 135,000 for wages; the chief part of both which sums is on account of ships
                    of war laid up in ordinary, none of which would be required by placing them on
                    slips. It would indeed form a singular revolution in naval management, if ships
                    hereafter should be laid up in ordinary on dry land, whilst the timber of which
                    they are built is now considered to be the best preserved under salt water; a
                    process which, from some experiments recently made, promises fair to be the most
                    effectual prevention of, and a probable cure for, the dry rot. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Dry Rot).</hi> This method of preserving timber has long been
                    practised at Brest, Carthagena, and several other places on the Continent; and
                    the only objection to it in some of our ports appears to be the attack of the
                    worm known to naturalists by the name of <hi rend="italic">teredo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">navalis,</hi> whose bite is almost as destructive as the dry
                    rot.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, there are very many and serious objections, even were the
                    measure practicable, of hauling up ships of the line in particular, to be laid
                    in ordinary on slips. In the first place, the length of sea-beach which would be
                    required is greater than probably all the dock-yards in the kingdom could
                    furnish. Secondly, the three warrantofficers who are now employed in each ship,
                    and who are the best men in the service, being no longer necessary, would be
                    turned adrift, and, in all probability, utterly lost to the navy. Thirdly, no
                    large ship could be hauled on the slips without being previously taken into a
                    dock to have her bilgeways fitted, and her bottom prepared for placing her on
                    the slip. The time taken for this purpose must necessarily interfere with the
                    other works of the yard; and after taking her out, the preparations for heaving
                    her up, the capstans, blocks, purchase-falls, chains, and a variety of other
                    articles, amount to a very large expense, not less, with the expense of the roof
                    to cover the ship, than L.10,000 for each slip so hauled up.</p>

                <p>Previously to the reign of Henry VIII. the kings of England had neither naval
                    arsenals nor dock-yards, nor any regular establishment of civil or naval
                    officers to provide ships of war, or to fight them. They had admirals, however,
                    possessing a high jurisdiction and very great power. (See the article <hi

                    furnish, on any emergency. By this poem it also appears that Little Hampton,
                    unfit as it now is, was the port at which Henry built </p>

                    it easy to conceive how the building and repairing of the Great Harry, which in
                    the reign of Henry VII. was launched at Portsmouth, and cost L.15,000, was
                    managed, considering the very rapid strides made at once from the small Cinque
                    Port vessels, manned with twenty-one men and a boy, to this enormous floating
                    castle. At that time it is well known that they had no docks, nor even
                    substitutes for them.</p>
                <p>The foundation of a regular navy, by the establishment of dock-yards, and the
                    formation of a board, consisting of certain commissioners for the management of
                    its affairs, was first laid by Henry VIII., and the first dock-yard erected
                    under his reign was that of Woolwich. Those of Portsmouth, Deptford, Chatham,
                    and Sheerness, followed in succession; and the last, excepting the new and
                    unfinished yard of Pembroke, was Plymouth, which was founded by William III.</p>
                <p>From the first establishment of the king’s dock-yards to the present time, most
                    of them have gradually been enlarged and improved by a succession of expedients
                    and make-shifts, which answered the purposes of the moment; but the best of them
                    possess not those conveniences and advantages which might be obtained from a
                    dock-yard systematically laid out on a uniform and consistent plan, with its
                    wharfs, basins, docks, slips, magazines, and workshops, arranged according to
                    certain fixed principles, calculated to produce convenience, economy, and
                    dispatch.</p>
                <p>Neither at the time when our dock-yards were first established, nor at any
                    subsequent periods of their enlargement as the necessities of the service
                    demanded, could it have been foreseen what incalculable advantages would one day
                    be derived from the substitution of machinery for human labour; and without a
                    reference to this vast improvement in all mechanical operations, it could not be
                    expected that any provision would be made for its future introduction; on the
                    contrary, the docks and slips, the work-shops and store-houses, were
                    successively built at random, and placed wherever a vacant space would most
                    conveniently admit them, and in such a manner as in most cases to render the
                    subsequent introduction of machinery and iron railways, and those various
                    contrivances found in the large manufacturing establishments of private
                    individuals, quite impossible, even in the most commodious and roomy of his
                    majesty’s dock-yards.</p>
                <p>The want of a systematic arrangement in our dockyards, independently of
                    machinery, and the enormous expenditure of money laid out on expedients, were
                    questions of frequent discussion among naval men connected with the various
                    administrations of the navy, and it was thought by many that it would be more
                    desirable to construct an entire new dock-yard in some eligible situation, on an
                    extensive scale, than to continue the <hi rend="italic">improvements</hi> in the
                    old ones. For this purpose, so early as the year 1765, the attention of the
                    naval administration appears to have been turned to the Isle of Grain in the
                    river Medway, along the shore of which is a fine expansive sheet of deep water.
                    A dock-yard thus placed, on a systematic plan, would supersede that of Chatham
                    on one side and Sheerness on the other; but it was discovered on boring that the
                    substratum was so loose and sandy as not to admit of a solid foundation. General
                    Bentham, however, revived the project in the year 1800, which he seems to claim
                    as his own, and painted the situation in such glowing colours, and as affording
                    so many advantages for a grand naval arsenal, that the lords of the admiralty
                    were induced to order a fresh set of borings to be taken. These were carried to
                    the depth of sixty feet, and were everywhere found to consist of sand and mud,
                    and totally unfit for the construction of basins, docks, and such solid
                    buildings as are required for naval purposes.</p>
                <p>The imperfection of the naval yards to the eastward, the extension of the
                    boundaries of France towards that quarter, the occupation of the great naval
                    port of Antwerp, and the uninterrupted command of the Scheldt and the ports of
                    Holland by that power, rendered an enlargement of the means of naval equipment
                    in the eastern dockyards of England, or a new naval arsenal, indispensable. For
                    the latter purpose the banks of the Thames were considered, in every point of
                    view, as preferable to those of the Medway, the entrance into the latter being
                    narrow, and having a bar across it, on which, at low water of spring tides,
                    there is only fourteen or fifteen feet of water; whereas the navigation of the
                    Thames is at all times uninterrupted, excepting by the badness of the weather.
                    It communicates directly with the great market-town of London, in which every
                    description of stores, foreign and domestic, is accumulated; and the trade of
                    the Thames is the great source from which the fleet is supplied with seamen. The
                    marshy peninsula of Northfleet was considered by naval men, who had turned their
                    attention to the subject, to possess every possible requisite for the
                    establishment of a royal dock-yard on an extensive scale. It was sufficiently
                    removed from the mouth of the river to be completely sheltered, yet near enough
                    for ships to proceed to sea with one wind. In the river between Northfleet and
                    the sea there is plenty of water for the largest three-deckers to proceed with
                    all their guns, ammunition, stores, and provisions on board, and almost with any
                    wind, if moderate. A copious stream of good fresh water runs across the
                    peninsula. The soil afforded plenty of earth suitable for bricks; the foundation
                    was excellent for docks, slips, wharfs, and buildings of all kinds. It was
                    sufficiently near the metropolis for speedy communication with the naval
                    departments, and to receive stores in barges and the river craft. It was capable
                    of being defended both on the land and river side; and when the whole was raised
                    to the height of twelve feet with a dry gravelly soil, from the excavations of
                    the docks and basins, there could be no doubt of the healthiness of the
                    situation. By the direction, therefore, of the lords of the admiralty, a
                    complete survey was made by Messrs Rennie and Whidbey, who furnished a plan and
                    estimate of a naval arsenal on a magnificent scale, within which all kinds of
                    machinery were proposed to be employed for the making of anchors, sawing of
                    timber, rope-making, block-making, &amp;c.; iron railways to be laid from the
                    timber wharfs to the timber fields, from thence to the mills and pits, and from
                    them to the docks, slips, and workshops. The estimate, it appears, was about six
                    millions sterling, which Mr Rose, in his letter to the late Lord Melville,
                    calculates, with the fortifications and unforeseen expenses, to amount actually
                    to ten millions; an expense which the minister did not venture to propose,
                    though there can be little doubt that, when the case was fairly stated to the
                    public, and the necessity of increasing our naval establishments to the eastward
                    had been made apparent, no violent opposition would have been made to a measure
                    which tended to keep up our naval superiority, and which was the less
                    objectionable, as none of the money would have been taken out of the country,
                    but circulated within it, to the encouragement of the arts, trades, and
                    manufactures of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>The board of revision made a detailed report on the merits of the plan, which,
                    however, as the execution of it was delayed, was not printed; but the real
                    reason was supposed to be, the very gloomy view taken by the commissioners of
                    the disadvantages and imperfections of the present dock-yards, which Mr Rose
                    seems to think, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193324175" xml:id="kp-eb0708-4175-0080"
                    />and indeed it is generally thought, is by no means warranted, and that those
                    disadvantages in that report are greatly exaggerated, perhaps to enhance the
                    value of the Northfleet plan, of which they seem to have been much enamoured.
                    Imperfect as the old dock-yards are, chiefly from their having risen, as before
                    observed, to their present state, by a succession of expedients and make-shifts,
                    they are nevertheless far superior to any similar establishments on the
                    Continent of Europe, if we except the unfinished arsenal of Cherbourg, whose
                    magnificent basins (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Breakwater)</hi> are certainly
                    unequalled, and the space surrounding them capable of being turned to every
                    possible advantage. Μ. Charles Dupin, a French officer, who examined all our
                    dock-yards with a skilful eye, pronounces them as by far superior to any on the
                    Continent. We have heard much of the magnificent basins and the covered docks of
                    Carlscrona, but the one has been greatly overrated, and the others are merely
                    covered over with shed-like roofs; nor is there the least likelihood that the
                    plan will ever be finished. We have been told likewise of the superior
                    advantages of the naval arsenal of Copenhagen, where every ship has its
                    appropriate storehouse. This plan has been adopted at Brest, and is reprobated
                    there by every naval officer, and the officers of the yard, as most
                    inconvenient, and a great waste of room, by having the most bulky and the most
                    trifling articles stowed together in the same room. A better arrangement is that
                    of having certain magazines appropriated to certain kinds of stores, and
                    arranged according to the class or rate of ship for which they are intended,
                    and, if appropriated or returned stores, the name of the ship to which they
                    belong painted in front of the birth in which they are deposited. This is the
                    system generally followed in our dock-yards.</p>
                <p>The great point in which our naval arsenals are most defective is the want of wet
                    docks or basins; which, however, are to a certain extent compensated at the two
                    principal dock-yards of Portsmouth and Plymouth, by two magnificent harbours, in
                    which the whole navy of England, when dismantled, may be moored and laid up in
                    ordinary, in perfect security. The want of basins, however, in our dock-yards is
                    most severely felt in time of war, when the expeditious fitting out of the fleet
                    becomes so very desirable. One at Portsmouth on a small scale has been found of
                    incalculable advantage to that yard; and a larger one, now constructed at
                    Sheerness, will probably make that yard of sufficient capacity to supersede the
                    necessity of a new establishment at Northfleet, or in any other situation to the
                    eastward.</p>
                <p>The perfection of a dock-yard, then, independently of the advantages of
                    machinery, which are but contingent, may be considered to depend upon one or
                    more extensive basins, surrounded by spacious wharfs or quays. By means of these
                    a prodigious saving of time, labour, and expense may be saved, in every stage of
                    the progress of fitting out a ship for sea, from the moment she is launched from
                    the slip, or taken out of a dock, as well as in dismantling a ship on returning
                    to port to be paid off and repaired, or laid up in ordinary. For this purpose
                    the docks and slips should occupy one of the sides of the basin, with working
                    sheds for carpenters and joiners, smiths’ shops, saw-pits, and seasoning-sheds
                    between them. The ship, when completed on the slip and launched into the basin,
                    may then be taken immediately into the adjoining dock to be coppered. From this
                    she proceeds to the second side of the basin, in the corner of which is the
                    ballast-wharf; the remainder of the side will probably be occupied by the
                    victualling department, with appropriate stores in the rear for various kinds of
                    provisions, and behind these the bakery, brewery, and slaughter-houses; on the
                    wharf the iron tanks for holding water, now universally used for the ground
                    tier, in lieu of wooden casks. These are taken on board next after the ballast,
                    and, together with the superincumbent casks, would be filled in the ship’s hold
                    by means of flexible pipes to convey the water into them. The provisions would
                    at the same time be taken on board at the same wharf, in front of the
                    victualling stores. The third side might be appropriated to the ordnance
                    department, with the gun-wharf extending along the whole side, and the
                    gun-carriage storehouses, magazines, &amp;c. in the rear. The fourth side would
                    be occupied as the anchor wharf, with the cable storehouses, the sail lofts and
                    stores, rigging loft, and magazines for various stores, in the rear. Behind
                    these, again, on the first side, containing the dry docks and building slips,
                    the ground would be appropriated to the reception, birthing, and converting of
                    timber, from whence iron railways would lead to the saw-mills, saw-pits, and
                    work-shops, all of which would be placed on that side. On the second side a pond
                    or basin for the victualling lighters and craft, with wharfs communicating with
                    the manufactories and storehouses; the same on the ordnance or third side; and
                    on the fourth side might be placed the ropery, hemp storehouses, tar-houses,
                    with a basin for hemp-vessels, lighters, and the like. Communicating with the
                    great basin on the building side, and also with the river or harbour, on the
                    shore of which the dockyard is to be formed, should be a mast-pond, with a lock
                    for the storing of spars; in front the mast-houses, tophouses, capstan-houses,
                    and a slip to launch the masts into the pond. Here also might be placed the
                    boat-houses and boat-pond.</p>
                <p>A peninsular situation like that of Northfleet, having at least three fourths of
                    its shore surrounded with deep water, is peculiarly favourable for some such
                    arrangement as is here mentioned; as any number of locks and canals might be
                    made to communicate with the river, so that ships coming into the basin might
                    not interfere with those going out, nor the lighters and other craft bringing
                    their several species of stores, with either or with one another. By such an
                    arrangment a ship would be equipped for sea at half the present expense, and
                    within half the usual time. A ship fitting out for an anchorage distant from the
                    dock-yard, as at the Nore and Spithead, is liable to every inconvenience and
                    delay, as all her guns, stores, provisions, and water, must be carried to her in
                    dock-yard lighters and other craft, into which and out of which they must be
                    hoisted and rehoisted; liable to delay from bad weather and contrary winds; to
                    be stove alongside the ship, to the total loss or damaging of their cargoes:
                    added to which is the loss of time in going backwards and forwards, especially
                    to the artificers; the desertion of the men; the accidents from the upsetting of
                    boats; and many other evils of a magnitude not easily to be calculated, and
                    exceeded only by the disappointment and vexation that unavoidably occur when
                    ships are preparing for some particular and pressing service; all of which, when
                    ships are fitted out in a basin for sea, are avoided. Here no delay, no
                    embezzlement, no desertion, can take place. A ship in returning from sea may be
                    docked and undocked into the basin with all her stores on board; and if to be
                    paid off, instead of keeping the crew on board for weeks, till all the stores
                    have been delivered into the dock-yard, the ship, by the proposed plan of
                    basins, would remain securely in the basin, to be stripped at leisure by the
                    riggers and labourers of the yard, and the crew become immediately available for
                    other ships. Of the many superior advantages of wet docks for laying up ships to
                    discharge, over the practice of exposing them in rivers or harbours, the
                    shipping interest of the ports of London, Liverpool, Bristol, and Hull, can best
                    testify, more especially<pb break="no" facs="nls:193324188"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-4188-0081"/> that of London, which has taken the precaution to
                    surround the docks with high inclosing walls, by means of which all access is
                    debarred, and all possibility of embezzlement prevented.</p>
                <p>From a brief description of the royal dock-yards as they now stand, a general
                    idea may be formed of their several capacities, advantages, and defects. Taking
                    them in succession, according to their vicinity to the capital, the first is <hi
                    rend="italic">Deptford.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The front or wharf wall of
                    this dock-yard, facing the Thames, is about 1700 feet in length, and the mean
                    breadth of the yard 650 feet; the superficial content about thirty acres. It has
                    three slips for ships of the line on the face next the river, and two for
                    smaller vessels, which launch into a basin or wet dock, 260 by 220 feet. There
                    are also three dry docks; one of them a double dock, communicating with the
                    Thames, and the other a smaller one, opening into the basin. With these
                    restricted means, even with an adequate number of workmen, its capacity for
                    building ships, or for large repairs, must be very limited; but in the
                    occasional repair of fourth-rates and frigates, and in the fitting out of sloops
                    and smaller vessels, a great deal of work was performed at Deptford in the
                    course of the war. The proximity of Deptford dock-yard to the capital is,
                    however, of great importance, in the convenience it affords of receiving from
                    this great mart all the home manufactures and products which may be purchased by
                    contract for the use of the navy. It is, in fact, the general magazine of stores
                    and necessaries for the fleet, from whence they are shipped off, as occasion
                    requires, to the home yards, the out-ports, and the foreign stations, in
                    store-ships, transports, coasting sloops, lighters, and launches, according to
                    the distance to which they must be sent, to the amount, in time of war, of more
                    than 30,000 tons a year.</p>
                <p>The principal stores deposited in Deptford dock-yard are small cordage, canvass,
                    and ships’ sails, to an immense amount; beds, hair for beds, hammocks, slops,
                    and marine clothing; anchors under the weight of about seventy-five hundred,
                    which are generally made by contract, all above that size being manufactured in
                    the king’s dock-yards.</p>
                <p>The great magazines for the reception of these stores consist of a large
                    quadrangular building, with a square in the middle, of three stories in height,
                    with cellars underneath, in which are contained pitch, tar, rosin, and
                    turpentine. The length of each side of these storehouses is nearly the same,
                    differing from a square only by some eighteen feet: this length is about 210
                    feet, but they vary in width from forty-six to twenty-four feet.</p>
                <p>Parallel to the west front of this quadrangle is the rigging-house and sail-loft,
                    240 feet, and nearly fifty feet wide, in which all the rigging is fitted for
                    ships and stowed away, the sails cut out, made, and placed in proper births for
                    their reception, as well as for various other stores of a smaller kind.</p>
                <p>On the eastern extremity of the yard is a long range of building, called the
                    pavilion, in which the beds, hammocks, and slop-clothing are kept, and in which
                    also are the housecarpenters’, the joiners’, and wheelwrights' shops. This
                    building is about 580 feet long by twenty-six feet wide.</p>
                <p>The remaining buildings usually appropriated to the different services of a
                    dock-yard are all to be found at Deptford; a good blacksmith’s shop, a plumber,
                    glazier, painter-shops, seasoning-sheds, store-cabins, saw-pits, masthouse, and
                    pond, boat-houses, mould-loft, timber-births, besides good houses and gardens
                    for the principal officers, with several coach-houses and stables, so that the
                    whole space is completely filled up in every part.</p>
                <p>The number of men employed in this yard, in time of war, may have been about
                    fifteen hundred, of whom about one half were shipwrights and other artificers,
                    and the other half labourers. There were, besides, in constant employ, eighteen
                    or twenty teams of four each, of horses, to drag timber and heavy stores.
                    Deptford dock-yard has recently been put down.</p>
                <p>Adjoining to the dock-yard is the victualling-yard, the completest establishment
                    of the kind, perhaps, in this or any other kingdom, though still capable of much
                    improvement in the arrangement. Its frontage to the Thames is about 1060 feet,
                    and mean depth 1000 feet, containing about nineteen acres. This space is laid
                    out in a more convenient manner than any of the dock-yards, for answering all
                    the purposes which were intended. The general storehouses in front of the wharf
                    wall, the cooperage, the brewery, the butchery, and the bakery, are all separate
                    and complete in themselves. A mill has recently been erected, of such capacity
                    as to grind corn to be made into biscuit sufficient for supplying the whole
                    navy. Besides all the requisite offices for keeping the accounts, there are
                    houses and gardens for eight of the principal officers of the yard; and when the
                    old wharf wall shall have been repaired, and carried out a little farther into
                    the river, for which a sum of L.27,000 appears on the estimate of 1817, the
                    victualling-yard will be complete in all .respects, according to the present
                    arrangement. <hi rend="italic">ÇNavy Estimates for</hi> 1817.)</p>
                <p>The cooperage is spacious and well laid out. The staves are all sawed by hand,
                    and this operation employs about 100 sawyers in time of war. Mr Brown of Fulham
                    has . succeeded, it seems, in making casks by machinery, by which seventeen men
                    in nine hours are stated to be able to complete 300 casks, whereas, by the
                    ordinary method, the same number could only complete about eighty. The brewery
                    is well arranged, so is the bakery; and the butchery, consisting of a yard for
                    keeping the cattle, with pens for sheep and hogs, two spacious
                    slaughtering-houses, cutting and salting-houses, by the abundant supply of water
                    and constant washing, are kept in the cleanest order, and free from any
                    disagreeable smell.</p>
                <p>In the salting season 260 carcasses have been slaughtered in each of the two days
                    in the week appropriated to killing, and the hog hanging-house is capable of
                    containing 650 carcasses.</p>
                <p>The total number of coopers, sawyers, bakers, and labourers employed during war,
                    in the victualling-yard at Deptford, amounted probably to twelve or thirteen
                    hundred.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Woolwich DockYard.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This first and
                    most ancient of the dock-yards presents a frontage to the river of 3300 feet;
                    the breadth is very irregular, being from 250 to 750 feet; and it contains an
                    area of about thirty-six acres. It has five slips, which open into the river,
                    three of which are for ships of the line, one for frigates, and one for vessels
                    of a smaller class. It has three dry docks, one a double and one single dock,
                    all of them capable of receiving ships of the line. With all its imperfections,
                    Woolwich yard, with a complete establishment of artificers, has been of great
                    service both in the building and repairing of ships of all classes. Some of the
                    largest and finest ships in the navy have been launched from Woolwich yard,
                    among which may be mentioned the Nelson and the Ocean. ∙ In fact, it is chiefly
                    as a building yard that Woolwich ought to be considered as of much importance;
                    and even in this respect it has of late years much deteriorated, owing to the
                    increasing shallowness of the river, and the immense accumulation of mud, which
                    is found in a very few weeks completely to block up all the entrances into the
                    docks and slips, and along the whole length of the wharf wall. It is stated in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Eighth Report of the Select Committee on Finance</hi>
                    (1818), that “the wharf wall at Woolwich, owing to the action of the tide on the
                    foundation, is in a falling <pb break="no" facs="nls:193324201"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-4201-0082"/>state, and in danger of being swept into the
                    river, it being secured only in a temporary manner, and requires to be
                    immediately rebuilt in a direction that will preserve it from similar injury
                    hereafter, and prevent, in a great degree, that accumulation of mud which has,
                    in the course of the last ten years, occasioned an expense of upwards of
                    L.125,692, and would threaten in time to render the yard useless.”</p>
                <p>It was, in fact, found necessary to diminish the depth of the hold of the Nelson,
                    in consequence of the Trinity Board having stated that no vessel drawing above
                    nineteen feet of water could be navigated down to Erith Reach, and one even of
                    that draught not without difficulty and danger.</p>
                <p>The magazines or storehouses are not to be compared with those of Deptford. They
                    are more confined, and, owing to the narrowness of the yard, and the progressive
                    additions made according as necessity required, there is little or no methodical
                    arrangement. As far, however, as regards the building and repairing of ships,,
                    its conveniences may be reckoned superior to those of Deptford. The new
                    mast-houses and mast-slip, the new mast-ponds, and the houses for stowing yards,
                    topmasts, &amp;c. with the locks under them, are all excellent; and a new and
                    spacious basin completes these great conveniences. The timber-births are well
                    arranged, and the addition recently made to the western extremity of the yard
                    will allow the stacking of several thousand loads of timber, and of classing it
                    according to the purposes to which it may be applicable; and when the new
                    smithery, and the line of wharf wall shall be completed, the dock-yard of
                    Woolwich will become an important and valuable naval arsenal.</p>
                <p>A considerable quantity of cables and cordage are manufactured at Woolwich; but
                    the ropery is most inconveniently situated at a distance from the dock-yard, and
                    great part of the town intervenes between them. Its length is 180 fathoms, but
                    so narrow that the hemp storehouses, of three stories high, come close to the
                    spinning house on either side. These storehouses are capable of containing about
                    2000 tons of hemp, and the cellars underneath them about 6000 barrels of pitch
                    and tar. The hemp stores in the dock-yard are capable of containing about 2000
                    tons more.</p>
                <p>In the present state and situation of the ropery, it would scarcely admit of the
                    introduction of machinery, as has been done in most of the great private
                    manufactories. The process of tarring, or passing the yarns through heated tar,
                    and then drawing them through apertures in an iron plate, is performed at
                    Woolwich by four horses. The laying of a cable of twenty-two or twenty-three
                    inches is performed by the simultaneous exertion of 170 or ISO men, and requires
                    upwards of an hour of the most severe exertion of strength, especially on the
                    part of those who are stationed at the cranks, who not unusually break a
                    blood-vessel by the severity of the labour. The simple and beautiful machine
                    invented by the late Captain Huddart, performs with more accuracy the same
                    process, and with the attendance of only three persons. For the reasons here
                    stated, and the sufficiency of the other ropeyards, tliis at Woolwich has
                    recently been disposed of.</p>
                <p>Woolwich dock-yard seems to be complete in all the usual appendages of
                    artificers, work-shops, store-cabins, offices for the clerks, houses and gardens
                    for the commissioner and the principal officers of the establishment. The number
                    of men employed during the war amounted to about 1800, of whom nearly 1100 were
                    shipwrights and artificers, and the rest labourers. The number of spinners,
                    knitters, layers, labourers, &amp;c. in the ropery, might be about 260. Upwards
                    of twenty teams of horses were daily employed in this yard.</p>
                <p>One of the four divisions (the 4th, consisting of thirteen companies) of royal
                    marines are stationed at Woolwich, where barracks and all the necessary
                    buildings have been erected for their accommodation on shore. See the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Marines.</hi><hi rend="italic">Chatham DockYard.</hi> —This
                    dock-yard is situated on the right bank of the Medway, to which it presents a
                    line of river wall at least 5500 feet in length; the width at the upper end
                    being 400, in the middle 1000, and at the lower end about 800. The superficial
                    contents may be estimated at about ninety acres. It has six building-slips on
                    the front, from which ships are launched into the river; three of these arc for
                    ships of the line, and three for frigates and smaller vessels. In the same front
                    arc four dry docks communicating with the Medway.</p>
                <p>The inconveniences arising from want of arrangement are less felt in Chatham than
                    in any other of his majesty’s dock-yards; and it could not perhaps be materially
                    improved, if on the same site an entirely new dock-yard was to be planned. At
                    the southern extremity of the yard is the ropery, hemp and yarn houses, rigging
                    houses, a range of storehouses 1000 feet in length by about 50 in breadth, in
                    front of which, along the wharf, are the anchor-racks, extending nearly 1000
                    feet. Next to these are the slips and docks, with the working-sheds and
                    artificers’ shops close in the rear, an excellent smithery, timber-births,
                    seasoning-sheds, deal and iron yard, &amp;c.; and beyond these, on the eastern
                    extremity of the yard, the officers’ houses and gardens. The commissioner’s
                    house and excellent garden are situated nearly in the centre of the yard. The
                    lower or north-eastern part of the yard is occupied by mast-ponds, mast-houses
                    and slips, store boathouses and slips, ballast-wharf, timber-births, and
                    saw-pits.</p>
                <p>With all the advantages of interior arrangement, Chatham dock-yard still labours
                    under that great defect to which most of the dock-yards are liable, from the
                    injudicious manner in which the wharf walls have been constructed, without any
                    regard being paid to the ebbing and flowing of the tide, or the currents of
                    rivers, projecting in one part and retiring in others; the consequence of which
                    is, that eddies are formed, and a constant accumulation of mud takes place along
                    the line of the wall, and particularly in the openings of the dry docks, the
                    slips, and the jetties. Of late years, however, since the attention of engineers
                    has been called to this important subject, every opportunity is taken, in the
                    repair of the wharf walls of the dock-yards, to correct the injurious effects
                    arising from their improper direction; and as the river wall of Chatham is
                    rebuilding, there is no doubt that due attention will be had to the line in
                    which it is to be carried, so as to obviate the evil so universally complained
                    of.</p>
                <p>There is no wet dock or basin in Chatham-yard; but the Medway, flowing along it
                    in a fine sheet of water, in some degree answers the purpose of one. The whole
                    river might indeed be converted into a magnificent basin, by pursuing the same
                    plan as that adopted in forming the new docks at Bristol. This would be effected
                    by cutting a new channel for the river through the chalk cliff below Frindsbury
                    Church, opening out a little above Upnor Castle, and continuing the new channel
                    across the marsh near St Mary’s Crcek, so as to open out into Gillingham Reach
                    close to the fort. Here a basin might be constructed wherein ships might be
                    equipped in all respects ready for sea, whenever the wind and tide should be
                    favourable. At present, owing to the shallowness of the water and the crooked
                    navigation from Chatham round Upnor Point, they are obliged to take in their
                    water and ballast at one place, their stores and provisions at another, their
                    guns, powder, and ammunition at a third; in consequence of which, a ship is
                    usually longer in getting out to sea from <pb break="no" facs="nls:193324214"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-4214-0083"/>Chatham than even from Deptford. If this new
                    channel was made for the river, the whole space from the first reach below
                    Rochester Bridge to St Mary’s Creek, at the lower extremity of the dock-yard,
                    might be converted into one magnificent basin.</p>
                <p>Chatham being a building, a repairing, and refitting yard, the establishment of
                    men was much greater in war than at Woolwich or Deptford; the number of
                    shipwrights and other artificers, and labourers, being probably upwards of 2000,
                    besides those of the rope-yard, which might amount to about 250.</p>
                <p>A considerable piece of new ground (about 2000 feet in length by 200 in breadth)
                    has recently been added to the upper part of Chatham dock-yard, on which is
                    erected one of the complctest saw-mills in the united kingdom, under the
                    direction of Mr Bruncll. The mill is situated on high ground, and close to the
                    margin of a deep circular basin or reservoir of water, dug down to the level of
                    the Medway, with which it cornmunicates by a tunnel or subterranean canal,
                    passing through the mast-pond. From the side of the reservoir opposite to the
                    mill proceeds a long iron railway, supported on a double row of iron pillars;
                    and alongside of and parallel to this railway, on the side next to the
                    dock-yard, are a continued series of stages for the reception of timber after it
                    has been sawn into planks. A steam-engine of the power of thirty-six horses sets
                    in motion all the operations of this mill, which may thus be briefly enumerated:
                    l⅛7, It drags up the large balks of timber through the canal into the reservoir
                    as they are wanted. 2&lt;7, It lifts up these large logs to the margin of the
                    basin, carries them into the mill, and places them on the frame under the saws.
                    3d, It saws them with the greatest nicety into planks of any required thickness.
                    <hi rend="italic">⅛th,</hi> It takes the pieces away thus sawn, and places them
                    on carriages of iron, <hi rend="italic">òth,</hi> It drives these carriages
                    along the iron railway to any required distance. And <hi rend="italic"
                    >Q&gt;th,</hi> It deposits the sawn timber on the stages, ready to be used in
                    any part of the dock-yard where it may be required. From these stages it is
                    conveniently conveyed to the docks or slips by single horse carts or trucks,
                    with great expedition, down an easy descent, and without the least interference
                    with any of the works carrying on in the yard. The whole of these operations are
                    conducted by about ten, or at most twelve men.</p>
                <p>This mill is supposed to be equal to the power of fifty saw-pits and nearly one
                    hundred sawyers, and is capable of supplying the dock-yards of Chatham and
                    Sheerness with all the straight-sawn timber that they can require. But the great
                    advantage of the plan is in its application of the steam-engine to the
                    management and arrangement of timber, by which the labour and expense of a great
                    number of horses are saved, and, what is of still greater importance, the
                    obstruction and impediments to the general services of the yard are avoided,
                    which the dragging about of large balks to and from the saw-pits, with teams of
                    four horses each, occasions in all the other yards. It allows, besides, the
                    large space of ground which these saw-pits would occupy, to be appropriated to
                    other purposes.</p>
                <p>The first division of royal marines, consisting of twenty-one companies, is
                    stationed at Chatham, in excellent barracks, situated near to one of the
                    extremities of the dockyard. (See article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Marines.)</hi></p>
                <p>There is a small victualling depot, situated partly in the parish of Chatham and
                    partly in that of Rochester, from which the ships at Chatham and at Sheerness
                    and the Nore receive a supply of provisions and water; but no articles of ship’s
                    stores are manufactured. The storehouses are sufficiently capacious for
                    containing all the stores that can be required for the ships fitted out at the
                    two ports on the Medway. The establishment consists of an agent, clerk of the
                    check, storekeeper, and their respective clerks, which, with the messengers,
                    porters, labourers, &amp;c. may amount to about ninety persons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sheerness Pock-Yard.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This
                    dock-yard is situated on a low point of land on the island of Sheppey, whose
                    soil is composed of sand and mud brought from the sea on the one side and down
                    the Medway on the other, and has so much contracted the mouth of this river as
                    completely to command the entrance of it. The situation, in a military point of
                    view, is a most important one, particularly from its vicinity to the North Sea
                    and to the anchorage at the Nore; by which anchorage, and the works of
                    Shecrness, the mouths of the Thames and the Medway are completely defended.</p>
                <p>As a situation for a dock, the objections to which it was liable are now in a
                    fair way of being removed. On account of the low swampy ground on which it
                    stood, fevers and agues were at one time so prevalent, that shipwrights and
                    other artificers were literally impressed and compelled to work at Sheerness. In
                    process of time, however, a town sprung up close to the dock-yard, and with it
                    some little improvement by drainage, embankments, and other measures. Still it
                    continued, till a very short time ago, an unhealthy and disagreeable place. As a
                    dock-yard it was totally destitute of all convenience or arrangement; and the
                    whole premises, mixed among wharfs and buildings belonging to the ordnance
                    department, did not exceed fifteen acres of ground. The storehouses were
                    dispersed in various parts of this space, and in so ruinous a state, that a ship
                    hauled up in the mud was by far the best in the whole yard. It had two small
                    inconvenient docks for frigates or smaller vessels. It was in fact a mere point
                    of refitment, and might be considered as an appendage to Chatham.</p>
                <p>From the very limited capacity of Sheerness, and the mighty preparations in the
                    Scheldt, originated the magnificent project of the naval arsenal at Northfleet,
                    which, from a change of political circumstances, and from the important
                    improvements now carrying on at Sheerness, is not likely ever again to be
                    revived. The Finance Committee <hi rend="italic">(Eighth Export)</hi> say they
                    have learnt “that the re-establishment and extension of the yards at Sheerness
                    and Chatham may be considered as superseding, under any circumstance that can
                    now be likely to occur, the plan contemplated for a naval establishment at
                    Northfleet, on so extensive a scale as to require the expenditure of several
                    millions.”</p>
                <p>These improvements appear indeed to be of sufficient magnitude to render any
                    establishment at Northfleet wholly unnecessary, by making Sheerness, when
                    finished, as complete a dock-yard, and perhaps more so, than any other in his
                    majesty’s dominions. Previously to carrying into execution this important
                    undertaking, a committee of engineers and others was appointed, among whom were
                    Watt, Huddart, and Jessop, whose plan was afterwards minutely examined, and some
                    slight improvements suggested therein by Mr Rennie. The first stone was laid on
                    the 19th August 1814, and the whole was completed at an expense not far short of
                    one million sterling.</p>
                <p>The advantages arising from the adoption of this plan are, Lsτ, The addition of
                    nineteen acres of ground to the dock-yai ’ d, by taking in the whole of the
                    muddy western shore of the Medway, beyond the low-water mark of neap tides, and
                    getting rid of the offensive and unwholesome smell which it perpetually
                    occasioned. 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> The construction of a wet dock or basin
                    520 feet in length by 300 in width, equal in surface to three and one half

                    present is below the level of the sea, and the water kept out, as in Holland, by
                    embankments, but which will be raised several feet by the excavation of the
                    basin, the dry docks, and the mast-ponds, so as to allow of drains to carry off’
                    the water to the shore, affording space for timber-births, houses and gardens
                    for all the officers of the dock-yard, as well as for the admiral commanding in
                    chief at Sheerness and the Nore. These additions, together with some part of the
                    premises held by the board of ordnance, will make the whole area of the new
                    dock-yard of Sheerness amount to upwards of fifty acres. The wharf wall on the
                    south side of the basin in front of the intended masthouses is a hundred feet,
                    and that on .the riverfront sixty feet in width, lined on both sides with as

                    confined to the repairing of small vessels in the yard, but mostly to repairs of

                    >Yard.—</hi> Portsmouth dock-yard will always be considered as the grand naval
                    arsenal of England, and the head-quarters or general rendezvous of the British
                    fleet. The dock-yard accordingly is by far the most capacious; and the safe and
                    extensive harbour, the noble anchorage at Spithead, the central situation with
                    respect to the English Channel and the opposite coast of France, and
                    particularly with regard to the naval arsenal at Cherbourg, render Portsmouth of
                    the very first importance as a naval station; and in this view of it, every
                    possible attention appears to have been paid to the extension and improvement of
                    its dock-yard. The sea wharf-wall of this yard, extending in the direction of
                    north and south along the western shore of the harbour, is about 3500 feet in
                    length, and the mean depth may be 2000 feet; and it incloses an area of more
                    than one hundred acres.</p>
                <p>In the centre of the wharf-wall, facing the harbour, is the entrance into the
                    great basin, whose dimensions are 380 by 260 feet, and its area 2ģ acres. Into
                    this basin open four excellent dry docks, and on each of its sides is a dry dock
                    opening into the harbour; and all of these six docks are capable of receiving
                    ships of the largest class. Besides these is a double dock for frigates, the
                    stern dock communicating through a lock with the harbour, and the head dock with
                    another basin about 250 feet square. There is also a camber, with a wharf-wall
                    on each side, 660 feet in length, and of sufficient width to admit of transports
                    and merchant ships bringing stores to the dock-yard. In the same face of the
                    yard are three building slips capable of receiving the largest ships, and a
                    small one for sloops, besides two building slips for frigates on the northern
                    face of the yard, and a smaller slip for sloops. The range of storehouses on the
                    north-east side, and the rigging-house and sail-loft on the south-west side of
                    the camber, are magnificent buildings, the former occupying nearly 600 feet in
                    length, exclusive of the two intermediate spaces, and nearly sixty feet in
                    width, and the two latter 400 feet. The two hemp-houses and the two sea-store
                    houses occupy a line of building which, with the three narrow openings between
                    them of twenty-five feet each, extend 800 feet. The rope-house, tarring-house,
                    and other appendages of the ropery, are on the same scale. The two sets of
                    quadrangular storehouses, and the two corresponding buildings, with the
                    intervening timber-births and saw-pits, at the head of the dry docks, issuing
                    from the great basin, are all excellent, and conveniently placed. The smithery
                    is on a large scale, and contiguous to it is an iron-mill, a copper-mill, and a
                    copper refinery, at which is remelted and rolled all the old copper which is
                    taken from ships’ bottoms; and here, also, are cast bolts, gudgeons, and various
                    articles of copper used in the navy. The number of sheets manufactured in one
                    year of the war amounted to about 300,000, weighing above 12,000 tons; on which
                    it has been calculated that a saving of at least L.20,000 was effected for the
                    public, besides obtaining a good pure article. Most of these were constructed
                    under the direction of General Bentham. . (Bentham’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Services.}</hi> At the head of the north dock are the wood mills, at which

                    navy, from boring the chamber of a pump to the turning of a button for a chest
                    of drawers. But the principal part of these mills is the machinery for making
                    blocks, contrived by that ingenious artist Mr Brunell (see <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    respect for the talents and skill of the author.</p>
                <p>The northern extremity of the dock-yard is chiefly occupied with seasoning-sheds,
                    saw-pits, and timber-births, the working boat-house, and boat-storehouse. On the
                    eastern extremity are situated the houses and gardens of the commissioner and
                    principal officers of the yard; the chapel, the royal naval college, and the
                    school of naval architecture. The former institution has recently been
                    remodelled, and the latter is a new establishment Formed by the recommendation
                    of the commissioners for revising the civil affairs of the navy, for the
                    education of a certain number of naval architects, known by the name of the
                    “Superior Class of Shipwright Apprentices.” These two establishments were
                    combined by order in council of the 30th January 1816, under the following

                    teaching drawing, dancing, fencing, and the French language, and two serjeants
                    of marine artillery. In addition to these, there is a superintendent of the
                    school for naval architecture, a professional ship-builder, brought up in one of
                    his majesty’s dock-yards, to instruct the apprentices in the practical parts of
                    ship-building. The school for naval architecture has recently been
                    abolished.</p>

                    required to pass their examination in the theory of navigation, at the naval
                    college, by the professor, in presence of the admiral commanding in chief, and

                <p>The strength of Portsmouth dock-yard, during the war, was considerably above 4000
                    working men, of whom about 1500 were shipwrights and caulkers; the joiners and
                    housecarpen ters were nearly 500; the smiths 200 nearly; the sawyers 250; the
                    riggers and their labourers nearly 200; the scavelmen and labourers of various
                    kinds nearly 700; and the rope-yard employed about 350 persons.</p>
                <p>There are two victualling establishments at this port; the one in Portsmouth
                    town, the other across the harbour, at a place called Weevil; both of them
                    inconveniently situated for supplying the ships with water and provisions, more
                    especially such as may have to take them in at Spithead. The former consists
                    chiefly of provision-stores and magazines, with a tide-mill and a bakery; at the
                    latter there is a cooperage and a brewery. The total number of persons employed,
                    including the officers, at the two establishments, during the war, amounted to
                    about 500. The victualling establishments are now consolidated at Weevil.</p>
                <p>The noble building for the reception of sick and wounded seamen is situated on
                    the Gosport side of Portsmouth harbour. Being appropriated to the military
                    branch of the navy, it will be described under the head of <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>The second division of royal marines, consisting of eighteen companies, is
                    stationed at Portsmouth, in barracks, which are inconveniently situated in the
                    town; and eight companies of the royal marine artillery have their head-quarters
                    at Fort Monckton, not far from Haslar Hospital. (See the article <hi

                    rend="italic">—</hi> The naval station of Plymouth is inferior only to that of
                    Portsmouth; and, in point of its more westerly situation, as considered with
                    reference to the grand naval arsenal of Brest, it is superior even to
                    Portsmouth. It possesses one of the finest harbours in the world, capable of
                    containing, in perfect security at their moorings, not less than a hundred sail
                    of the line; and by means of the breakwater it may boast of an excellent
                    roadstead for eighteen or twenty sail of the line. The dock-yard, however, has
                    only one small basin, without gates, whose dimensions are 250 by 180 feet, and
                    contents little more than an acre; but the excellent harbour of Hamoaze, on the
                    western bank of which the wharf-wall extends, almost compensates for the want of
                    one, especially as the depth of water allows the largest ships to range along
                    the jetties, and receive their stores on board immediately from the wharf.</p>
                <p>Plymouth dock-yard extends in a circular sweep along the shores of Hamoaze 3500
                    feet, its width about the middle, where it is greatest, being 1600, and at each
                    extremity 1000 feet, making its superficial contents about ninety-six acres. In
                    the line facing the harbour are two drydocks for ships of the first rate, a
                    double dock for seventy-four gun ships, communicating with Hamoaze, and another
                    dock for ships of the line, opening into the basin. There is, besides, a
                    graving-dock without gates, and a canal or camber similar to that in Portsmouth
                    yard, for the admission of vessels bringing stores into the yard; which,
                    communicating with the boat-pond, cuts the dock-yard nearly into two parts.
                    There are five jetties projecting from the entrances of the dry-docks into
                    Hamoaze, along side of which ships are conveniently brought when undocked. All
                    these are situated between the centre and the northern extremity of the harbour
                    line. On the southern part are three building slips for the largest class of
                    ships, and two for smaller vessels; the outer mast-pond and masthouses,
                    timber-births, saw-pits, and smithery. Higher up, on this end of the yard, is an
                    extensive mast-pond and mast-locks, with plank-houses over them; and, above
                    these, three hemp magazines, contiguous to which is the finest ropery in the
                    kingdom, consisting of two ranges of buildings, one the laying-house, the other
                    the spinninghouse, each being 1200 feet in length, and three stories in height.
                    In the construction of the new rope-house no wood has been used excepting the
                    shingles of the roof, to which the slates are fastened. All the rest is of iron.
                    The ribs and girders of the floors are of cast iron, covered over with Yorkshire
                    paving stone, and the doors, window frames, and staircases, arc all of cast
                    iron, so that the whole building may be considered as proof against fire.</p>
                <p>The northern half of the yard, besides the docks and basin, with all the
                    appropriate working sheds and artificers’ shops, contains a cluster of very
                    elegant stone buildings, ranged round a quadrangle, the longest sides being
                    about 450 feet, and the shortest 300 feet. Within the quadrangle are also two
                    new ranges of buildings, in which iron has been used in the place of wood. These
                    buildings consist, of magazines for different kinds of stores, rigging-houses,
                    and sail-lofts. The northern and upper part of the yard is occupied by a range
                    of handsome houses, with good gardens behind them, for the commissioner and the
                    principal officers of the yard, the chapel, the guard-house, and payoffice,
                    stables for the officers, and the teams, and a fine reservoir of fresh water for
                    the supply of the yard.</p>
                <p>Plymouth is not only a good building and repairing yard, on account of its
                    excellent docks and slips, and the great length of line along the Hamoaze, but
                    also a good refitting yard, and was fully occupied during the war with the
                    refitment of the western squadron, employed in the constant blockade of Brest.
                    The number of men borne on the establishment of this yard might have been about
                    3000, of∖vhich about 800 were shipwrights.</p>

                    unconnected, and, in fact, dispersed in three different places; the cooperage
                    and the brewery being at South Down, near Millbrook, on the farther side of

                    the victualling establishments have been consolidated at Cremill, which consists
                    of every possible convenience for victualling and watering the navy.</p>

                <p>The third division of royal marines, consisting of twenty companies, are

                    This dock-yard has been established but a few years, and is intended merely as a
                    building-yard. It is situated on the southern shore of Milford Haven, not two
                    miles from the town of Pembroke. It includes an area of about sixty acres, its
                    surface descending in a gradual slope to the water’s edge, along the shore of
                    which is ample space for a couple of dry docks, and at least twelve building
                    slips, over which it is intended to erect a connected series of roofs, which
                    will not only be attended with much convenience to the workmen, but also with a
                    great saving of expense. The slips, being built of wood, on a limestone
                    foundation, are erected at a very trifling cost; and the only works of any
                    considerable expense in the yard will be those of the dry docks, each of which
                    will amount to the sum of L.60,000 nearly. For a new building yard a small
                    storehouse will be quite sufficient, and an old ship hauled up serves all the
                    purposes of one at present. There is no commissioner, nor is the usual
                    establishment of officers completed. The total number of persons of all
                    descriptions employed in the yard is under 500.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ordinary of the Dock-Yards.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> At
                    each of the ports where there is a dock-yard, Pembroke excepted, a certain
                    number of ships when put out of commission, or new ships not commissioned, are
                    laid up in what is called a state of ordinary; and such ships, until recently,
                    used to be placed under the immediate charge of the commissioner, the masters
                    attendant, and other officers of the dock-yard. But a new system has lately been
                    adopted, both with regard to the fitting of the ships for their better
                    preservation, while thus unemployed (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Dry Rot),</hi> and
                    also as to the care and management of them by naval commissioned officers living
                    constantly on board. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Navy.)</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Capacity of a Dock-Yard.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The capacity of a
                    dockyard for building, repairing, and refitting ships of war, depends upon so
                    many circumstances that it scarcely admits of calculation; chiefly, however, on
                    the facilities afforded by a suitable arrangement of dry docks, building slips,
                    and basins, and on the number of shipwrights and other artificers borne on the
                    strength of the yard. In building new ships, where the materials are at hand,
                    and no interruptions occur, the capacity may be ascertained to a tolerable
                    degree of accuracy. To complete the building of a seventy-four gun ship, it is
                    calculated that the labour of one man would be required for 18,000 days, or of
                    eighteen men for 1000 days, or about fifty-four men to finish her in the space
                    of one year. A dock-yard, therefore, with 500 good shipwrights, might be
                    expected to launch from eight to ten sail of the line every year, if the
                    conveniences of the yard admitted them all to be employed on building. But with
                    regard to repairs, they are so various and so uncertain, that it would be next
                    to impossible to form any calculation that should at all approach to the truth.
                    A writer well versed in naval matters, in attempting to prove the sufficiency of
                    our dock-yards, without having recourse to private merchant yards during war,
                    has stated, that by a uniform system of management, “the annual regeneration of
                    ships of the line maybe safely reckoned at <hi rend="italic">twelve sail,</hi>
                    and that of frigates at <hi rend="italic">eight sail</hi> and that, besides,

                <p>When Henry VIII. first established a regular king’s doek-yard at Woolwich, he
                    appointed a board, consisting of certain commissioners, for the management of
                    all naval matters; and it is curious enough, as appears from the <hi

                    Cambridge, that the regulations which he made for the civil government of the
                    navy, and which were, in the reign of Edward VI., revised, arranged, and turned
                    into ordinances, form the broad basis of all the subsequent instructions given
                    to the several officers to whom the management of the civil affairs of the navy
                    has been committed. <hi rend="italic">(First Pep. Nav. Reν.</hi><hi rend="italic

                <p>The commissioners of the navy then consisted of the vice-admiral of England, the
                    master of the ordnance, the surveyor of the marine causes, the treasurer,
                    comptroller, general surveyor of the victualling, clerk of the ships, and clerk
                    of the stores. They had each their particular duties; and once a week they were
                    ordered to meet at their office on Tower Hill, and once a month to report their
                    proceedings to the lord high admiral.</p>
                <p>In 1609 the principal officers for conducting the civil affairs of the navy were
                    suspended in consequence of many abuses being complained of; and other
                    commissioners were appointed, with powers to manage, settle, and put the affairs
                    of the navy into a proper train, and to prevent, by such measures as might
                    appear to be necessary, the continuance of the many great frauds and abuses
                    which had prevailed. A similar commission was renewed in 1618, which in a full
                    and minute report detailed and explained those frauds and abuses.</p>
                <p>That commission, which ended on the death of James I., was renewed by his
                    successor, and remained in force till 1628, when it was dissolved, and the
                    management of the navy was restored to the board of principal officers, as
                    established by Edward VI.</p>
                <p>In the disturbed reign of Charles I. the navy was suffered to go to decay; but by
                    the extraordinary exertions of Cromwell, it was raised to a height which it had
                    never before reached, but again declined under the short and feeble
                    administration of his son.</p>
                <p>On the restoration of Charles II. the Duke of York was appointed lord high
                    admiral; and by his advice a committee was appointed to consider a plan he had
                    drawn out for the future regulation of the affairs of the navy, at which he
                    himself presided. “In all naval affairs,” say the commissioners of revision, “he
                    appears to have acted with the advice and assistance of Mr Samuel Pepys, who
                    first held the office of clerk of the acts, and was afterwards secretary of the
                    admiralty; a man of extraordinary knowledge in all that related to the business
                    of that department, of great talents, and the most indefatigable industry.”</p>
                <p>The entire management of the navy was now in the hands of the duke, as lord high
                    admiral, by whom three new commissioners were appointed to act conjunctly with
                    the treasurer of the navy, the comptroller, the surveyor, and clerk of the acts,
                    as principal officers and commissioners of the navy. A book of instructions,
                    drawn out by Mr Pepys, was sent to the navy board for its guidance. A rapid
                    progress was made in the repair and augmentation of the fleet; but being called
                    away, in consequence of the Dutch war in 1664, the example of zeal and industry
                    set by Mr Pepys was not sufficient, in the duke’s absence, to prevent <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193324266" xml:id="kp-eb0708-4266-0087"/> neglect and
                    mismanagement in every department except his own.</p>
                <p>From 1673 to 1679, the office of lord high admiral being put in commission, at
                    the head of which Prince Rupert was placed, the king, through Mr Pepys, arranged
                    all naval affairs; but in the latter year, when the duke was sent abroad, and Mr
                    Pepys to the Tower, a new set of men were made commissioners of the navy; who,
                    without experience, ability, or industry, suffered the navy to go to decay. “All
                    the wise regulations,” say the commissioners of revision, “formed during the
                    administration of the Duke of York, were neglected; and such supineness and
                    waste appear to have prevailed as, at the end of not more than five years, when
                    he was recalled to the office of lord high admiral, only twenty-two ships, none
                    larger than a fourth rate, with two fire-ships, were at sea; those in the
                    harbour were quite unfit for service; even the thirty new ships which he had
                    left building had been suffered to fall into a state of great decay, and hardly
                    any stores were found to remain in the dock-yards.” He re-appointed Mr Pepys as
                    secretary of the admiralty; he set about an inquiry into the characters and
                    abilities of the first ship-builders in England; and by the advice of Mr Pepys,
                    he joined Sir Anthony Dean, eminent in that profession, with three others, to
                    the former principal officers in a new commission. The old commissioners were
                    directed entirely to confine their attention to the business of a committee of
                    accounts. To each of the new ones was entrusted a distinct branch of the
                    proposed reform; and it appears that, highly to their credit, “they performed
                    what they had undertaken in less time than was allowed for it, and at less
                    expense ;” having completed their business to the general satisfaction of the
                    public two months before the Revolution.</p>
                <p>The business of the navy, thus methodized and settled, remained undisturbed by
                    that event. The commissioners of revision justly observed, that “the great work
                    of reestablishing the fleet, and restoring order, industry, and discipline, in
                    the dock-yards, accomplished in so short a time by the commissioners then
                    chosen, with so much carc, proves, in the most convincing manner, how much
                    depends on having the civil affairs of the navy placed under the management of
                    men of real ability, professional knowledge, and uninterrupted industry.”</p>
                <p>It will readily be supposed that the vast increase of our naval force since that
                    time has necessarily required many additional orders and regulations, some of
                    which, from circumstances, were not compatible with each other; some were given
                    to one dock-yard and not to another; others in one yard became obsolete, while
                    they continued to be acted upon in another; so that there was no longer that
                    uniformity in the management which it is so desirable, indeed so essentially
                    necessary, to preserve. From the year 1764 to 1804, when his majesty appointed a
                    commission “for revising and digesting the civil affairs of his navy,” the
                    attention of the lords of the admiralty and the navy board had frequently been
                    directed to this important subject; but owing to various causes nothing was done
                    to forward so desirable an arrangement, except that Sir Charles Middleton
                    (afterwards Lord Barham), when comptroller of the navy, classed and digested
                    under distinct heads, in a book for that purpose, all orders and regulations
                    prior to the year 1786. The commissioncrs of naval inquiry, appointed in 1803,
                    state the necessity of revising the instructions, and digesting the immense mass
                    of orders issued to the dock-yard officers, and regret that a work of such
                    utility should not have been completed. The late Lord Melville, to whom the navy
                    is perhaps more indebted than to any single individual, and who, from the active
                    part he had long taken in its concerns, was well aware of the irregularities and
                    disorder which prevailed in the dock-yards, on his appointment to the
                    administration of naval affairs, determined to carry into execution a complete
                    system of reform and of uniform management in all the several departments. The
                    commission consisted of Admiral Lord Barham, John Fordyce, Esq. Admiral Sir
                    Roger Curtis, Bart. Vice Admiral Domett, and Ambrose Serle, Esq. They made
                    fifteen distinct reports, the date of the first being 13th June 1805, of the
                    last the 6th March 1808; all of which, except two, have been printed, by order
                    of the House of Commons, and mostly carried into effect by his majesty’s orders
                    in council. One of the two not printed is an inquiry into the state of the navy
                    at different periods, and of naval timber; the other relates to the formation of
                    a new dock-yard at Northfleet, which, however advisable and even necessary the
                    design of it might have been considered at the time when Bonaparte was
                    energetically carrying on his mighty plans for the creation of a naval force to
                    contest the power of the ocean with Great Britain, will, as has already been
                    observed, no longer be thought so under present circumstances.</p>
                <p>From these reports have been established, for the first time, in all his
                    majesty’s dock-yards, one uniform system <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> of
                    management, by which it was hoped incalculable advantages would have been
                    derived to the public, in the preventing of frauds, in the saving of labour and
                    materials, and consequently time and expense, and in securing better workmanship
                    in the construction of ships, which is perhaps of all other considerations the
                    most important; but the system was cumbrous and very expensive.</p>
                <p>The management of the dock-yards, and of all the civil affairs of the navy, was,
                    until recently, entrusted to cer- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> tain
                    commissioners appointed by patent, of whom the comptroller of the navy and three
                    surveyors, and seven other commissioners, formed a board at Somerset House, for
                    the general direction and superintendence of the civil concerns of the navy,
                    subject to the control of the lords commissioners of the admiralty. At most of
                    the home yards and of the foreign yards was a commissioner of the navy, who was
                    always a naval officer of the rank of captain. The foreign yards over which a
                    commissioner presided were, Bermuda, Cape of Good Hope, Gibraltar, Halifax,
                    Jamaica, Malta, Quebec, Kingston, including the lake establishments and
                    Trincomalee, which, with the five belonging to the home yards, Woolwich
                    (including Deptford), Chatham, Sheerness, Portsmouth, and Plymouth, made the
                    whole number of commissioners of the navy amount to twenty-four. The salary of
                    each of the home commissioners was L.1000 a year, that of the comptroller
                    L.2000. The salary of the foreign commissioners L.1200 a year, except that of
                    the Cape of Good Hope, which was L.1800, and Trincomalee L.3000 a year. They
                    were also entitled to liberal superannuations when unfit for further service;
                    and, at their death, their widows received a pension for life of L.300 a year.
                    All these have been swept away, and the two great departments, the navy and the
                    victualling offices, have been consolidated with the admiralty, and the details
                    of the business placed under five principal officers, each having a separate
                    department. These are, 1. the surveyor of the navy; 2. the accountant general;
                    3. the storekeeper general; 4. the comptroller of the victualling and
                    transports; 5. the physician.</p>
                <p>The treasurer of the navy is a high and responsible officer appointed by the
                    crown, and removeable at pleasure. His salary was L.4000 a year, but it has
                    recently been reduced to L.3000. The establishment of the navy pay-office at
                    Somerset House consists of a paymaster and deputy; three cashiers, one for the
                    navy, one for the victualling, and one for the allotment branch; an accountant;
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193324279" xml:id="kp-eb0708-4279-0088"/> inspector; a
                    superintendent of the payments of the dockyards, resident in London; sixty
                    established and eighteen extra clerks, besides six pay clerks and three
                    conductors of money at the four pay ports, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Chatham, and
                    Sheerness.</p>
                <p>To each of the four dock-yards, Deptford, Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Chatham, are
                    victualling establishments for supplying the fleet with provisions and water;
                    and also at Dover, Cork, Cape of Good Hope, Gibraltar, and Malta. The
                    victualling board at Somerset House consisted of a chairman and deputy chairman,
                    the former with a salary of L.1200, the latter of L.1000 a year, and five other
                    commissioners with salaries of L.800 a year each; a secretary to the board, and
                    a secretary to the committee of accounts; a registrar of securities, and 136
                    clerks, with salaries varying from L.800 to L.80 a year, according to their
                    class and length of service. These have all been abolished, and, as before
                    stated, consolidated with the admiralty.</p>
                <p>The transport board having been dissolved at the end of the war, its twofold
                    duties were divided between the navy and victualling boards; those which
                    concerned the hiring of transports devolved on the commissioners of the navy,
                    and those which related to the sick and hurt department on the commissioners of
                    the victualling board, on whom also devolves the direction and superintendence
                    of all the naval hospitals at home and abroad. These have also merged in the
                    admiralty.</p>
                <p>The principal officers of an established dock-yard were, 1. the commissioner; 2.
                    the master attendant; 3. the master shipwright; 4. the clerk of the check; 5.
                    the storekeeper; 6. the clerk of the survey; to which have recently been added
                    the subordinate officers of timbermaster and the master measurer. By the new
                    regulations, the commissioner has been superseded by a superintendent, the clerk
                    of the check and clerk of the survey abolished, as well as the master measurer,
                    and a store receiver substituted for the timber-master. Many subordinate
                    officers have also been abolished, and the whole system of working the men,
                    keeping the accounts, &amp;c. simplified and amended; and some idea may be
                    collected of the diminution of the expense by the simple fact, that, in the
                    ordinary estimate of the navy for 1817 the establishment of officers in
                    Portsmouth yard was L.50,065, whereas in 1833 it is only L.19,803.</p>
                <p>Hitherto the men were usually employed by what was called task and job; but they
                    are now wholly put upon day pay.</p>
                <p>The commissioners of naval inquiry <hi rend="italic">(Sixth Report)</hi> clearly
                    expose the “combination of self-interest which has been permitted to exist
                    against the public in all the persons who were concerned in the accounts of
                    job-work, and the fictitious manner of making up those accounts.” The
                    quarter-men, for instance, were paid wages according to the amount of the
                    earnings of the men under their own superintendence, and the accounts of those
                    earnings were taken by themselves. General Bentham has furnished an instance of
                    the gross abuses which existed under the old system of job-work. “By the
                    regulations of the navy board, nothing less than L.5. 2s. was to be paid for the
                    <hi rend="italic">smallest</hi> repair of a thirty-four feet launch. If the
                    above sum should be found inadequate to the payments for the work done to a boat
                    of this class, the repair was then to be denominated a <hi rend="italic"
                    >middling</hi> repair; in which case L.l 1. Is. was the exact sum. Again, if
                    this sum were insufficient, the repair was to be denominated a <hi rend="italic"
                    >large repair</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in this case, although the value
                    of the workmanship might have exceeded the sum of L.ll. Is. only by a few
                    shillings, the expense was to have appeared in the account as doubled, and set
                    down atL.22. 2s. and nothing less was to be the exact sum paid for this work.”
                    Nothing was more common, in estimating a man’s wages, than to find him working
                    three or four tides, and very often three nights, in one day. (Bentham’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Services,</hi> &amp;c.) The whole of this system is now done away;
                    and the consequence is, that as much work is performed, and turned out in a more
                    workman-like manner, and a very large saving, both in pay and materials, by
                    resorting to day pay, under proper superintendence. The effect of the change of
                    system, and the reductions that have been made in the establishments at home and
                    abroad, have reduced the expense in the year 1817 from about L.556,000 to
                    L.286,000, making a saving of L.270,000 a year.</p>
