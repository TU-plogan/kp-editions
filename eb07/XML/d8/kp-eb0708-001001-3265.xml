                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">DICTIONARY</label>, in its original acceptation, is the
                    arranging of all the words of a language according to the order of the alphabet,
                    and annexing a definition or explanation to each word. When arts and sciences
                    began to be improved and extended, the multiplicity of technical terms rendered
                    it necessary to compile dictionaries, either of science in general, or of
                    particular sciences, according to the views of the compiler.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dictionary</hi><hi rend="italic">of the English
                    Language.</hi> The design of every dictionary of language is to explain, in the
                    most accurate manner, the meaning of every word; and to show the various ways in
                    which it can be combined with others, in as far as this tends to alter or modify
                    its meaning. The dictionary which does this in the most accurate manner is the
                    most complete work of the kind; therefore the principal study of a lexicorapher
                    ought to be to discover the method which may seem best adapted for that purpose.
                    Dr Johnson, with great labour, has collected the various meanings of every word,
                    and quoted the authorities; but it would have been an improvement if he had
                    given an accurate definition of the precise meaning of every word; pointed out
                    the way in which it ought to be employed with the greatest propriety; showed the
                    various deviations from the original meaning, which custom had so far
                    established as to render allowable; and fixed the precise limits beyond which it
                    could not be employed without becoming a vicious expression. With this view it
                    would have been necessary to exhibit the nice distinctions which take place
                    between words nearly synonymous, and without which many words can only be
                    defined in such a manner that they must be considered as exactly synonymous. We
                    omit making any quotations from Johnson in order to point out these defects; and
                    shall content ourselves with giving a few examples, to show in what manner,
                    according to our idea, a dictionary of the English language ought to be
                    compiled.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Immediately,</hi><hi rend="italic">adv. of time.</hi></p>
                <p>1. Instantly, without delay. Always employed to denote future time, and never
                    past. Thus we may say, <hi rend="italic">I will come immediately;</hi> but not
                    <hi rend="italic">I am immediately come from such a place.</hi> See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Presently.</hi></p>
                <p>2. Without the intervention of any cause or event; as opposed to <hi
                    rend="italic">mediately.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Presently,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">adv. of time.</hi></p>
                <p>1. Instantly, without delay. Exactly synonymous with <hi rend="italic"
                    >immediately</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> being never with propriety employed to
                    denote any thing but future time.</p>
                <p>2. Formerly it was employed to express present time. Thus, <hi rend="italic">The
                    house presently possessed by such a one,</hi> was often used, but this has now
                    become a vicious expression; and we ought to say, <hi rend="italic">The house
                    possessed at present.</hi> It differs from <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi> in
                    this, that even in the most corrupt phrases it never can denote] past time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Form,</hi><hi rend="italic">subst.</hi> The external
                    appearance of any object, when considered only with reference to shape or
                    figure. This term, therefore, in the literal sense, can only be applied to the
                    objects of sight and touch, and is therefore nearly synonymous with <hi
                    rend="italic">figure</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but these terms differ in some
                    respects. <hi rend="italic">Form</hi> may be employed to denote more rude and
                    unfinished shapes; <hi rend="italic">figure,</hi> those which are more perfect
                    and regular. <hi rend="italic">Form</hi> can never be employed without denoting
                    matter, whereas <hi rend="italic">figure</hi> may be employed in the abstract:
                    thus we say a square or a triangular^^wre, but not a square or triangular <hi
                    rend="italic">form.</hi> Andin the same manner we say the <hi rend="italic"
                    >figure</hi> of a house; but we must denote the substance which forms that
                    figure if we use the word <hi rend="italic">form</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    as, <hi rend="italic">a cloud of the form of a house.</hi> See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Figure.</hi></p>
                <p>2. In contrast to irregularity or confusion. As beauty cannot exist without
                    order, it is by a figure of speech employed to denote beauty, order, and the
                    like.</p>
                <p>3. As <hi rend="italic">form</hi> respects only the external appearance of
                    bodies, without regard to their internal qualities, it is, by a figure of
                    speech, employed in contrast to these qualities to denote empty show, without
                    essential qualities. In this sense it is often taken when applied to religious
                    ceremonies, pageantry, and so forth.</p>
                <p>4. As <hi rend="italic">form</hi> is employed to denote the external appearance
                    of bodies, so, in a figurative sense, it is applied to reasoning, denoting the
                    particular mode or manner in which this is conducted; as, <hi rend="italic">the
                    form of a syllogism,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>5. In the same manner it is employed to denote the particular mode of procedure
                    established in courts of law; as, <hi rend="italic">the forms of law,
                    religion,</hi> and the like.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Form</hi> is sometimes, although improperly, used to denote
                    the different circumstances of the same body; as, <hi rend="italic">water in a
                    fluid or a solid form.</hi> But as this phrase regards the internal qualities
                    rather than the external figure, it is improper, and ought to be, <hi
                    rend="italic">water in a fluid or a solid state.</hi></p>
                <p>7. But when bodies of different kinds are compared with one another, this term
                    may be employed to denote other circumstances than shape or figure; for we may
                    say, <hi rend="italic">a juice exuding from a tree in the form of wax or
                    resin;</hi> although, in this case, the consistence, colour, &amp;c. and not the
                    external arrangement of parts, constitutes the resemblance.</p>
                <p>8. From the regular appearance of a number of persons arranged in one long seat,
                    such persons so arranged are sometimes called a <hi rend="italic">form;</hi> as,
                    <hi rend="italic">a form of students,</hi> &amp;c. And,</p>
                <p>9. By an easy transition the seat itself has also acquired that name.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Great,</hi> A relative word, denoting largeness of quantity,
                    number, &amp;c., serving to augment the value of those terms with which it is
                    combined, and opposed to <hi rend="italic">small</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >little.</hi> The principal circumstances in which this word can be employed are
                    the following:</p>
                <p>1. When merely inanimate objects are considered with regard to quantity, <hi
                    rend="italic">great</hi> is with propriety employed to denote that the quantity
                    is considerable: as, <hi rend="italic">a great mountain, great house,</hi> and
                    the like; and it is here contrasted with <hi rend="italic">small.</hi> When <hi
                    rend="italic">great</hi> is thus employed, we have no other word which is
                    exactly synonymous.</p>
                <p>2. When inanimate objects are considered with regard to their extent, this term
                    is sometimes employed, although with less propriety; as, <hi rend="italic">a
                    great plain, a great</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193323278"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-3278-0011"/><hi rend="italic">field,</hi> and the like. In
                    this sense it is nearly synonymous with <hi rend="italic">large</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and these terms were often used indiscriminately, but with
                    some difference of meaning; for, as <hi rend="italic">large</hi> is a term
                    chiefly employed to denote extent of superficies, and as <hi rend="italic"
                    >great</hi> more particularly regards the quantity of matter, therefore, when
                    <hi rend="italic">large</hi> is applied to any object which is not merely
                    superficial, it denotes that it is the extent of surface which is there meant to
                    be considered, without regard to the other dimensions; whereas, when the term
                    <hi rend="italic">great</hi> is employed, it has reference to the whole
                    contents. If, therefore, we say <hi rend="italic">a large house,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">a large river,</hi> we express that the house, or the river, has a
                    surface of great extent, without having any necessary connexion with the size in
                    other respects. But if we say <hi rend="italic">a great house,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">a great river,</hi> it at once denotes that these objects have not
                    only a large surface, but are also of great size in every respect.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Great,</hi> when applied to the human species, never denotes
                    the size or largeness of body, but is applied solely to the qualities of the
                    mind. Thus when we say that <hi rend="italic">Socrates was a great mail,</hi> we
                    do not mean that he was a man of great size, but that he was a man who excelled
                    in the endowments of the mind. The terms which denote largeness of size in the
                    human body are <hi rend="italic">big, bulhy, huge.</hi></p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Great</hi> is sometimes applied to the human species, as
                    denoting high rank. In this case it is oftener used in the plural number than
                    otherwise. Thus we say simply <hi rend="italic">the great,</hi> meaning the
                    whole body of men in high station, as opposed to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mean.</hi> It should seldom be employed in this sense, as it tends to confound
                    dignity of rank with elevation of mind.</p>
                <p>5. As this is a general term of augmentation, it maybe joined with all nouns
                    which denote <hi rend="italic">quantity, quality, number, excellence,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">defects</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> or such as imply <hi
                    rend="italic">praise, blame, anger, contempt,</hi> or any other affection of the
                    mind.</p>
                <p>6. It is employed to denote every step of ascending or descending consanguinity,
                    as <hi rend="italic">great-grandfather, great-grandson,</hi> and so on.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">High,</hi><hi rend="italic">adj.</hi> Exalted in a
                    perpendicular direction at a distance from the surface of the earth, and opposed
                    to <hi rend="italic">low.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">High</hi> is a term altogether indefinite, and is employed
                    to express the degree of elevation of any inanimate body. Thus we say <hi
                    rend="italic">a high mountain, a high house, steeple, tower, pillar,</hi> and
                    the like. Nor is there any other word which can here be considered as
                    synonymous; <hi rend="italic">lofty</hi> being employed only to denote a very
                    eminent degree of elevation.</p>
                <p>2. To express the perpendicular elevation of vegetables either <hi rend="italic"
                    >high</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tall</hi> may be employed, as being in this case
                    nearly synonymous. We may therefore say a <hi rend="italic">high</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">tall tree,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">high</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >tall mast,</hi> and so forth, but with this difference between these two
                    expressions, that toZZcan be more properly applied to those which are much
                    elevated and of small dimensions; and <hi rend="italic">high,</hi> to such as
                    are more bulky and of greater size.</p>
                <p>3. The perpendicular height of man can never be expressed by the word <hi
                    rend="italic">high, tall</hi> being here the proper expression. And although <hi
                    rend="italic">high</hi> is sometimes used to express the height of other
                    animals, yet it seems to be an improper expression. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Tall.</hi></p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">High,</hi> when applied to the human species, always refers
                    to the mind, and denotes <hi rend="italic">haughtiness, stateliness, pride,</hi>
                    and when combined with expressions indicating energy of mind, it denotes that in
                    a higher degree. In this sense it is opposed to <hi rend="italic">meanness,
                    abjectness,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">humility.</hi></p>
                <p>5. As this is an indefinite term, tending to denote any thing which is elevated
                    above us, it may be combined with almost every noun which admits of this
                    elevation. Hence, as objects high above us are always out of our reach, it is in
                    a metaphorical sense used to denote any thing which seems to be above the
                    ordinary condition of mankind, or those qualities or endowments of mind which
                    are not easily acquired; as, <hi rend="italic">dignity</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >elevation of sentiment, dignity of rank, acuteness in reasoning on difficult
                    subjects, pride, haughtiness,</hi> or any other quality which seems beyond the
                    ordinary level of mankind; <hi rend="italic">dearness of price.</hi></p>
                <p>6. In the same manner we apply this term to time, which having a metaphorical
                    resemblance to a river flowing on with an unceasing current through all
                    successive ages, any thing of remote antiquity is denoted by the term <hi
                    rend="italic">high.</hi><hi rend="italic">7.</hi> Likewise to those degrees of
                    latitude far removed from the line, where the pole becomes more elevated.</p>
                <p>8. And also to some particular crimes, as being attended with peculiar degrees of
                    guilt, as <hi rend="italic">high treason.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Tall,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">adj.</hi> Something elevated to a considerable degree in a
                    perpendicular direction, and opposed to <hi rend="italic">low.</hi></p>
                <p>1. This term is chiefly employed to express the height of man and other animals;
                    and is applied to denote the height of the body only, without having any
                    reference to the mind. When applied to man, no other word can be substituted in
                    its stead; when applied to other animals, <hi rend="italic">high</hi> is
                    sometimes considered as nearly synonymous. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >High.</hi></p>
                <p>2. It is likewise employed to denote the perpendicular height of vegetables, and
                    in this case it is nearly synonymous with <hi rend="italic">high.</hi> See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">High.</hi></p>
                <p>3. It can in no case be employed to express the height of merely inanimate
                    objects, as we can never say a <hi rend="italic">tall steeple, tower, or
                    pillar,</hi> but a <hi rend="italic">high steeple,</hi> &amp;c. For the
                    distinctions in these cases, see <hi rend="smallcaps">High.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Long,</hi><hi rend="italic">adj.</hi> A relative term, denoting
                    the distance between the extremes of any body which is extended more in one of
                    its geometrical dimensions than in another. It is opposed to <hi rend="italic"
                    >short.</hi></p>
                <p>1. This term maybe applied to all inanimate objects, of whatever kind, whose
                    dimensions in one way exceed their dimensions in the other, and when not in an
                    erect posture, whatever be the other circumstances attending them, whether it
                    relates to superficies alone or to solid bodies, whether these be bounded or
                    open, straight or crooked, flexible or rigid, or in any other circumstances
                    whatever: thus we say <hi rend="italic">a long</hi> or <hi rend="italic">short
                    line, a long</hi> or <hi rend="italic">short ridge, street, ditch, rope, chain,
                    staff,</hi> and the like. But it is to be observed, that although <hi
                    rend="italic">long</hi> is in the strict sense only opposed to <hi rend="italic"
                    >short,</hi> yet as it expresses the extension of matter in one of its
                    geometrical proportions, it is often contrasted by those words which express the
                    other proportions when we mean only to describe the several proportions; as, <hi
                    rend="italic">a table long and broad.</hi> And as these several dimensions are
                    expressed by different words, according to the various forms, modifications, and
                    circumstances in which bodies are found, therefore it is in this sense
                    contrasted by a great diversity of terms; as, <hi rend="italic">a long</hi> i
                    <hi rend="italic">and brood</hi> or <hi rend="italic">wide, narrow</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">strait, street</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lane</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">α long and thick</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >small rope, chain, staff.</hi> For the distinctions in these cases see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Broad, Wide, &amp;c.</hi></p>
                <p>2. Objects necessarily fixed in an erect position can never have this term
                    applied to them, and therefore we cannot say <hi rend="italic">a long,</hi> but
                    a <hi rend="italic">high tower</hi> or <hi rend="italic">steeple.</hi> And for
                    the same reason, while trees are growing and fixed in an erect position, we
                    cannot apply this term to them; but when they are felled and laid upon the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193323291" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3291-0012"/> ground, it is
                    quite proper and necessary. Thus we do not say <hi rend="italic">a long,</hi>
                    but <hi rend="italic">a tall</hi> or <hi rend="italic">high tree,</hi> while it
                    is growing; but we say <hi rend="italic">a long,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">a
                    tall log of wood;</hi> and in the same manner we say <hi rend="italic">a tall
                    mast</hi> when it is fixed in the ship, but <hi rend="italic">a long mast</hi>
                    while it lies upon the beach. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Tall</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">High.</hi></p>
                <p>3. Those vegetables which are of a tender, pliant nature, or so weak as not to be
                    able to retain a fixed position, being considered as of a middle nature between
                    erect and prostrate bodies, admit of either the terms <hi rend="italic">long,
                    tall,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">high</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> as, <hi
                    rend="italic">α long</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tall rush</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">willow wand,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">a long, tall,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">high stalk of corm</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">High</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Tall.</hi></p>
                <p>4. The parts of vegetables, when considered as distinct from the whole, even when
                    growing and erect, assume the term <hi rend="italic">long</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> for we do not say <hi rend="italic">a tall,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">a
                    long shoot of a tree,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a tree with a long stem,</hi>
                    in preference to <hi rend="italic">a tree with a high stem.</hi></p>
                <p>5. For the same reason, a staff and pole, even when fixed in a perpendicular
                    direction, assume the word <hi rend="italic">long,</hi> in preference to <hi
                    rend="italic">tall</hi> or <hi rend="italic">high.</hi></p>
                <p>6. With regard to animals, the general rule is applied, without any exceptions;
                    <hi rend="italic">tall,</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">long,</hi> being employed
                    to denote the height of the human body when in an erect posture; and <hi
                    rend="italic">long,</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">tall,</hi> to denote its
                    length when in an incumbent situation. <hi rend="italic">Long</hi> applied to
                    all other animals which do not walk erect, always denotes their greatest length
                    in a horizontal position from head to tail.</p>
                <p>7. In a figurative sense, it denotes, with regard to time, any thing at a great
                    distance from us.</p>
                <p>8. As also, any thing that takes up much time before it is finished, as, <hi
                    rend="italic">a long discourse, a protracted note in music,</hi> and the
                    like.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Broad,</hi><hi rend="italic">adj.</hi> The distance between
                    the two nearest sides of any body whose geometrical dimensions are larger in one
                    direction than in another. It has a reference to superficies only, and never to
                    the solid contents, and is opposed to <hi rend="italic">narrow.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Broad,</hi> in the strictest acceptation, is applied to
                    denote those bodies only whose sides are altogether open and unconfined; as, <hi
                    rend="italic">a broad table, a broad wheel,</hi> &amp;c. and in these cases it
                    is invariably contrasted with <hi rend="italic">narrow</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> nor is there any other word which in these cases can be considered as
                    synonymous with it, or be used in its stead.</p>
                <p>2. When any object is in some sort bounded on the sides, although not quite
                    closed up, as a road, street, ditch, and the like, either <hi rend="italic"
                    >broad</hi> or <hi rend="italic">wide</hi> may be employed, but with some
                    difference of signification; <hi rend="italic">broad</hi> being most properly
                    used for those which are more open, and <hi rend="italic">wide</hi> for those
                    which are more confined: nor can this term be ever applied to such objects as
                    are closely bounded all around, as a house, a church, and the like, <hi
                    rend="italic">wide</hi> being here employed. For the more accurate distinctions
                    in these cases see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Wide.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Wide,</hi><hi rend="italic">adj.</hi> A term employed to denote
                    relative extent in certain circumstances, and opposed to <hi rend="italic"
                    >narrow</hi> and <hi rend="italic">strait.</hi></p>
                <p>1. This term is in its proper sense applied only to denote the space contained
                    within any body closed all round and on every side; as, a house, gate, or the
                    like; and it differs from <hi rend="italic">broad</hi> in this, that it never
                    relates to the superficies of solid objects, but is employed to express the
                    capaciousness of any body which contains vacant space; nor can capaciousness in
                    this sense be expressed by any other word but <hi rend="italic">wide.</hi></p>
                <p>2. As many bodies may be considered either with respect to their capaciousness or
                    superficial extent, in all these cases either the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >broad</hi> or <hi rend="italic">wide</hi> may be used; as,« <hi rend="italic"
                    >broad or wide street orditch,</hi> &amp;c.; but with a greater, or less degree
                    of propriety, according to the circumstances of the object, or the idea which we
                    wish to convey. In a street where the houses are low and the boundaries open, or
                    in a ditch of small depth and large superficies, as this largeness of
                    superficies bears the principal proportion, <hi rend="italic">broad</hi> would
                    be more proper; but if the houses are of gŗeat height, or the ditch of great
                    depth, and capaciousness is the principal property which affects the mind, we
                    would naturally say <hi rend="italic">a wide street</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >ditch</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the same may be said of all similar
                    cases. But there are some cases in which both these terms are applied, with a
                    greater difference of meaning; thus we say <hi rend="italic">a broad</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">a ĩcide gate.</hi> As the gate, however, is employed to denote
                    either the aperture in the wall, or the matter which closes that aperture, these
                    terms are each of them used to denote that particular quality to which they are
                    generally applied; and as the opening itself can never be considered as a
                    superficies, the term <hi rend="italic">wide,</hi> in this case, denotes the
                    distance between the sides of the aperture; whilst, on the contrary, <hi
                    rend="italic">broad</hi> denotes the extent of matter fitted to close that
                    aperture; nor can these two terms be in any case substituted for one
                    another.</p>
                <p>3. As a figurative expression, it is used as a cant phrase for a mistake; as, <hi
                    rend="italic">you are wide of the mark</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that is, not
                    near the truth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Narrow,</hi><hi rend="italic">adj.</hi> A relative term,
                    denoting a proportional smallness of distance between the sides of the
                    superficies of plain bodies, and opposed to <hi rend="italic">broad.</hi></p>
                <p>1. As this is only applied to superficies, it is exactly contrasted by <hi
                    rend="italic">broad,</hi> and is applied in all cases where the term <hi
                    rend="italic">broad</hi> can be used (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Broad)</hi>; and
                    in no other case but as a contrast to it, excepting the following.</p>
                <p>2. It sometimes is employed to describe the smallness of space circumscribed
                    between certain boundaries, as opposed to <hi rend="italic">wide,</hi> and
                    nearly synonymous with <hi rend="italic">straight</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    thus we say <hi rend="italic">a wide</hi> or <hi rend="italic">a narrow house,
                    church,</hi> and the like. For the necessary distinctions here, see the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Strait.</hi></p>
                <p>3. In a figurative sense it denotes <hi rend="italic">parsimony, poverty,
                    confined sentiments,</hi> and so forth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Strait,</hi><hi rend="italic">adj.</hi> A relative .term,
                    denoting the extent of space in certain circumstances, and opposed to <hi
                    rend="italic">wide.</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Wide.</hi></p>
                <p>1. This term is employed, in its proper sense, to denote only space, as contained
                    between surrounding bodies in such circumstances as to denote some degree of
                    confinement, and is exactly opposed to <hi rend="italic">wide</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> as, <hi rend="italic">a ιoide</hi> or <hi rend="italic">a
                    strait gate,</hi> &amp;c. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Wide.</hi></p>
                <p>2. So necessary is it that the idea of confinement should be connected with this
                    word, that in all those cases where the space contained is large, as in a church
                    or house, we cannot express a smaller proportional width by this term. And as we
                    have no other word to express space in these circumstances, we are obliged to
                    force the word <hi rend="italic">narroτν</hi> from its natural signification,
                    and make it express this. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Narrow.</hi></p>
                <p>3. In some particular cases, <hi rend="italic">narrow</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >strait</hi> may be applied to the same object; as, <hi rend="italic">a
                    narrow</hi> or <hi rend="italic">a strait line</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but
                    here <hi rend="italic">strait</hi> is never employed except where an idea of
                    confinement is suggested, and where it is exactly contrasted to <hi
                    rend="italic">wide</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> nor can <hi rend="italic"
                    >narrow</hi> be employed except in such circumstances where <hi rend="italic"
                    >broad</hi> would be a perfect contrast to it. Therefore these two terms may be
                    always used in the same circumstances as those which contrast with them. For an
                    account of these see <hi rend="smallcaps">Wide.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193323304" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3304-0013"/>
                <p>4. The term <hi rend="italic">strait</hi> is likewise in a peculiar manner used
                    to denote the smallness of the internal diameter of those bodies which are
                    fitted to receive or contain others, as any kind of bag, tube, body clothes,
                    mortises, and others of the same kind; and in all these cases this term may be
                    employed to denote the smallness of their lesser diameter, and never the term
                    <hi rend="italic">narrow.</hi> But in certain circumstances the word <hi
                    rend="italic">tight</hi> may be substituted for it. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Tight.</hi></p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Strait,</hi> in a figurative sense, denotes any sort of
                    confinement of sentiment or disposition.</p>
                <p>TIGHT, <hi rend="italic">adj.</hi> A term employed in certain circumstances to
                    denote the internal capacity of particular bodies, and nearly synonymous with
                    <hi rend="italic">strait.</hi></p>
                <p>This term is confined entirely to denote the smallness of the internal dimensions
                    of such objects as are formed to cover, or to receive or contain, other solid
                    bodies, and can be employed in no other case. And although it agrees with <hi
                    rend="italic">strait,</hi> in always denoting confinement, and by being
                    applicable to the same species of objects, yet it differs in the following
                    respects: 1. If there be any difference of the diameter of the objects to which
                    the term <hi rend="italic">strait</hi> can be applied, it has always reference
                    to the smaller; yet <hi rend="italic">tight</hi> may be applied to any sort of
                    confinement, whether it regards the length or breadth. 2. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Strait</hi> can be applied to all bodies of capacity when of small diameter,
                    without any sort of reference to the nature of the substance which it may be
                    capable of containing. For we can say <hi rend="italic">a strait bag, a strait
                    sleeve, a strait mortise, a strait gate,</hi> and so on, whereas <hi
                    rend="italic">tight</hi> can only be applied to any body when it is considered
                    as having reference to another body which is intended to be contained in it, and
                    is pinched from want of room. Thus we say <hi rend="italic">the sleeve of a coat
                    is too tight for the arm, the mortise is too tight for the teìwn,</hi> and so
                    forth; but we cannot say <hi rend="italic">the bag</hi> or <hi rend="italic">the
                    gate is too tight,</hi> because they are fitted to receive any sort of objects.
                    And hence it happens that in many cases the dimensions of the same body may be
                    expressed by <hi rend="italic">tight</hi> or <hi rend="italic">strait,</hi> when
                    considered in different circumstances.’ Thus we may say, <hi rend="italic">this
                    sleeve is too strait,</hi> when we look at a coat lying on the table and
                    consider its proportions; but it is not till we have tried it upon the arm which
                    it is intended to cover, that we call it <hi rend="italic">tight.</hi> And we
                    may say, <hi rend="italic">a gate is too strait</hi> or <hi rend="italic">too
                    tight;</hi> but in the first case we consider it as being too confined for
                    admitting objects to pass through it; and in the next, as being too confined
                    with respect to the “leaves” which are to shut the aperture not allowing them
                    space to move with freedom.</p>
                <p>These examples may serve to give some idea of the plan of an English dictionary
                    composed upon philosophical principles. But, besides the circumstances above
                    enumerated, there are many others which would require particular attention in
                    the execution of a work of this kind. In the English language a great variety of
                    terms occur which denote matter under certain general forms or circumstances,
                    without regarding the minute diversities that may take place; as the word <hi
                    rend="italic">cloth,</hi> which denotes matter as manufactured into a particular
                    form, including under it all the variety of stuffs manufactured in that
                    particular way, of whatever materials, colour, texture, or fineness they may be.
                    The same may be said of <hi rend="italic">wood, iron, yarn,</hi> and a great
                    variety of terms of the same nature, some of which cannot assume any plural;
                    whilst others admit of it in all cases, and others, again, admit or refuse it
                    according to the different circumstances in which they are considered.</p>
                <p>In a dictionary, therefore, all this variety of cases ought to be clearly and
                    distinctly pointed out under each particular article. This is the more
                    necessary, as some of these words have others formed from them which might be
                    readily mistaken for their plurals, although they have a very different
                    signification; as <hi rend="italic">clothes,</hi> which does not denote any
                    number of pieces of different kinds of <hi rend="italic">cloth,</hi> but <hi
                    rend="italic">wearing apparel.</hi> The following example will illustrate this
                    head.</p>
                <p>WOOD, <hi rend="italic">subst.</hi> A solid substance of which the trunks and
                    branches of trees consist.</p>
                <p>1. This term is employed to denote the solid parts of vegetables of all kinds, in
                    whatever form or circumstances they are found. Nor does it admit of a plural
                    with propriety, unless in the circumstances after mentioned; for we say, <hi
                    rend="italic">many different hinds of wood,</hi> in preference to <hi
                    rend="italic">many hinds of woods</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> or we say, <hi
                    rend="italic">oak, ash,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">elm wood,</hi> not <hi
                    rend="italic">woods.</hi></p>
                <p>2. But where we want to contrast wood of one quality or country with that of
                    another, it admits of a plural; for we say, <hi rend="italic">white woods are in
                    general softer than red</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> or, <hi rend="italic">West
                    Indian woods are in general of greater specific gravity than the European
                    woods.</hi> But unless where the colour, or some quality which distinguishes it
                    from growing wood, is mentioned, this plural ought as much as possible to be
                    avoided, as it always suggests an idea of growing wood.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Wood</hi> likewise denotes a number of trees growing near
                    one another, being nearly synonymous with Jò- <hi rend="italic">rest.</hi> See
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Forest.</hi> In this sense it always admits of a plural;
                    as, <hi rend="italic">Ye woods and wilds whose melancholy gloom,</hi>
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>A dictionary cannot be reckoned complete without explaining obsolete words; and
                    if the terms of the several provincial dialects were likewise given, it would be
                    of great utility. Nor would this occupy much space, because a number of these
                    words need no other explanation than to mark along with them the words which had
                    come in their place, when there happened to be one perfectly synonymous; and in
                    those cases where the same idea could not be expressed in modern language
                    without a periphrasis, it would be of use to explain them distinctly; so that,
                    when a writer found himself at a loss for a term, and was obliged to search for
                    one beyond the bounds of his own language, he might take one of these, if he
                    found it expressive and energetic, in preference to another drawn from a foreign
                    language. This would at least have one good effect; it would render our language
                    more fixed and stable, not to say more accurate and precise, than by borrowing
                    from foreign languages. The following examples may serve to give some idea of
                    the manner of treating this part of the work.</p>
                <p>MOE, or <hi rend="smallcaps">mo,</hi><hi rend="italic">adj.</hi> An obsolete term
                    still employed in the Scotch dialect, and by them pronounced <hi rend="italic"
                    >mae,</hi> denoting a greater number, and nearly synonymous with <hi
                    rend="italic">more</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but it differs in this respect,
                    that in the Scotch dialect, <hi rend="italic">mae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >mair</hi> (English <hi rend="italic">morej</hi> are each employed in their
                    distinct sphere, without encroaching upon one another, <hi rend="italic"
                    >mae</hi> being employed to denote number, but never quantity or quality, and
                    <hi rend="italic">mair</hi> to denote quantity and quality, but never number;
                    thus they say <hi rend="italic">mae,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">mair, apples,
                    men,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi rend="italic">mair,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">mae,
                    cloth, earth, courage,</hi> &amp;c. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Mair.</hi> Both
                    these terms are supplied by the word <hi rend="italic">more,</hi> which in the
                    English language is applied indiscriminately to denote quantity, quality, and
                    number. See <hi rend="smallcaps">More.</hi></p>
                <p>As the English language is so exceedingly irregular in the pronunciation, the
                    same letter in the same situation often assuming sounds totally different in
                    different words, it is impossible to establish any general rules on this subject
                    which do not admit of many exceptions; therefore a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193323317" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3317-0014"/>dictionary is the best means
                    of ascertaining and pointing out the proper pronunciations of words. For, if the
                    writer first pointed out all the different sounds which the same letter could
                    ever be made to express, and assigned to every particular sound which each
                    letter could be made to assume, a particular mark, appropriated to denote that
                    particular sound of the letter whenever it occurred, by placing these particular
                    marks above the letters in the dictionary, the sound of each letter would be
                    pointed out in all cases with the utmost certainty. It is impossible to
                    illustrate this by examples, without first ascertaining all the sounds of each
                    letter, which would lead into a discussion too long for this place.</p>
                <p>We shall only further observe, that besides having the accented syllable of every
                    word <hi rend="italic">properly</hi> distinguished in a dictionary to assist in
                    the pronunciation, the English language requires another essential improvement,
                    namely, the use of accents to distinguish the meaning <hi rend="italic">of
                    words</hi> and <hi rend="italic">j)hrases,</hi> which, although it is not so
                    properly confined to a lexicorapher, yet it is not quite without his sphere.
                    Thus, the word <hi rend="italic">as</hi> admits of two very different sounds, as
                    well as different significations; for example, “Cicero was nearly <hi
                    rend="italic">as</hi> eloquent <hi rend="italic">as</hi> Demosthenes in which
                    the first <hi rend="italic">as</hi> is pronounced <hi rend="italic">ass,</hi>
                    and the last is pronounced <hi rend="italic">az.</hi> Now it often happens that,
                    in reading, the particular way in which it ought to be understood is not pointed
                    out by the context till after the word itself is pronounced, which has an equal
                    chance at least of being pronounced wrong; whereas, if it were always accented
                    when employed in the one sense, and not in the other, it would free the reader
                    from this perplexity. There are other cases in which the proper use of accents
                    in writing would be of great consequence; as at the beginning of a sentence when
                    it is put as a question, or used ironically. But this does not so properly
                    belong to the lexicorapher as the grammarian.</p>
                <p>The above examples, we hope, will be sufficient to give the reader some idea of
                    the plan which we would propose, and will enable him to determine whether or not
                    a dictionary, executed in this way, would convey to his mind a more perfect
                    knowledge of the English language than those dictionaries which have hitherto
                    been published. These examples are given rather with a view to show the manner
                    in which a work of this kind may be conducted, than as perfect and
                    unexceptionable explanations of the several articles there enumerated; and
                    therefore we have not thought it necessary to produce any authorities, although
                    we are sensible that they would be requisite in such a work.</p>
