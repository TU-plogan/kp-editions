                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">DOMENICHINO</label>, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Domenico,
                    Lampieri,</hi> the celebrated painter, was born at Bologna in 1581. He was
                    placed when young under the tuition of Denis Calvart; but having been treated
                    with great-severity by that master, he left him, and became a pupil in the
                    academy of the Caracci, where he remained for a long time. The genius of
                    Domenichino was slow in its development. He was at first timid and distrustful
                    of his powers; whilst his studious, thoughtful, and reserved manners were
                    misunderstood by his companions for dulness. But the intelligent Annibal
                    Caracci, who observed his faculties with more attention, and knew his abilities
                    better, testified of Domenichino that his apparent slowness of parts would in
                    time produce what would be an honour to the art of painting. When his early
                    productions had brought him into notice, he studied with incredible application,
                    and made such advances in painting as to raise his works into a comparison with
                    those of the most admired masters. From his acting as a continual censor of his
                    own works, he became amongst his fellow pupils the most accurate and expressive
                    designer; his colours were the truest to nature, and of the best <hi
                    rend="italic">impasto,</hi> and he proved the most universal master in the
                    theory of his art; in short, the only painter amongst them all, in whom Mengs
                    found nothing to desire, except a somewhat larger proportion of elegance. That
                    he might devote his whole being to the art, Domenichino shunned all society, or
                    if he occasionally sought it in the public theatres and walks, it was in order
                    better to observe the play of the passions in the features of the people,—those
                    of joy, anger, grief, terror, and every affection of the mind, and to commit
                    them vividly to his tablets; and thus, says Belloni, it was that he succeeded in
                    delineating the soul, in colouring life, and calling forth heartfelt emotions,
                    at which his works all aim, as if he waved the same wand which had belonged to
                    the poetical enchanters Tasso and Ariosto.</p>
                <p>After several years’ severe study at Bologna, Domenichino went to Parma, in order
                    to examine the beautiful <pb break="no" facs="nls:193324422"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-4422-0099"/>works of the Lombards, and thence proceeded to
                    Rome, where he assisted Annibal Caracci, and obtained employment through his
                    recommendation from Cardinals Borghese, Farnese, and Aldobrandi, for all of whom
                    he painted works ip fresco, which were justly admired. The distinguished
                    reputation which he had acquired excited the jealousy of some of his
                    contemporaries, who represented his very excellencies as defects. Lanfranco in
                    particular, one of his most inveterate enemies, asserted that his Communion of
                    St Jerome was an imitation from Agostino Caracci, and procured an engraving of
                    this master’s picture of the same subject, copies of which were circulated for
                    the purpose of showing up Domenichino as a plagiarist. But this stratagem only
                    tended to expose the calumnious intents of his rivals, as it was evident that
                    there was no other resemblance in the compositions than what must necessarily be
                    the case in the pictures of two artists treating the same subject; and that
                    every essential part, and all that was admired in the work, were entirely his
                    own. If it had been possible for the exertions of modest merit to have repelled
                    the shafts of slander, the pictures which he painted immediately afterwards,
                    representing subjects from the life of St Cecilia, might have silenced the
                    attacks of envy and malevolence; but they only increased the alarm of his
                    competitors, and redoubled their injustice and malignity. Disgusted with these
                    cabals, Domenichino left Rome for Bologna, where he remained until lie was
                    recalled by Pope Gregory XV., who appointed him principal painter and architect
                    to the pontifical palace. But the persecutions of his enemies continued
                    unabated, and are said to have absolutely wearied out his life. He died, not
                    without suspicion of being poisoned, in 1641.</p>
                <p>Domenichino, in correctness of design, expression of the passions, and simplicity
                    and variety in the airs of his heads, is allowed to be little inferior to
                    Raffàelle. “We must,” says Lanzi, “despair to find paintings exhibiting richer
                    or more varied ornaments, accessaries more beautifully adapted, or more majestic
                    draperies. The figures are finely disposed both in place and action, conducing
                    to the general effect; whilst a light pervades the whole, which seems to rejoice
                    the spirit, growing brighter and-brighter in the aspect of the best
                    countenances, whence they first attract the eye and heart of the beholder.” The
                    persons delineated could not tell their tale to the ear more plainly than they
                    speak it to the eye. The Scourging of St Andrew, which he executed in
                    competition with Guido at Rome, is a powerful illustration of this truthful
                    expression. Of the two∖vorks of these'masters, Annibal Caracci preferred that of
                    Domenichino. It is said that iir painting one of the executioners the artist
                    actually threw hittj-sélf into a passion, using threatening words and actions,
                    and that Annibal Caracci surprising him at that moment, embraced him,,
                    exclaiming with joy, “To-day, my dear Domenichinβ, tliou art teaching me.” “So
                    novel,” remarks Lanzi, “and at the same time so natural,· it appeared to him,
                    that the artist, like the orator, should feel within himself all that he is
                    representing to others.” Domenichino is universally esteemed as the most
                    distinguished disciple of the Caracci. Algarotti prefers him to the greatest
                    masters; and Nicoo Poussin considered him as the first painter after Raffaelle.
                    His pictures of the Communion of St Jerome, Adam and Ėve, and the Martyrdom of
                    St Agnes, are esteemed amongst his best works. Domenichino was unrivalled in his
                    frescos. He excelled also in landscape painting. In that style the beauty <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> arising from the natural and simple elegance of his
                    scenery, his trees, his well-broken grounds, and in particular the character and
                    expression of his figures, gained him as much public admiration as any of his
                    other performances.</p>
                <p>The worth of Domenichino, as Agucchi foretold, was never rightly appreciated
                    during his lifetime. But the spirit of party which set in so strongly against
                    him whilst living, soon passed away when he was no more; and impartial posterity
                    has done justice to the talents of this illustrious painter, whose works are in
                    the highest esteem, and fetch enormous prices. (z. <hi rend="italic"
