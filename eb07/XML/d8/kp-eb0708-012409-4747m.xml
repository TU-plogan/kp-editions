                    in his imagination the seeds of genuine poetry. In the year 1509, we find him

                    mourning. This precipitate match, which had been concluded without the
                    concurrence of the principal nobility, excited general indignation: the queen
                    was no longer willingly acknowledged as regent; the pre-eminence of her husband
                    rendered him odious in the eyes of the more powerful subjects; and the house of

                    decline this splendid offer, and the queen afterwards attempted to elevate
                    Douglas to the primacy. Confiding in the royal nomination, and in the influence
                    of his own family, he took possession of the archiepiscopal palace; but his
                    claims were disputed by two powerful rivals, John Hepburn, prior of St Andrews,
                    and Andrew Foreman, bishop of Moray in Scotland, and archbishop of Bourges in
                    France. Hepburn having prevailed upon the canons to elect him to the see, laid
                    siege to the castle, and after meeting with some resistance,· expelled the

                    moderation, resolved to abandon the pursuit of this high object of
                    ecclesiastical ambition; but the other competitors seem to have been alike
                    insensible to motives of private virtue and of public decorum. Foreman being
                    afraid to publish the papal bulls, prevailed upon Lord Hume, by bestowing on his
                    brother the priory of Coldingham, to undertake the support of his cause; and
                    this border chieftain enabled him to appear at Edinburgh, attended by ten
                    thousand men in arms. Having performed the necessary ceremony, they hastened to
                    St Andrews in order to complete their pious task, but they found the prior
                    sufficiently prepared for their reception: Jn the castle and in the cathedral he
                    had placed so considerable a garrison, that Foreman was unwilling to hazard an
                    attack, and deemed it more prudent to adjust their claims by an amicable
                    negociation; it was finally stipulated that he should be put in quiet possession
                    of the primacy, that Hepburn should' receive a yearly pension from the bishopric
                    of Moray, and should retain such rents as he had already levied from the
                    archbishopric of St Andrews.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>From this negociation Douglas derived no advantage; and, to complete the measure
                    of his disappointments, the abbacy of Aberbrothock, which· he had regarded as
                    secure, was transferred to James Beaton, archbishop of Glasgow, and chancellor
                    of the kingdom. The death of George Brown, bishop of Duukeld, which occurred in
                    the month of January 1515, presented him with new prospects, and exposed him to
                    new mortifications. The queen nominated him to the vacant see, and, as is
                    supposed, by the intervention of her brother the king of England, obtained a
                    papal bull in his favour. But, in the mean time, the earl of Athole had induced
                    the chapter to postulate his brother Andrew Stewart, prebendary of Craig, who
                    had not yet taken subdeacon’s orders.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It may not be unnecessary to remark, that in the popish

                    elected a bishop, unless he has at least taken subdeacon’s orders. Although he
                    cannot be elected, he may however be postulated by the chapter; and if this
                    postulation is admitted by the pope, he is then considered as elected and
                    iconfirmed. “Postulatio est ejus, qui eligi non potest, in praelatum concors

                    viii.) There are other canonical impediments, which we need not enumerate; for
                    Stewart’s disqualification is particularly specified by Myln.</p></note> The
                    enemies of the queen did not neglect this opportunity of disgracing an
                    individual so nearly allied to her husband í Douglas was cited before the
                    competent judges, and was accused of having violated the laws, by procuring
                    bulls from Rome. Such practices had indeed been prohibited by several statutes,
                    but these had vefy seldom been enforced. Of this offence he was however
                    convicted; and being committed to the charge of his former rival Hepburn, he was
                    successively confined in the castles of Edinburgh, St Andrews, and Dunbar, and
                    again in that of Edinburgh. Before the period of his trial, the queen’s party
                    had almost entirely lost its influence: the duke of Albany, who was the grandson
                    of James the Second, and the cousin of the late king, arrived from France on the
                    10th of May, and within the space of about two months was declared regent of the
                    kingdom. A compromise at length took place between the two parties: Douglas
                    obtained his liberty after an imprisonment of more than twelve months; and his
                    claim to the bishopric was secured by Beaton’s mediation with the new regent. He
                    was consecrated at Glasgow by the same prelate, who defrayed the expenses
                    attending this ceremony; and having paid a visit to the metropolitan city of St
                    Andrews, he proceeded to Dunkeld, where the clergy and laity testified the
                    utmost joy at the arrival of sô noble, learned, and pious a bishop. The bulls
                    having with the usual solemnities been read at the high altar, he retired to the
                    residence of the dean, George Hepburn, by whom hé was suitably entertained. The
                    episcopal palace was still occupied by the retainers of Stewart; and the bishop
                    finding next day that they had likewise seized the tower oΓ the cathedral, was
                    obliged to perform divine service at the deanery. In the afternoon he held a
                    consultation with the nobility, gentry, and clergy, by whom he was attended; but
                    their deliberations were speedily interrupted by the intelligence that Stewart
                    had taken up arms, and was advancing to support his adherents; and at the same
                    time they were alarmed by the commencement of a fire from the palace and the
                    cathedral. Lord Ogilvy, with the eldest son of the earl of Crawford, and many
                    other friends, including a considerable number of ecclesiastics, with' the dean
                    among the rest, immediately began to prepare for action; and messengers having
                    been dispatched to the neighbouring districts, his party was next day
                    strengthened by the arrival of a formidable reinforcement of armed men. Stewart,
                    who did not find himself strong enough to hazard an attack, retired ińto the
                    woods. His retaipers, who garrisoned the palace and the cathedral, were now
                    summoned to surrender, under the pain of excommunication; and on their refusing
                    to obey this summons, the bishop’s servants, led by a valiant prebendary, and by
                    James Carmichael, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193324773"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-4773-0126"/>took possession of the cathedral. Intimidated by
                    this event, those who occupied the palace requested that a truce might be
                    granted, and the sentence of excommunication delayed for a few hours; but when
                    the stipulated time had elapsed, they still refused to surrender. The
                    interference of the regent at length enabled Douglas to take possession of his
                    palace without the effusion of blood; a circumstance, as one of his biographers
                    has remarked, which “was certainly very acceptable to the good bishop; who in
                    all the actions of his life discovered a gentle and merciful disposition,
                    regulating the warlike and heroic spirit of his family by the excellent laws of
                    the Christian religion.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Sage’s Life of Douglas, p. 7∙</p></note> After these events, Stewart
                    hastened to the court, accompanied by his brother the earl; and Douglas having
                    likewise made his appearance, their respective claims were taken into
                    consideration by the regent and council. It was finally agreed that Stewart
                    should relinquish his pretensions to the see of Dunkeld, but should retain such
                    rents as he had already levied, and should be confirmed in the possession of the
                    two benefices of Alyth and Cargill, under the condition of paying the bishop a
                    certain annual contribution in grain.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Although Douglas had so recently been punished for soliciting bulls from Rome,
                    yet the regent did not scruple to apply to the pope for a ratification of this
                    agreement: in a letter dated on the 28th of September 1516, he entreated his
                    holiness that all informalities might be removed, and the stipulations rendered
                    valid by his sanction.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Having at length been installed in his cathedral, he was speedily called from the
                    discharge of his episcopal functions. During the ensuing year, an ambassador
                    arrived from France, with a proposition for the renewal of the ancient league
                    between the two kingdoms; and it was thought expedient that the duke of Albany
                    should himself repair to Paris, accompanied by Bishop Douglas, and by Patrick
                    Panter, chancellor of Dunkeld, and secretary of state. The negociation having
                    been brought to a satisfactory conclusion, the bishop was employed to convey the
                    earliest intelligence to Scotland.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    in a delightful part of the country: the situation of Dunkeld, which no
                    intelligent lover of our early literature can visit without recollecting the
                    name of Douglas, has a romantic beauty of which it is difficult to convey an
                    adequate idea.</p>
                <p>When the duke of Albany was preparing to quit the kingdom, he delegated his
                    authority to the archbishops of St Andrews and Glasgow, and the earls of Arran,
                    Angus, Argyle, and Huntley: but the predominating power of Angus excited the
                    apprehensions or the jealousy of his colleagues; and they resolved to unite
                    their strength with the view of circumscribing the influence of so formidable a
                    rival. On the 29th of April 1520, Arran with many others of the nobility
                    assembled at Edinburgh in the house of Archbishop Beaton: they formed the
                    resolution of instantly seizing the person of Angus, whose power, they
                    pretended, was so exorbitant that, while he continued at liberty, his
                    fellow-subjects could enjoy no security. Aware of their hostile intentions, he
                    requested his uncle the bishop of Dunkeld to mitigate their resentment, and
                    persuade them to adopt a more lawful method of redress. He accordingly addressed
                    himself to the archbishop, whom he found in the church belonging to the
                    monastery of the black friars, and entreated him to act the part of a
                    peacemaker: the crafty and turbulent prelate protested that he was at once
                    ignorant of their designs, and unable to prevent them from being carried into
                    execution; and to confirm this averment, he made a solemn appeal to his
                    conscience, but having too forcibly applied his hand to his breast, he
                    discovered to his indignant companion, that his sacred habit concealed a coat of
                    mail. “My Lord,” exclaimed the bishop, “I perceive your conscience is not good,
                    for I hear it <hi rend="italic">clattering”</hi> that is, telling tales. He next
                    accosted Sir Patrick Hamilton, requesting him to interpose with his brother the
                    earl of Arran: this gentleman was inclined to peaceable measures, when the
                    earl’s natural son Sir James, a man of a ferocious disposition, rudely upbraided
                    him with cowardice. This charge he repelled with indignation; and having drawn
                    his sword, he rushed furiously into the street, where the earl of Angus had
                    stationed a numerous body of his retainers: perceiving him advance before the
                    other assailants, the earl called aloud to his followers to save Sir Patrick
                    Hamilton’s life; but in the heat of battle it is difficult to spare those who
                    are eager to destroy, and he was speedily slain, together with the eldest son of
                    the earl of Eglintoun. The encounter, which was long and fierce, was at length
                    decided by the interference of some of the citizens, who were favourably
                    disposed to the queen, and therefore espoused the cause of her husband.
                    Seventy-two of his antagonists perished in the battle. During this scene of
                    disgraceful violence, the bishop of Dunkeld had retired to his chamber, and
                    spent the anxious interval in a manner suitable to the profession; but when the
                    contest was decided, he hastened to prevent the wanton effusion of blood. The
                    archbishop, who appears to have been personally engaged, had taken refuge behind
                    the altar of Black-friars church, and the rocket was already torn from his
                    shoulders, when the interposition of Douglas saved his life.<note

                    Scotland in 1521; and one of his earliest measures was to reduce the inordinate
                    power of the Douglasses. Angus and his principal adherents, having been summoned
                    to answer for their violent proceedings, fled for refuge to the Kirk of Steill.

                <p>While the accomplished prelate was thus employed in England, his enemies were not
                    inactive in Scotland. His mission to the English king furnished a sufficient
                    pretext for accusing him of treason: on the 21st of February 1522 he was
                    declared a traitor, and the revenues of his see were placed in a state of
                    sequestration; the king’s subjects were prohibited, under the pain of treason,
                    from affording him any pecuniary assistance, or maintaining with him any
                    correspondence either by letters or messages. An account of these proceedings
                    was transmitted to the pope, accompanied with a remonstrance against the
                    nomination or recommendation of the traitor Gavin Douglas to the archbishopric
                    of St Andrews and the abbacy of Dunfermline, or to either of those

                    Nor were these the only expedients to which he resorted: as chancellor of the
                    kingdom, he addressed a letter to the king of Denmark, entreating him to

                    represents him as eminently skilled in divinity and the canon law. He was
                    perhaps the most learned of the early Scotish pocts. Among the ancient poets,
                    his favourites were apparently Virgil and Ovid; among the Christian fathers, his
                    favourite was St Augustin, whom he denominates the chief of clerks. Of the Latin
                    language his knowledge was certainly extensive; and as he states that Lord
                    Sinclair had requested him to translate Homer, we may venture to infer that he
                    was not unacquainted with Greek. It is highly probable that he had completed his
                    education on the continent, and had thus given his studies a more elegant and
                    classical direction. Nor were his talents less conspicuous than his learning. In
                    all his writings he evinces an excursive fancy, with much of the fervour of
                    genius. His allegorical sketches are efforts of no common ingenuity; but what
                    chiefly renders his works interesting is the frequent occurrence of those
                    picturesque and characteristic touches, which can only be produced by a man
                    capable of accurate observation and original thinking. He exhibits perpetual
                    vestiges of a prolific and even exuberant imagination, and his very faults are
                    those of superabundance rather than deficiency. In his descriptions, which are
                    often admirable, he occasionally distracts the attention by a multiplicity of
                    objects, nor is he sufficiently careful to represent each new circumstance in a
                    definite and appropriate manner. His style is copious and impetuous, but it
                    cannot be commended for its purity. In his translation of Virgil he professes to
                    be scrupulous in rejecting Anglicisms, and indeed his diction is often remote
                    from that of the English poets: but he has imported many exotic terms from
                    another quarter; his familiarity with the Latin language betrays itself in
                    almost every page of his writings. His verses, though less smooth and elegant
                    than those of Dunbar, arc not unskilfully constructed.</p>

                    1827, 4to.</p></note> an allegorical poem which displays much versatility of
                    fancy and a ready command of striking imagery. Still however it is to be
                    considered as a Gothic structure, and as exhibiting many of the peculiarities
                    which belong to that order: ancient and modern usages, classical and Christian
                    subjects, are almost constantly blended together; and a nymph of Calliope’s
                    train expounds the scheme of human redemption. This poem appears to have been
                    composed in 1501, when the author was twenty-six or twenty-seven years of age.
                    It has been surmized that Douglas’s work is probably founded on the <hi

                    appearance of the different courts described in the Palice of Honour, may
                    possibly remind some readers of the Triumphs of Petrarch, in which various
                    shadowy trains succeed each other in a somewhat similar manner; but
                    notwithstanding these different suggestions, Douglas’s poem must still be

                    a work which furnishes a striking example of the misapplication of fine poetical
                    talents. From the occurrence of several incorrect passages, it has been supposed
                    to be one of Douglas’s earliest performances. Incorrect passages we may expect
                    to find in all the vernacular poetry of that age; and the versification appears
                    to us superior to that of the Palice of Honour. As he has not enumerated it
                    among his early works, we may perhaps venture to conclude that it was written
                    after his translation of Virgil. The heart, being the fountain of vital motion,
                    is here personified as man himself, and is conducted through a great variety of
                    adventures.</p>
                <p>But the most remarkable of Douglas’s works is perhaps his translation of the

                    fortunately specified the origin and progress of this undertaking: he there
                    informs us that it was begun at the request of his cousin Lord Sinclair, whom he
                    represents as a zealous collector of books, and protector of science and
                    literature; and that it was the labour of only sixteen months, being completed
                    on the 22d day of July 1513, about twelve years after he had composed the Palice
                    of Honour. This task must apparently be understood to comprehend, not merely a
                    version of Virgil’s twelve books, but likewise of the supplementary book of
                    Mapheus Vcgius, together with the original poems which he has interspersed in
                    the volume. Whether we consider the state of British literature at that period,
                    or the rapidity with which he executed so extensive a work, it is impossible to
                    withhold from this version a large share of our approbation. In either of the
                    sister languages, few translations of classical authors had hitherto been
                    attempted. Even in England, it has been remarked, no metrical version of a
                    classic had yet appeared; except of Boethius, who scarcely merits that
                    appellation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Warton’s
                    Hist, of English Poetry, vol. iii. p. 112.</p></note> On the destruction of
                    Troy, Caxton had published a kind of prose romance, which he professes to have
                    translated from the French; and the English reader was taught to consider this
                    motley composition as a version of the Aeneid. Douglas bestows severe
                    castigation on Caxton for his perversion of the classical story; and affirms
                    that his work no more resembles Virgil than the devil resembles St Austin. He
                    has however fallen into one error which he exposes in his precursor; proper
                    names are so completely disfigured in his translation, that they cannot be
                    recognized without some degree of difficulty. In various instances, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193324812" xml:id="kp-eb0708-4812-0129"/>he has been guilty

                <p>Douglas’s translation of Virgil is certainly executed with no mean ability; it is
                    the effort of a bold and energetic writer, whose knowledge of the original

                    qualified him for the performance of so arduous a task. It is indeed to be
                    regretted that he did not devote a much longer period to this undertaking: he
                    might thus have been enabled to render his versification more terse and
                    finished; but the work, in its present state, is a singular monument of his
                    genius and industry. One of his principal objects was to write in plain and
                    intelligible language, so that his favourite poet might be readily understood by
                    his countrymen; and by keeping this object constantly in view, he has frequently
                    attained to less elevation of style than might have been expected. His
                    translation possesses one merit which he probably did not contemplate: as a
                    version of a well-known classic, it presents an ample fund of philological
                    information; and Ruddiman’s excellent glossary has long recommended it to all
                    those who have paid any particular attention to the etymology of the Scotish
                    language. The felicity of this translation has been very warmly commended by
                    another Scotish prelate, Dr Lesley, the celebrated bishop of Ross; who, in
                    enumerating its various excellencies, has stated that it always renders one
                    verse by another. But this regularity of correspondence, for which it has
                    likewise been praised by Dempster, must not be too literally understood; and it
                    may be proper to recollect that the verses of the two poets, although they might
                    be equal in number, could not be equal in length, as a hexameter line may
                    consist of seventeen, and cannot consist of fewer than thirteen syllables.</p>
                <p>The bishop of Dunkeld’s version of the Aeneid seems to have suggested a similar
                    plan to the earl of Surrey, who translated the second and fourth books into
                    English. In this translation he has exhibited the earliest specimen of blank
                    verse that occurs in the history of English poetry. Dr Nott has remarked that
                    “we meet with so many expressions which Surrey has evidently borrowed, with so
                    many lines adopted with hardly any other alteration than that which the
                    difference of the dialect, and the measure made necessary, and so many taken
                    without any alteration at alR that all doubt ceases. It becomes a matter of
                    certainty that Surrey must have read and studied the Scottish translation before
                    he began his own.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Nott’s Dissertation on the State of English Poetry before the Sixteenth
                    Century, p. cciv.</p></note> This assertion he has verified by a long series of
                    parallel passages, which it is impossible to read without acquiescing in his
                    opinion.</p>
                <p>The several books of Douglas’s translation are introduced by prologues, which, in
                    the opinion of Warton, are often highly poetical, and shew that his proper walk
                    was original poetry. They have likewise received warm commendation from Hume of
                    Godscroft, who was himself a scholar and a poet. <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">In</hi> his prologues before every book,” he remarks, “where he
                    hath his liberty, he sheweth a natural and ample vein of poesy, so pure,
                    pleasant, and judicious, that I believe there is none that hath written before
                    or since, but cometh short of him. And, in my opinion, there is not such a piece
                    to be found as his prologue to the eighth book, beginning <hi rend="italic">Of
                    drevilling and dreams,</hi> &amp;c. at least in our language.”</p>
                <p>These are the only works of Bishop Douglas with which we are now acquainted. On
                    concluding his translation of Virgil, he avowed a resolution to devote his
                    future days to the service of the commonwealth and the glory of God. The
                    earliest of his poetical performances appears to have been a translation of Ovid
                    <hi rend="italic">JDe Pemedio</hi><hi rend="italic">Amoris</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but of this translation no copy is known to be extant.</p>

                <p>Bale mentions another of his compositions under the title of “Aureae Narrationes
                    which Sage supposes to be the short commentary noticed in the concluding address
                    to Lord Sinclair:</p>
                <p>I haue also ane schorte commend compyld, » To expone strange historiis and termes
                    wylde.</p>
                <p>This comment, as the same biographer conjectures, may have been merely a brief
                    explanation of the classical mythology. If we may rely on the authority of Bale
                    and Dempster, he likewise composed comedies; but both these writers are apt to
                    multiply books as well as authors. Another biographer is inclined to suppose
                    that he may have written the Flowers of the Forest, a song which displays no
                    small portion of pathetic simplicity. “It may be conjectured,” says Mr Scott,
                    “that he was the author of that celebrated elegaic song, which describes the
                    devastation occasioned by the battle of Flowdon, in that part of the country
                    with which he had long been well acquainted.”<note anchored="true"

                    for almost all his predecessors, his critical opinions on such subjects were
                    very far. from being infallible. According to a more authentic account, the tune
                    and two detached verses of this song are ancient; and all the others were
                    composed by a lady connected with the county of Roxburgh.<note anchored="true"
