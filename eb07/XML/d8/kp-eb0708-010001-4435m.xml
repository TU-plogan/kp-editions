                    wife and children, but most frequently to servants, such as footmen, lacqueys,
                    porters, and the like.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Domestic,</hi><hi rend="italic">adj.</hi> is sometimes
                    opposed to foreign. Thus <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">domestic</hi>
                    occurrences” signify those events which happen in our own country, in
                    contradistinction to those of which we receive intelligence from abroad.</p>
                <p>In its more usual acceptation, the term implies something peculiar to <hi
                    rend="italic">home</hi> or <hi rend="italic">household.</hi> Thus we speak of
                    <hi rend="italic">domestic</hi> happiness or pleasures, meaning the pleasures
                    enjoyed in the bosom of one’s family; in opposition to those which are found in
                    the bustle of public life, or delusively sought for in the haunts of
                    dissipation.</p>
                <p>The solace of domestic enjoyment has been coveted by the wisest and greatest of
                    men. Senators and heroes have shut out the acclamations of an applauding world,
                    in order to enjoy the society of their little ones, and to partake the
                    endearments of family conversation. They knew that even their best friends, in
                    the common intercourse of life, were in some degree actuated by interested
                    motives in displaying their affection; that many of their followers applauded
                    them in hopes of reward; and that the giddy multitude, however zealous, were not
                    always judicious in their approbation. But the attentions paid them at their
                    fire-side, and the smiles which exhilarated their own table, were the genuine
                    result of undissembled love.</p>
                <p>“The nursery has often alleviated the fatigues of the bar and the senate-house,”
                    says an excellent essayist, (Knox). “Nothing contributes more to raise the
                    gently pleasing emotions than the view of infant innocence enjoying the raptures
                    of a game at play. All the sentiments of uncontrolled nature display themselves
                    to the view, and furnish matter for agreeable reflection to the mind of the
                    philosophical observer. To partake with children in their little pleasures is by
                    no means unmanly. It is one of the purest sources of mirth. It has an influence
                    in amending the heart, which necessarily takes a tincture from the company that
                    surrounds us. Innocence as well as guilt is communicated and increased by the
                    contagion of example. And the great Author of evangelical philosophy has taught
                    us to emulate the simplicity of the infantine age. He seems indeed himself to
                    have been delighted with young children, and found in them what he in vain
                    sought among those who judged themselves their superiors, unpolluted purity of
                    heart.</p>
                <p>“Among the great variety of pictures which the vivid imagination of Homer has
                    displayed throughout the Iliad, there is not one more pleasing than the
                    family-piece which represents the parting interview between Hector and
                    Andromache. It deeply interests the heart, while it delights the imagination.
                    The hero ceases to be terrible, that he may become amiable. We admire him while
                    he stands completely armed in the field of battle; but we love him more while he
                    is taking off his helmet, that he may not frighten his little boy with its
                    nodding plumes. We are refreshed with the tender scene of domestic love, while
                    all around breathes rage and discord. We are pleased to see the arm, which is
                    shortly to deal death and destruction among an host of foes, employed in
                    caressing an infant son with the embraces of paternal love. A professed critic
                    would attribute the pleasing effect entirely to contrast; but the heart has
                    declared, previously to the inquiries of criticism, that it is chiefly derived
                    from the satisfaction which we naturally take in beholding great characters
                    engaged in tender and amiable employments.</p>
                <p>“But after all that is said of the purity and the solidity of domestic pleasures,
                    they unfortunately appear to a great part of mankind insipid, unmanly, and
                    capable of satisfying none but the weak, the spiritless, the inexperienced, and
                    the effeminate. The pretenders to wit and modern philosophy are often found to
                    renounce the received opinions of prudential conduct, and, while they affect a
                    superior liberality, to regulate their lives by the most selfish principles.
                    Whatever appears to have little tendency to promote personal pleasure and
                    advantage, they leave to be performed by those simple individuals who are dull
                    enough, as they say, to pursue the journey of life by the straight road of
                    common sense. It is true, they will allow that the world must be replenished by
                    a perpetual succession; and it is no less true, that an offspring once
                    introduced into the world requires all the care of painful attention. But let
                    the task be reserved for meaner spirits. If the passions can be gratified
                    without the painful consequences of supporting a family, they eagerly seize the
                    indulgence; but the toil of education they leave to those whom they deem fools
                    enough to take a pleasure in it. There will always be a sufficient number, say
                    they, whose folly will lead them, for the sake of a silly passion called
                    virtuous love, to engage in a life of perpetual anxiety. The fool’s paradise,
                    they add with derision, will never be deserted.</p>
                <p>“Presumptuous as are all such pretenders to newly-invented systems of life and
                    conduct, it is not to be supposed<pb break="no" facs="nls:193324448"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-4448-0101"/> they will think themselves superior to Cicero.
                    Yet Cicero, with all his liberality of mind, felt the tenderness of conjugal and
                    parental attachment, and acknowledged that at one time he received no
                    satisfaction in any company but that of his wife, his little daughter, and, to
                    use his own epithet, his <hi rend="italic">honied</hi> young Cicero. The great
                    Sir Thomas More, whom nobody will suspect of narrowness of mind, who, by a very
                    singular treatise, evinced that he was capable of thinking and of choosing for
                    himself, has left it on record that he devoted a great share of his time, from
                    the united motives of duty and delight, to the amusement of his children.</p>
                <p>“It will be objected by those who pretend to have formed their ideas of life from
                    actual observation, that domestic happiness, however pleasing in description,
                    like many a poetic dream, is but an alluring picture, designed by a good heart,
                    and painted in glowing colours by a lively fancy. The constant company, they
                    urge, even of those we love, occasions an insipidity. Insipidity grows into
                    disgust. Disgust long continued sours the temper. Peevishness is the natural
                    consequence. The domestic circle becomes the scene of dispute. Mutual antipathy
                    is ingenious in devising mutual torment. Sullen silence or malignant remarks
                    fill up every hour, till the arrival of a stranger causes a temporary restraint,
                    and excites that good humour which ought to be displayed among those whom the
                    bonds of affection and blood have already united.</p>
                <p>“Experience, indeed, proves that these remarks are sometimes verified. But that
                    there is much domestic misery is no argument that there is no domestic
                    happiness, or that the evil may not be removed. Natural stupidity, natural ill
                    temper, acquired ill habits, want of education, illiberal manners, and a neglect
                    of the common rules of discretion, will render every species of intercourse
                    disagreeable. When those are united by connubial ties who were separated by
                    natural and inherent diversity, no wonder if that degree of happiness which can
                    only result from a proper union is unknown. In the forced alliance which the
                    poet of Venusium mentions, of the serpent with the dove, of the tiger with the
                    lamb, there can be no love. When we expatiate on the happiness of the domestic
                    group, we presuppose that all who compose it are originally assimilated by
                    affection, and are still kept in union by discreet friendship. When this is not
                    the case, the censure must fall on the discordant disposition of the parties,
                    and not on the essential nature of family intercourse.</p>
                <p>“To form under the direction of prudence, and by the impulse of virtuous love, an
                    early conjugal attachment, is one of the best securities of virtue, as well as
                    the most probable means of happiness. The duties which are powerfully called
                    forth by the relations of husband and father, are of that tender kind which
                    inspires goodness and humanity. He who beholds a woman whom he loves, and a
                    helpless infant looking up to him for support, will not easily be induced to
                    indulge in unbecoming extravagance, or devote himself to indolence. He who has a
                    rising family to introduce into a vicious world, will be cautious of setting a
                    bad example, the contagion of which, when it proceeds from parental authority,
                    must be irresistibly malignant. Thus many who, in their individual and
                    unconnected state, would probably have spent a life not only useless to others,
                    but profligate and careless in itself, have become valuable members of the
                    community, and have arrived at a degree of moral improvement to which .they
                    would not otherwise have attained.</p>
                <p>“The contempt in which domestic pleasures have in modern times been held, is a
                    mark of profligacy. It is also a proof of a prevailing ignorance of real
                    enjoyment. It argues a defect in taste and judgment as well as in morals; for
                    the general voice of the experienced has in all ages declared, that the truest
                    happiness is to be found at home.”</p>
