                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    is a very pleasing and ingenious essay by Dr Barnes, in the Memoirs of the
                    Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester. It is introduced with the
                    following motto from Lucretius:</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N">Suave mari magno, turbantibus aequora ventis,</l>
                    <l part="N">Eterra alterius magnum spectare periclum.</l>

                    <l part="N">Sed quibus ipse malis careas, quia cernere suave est.</l>
                </lg>
                <p>“The pleasure here described by the poet, and of which he has mentioned so
                    striking and apposite an instance, may perhaps at first seem of so singular and
                    astonishing a nature, that some may be disposed to doubt of its existence. But
                    that it does exist in the case here referred to, and in many others of a similar
                    kind, is an undoubted fact; and it may not appear an useless or disagreeable
                    entertainment to trace its source in the human breast, together with the final
                    cause for which it was implanted there by our benevolent Creator.</p>
                <p>“Shall I, it maybe said, feel complacency in beholding a scene in which many of
                    my fellow-creatures are agonizing with terror, whilst I can neither diminish
                    their danger, nor, by my sympathy, divide their anguish? At the sight of
                    another’s woe, does not my bosom naturally feel pain? Do I not share in his
                    sensations? And is not this strong and exquisite sensibility intended by my
                    Maker to urge me on to active and immediate assistance? /These sensations arc
                    indeed attended with a noble pleasure, when I can, by friendly attention, or by
                    benevolent communication, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193323837"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-3837-0054"/>soothe the sorrows of the poor mourner, snatch him
                    from impending danger, or supply his pressing wants. But in general, where my
                    sympathy is of no avail to the wretched sufferer, I fly from the spectacle of
                    his misery, unable or unwilling to endure a pain which is not allayed by the
                    sweet satisfaction of doing good.”</p>
                <p>In answer to these objections, it will be necessary, in the first place to prove
                    the reality of the feeling, the cause of which, in the human constitution, many
                    have attempted to explore.</p>
                <p>Mr Addison, in his beautiful papers on the pleasures of the imagination, has
                    observed, “that objects or scenes, which, when real, give disgust or pain, in
                    description often become beautiful and agreeable. Thus, even a dunghill may, by
                    the charms of poetic imagery, excite pleasure and entertainment. Scenes of this
                    nature, dignified by apt and striking description, we regard with something of
                    the same feelings with which we look upon a dead monster.</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N">............. Informe cadaver</l>
                    <l part="N">Protrahitur: nequeunt expleri corda tuendo</l>

                </lg>
                <p>“This,” he observes, “is more particularly the case where the description raises
                    a ferment in the mind, and works with violence upon the passions. One would
                    wonder,” he adds, “how it comes to pass, that passions, which are very
                    unpleasant at all other times, are very agreeable when excited by proper
                    description; such as terror, dejection, grief, &amp;c. This pleasure arises from
                    the reflection we make upon ourselves, whilst reading it, that we are not in
                    danger from them. When we read of wounds, death, &amp;c. our pleasure does not
                    rise so properly from the grief which these melancholy descriptions give us, as
                    from the secret comparison we make of ourselves with those who suffer. We should
                    not feel the same kind of pleasure if we actually saw a person lying under the
                    tortures that we meet with in a description.”</p>
                <p>And yet, upon the principle assigned by this amiable writer, we might feel the
                    same, or even higher pleasure, from the actual view of distress, than from any
                    description; because the comparison of ourselves with the sufferer would be more
                    vivid, and consequently the feeling more intense. Wc would only observe, that
                    the cause which he assigns for this pleasure is the very same with that assigned
                    by Lucretius in our motto. Mr Addison applies it to the description, the poet to
                    the actual contemplation, of affecting scenes. In both, the pleasure is supposed
                    to originate in selfishness. But wherever the social passions are deeply
                    interested, as they arc here supposed to be, from the pathetic description, or
                    the still more pathetic survey, of the sufferings of another, the sympathetic
                    feelings will of themselves at once, and previously to all reflection, become a
                    source of agreeable and tender emotions. They will thus dignify and enhance the
                    satisfaction, if any such be felt, arising merely from the consideration of our
                    own personal security. And the more entirely we enter into the scene, by losing
                    all ideas of its being either past or fabulous—the more perfectly we forget
                    ourselves, and are absorbed in the feeling—the more exquisite is the
                    sensation.</p>
                <p>But as our subsequent speculations will chiefly turn upon the pleasure derived
                    from real scenes of calamity, and not from those which are imaginary, we may be
                    expected to produce instances in proof of the proposition that such pleasure is
                    actually felt by persons very different in their tastes and mental
                    cultivation.</p>
                <p>We shall not mention the horrid joy with which the savage feasts his eyes upon
                    the agonies and contortions of his dying prisoner, expiring in all the pains
                    which artificial cruelty can inflict. Nor will we recur to the almost equally
                    savage sons of ancient Rome, when the majesty of the Roman people could rush
                    with eagerness and transport to behold hundreds of gladiators contending in
                    fatal conflict, and probably more than half the number extended, weltering in
                    blood and writhing in agony upon the arena. Nor will we mention the Spanish bull
                    feasts; nor the fervent acclamations of an English mob around their fellow
                    creatures when engaged in furious battle, in which it is possible that some of
                    the combatants may receive a mortal blow, and be hurried into another world. Let
                    us survey the multitudes which in every part of the kingdom always attend an
                    execution. It may perhaps be said, that in every place the vulgar have little of
                    the sensibility and tenderness of more polished minds. But in the last-mentioned
                    instance, an execution, there is no exultation in the sufferings of the poor
                    criminal. He is regarded by every spectator with the most melting compassion.
                    The whole assembly sympathize with him in his unhappy situation; an awful
                    stillness prevails at the dreadful moment; many are wrung with unutterable
                    sensations; and prayer and silence declare, more loudly than any language could,
                    the interest they feel in his distress. Should a reprieve come to rescue him
                    from death, how great is the general triumph and congratulation. And probably in
                    this multitude you will find not the mere vulgar herd alone, but men of superior
                    knowledge and of more refined sensibility, who, led by some strong principle
                    which we wish to explain, feel a pleasure greater than all the pain, great and
                    exquisite as one should imagine it to be, in beholding such a spectacle.</p>
                <p>The man who condemns many of the scenes we have already mentioned as barbarous
                    and shocking, would probably run with the greatest eagerness to some high cliff
                    overhanging the ocean, to sec it swelled into a tempest, though a poor vessel,
                    or even a fleet of vessels, were to appear as one part of the dreadful scenery,
                    now lifted to the heavens on the foaming surge, now plunged deep into the
                    fathomless abyss, and now dashed upon the rocks, where they are in a moment
                    shivered into fragments, and, with all their mariners, entombed in the deep. Or,
                    to vary the question a little, who would not be forward to stand safe on the top
                    of some mountain or tower, adjoining to a field of battle, in which two armies
                    meet in desperate conflict, though probably thousands may soon lie before him
                    prostrate on the ground, and the whole field present the most horrid scenes of
                    carnage and desolation? That in all these cases pleasure predominates in the
                    compounded feeling is plain, because you continue to survey the scene; whereas,
                    when pain became the stronger sensation, you would certainly retire.</p>
                <p>Cultivation may indeed have produced some minuter differences in the taste and
                    feelings of different minds; and those whose sensibilities have not been refined
                    by education or science, may feel the pleasure in a more gross and brutal form.
                    But do not the most polished natures feel a similar, a kindred pleasure, in the
                    deep-wrought distresses of the well-imagined scene? Here the endeavour is to
                    introduce whatever is dreadful or pathetic, whatever can harrow up the feelings
                    or extort the tear. And the deeper and more tragical the scene becomes, the more
                    it agitates the several passions of terror, grief, or pity, the more intensely
                    it delights even the most polished minds. They seem to enjoy the various and
                    vivid emotions of contending passions. They love to have the tear trembling in
                    the eye, and to feel the whole soul as it were rapt in thrilling sensations. For
                    that moment they seem to forget the fiction; and afterwards commend that
                    exhibition most in which they most entirely lost sight of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193323850" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3850-0055"/>author and of their own
                    situation, and were alive to all the unutterable vibrations of strong or melting
                    sensibility.</p>
                <p>Taking it then for granted, that in the contemplation of many scenes of distress,
                    both imaginary and real, a gratification is felt, let us endeavour to account
                    for it by mentioning some of those principles, interwoven into the web of human
                    nature by its benevolent Creator, on which that gratification depends.</p>
                <p>Dr Akenside, in one of the most striking passages of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pleasures of the Imagination,</hi> has endeavoured to show that the sympathetic
                    feelings are virtuous, and therefore pleasant; and from the whole he deduces
                    this important conclusion, that every virtuous emotion must be agreeable, and
                    that this is the sanction and the reward of virtue. The thought is amiable, and
                    the conclusion noble; but still the solution appears to us to be imperfect. We
                    have already said, that the pleasure arising from the contemplation of
                    distressful scenes is a compounded feeling arising from several distinct sources
                    in the human breast. The kind and degree of the sensation must depend upon the
                    various blendings of the several ingredients which enter into the composition.
                    The cause assigned by Mr Addison, namely, the sense of our own security, may be
                    supposed to have some share in the mass of feelings. That of Dr Akenside may be
                    allowed to have a still larger proportion. Let us attempt to trace some of the
                    rest.</p>
                <p>There arc few principles in human nature of more general and important influence
                    than that of sympathy. An ingenious writer, led by the fashionable idea of
                    simplifying all the springs of human nature into one source, has, in his
                    beautiful Theory of Moral Sentiments, endeavoured to analyze a very large number
                    of the feelings of the heart into sympathetic vibration. Though it appears to us
                    most probable that the human mind, like the human body, possesses various and
                    distinct springs of action and of happiness, yet he has shown, in an amazing
                    diversity of instances, the operation and importance of this principle of human
                    nature.</p>
                <p>We naturally sympathize with the passions of others. But if the passions which
                    they appear to feel be not those of mere distress alone; if, amidst the scenes
                    of calamity, they display fortitude, generosity, and forgiveness; if “rising
                    superior to the cloud of ills which covers them,” they stand firm, collected,
                    and patient; a still higher source of pleasure opens upon us, arising from
                    complacent admiration, and that unutterable sympathy which the heart feels with
                    virtuous and heroic minds. By the operation of this principle, we place
                    ourselves in their situation; we feel, as it were, some share of that conscious
                    integrity and peace which they must enjoy. Hence, as was before observed, the
                    pleasure will vary, both as to its nature and degree, according to the scene and
                    characters before us. The shock of contending armies in the field; the ocean
                    wrought to tempest, and covered with the wrecks of shattered vessels; and a
                    worthy family silently yet nobly bearing up against a multitude of surrounding
                    sorrows; will excite very different emotions, because the component parts of the
                    pleasurable sensation consist of very different materials. They all excite
                    admiration; but admiration diversified both as to its degree and its cause.
                    These several ingredients may doubtless be so blended together that the pleasure
                    shall make but a very small part of the mixed sensation. The more agreeable
                    tints may bear little proportion to the terrifying red or the gloomy black.</p>
                <p>In many of the instances which have been mentioned, the pleasure must arise
                    chiefly, if not solely, from the circumstances or accompaniments of the scene.
                    The sublime feelings excited by the view of an agitated ocean, relieve and
                    soften those occasioned by the shipwreck: and the awe excited by the presence of
                    thousands of men, acting as if with one soul, and displaying magnanimity and
                    firmness in the most solemn trial, tempers those sensations of horror and of
                    pain which would arise from a view of the field of battle.</p>
                <p>The gratification we are attempting to account for depends also, in a very
                    considerable degree, upon a principle of human nature, implanted in it for the
                    wisest ends; the exercise which it gives to the mind by rousing it to energy and
                    feeling. Nothing is so insupportable as that languor and ennui, for the full
                    expression of which our language does not afford a proper term. To show how
                    agreeable it is to have the soul called forth to exertion and sensibility, we
                    may cite the case of the gamester, who, unable to endure the lassitude and
                    sameness of unanimated luxury, runs with eagerness to the place where probably
                    there await him all the irritation and agony of the most tumultuous
                    passions.</p>
                <p>Again, it is,a law in our nature, that opposite passions, when felt in
                    succession, and, above all, when felt at the same moment, heighten and increase
                    each other. Ease succeeding pain, certainty after suspense, friendship after
                    aversion, are unspeakably stronger than if they had not been thus contrasted. In
                    this conflict of feelings, the mind rises from passive to active energy. It is
                    roused to intense sensation; and it enjoys that peculiar, exquisite, and complex
                    feeling, in which, as in many articles of our table, the acid and the sweet, the
                    pleasurable and painful pungencies, are so happily mixed together, as to render
                    the united sensation amazingly more strong; and delightful.</p>
                <p>We have not yet mentioned the principle of curiosity, that busy and active power,
                    which appears so early, continues unimpaired so long, and to which, for the
                    wisest ends, is annexed so great a sense of enjoyment. To this principle, rather
                    than to a love of cruelty, we would ascribe that pleasure which children
                    sometimes seem to feel from torturing flies and lesser animals. They have not
                    yet formed an idea of the pain which they inflict. It is indeed of unspeakable
                    consequence that this practice should be checked as soon and as effectually as
                    possible, because it is so important that they should learn to connect the ideas
                    of pleasure and pain with the motions and actions of the animal creation. And to
                    this principle may we also refer no small share of that pleasure in the
                    contemplation of distressful scenes, the springs of which, in the human heart,
                    we are now endeavouring to unfold.</p>
                <p>To curiosity, then, to sympathy, to mental exertion, to the idea of our own
                    security, and to the strong feelings occasioned by viewing the actions and
                    passions of mankind in interesting situations, do we ascribe the gratification
                    which the mind feels from the survey of many scenes of sorrow. We have called it
                    <hi rend="italic">a pleasure;</hi> but it approaches towards or recedes from
                    pleasure, according to the nature and proportion of the ingredients of which the
                    sensation is composed. In some cases pain predominates; in others there is
                    exquisite enjoyment.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Distress,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Law,</hi> the seizing or
                    distraining of any thing for rent in arrear, or other duty unperformed.</p>
                <p>The effect of this distress is to compel the party either to replevy the things
                    distrained, and contest the taking in an action of trespass against the
                    distrainer; or rather to oblige him to compound and pay the debt or duty for
                    which he was so distrained.</p>
                <p>There are likewise compulsory distresses in actions to cause a person to appear
                    in court, of which kind there is a distress personal of one’s moveable goods,
                    and the profits of his lands, for contempt in not appearing after summons; and
                    there is likewise real distress of a person’s immoveable goods. In these cases
                    none shall be distrained to answer<pb break="no" facs="nls:193323863"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-3863-0056"/> for any thing touching their freeholds, except by
                    the king’s writ.</p>
                <p>Distress may be either finite or infinite. Finite distress is that which is
                    limited by law, in regard to the number of times it shall be made, in order to
                    bring the party to a trial of the action. Infinite distress is that which is
                    without any limitation, being made till the person appear; it is further applied
                    to jurors who do not appear; as, upon a certificate of assize, the process is
                    <hi rend="italic">venire facias, habeas corpora,</hi> and distress infinite.</p>
                <p>It is also divided into grand distress and ordinary distress. Of these, the
                    former extends to all the goods and chattels which the party has within the
                    county. A person, of common right, may distrain for rents and for all manner of
                    services, and where a rent is reserved on a gift in tail, lease for life, or
                    years, &amp;c. though there be no clause of distress in the grant or lease, so
                    as that he has the reversion; but on a feoffment made in fee, a distress may not
                    be taken, unless it be expressly reserved in the deed.</p>
