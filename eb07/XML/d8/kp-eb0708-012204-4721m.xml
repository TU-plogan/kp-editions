                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    >Music,</hi> a name given by Rameau to the two different modes in which the
                    chord of the sub-dominant may be regarded and treated, namely, as the
                    fundamental chord of the sixth superadded, or as the chord of the great sixth,
                    inverted from a fundamental chord of the seventh. In reality the chords carry
                    exactly the same notes, are figured in the same manner, and are employed upon
                    the same chord of the tone, in such a manner that frequently we cannot discern
                    which of the two chords the author employs, except by the assistance of the
                    subsequent chord, which resolves it, and which is different in these different
                    cases.</p>
                <p>To make this distinction, we must consider the diatonic progress of the two notes
                    which form the fifth and the sixth, and which, constituting between them the
                    interval of a second, must one or the other constitute the dissonance of the
                    chord. Now this progress is determined by the motion of the bass. Of these two
                    notes, then, if the superior be the dissonance, it will rise by one gradation
                    into the subsequent chord, the lower note will keep its place, and the higher
                    note will be a superadded sixth. If the lower be the dissonance, it will descend
                    into the subsequent chord, the higher will remain in its place, and the chord
                    will be that of the great sixth.</p>
                <p>With respect to the composer, the use which he may make of the double employment
                    is to consider the chord in its different points of view, that he may thence
                    know how to make his entrance to it, and his exit from it; so that having, for
                    instance, arrived at the chord of the superadded sixth, he may resolve it as a
                    chord of the great sixth, and reciprocally.</p>
                <p>D’Alembert has shown that one of the chief uses of the double employment is, that
                    we may be able to carry the diatonic succession of the gamut even to an octave,
                    without changing the mode, at least whilst we rise; for in descending we must
                    change it. Of this gamut, and its fundamental bass, an example will be found in
                    Rousseau’s <hi rend="italic">Musical Dictionary.</hi> It is evident, according
                    to the system of Rameau, that all the harmonic successions which result from it
                    are in the same tone; for, in strictness, no other chords are there employed but
                    three, namely, that of the tonic, that of the dominant, and that of the
                    sub-dominant; which last, in the double employment, constitutes the seventh from
                    the second note, and is employed upon the sixth.</p>
                <p>With respect to what D’Alembert says in his <hi rend="italic">Elements of
                    Music</hi> (p. 70), and repeats in the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie</hi>
                    (article <hi rend="italic">Double</hi><hi rend="italic">Emploi),</hi> that the
                    chord of the seventh <hi rend="italic">re fa la ut,</hi> though we should even
                    regard it only as an inversion of <hi rend="italic">fit la ut re,</hi> cannot be
                    followed by the chord <hi rend="italic">ut mi sol ut,</hi> Rousseau declares, “I
                    cannot be of his opinion in this point.” The proof which he gives in support of
                    this dissent is, that the dissonance <hi rend="italic">ut</hi> of the first
                    cannot be resolved in the second. And this is true, since it remains in its
                    place; but in the chord of the seventh, <hi rend="italic">re fa la ut,</hi>
                    inverted from the chord of the superadded sixth, <hi rend="italic">fa la ut
                    re,</hi> it is not the <hi rend="italic">ut,</hi> but the <hi rend="italic"
                    >re,</hi> which is the dissonance; and consequently it ought to be resolved in
                    ascending upon <hi rend="italic">mi,</hi> as it really does in the subsequent
                    chord; so that this procedure in the bass itself is forced, which, from <hi
                    rend="italic">re,</hi> cannot without an error return to <hi rend="italic"
                    >ut,</hi> but ought to ascend to wtι, in order to resolve the dissonance.</p>
                <p>D’Alembert afterwards shows that this chord <hi rend="italic">re fa la ut,</hi>
                    when preceded and followed by that of the tonic, cannot be authorized by the
                    double employment; and this is likewise true; because, in fact, this chord,
                    though figured with a 7, is not treated as a chord of the seventh, neither when
                    we make our entrance to it nor our exit from it; or at least that it is not
                    necessary to treat it as such, but simply as an inversion of the superadded
                    sixth, of which the dissonance is the bass; in which case we ought by no means
                    to forget that this dissonance is never prepared. Thus, though in such a
                    transition the double employment is not in question, and though the chord of the
                    seventh be no more than apparent, and impossible to be resolved by the rules,
                    this does not hinder the transition from being proper and regular.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193324734" xml:id="kp-eb0708-4734-0123"/>
                <p>This inversion of the chord of the sixth superadded, which transfers the
                    dissonance to the bass, has been censured by Rameau, who, taking it for a
                    fundamental chord, the chord of the seventh, which results from it, rather chose
                    to make the fundamental bass descend diatonically, and resolve one seventh by
                    another, than to unfold this seventh by an inversion. But Rousseau has
                    dissipated this error, and many others, in some papers which long ago passed
                    into the hands of D’Alembert when he was composing his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elements of Music.</hi> In other respects, the double employment cannot be used
                    with too much reserve, and the greatest masters are the most temperate in
                    putting it in practice.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Double</hi><hi rend="italic">Fichy,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Piche,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Heraldry,</hi> the denomination
                    of a cross, when the extremity has two points; in contradistinction to fiché,
                    where the extremity is sharpened away to one point.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Double</hi><hi rend="italic">Octave,</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">Music,</hi> an interval composed of fifteen notes in diatonic
                    progression, and which, for that reason, is called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >fifteenth.</hi> It is, says Rousseau, an interval composed of two octaves,
                    called by the Greeks, <hi rend="italic">disdiapason.</hi></p>
                <p>It deserves, however, to be remarked, that in intervals less distant and
                    compounded, as in the <hi rend="italic">third,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fifth,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">simple octave,</hi> and so on, the lowest and
                    highest extremes are included in the number from whence the interval takes its
                    name. But, in the <hi rend="italic">double octave,</hi> when termed a fifteenth,
                    the simple number of which it is composed gives the name. This is by no means
                    analogical, and may occasion some confusion. We should rather choose, therefore,
                    to run any hazard which might occur from uniformly including all the terms of
                    which the component intervals consist, and call the <hi rend="italic"
                    >double</hi> octave a sixteenth, according to the general analogy.</p>
