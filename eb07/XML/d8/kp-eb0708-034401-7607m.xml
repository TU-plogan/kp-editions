                <p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> name marks that department of
                    physicomathematical science which contains the abstract doctrine of <hi
                    rend="italic">movingforces</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that is, whatever
                    necessarily results from the relations of our ideas of motion, and of the
                    immediate causes of its production and changes.</p>
                <p>2. All <hi rend="italic">changes</hi> of motion are considered by us as the
                    indications, the characteristics, and the measures of changing causes. This is a
                    physical law of human thought, and therefore a principle to which we may refer,
                    and from which we must derive all our knowledge of those causes. When we appeal
                    to our own thoughts or feelings, we do not find in ourselves any disposition to
                    refer mere existence to any cause, although the beginning of existence certainly
                    produces this reference in an instant. Had we always observed the universe in
                    motion, it does not appear that we should have ascribed it to a cause, till the
                    observation of relative rest, or something leading to it, had enabled us to
                    separate, by abstraction, the notion of matter from that of motion. We might
                    then perceive that rest is not incompatible with matter; and we might even
                    observe, by means of relative, motions, that absolute rest might be produced by
                    the concourse of equal and opposite motions. But all this requires reflection
                    and reasoning, whereas we are now speaking of the first suggestions of our
                    minds.</p>
                <p>3. We cannot have any notion of motion <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >abstracto,</hi> without considering it as a state or condition of existence
                    which would remain if not changed by some cause. It is from changes alone,
                    therefore, that we infer any agency in nature; and it is in these that we are to
                    find all that we know of their causes.</p>
                <p>4. When we look around us, we cannot but observe that the motions of bodies have
                    in most cases, if not always, some relation to the situation, the distance, and
                    the discriminating qualities of other bodies. The motions of the moon have a
                    palpable relation to the earth; the motions of the tides have as evident a
                    relation to the moon; the motions of a piece of iron have a palpable dependence
                    on a magnet. The vicinity of the one seems to be the occasion at least of the
                    motions of the other. The causes of these motions have an evident connection
                    with or dependence on the other body. We are even disposed to imagine that they
                    are inherent in that body, and that it possesses certain qualities which are the
                    causes of those modifications of motion in other bodies. These serve to
                    distinguish some bodies from others, and may therefore be called <hi
                    rend="italic">properties</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and since the condition of
                    other bodies so evidently depends on them, these properties express very
                    interesting relations of bodies, and are chiefly attended to in the enumeration
                    of the circumstances which ascertain what we call the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nature</hi> of any thing. We do not mean to say that these inferences are
                    always just; nay, we know that many of them are ill founded; but they are real,
                    and they serve abundantly for informing us what we may expect from any proposed
                    Situation of things. It is enough for us to know, that when a piece of iron is
                    so and so situated in relation to a magnet, it will move in a certain
                    manner.</p>
                <p>This mutual relation of bodies is differently considered, according to the
                    interest that we chance to take in the phenomenon. The cause of the approach of
                    the iron to a magnet is generally ascribed to the magnet, which is said to
                    attract the iron, because we commonly employ the magnet in order that these
                    motions may take place. The similar approach of a stone to the earth is ascribed
                    to the stone, and we say that it tends to the earth. In all probability the
                    procedure of nature is the same in both; for: they are observed in every
                    instance to be mutual between the related bodies. As iron approaches a magnet,
                    so the magnet approaches the iron. The same thing is observed in the motions of
                    electrified bodies; also in the case of the stone and the earth. Therefore the
                    cause of the motions may be conceived as inherent in either, or in both.</p>
                <p>The qualities thus inherent in bodies constituting their mechanical relations,
                    have been called the <hi rend="italic">mechanical af-. feetions of matter.</hi>
                    But they are more commonly named <hi rend="italic">powers</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">forces</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the event which indicates
                    their presence is considered as the effect and mark of their agency. The magnet
                    is said to <hi rend="italic">act</hi> on the iron, the earth is said to <hi
                    rend="italic">act</hi> on the stone; and the iron and the stone are said to <hi
                    rend="italic">act</hi> on the magnet and on the earth.</p>
                <p>All this is figurative or metaphorical language. All languages have begun with
                    social union, and have improved along with it. The first collections of words
                    expressed the most familiar and the most interesting notions. In the process of
                    social improvement, the number of words did not increase in the same proportion
                    with the notions that became interesting and familiar in their turn: for it
                    often happened that relations, of certain ideas so much resembled the relations
                    of certain other ideas, that the word expressing one of them served very well
                    for expressing the other; because the dissimilar circumstances of the two cases
                    prevented all chance of mistake. Thus we are said to <hi rend="italic"
                    >surmount</hi> a difficulty, without attaching to the word the notion of <hi
                    rend="italic">getting over</hi> a steep hill. Languages are thus filled with
                    figurative expressions.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Power, Force,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Action,</hi> are
                    words which must have appeared in the language of the most simple people;
                    because the notions of personal ability, strength, and exertion, are at once the
                    most familiar and the most interesting that can have a place in the human mind.
                    These terms, when used in their pure, primitive sense, express the notions of
                    the power, force, and action of a sentient, active being. Such a being only is
                    an agent. The exertion of his power or force is (exclusively) action; but the
                    relation of cause and effect so much resembles in its results the relation
                    between this force and the work performed, that the same term may be very
                    intelligibly employed for both. Perhaps the only case of pure unfigurative
                    action is that of the mind on the body. But as this is always with the design of
                    producing some change on external bodies, we think only of them; the instrument
                    or tool is overlooked, and we say that we act on the external body. Our <hi
                    rend="italic">real</hi> action therefore is but the first movement in a long
                    train of successive events, and is but the remote cause of the interesting
                    event. The resemblance to such actions is very strong indeed in many cases of
                    mechanical phenomena. A man throws a ball by the motion of his arm. A spring
                    impels a ball in the same manner by unbending. These two events resemble each
                    other in every circumstance but the action of the mind on the corporeal organ;
                    the rest of it is a train of pure mechanism. In general, because the ultimate
                    results of the mutual influence of bodies on each other greatly resemble the
                    ultimate results of our actions on bodies, we have not invented appropriated
                    terms, but have contented ourselves with those already employed for expressing
                    our own actions, the exertions of our own powers or forces. The relation of
                    physical cause and effect is expressed metaphorically in the words which belong
                    properly to the relation of agent and action. This has been attended by the
                    usual consequences of poverty <pb break="no" facs="nls:193327620"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-7620-0345"/>of language, namely, ambiguity, and sometimes
                    mistake, both in our reflections (which are generally carried on by mental
                    discourse), our reasonings, and our conclusions. It is necessary to be on our
                    guard against such mistakes; for they frequently amount to the confounding of
                    things totally different. Many philosophers of great reputation, on no better
                    foundation than this metaphorical language, have confounded the relations of
                    activity and of causation, and even denied that there is any difference; and
                    they have affirmed that there is the same invariable relation between the
                    determinations of the will and the inducements that prompt them, as there is
                    between any physical power and its effect. Others have maintained that the first
                    mover in the mechanical operations, and indeed through the whole train of any
                    complicated event, is a percipient and intending principle, in the same manner
                    as in our actions. According to these philosophers, a particle of gravitating
                    matter perceives its relation to every other particle in the universe, and
                    determines its own motion according to fixed laws, in exact conformity to its
                    situation. But the language, and even the actions of all men, show that they
                    have a notion of the relation of an agent to the action, easily distinguishable
                    (because all distinguish it) from the relation between the physical cause and
                    its effect. This metaphorical language has affected the doctrines of mechanical
                    philosophy, and has produced a dispute about some of its first principles; the
                    only way to decide this dispute is to avoid most scrupulously all metaphorical
                    language, though at the expense of much circumlocution.</p>
                <p>6. When we speak of powers or forces as residing in a body, and the effect as
                    produced by their exertion, the body, considered as possessing the power, is
                    said to <hi rend="italic">act</hi> on the other. A magnet is said to act on a
                    piece of iron; a billiard ball in motion is said to act on one that is hit by
                    it; but if we attempt to fix our attention on this action, as distinct both from
                    the agent and the thing acted on, we find no object of contemplation; the
                    exertion or procedure of nature in producing the effect does not come under our
                    view. When we <hi rend="italic">speah</hi> of the action as distinct from the
                    agent, we find that it is not the action, properly speaking, but the act, that
                    we speak of. In like manner the action of a mechanical power can be conceived
                    only in the effect produced.</p>
                <p>7. A man is not said to act unless he produces some effect. Thought is the act of
                    the thinking principle; motion of the limb is the act of the mind on it. In
                    mechanics also, there is action only in so far as there is mechanical effect
                    produced. I must act violently in order to begin motion on a slide. I must exert
                    force, and this force exerted produces motion. I conceive the production of
                    motion in all cases as the exertion of force; but it requires no exertion to
                    continue the motion along the slide; I am conscious of none; therefore I ought
                    to infer that no force is necessary for the continuation of any motion. The
                    continuation of motion is not the production of any new effect, but the
                    permanency of an effect already produced. We indeed consider motion as the
                    effect of an action; but there would be no effect if the body were not moving.
                    Motion is not the action, but the effect of the action.</p>
                <p>8. Mechanical actions have been usually classed under two heads. They are either
                    <hi rend="italic">pressures</hi> or <hi rend="italic">impulsions.</hi> They are
                    generally considered as of different kinds—the exertions of different powers.
                    <hi rend="italic">Pressure</hi> is supposed to differ essentially from <hi
                    rend="italic">impulse.</hi></p>
                <p>Instead of attempting to define, or describe, these two kinds of forces and
                    actions, we shall just mention some instances. This will give us all the
                    knowledge of their distinctions that we can acquire.</p>
                <p>When a ball lies on a table, and 1 press it gently on one side, it moves toward
                    the other side of the table. If I follow it with my finger, continuing my
                    pressure, it accelerates i continually in its motion. In like manner, when I
                    press' on the handle of a common kitchen jack, the fly to move. If I continue to
                    urge or press round the handle, the fly accelerates continually, and may be
                    brought into a state of very rapid motion. These motions are the effects of
                    genuine pressure. The ball would be urged along the table in the same manner,
                    and with a motion continually accelerated, by the unbending of a spring. Also, a
                    spring coiled up round the axis of the handle of the jack would, by uncoiling
                    itself, urge round the fly with a motion accelerating in the same way. The more
                    1 reflect on the pressure of my finger on the ball, and compare it with the
                    effect of the spring on it, the more clearly do I see the perfect similarity;
                    and I call these influences, exertions, or actions, by one name, <hi
                    rend="italic">pressure,</hi> taken from the most familiar instance of them.</p>
                <p>Again, the very same motion may be produced in the ball or fly, by pulling the
                    ball or the machine by means of a thread, to which a weight is suspended. As
                    both are motions accelerated in the same manner, I call the influence or action
                    of the thread on the ball or machine by the same name, <hi rend="italic"
                    >pressure,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">τveight</hi> is considered as a pressing
                    power. Indeed I feel the same compression from the real pressure of a man on my
                    shoulders that I would feel from a load laid on them. But the weight in our
                    example is acting by the intervention of the thread. By its pressure it is
                    pulling at that part of the thread to which it is fastened; this part is pulling
                    at the next by means of the force of cohesion; and this pulls at a third, and so
                    on, till the most remote pulls at the ball or the machine. Thus may elasticity,
                    weight, cohesion, and other forces, perform the office of a genuine power; and
                    since their result is always a motion beginning from nothing, and accelerating
                    by perceptible degrees to any velocity, this resemblance makes us call them by
                    one familiar name.</p>
                <p>But further, I see that if the thread be cut, the weight will fall with an
                    accelerated motion, which will increase to any degree, if the fall be great
                    enough. I ascribe this also to a pressing power acting on the weight. Nay, after
                    a very little refinement, I consider this power as the cause of the body’s
                    weight; which word is but a distinguishing name for this particular instance of
                    pressing power. Gravitation is therefore added to the list of pressures; and for
                    similar reasons the attractions and repulsions of magnets or electric bodies may
                    be added to the list; for they produce actual compressions of bodies placed
                    between them, and they produce motions gradually accelerated, precisely as
                    gravitation does. Therefore all these powers may be distinguished by this
                    descriptive name, <hi rend="italic">pressures,</hi> which, in strict language,
                    belongs to one of them only.</p>
                <p>Several writers, however, subdivide this great class into ∣ pressions and
                    solicitations. Gravity is a solicitation <hi rend="italic">abi extra,</hi> by
                    which a body is urged downward. In like man- <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> ner
                    the forces of magnetism and electricity, and a vast variety of other attractions
                    and repulsions, are called <hi rend="italic">solici- . tations.</hi> We see
                    little use for this distinction, and the. term is too like an affection of
                    mind.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Impulsion</hi> is exhibited when a ball in motion puts
                    another ball into motion by hitting, or (to speak metapho- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> rically) by striking it. The appearances here are
                    very <hi rend="superscript">:</hi> different. The body that is struck acquires,
                    in the instant of impulse, a sensible quantity of motion, and sometimes a very
                    rapid motion. This motion is neither accelerated nor retarded after the stroke,
                    unless it be affected by some other force. It is also remarked that the rapidity
                    of the motion depends, <hi rend="italic">inter alia,</hi> on the previous
                    velocity of the striking body. For instance, if a clay ball, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193327633" xml:id="kp-eb0708-7633-0346"/>moving with any velocity,
                    strike another equal ball which is at rest, the struck ball moves with half the
                    velocity of the other. And it is farther remarkable that the striking body
                    always loses as much motion as the struck body gains. This universal and
                    remarkable fact seems to have given rise to a confused or indistinct notion of a
                    sort of transference of motion from one body to another. The phraseology in
                    general use on this subject expresses this in the most precise terms. The one
                    ball is not said to cause or produce motion in the other, but to <hi
                    rend="italic">communicate</hi> motion to it; and the whole phenomenon is called
                    the <hi rend="italic">communication of motion.</hi> We call this an <hi
                    rend="italic">indistinct</hi> notion; for surely no one will say that he has any
                    clear conception of it. We can form the most distinct notion of the
                    communication of heat, or of the cause of heat; of the communication of
                    saltness, sweetness, and a thousand other <hi rend="italic">things;</hi> but we
                    cannot conceive how part of that identical motion which was formerly in A, is
                    now infused into B, being given up by A. It is in our attempt to form this
                    notion that we find that motion is not a <hi rend="italic">thing,</hi> not a
                    substance which can exist independently, and is susceptible of actual
                    transference. It appears in this case to be a state, or condition, or mode of
                    existence, of which bodies are susceptible, which is producible, or (to speak
                    without metaphor) causable, in bodies, and which is the effect and <hi
                    rend="italic">characteristic</hi> of <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> natural
                    qualities, properties, or powers. We are anxious to have our readers impressed
                    with clear and precise notions on this subject, being confident that such, and
                    only such, will carry them through some intricate paths of mechanical and
                    philosophical research.</p>
                <p>10. The remarkable circumstance in this phenomenon is, that a rapid motion, which
                    requires for the effecting it the action of a pressing power, continued for a
                    sensible, and frequently a long time, seems to be affected in an instant by
                    impulsion. This has tended much to support the notion of the actual transference
                    of something formerly possessed exclusively by „the striking body, inhering in
                    it, but separable, and now transfused into the body stricken. And now room is
                    found for the employment of metaphor, both in thought and language. The <hi
                    rend="italic">striking</hi> body affects the body which it thus impels: it
                    therefore possesses the <hi rend="italic">power</hi> of impulsion, that is, of
                    <hi rend="italic">communicating</hi> motion. It possesses it only while it is in
                    motion. This <hi rend="italic">power,</hi> therefore, is the efficient
                    distinguishing cause of its motion, and its only office must be the continuation
                    of this motion. It is therefore called the <hi rend="italic">inherent
                    force,</hi> the force inherent in a moving body, vis <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >insita</hi><hi rend="italic">corpori moto.</hi> This force is transfused into
                    the body impelled; and <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> the transference is
                    instantaneous, and the impelled body continues its motion till it is changed by
                    some other action. All this is at first sight very plausible; but a scrupulous
                    attention to those feelings which have given rise to this metaphorical
                    conception should have produced very different notions. I am conscious of
                    exertion in order to begin motion on a slide; but if the ice be very smooth, I
                    am conscious of no exertion in order to slide along. My power is felt only while
                    I am conscious of exerting it; therefore I have no primitive feeling or notion
                    of power while I am sliding along. I am certain that no exertion of power is
                    necessary here. Nay, I find that I cannot think of my moving forward without
                    effort otherwise than as a certain mode of my existence. Yet we imagine that the
                    partizans of this opinion did really deduce it in some shape from their
                    feelings. We must continue the <hi rend="italic">exertion</hi> of walking in
                    order to walk on; our power of walking must be continually exerted, otherwise we
                    shall stop. But this is a very imperfect, incomplete, and careless observation.
                    Walking is much more than mere continuance in progressive motion. It is a
                    continually repeated lifting our body up a small height, and al- ’ lowing it to
                    come down again. This renewed ascent requires repeated exertion.</p>
                <p>11. We have other observations of importance yet to make on this force of moving
                    bodies, but this is not the ' most proper occasion. Meanwhile we must remark,
                    that the instantaneous production of rapid motion by impulse has induced the
                    first mechanicians of Europe to maintain that the power or force of impulse is
                    unsusceptible of any comparison with a pressing power. They have asserted that
                    impulse is infinitely great when compared with pressure; not recollecting that
                    they held them to be things totally disparate, that have no proportion more than
                    weight and sweetness. But these gentlemen are perpetually enticed away from
                    their creed by the similarity of the ultimate results of pressure and impulse.
                    No person can find any difference between the motion of two balls moving equally
                    swift, in the same direction, one of which is descending by gravity, and the
                    other has derived its motion from a blow. This struggle of the mind to maintain
                    its faith, and yet accommodate its doctrines to what we see, has occasioned some
                    other curious forms of expression. Pressure is considered as an <hi
                    rend="italic">effort</hi> to produce motion. When a ball lies on a table, its
                    weight, which they call <hi rend="italic">a power,</hi> continually and
                    repeatedly <hi rend="italic">endeavours</hi> (mark the metaphorical word and
                    thought) to move the ball downward. But these efforts are ineffectual. They say
                    that this ineffectual power is <hi rend="italic">dead,</hi> and call it a <hi
                    rend="italic">vis</hi><hi rend="italic">mortua</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> but
                    the force of impulsion is called a <hi rend="italic">vis viva,</hi> a living
                    force. But this is very whimsical and very inaccurate. If the impelling ball
                    falls perpendicularly on the other lying on the table, it will produce no
                    motion, any more than gravity will; and if the table be annihilated, gravity
                    becomes a <hi rend="italic">vis viva.</hi></p>
                <p>We must now add, that in order to prove that impulse is infinitely greater than
                    pressure, these mechanicians turn our attention to many familiar facts which
                    plead strongly in their favour. A carpenter will drive a nail into a board with
                    a very moderate blow of his hammer. This will require a pressure which seems
                    many hundred times greater than the impelling effort of the carpenter. A very
                    moderate blow will shiver into pieces a diamond which would carry the weight of
                    a mountain. Seeing this prodigious superiority in the impulse, how shall they
                    account for the production of motion by means of pressure; for this motion of
                    the hammer might have been acquired by its falling from a height; nay, it is
                    actually acquired by means of the’continued pressure of the carpenter’s arm.
                    They consider it as the aggregate of an infinity of succeeding pressures in <hi
                    rend="italic">every</hi> instant of its continuance; so that the insignificant
                    smallness of each effort is compensated by their inconceivable number.</p>
                <p>On the whole, we do not think that there is clear evidence that there are two
                    kinds of mechanical force essentially different in their nature. It is virtually
                    given up by those who say that impulse is infinitely greater than pressure. Nor
                    is there any considerable advantage to be obtained by arranging the phenomenon
                    under those two heads. We may perhaps find some method of explaining
                    satisfactorily the remarkable difference that is really observed in the two
                    modes of producing motion; namely, the gradual production of motion by
                    acknowledged pressure, and the instantaneous production of it by impulse. Indeed
                    we should not have taken up so much of our readers’ attention with this subject,
                    had it not been for some inferences that have been made from these premises,
                    which meet us in our very entry on the consideration of first principles, and
                    that are of extensive influence on the whole science of mechanical philosophy,
                    and, indeed, on the whole study of nature.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193327646" xml:id="kp-eb0708-7646-0347"/>
                <p>12. Mechanicians are greatly divided in their opinion about the nature of the
                    sole moving force in nature. Those whom we are now speaking of seem to think
                    that all motion is produced by pressure; for when they consider impulse as
                    equivalent to the aggregate of an infinity of repeated pressures, they
                    undoubtedly suppose any pressure, however insignificant, as a moving force. But
                    there is a party, both numerous and respectable, who maintain that impulsion is
                    the sole cause of motion. We see bodies in motion, say they, and we see them
                    impel others; and we see that this production of motion is regulated by such
                    laws, that there is but one absolute quantity of motion in the universe which
                    remains unalterably the same. It must therefore be transfused in the acts of
                    collision. We also see, with clear evidence, in some cases, that motion can
                    produce pressure. Euler adduces some very whimsical and complicated cases, in
                    which an action precisely similar to pressure may be produced by motion. Thus,
                    two balls connected by a thread may be so struck that they shall move forward,
                    and at the same time wheel round. In this case the connecting thread will be
                    stretched between them. Now, say the philosophers, since we see motion, and see
                    that pressure may be produced by motion, it is preposterous to imagine that it
                    is any thing else than a result of certain motions; and it is the business of a
                    philosopher to inquire and discover what motions produce the pressures that we
                    observe.</p>
                <p>They then proceed to account for those pressing powers, or solicitations to
                    motion, which we observe in the acceleration of falling bodies, the attractions
                    of magnetism and electricity, and many other phenomena of this kind, where
                    bodies are put in motion by the vicinity of other bodies, or, in the popular
                    language, by the action of other bodies at a distance. To say that a magnet can
                    act on a piece of remote iron, is to say that it can act <hi rend="italic"
                    >where</hi> it is not, which is as absurd as to say that it can act <hi
                    rend="italic">when</hi> it is not. <hi rend="italic">Nihil</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >movetur,</hi> says Euler, <hi rend="italic">nisi</hi><hi rend="italic">a
                    contiguo</hi><hi rend="italic">et moto.</hi></p>
                <p>The bulk of these philosophers are not very anxious about the way in which these
                    motions are produced, nor do they fall upon such ingenious methods of producing
                    pressure as the one already mentioned, which was adduced by Euler. The piece of
                    iron, say they, is put in motion when brought into the neighbourhood of a
                    magnet, because there is a stream of fluid issuing from one pole of the magnet,
                    which circles round the magnet, and enters at the other pole. This stream impels
                    the iron, and arranges it in certain determined positions, just as a stream of
                    water would arrange the flote grass. In the same manner, there is a stream of
                    fluid continually moving towards the centre of the earth, which impels all
                    bodies in lines perpendicular to the surface; and so on with regard to other
                    like phenomena. These motions are thus reduced to very simple cases by
                    impulsion.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary to refute this doctrine at present: it is enough that it is
                    contrary to all the dictates of common sense. To <hi rend="italic">suppose</hi>
                    an agent that we do not see, and for whose existence we have not the smallest
                    argument; with equal propriety we might suppose ministering spirits, or any
                    thing that we please.</p>
                <p>13. Other philosophers are so dissatisfied with this notion of the production of
                    pressure, that they, on the other hand, ’ affirm that pressure is the only
                    moving force in nature; not according to the popular notion of pressure, by the
                    mutual contact of solid bodies, but that kind of pressure which has been called
                    <hi rend="italic">solicitation,</hi> such as the power of gravity. They affirm
                    that there is no such thing as contact on instantaneous communication of motion
                    by real collision. They say, and they prove it by very convincing facts, that
                    the particles of solid bodies exert very strong repulsions to a small distance;
                    and therefore, when they are brought by motion sufficiently near to another
                    body, they repel it, i and are equally repelled by it. Thus is motion produced
                    in the other body, and their own motion is diminished. And they then show, by a
                    scrupulous consideration of the state of the bodies while the one is advancing
                    and the other retiring, in what manner the two bodies attain a common velocity,
                    so that the quantity of motion before collision remains unchanged, the one body
                    gaining as much as the other loses. They also show cases of such mutual action
                    between bodies, where it is evident that theyhave never come into contact; and
                    yet the result has been precisely similar to those cases where the motion
                    appeared to be changed in an instant. Therefore they conclude that there is no
                    such thing as instantaneous <hi rend="italic">communication,</hi> or transfusion
                    of motion, by contact in collision or impulse. The reason why previous motion of
                    the impelling body is necessary, is not that it may have a <hi rend="italic"
                    >vis</hi><hi rend="italic">insita corpori moto,</hi> a force inherent in it <hi
                    rend="italic">by its being in motion,</hi> but that it may continue to follow
                    the impelled and retiring body, and exert on it a force inherent in itself,
                    whether in motion or at rest. According to these philosophers, therefore, all
                    moving forces are of that kind which has been named <hi rend="italic"
                    >solicitation,</hi> such as gravity. We shall know it afterwards by the more
                    familiar and descriptive name of <hi rend="italic">accelerating</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">retarding</hi> force.</p>
                <p>14. The exertions of mechanical forces are differently termed, according to the
                    reference that we make to the result. If in boxing or wrestling I strike, or
                    endeavour to throw my antagonist, I am said to <hi rend="italic">act</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but if I only parry his blows, or prevent him from throwing
                    me, I am said to <hi rend="italic">resist.</hi> This distinction is applied to
                    the exertions of mechanical powers. When one body, A, changes the motion of
                    another, B, we may consider the change in the motion of B either as the
                    indication and measure of A’s power of producing motion, or as the indication
                    and measure of A’s resistance to the being brought to rest, or having its motion
                    any how changed. The distinction is not in the thing itself, but only in the
                    reference that we are disposed, by other considerations, to make of its effect.
                    They may be distinguished in the following manner: If a change of motion follow
                    when one of the powers ceases to be exerted, that power is conceived as having
                    resisted. The whole language on this subject is metaphorical. Resistance,
                    effort, endeavour, &amp;c. are words which cannot be employed in mechanical
                    discussions without figure, because they all express notions which relate to
                    sentient beings; and the unguarded indulgence of this figurative language has so
                    much affected the imagination of philosophers, that many have almost animated
                    all matter. Perhaps the word <hi rend="italic">reaction,</hi> introduced by
                    Newton, is the best term for expressing that mutual force which is perceived in
                    all the operations of nature that we have investigated with success. As the
                    magnet attracts iron, and in so doing is said to <hi rend="italic">act</hi> on
                    it; so the iron attracts the magnet, and may be said to <hi rend="italic"
                    >re-act</hi> on it.</p>
                <p>15. With respect to the difficulty that has been objected to the opinion of those
                    who maintain that all the mechanical phenomena are produced by the agency of
                    attracting or repelling forces; namely, that this supposes the bodies to act on
                    each other at a distance, however small those distances may be, which is thought
                    to be absurd, we may observe, that we may ascribe the mutual approaches or
                    recesses to tendencies to or from each other. What we call <hi rend="italic">thx
                    attraction of the magnet</hi> may be considered as a tendency of the iron to the
                    magnet, somewhat similar to the gravitation of a stone toward the earth. We
                    surely (at least the unlearned) can and do conceive the iron to be affected by
                    the magnet, <hi rend="italic">without thinking</hi> of any intermedium. The
                    thing is not therefore inconceivable, which is all that we know about absurdity;
                    and we do not <pb break="no" facs="nls:193327659" xml:id="kp-eb0708-7659-0348"
                    />know any thing about the nature or essence of matter which renders this
                    tendency to the magnet impossible. That we do not see intuitively any reason why
                    the iron should approach the magnet, must be granted; but this is not enough to
                    entitle us to say that such a thing is impossible, or inconsistent with the
                    nature of matter. It appears, therefore, to be very hasty and unwarrantable to
                    suppose the impulse of an invisible fluid, of which we know nothing, and of the
                    existence of which we have no proof. Nay, if it be true that bodies do not come
                    into contaet, even when one ball hits another, and drives it before it, this
                    invisible fluid will not solve the difficulty, because the same difficulty
                    occurs in the action of any particle of the fluid on the body. We are obliged to
                    say that the production of motion without any <hi rend="italic">observed</hi>
                    contaet, is a much more familiar phenomenon than the production of motion by
                    impulsion. More motion has been produced in this way by the gravitation of a
                    small stream of water, running ever since the creation, than by all the impulses
                    in the world twice told. W <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> e do not mean by this
                    to say, that the giving to this observed mutual relation between <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> iron and a loadstone the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >tendency</hi> makes it less absurd than when we say that the loadstone attracts
                    the iron; it only makes it more conceivable. It suggests a very familiar
                    analogy; but both are equally figurative expressions, at least as the word
                    tendency is used at present. In the language of ancient Rome, there was no
                    metaphor when Virgil’s hero said, <hi rend="italic">Tendimus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">Latium. Tendore</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >versus</hi><hi rend="italic">solem</hi> means, in plain Latin, to <hi
                    rend="italic">approach the sun.</hi> The safe way of conceiving the whole is to
                    say that the condition of the iron depends on the vicinity of the magnet.</p>
                <p>16. When the exertions of a mechanical power are observed to be always directed
                    toward a body, that body is said to attract; but when the other body always
                    moves off from it, it is said to repel. These also are metaphorical expressions.
                    I attract a boat when I pull it toward me by a rope; this is purely <hi
                    rend="italic">Attraction</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and it is pure,
                    unfigurative <hi rend="italic">Repulsion,</hi> when I push any body from me. The
                    same words are applied to the mechanical phenomena, merely because they resemble
                    the results of real attraction or repulsion. We must be much on our guard to
                    avoid metaphor in our coneeptions, and never allow those words to suggest to our
                    mind any opinion about the <hi rend="italic">manner</hi> in which the mechanical
                    forces produce their effects. It is plain, that if the opinion of those who
                    maintain the existence and action of the above-mentioned invisible fluid be
                    just, there is nothing like attraction or repulsion in the universe. We must
                    always recur to the ⅛mple phenomenon, the motion to or from the attracting or
                    repelling body; for this is all we see, and generally all that we know.</p>
                <p>17. We conceive one man to have twice the strength of another man, when we see
                    that he can withstand the united effort of two others. Thus animal force is
                    conceived as a quantity, made up of and measured by its own parts. But we doubt
                    exceedingly whether this be an accurate conception. We have not a distinct
                    notion of one strain added to another, though we have of their being joined or
                    combined. We want words to express the difference of these two notions in our
                    own minds, but we imagine that others perceive the same difference. We conceive
                    clearly the addition of two lines or of two minutes; we can conceive them apart,
                    and perceive their boundaries, common to both, where one ends and the other
                    begins. We cannot conceive thus of two forces combined; yet we cannot say that
                    two equal forces are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> double of one of them. Vv <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> e measure them by the effects which they are known to
                    produce. Yet there are not wanting many eases where the action of two men,
                    equally strong, does not produce a double motion.</p>
                <p>In like manner, we conceive all mechanical forces as measurable by their effects;
                    and thus they are made the subjects of mathematical discussion. We talk of the
                    proportions of gravity, magnetism, electricity, &amp;c.; nay, we talk of the
                    proportion of gravity to magnetism: yet these, considered in themselves, are
                    disparate, and do not admit of any proportion; but they produce effects, some of
                    which are measurable, and whose assumed measures are susceptible of comparison,
                    being quantities of the same kind. ∙ Thus, one of the effects of gravity is the
                    acceleration of motion in a falling body: magnetism will also accelerate the
                    motion of a piece of iron; these two accelerations are comparable. But we cannot
                    compare magnetism with heat, because we do not know any measurable effects of
                    magnetism that are of the same kind with any effects of heat.</p>
                <p>When we say that the gravitation of the moon is the 3600th part of the
                    gravitation at the sea-shore, we mean that the fall of a stone in a second is
                    3600 times greater than the fall of the moon in the same time. But we also mean
                    (and this expresses the proportion of the <hi rend="italic">tendency</hi> of
                    gravitation more purely), that if a stone, when hung on a spring steelyard, draw
                    out the rod of the steelyard to the mark 3600, the same stone, taken up to the
                    distance of the moon, will draw it out no farther than the mark 1. We also mean,
                    that if the stone at the sea-shore draw out the rod to any mark, it will require
                    3600 such stones to draw it out to that mark when the trial is made at the
                    distance of the moon. It is not, therefore, in consequence of any immediate
                    perception of the proportion of the gravitation at the moon to that at the
                    surí’accof the earth that we make such an assertion; but these motions, which we
                    consider as its effects in these situations, being magnitudes of the same kind,
                    are susceptible of comparison, and have a proportion which can be ascertained by
                    observation. It is these proportions that we contemplate; although we speak of
                    the proportions of the unseen causes, the forces, or endeavours to descend. It
                    will be of material service to the reader to peruse the judicious and acute
                    dissertation on <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi> in the works of Dr Reid (vol.
                    ii.), where he will see clearly how force, velocity, density, and many other
                    magnitudes of very frequent occurrence in mechanical philosophy, may be made the
                    subjects of mathematical discussion, by means of some of those proper
                    quantities, measurable by their own parts, which are to be assumed as their
                    measures. Pressures are measurable only by pressures. When we consider them as
                    moving powers, we should be able to measure them by <hi rend="italic">any</hi>
                    moving powers, otherwise we cannot compare them; therefore it is not as
                    pressures that we then measure them. This observation is momentous.</p>
                <p>One circumstance must be carefully attended to. That those assumed measures may
                    be accurate, they must be invariably connected with the magnitudes which they
                    are employed to measure, and so connected that the degrees of the one must
                    change in the same manner with the degrees of the other. This is evident, and is
                    granted by all. But we must also <hi rend="italic">know</hi> this of the measure
                    we employ; we must see this constant and preeise relation. How can we know this?
                    We do not perceive force as a separate existence, so as to see its proportions,
                    and to see that these are the same with the proportions of the measures, in the
                    same manner that Euclid sees the proportions of triangles and those of their
                    bases, and that these proportions are the same when the triangles are of equal
                    altitudes. How do we discover that to every magnitude which we <hi rend="italic"
                    >ca</hi><hi rend="italic">∖∖</hi><hi rend="italic">force</hi> is invariably
                    attached a corresponding magnitude of acceleration or defleetion? Clearly. In
                    fact, the very existence of the force is an inference that we make from the
                    observed acceleration; and the degree of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193327672"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-7672-0349"/>the force is, in like manner, an inference from
                    the observed magnitude of the acceleration. Our measures are therefore
                    necessarily connected with the magnitudes which they measure, and their
                    proportions are the same; because the one is always an inference from the other,
                    both in species and in degree.</p>
                <p>18. It is now evident that these disquisitions are susceptible of mathematical
                    accuracy. Having selected our measures, and observed certain mathematical
                    relations of those measures, every inference that we can draw from the
                    mathematical relations of the proportions of those representations is true of
                    the proportions of the motions, and therefore of the proportions of the forces.
                    And thus dynamics becomes a demonstrative science, one of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >disciplinoe accuratoe.</hi></p>
                <p>19. But moving forces are considered as differing and in kind; that is, in
                    direction. We assign to the force the direction of the observed change of
                    motion, which is not only the indication, but also the characteristic, of the
                    changing force. We call it an <hi rend="italic">accelerating, retarding,
                    deflecting farce,</hi> according as we observe the motion to be accelerated,
                    retarded, or deflected.</p>
                <p>These denominations show us incontestably that we have no knowledge of the forces
                    different from our knowledge of the effects. The denominations are all either
                    descriptive of the effects, as when we call them accelerating, penetrating,
                    protrusive, attractive, or repulsive forces; or they are names of reference to
                    the substances in which the accelerating, protrusive, &amp;c. forces are
                    supposed to be inherent, as when we call them <hi rend="italic">magnetism,
                    electricity, corpuscular,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>20. When I struggle with another, and feel, that in order to prevent being
                    thrown, I must exert force, I learn that my antagonist is exerting force. This
                    motion is transferred to matter; and when a moving power which is <hi
                    rend="italic">known</hi> to operate produces no motion, we conceive it to be
                    opposed by another equal force, the existence, agency, and intensity of which is
                    detected and measured by these means. The quiescent state of the body is
                    considered as a change on the state of things that would have been exhibited in
                    consequence of the known action of one power, had this other power not acted;
                    and this change is considered as the indication, characteristic, and measure, of
                    another power, detected in this way. Thus forces are recognised not only by the
                    changes of motion which they produce, but also by the changes of motion which
                    they prevent. The cohesion of matter in a string is inferred not only by its
                    giving motion to a ball which 1 pull toward me by its intervention, but also by
                    its suspending that ball, and hindering it from falling. I know that gravity is
                    acting on the ball, which, however, does not fall. The solidity of a board is
                    equally inferred from its stopping the ball which strikes it, and from the
                    motion of the ball which it drives before it. In this way we learn that the
                    particles of tangible matter cohere by means of moving forces, and that they
                    resist compression with force; and in making this inference, we find that this
                    corpuscular force exerted between the particles is mutual, opposite, and equal;
                    for we must apply force equally to <hi rend="italic">a</hi> or to <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> in order to produce a separation or a compression. We
                    learn their equality, by observing that no motion ensues while these mutual
                    forces are known to act on the particles; that is, each is opposed by another
                    force, which is neither inferior nor superior to it.</p>
                <p>OF THE LAWS OF MOTION.</p>
                <p>Such, then, being our notions of mechanical forces, the causes of the sensible
                    changes of motion, there will result certain consequences from them, which may
                    be called axioms or laws of motion. Some of these may be intuitive, offering
                    themselves to the mind as soon as the notions' which they involve are presented
                    to it. Others may be as necessary results from the relations of these notions,
                    but may not readily offer themselves without the mediation of axioms of the
                    first class. We shall select those which are intuitive, and may be taken for the
                    first principles of all discussions in mechanical philosophy.</p>
                <p>FIRST LAW OF MOTION.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Every body continues in a state of rest, or of uniform
                    rectilineal motion, unless affected by some mechanical force.</hi></p>
                <p>21. This is a proposition, on the truth of which the whole science of mechanical
                    philosophy ultimately depends. It is therefore to be established on the firmest
                    foundation; and a solicitude on this head is the more justifiable, because the
                    opinions of philosophers have been extremely different, both with respect to the
                    truth of this law, and with respect to the foundation on which it is built. Tfi
                    ’ cse opinions are, in general, very obscure and unsatisfactory; and, as is
                    natural, they influence the discussions of those by whom they are held through
                    the whole science. Although of contradictory opinions one only can be just, and
                    it may appear sufficient that this one be established and uniformly applied; yet
                    a short exposition, at least, of the rest is necessary, that the greatest part
                    of the writings of the philosophers may be intelligible, and that we may avail
                    ourselves of much valuable information contained in them, by being able to
                    perceive the truth in the midst of their imperfect or erroneous conceptions of
                    it.</p>
                <p>22. It is not only the popular opinion that rest is the natural state of body,
                    and that motion is something foreign to it, but it has been seriously <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> maintained by the greatest part of those who are
                    esteemed philosophers. They readily grant that matter will continue at rest
                    unless some moving force act upon it. Nothing seems necessary for matter’s
                    remaining where it is, but its continuing to exist. But it is far otherwise, say
                    they, with respect to matter in motion. Here the body is continually changing
                    its relations to other things; therefore the continual agency of a changing
                    cause is necessary (by the fundamental principle of all philosophical
                    discussion), for there is here the continual production of an effect. They say
                    that this metaphysical argument receives complete confirmation (if confirmation
                    of an intuitive truth be necessary) from the most familiar observation. We see
                    that all motions, however violent, terminate in rest,· and that the continual
                    exertion of some force is necessary for their continuance.</p>
                <p>23. These philosophers therefore assert, that the conti nual action of the moving
                    cause is <hi rend="italic">essentially</hi> necessary for the continuance of the
                    motion; but they differ among themselves in their notions and opinions about
                    this cause. Some maintain that all the motions in the universe are produced and
                    continued by the immediate agency of Deity; others affirm, that in every
                    particle of matter there is inherent a sort of mind, the ρυΛ; and of Aris totle,
                    which they call an <hi rend="italic">Elemental AIind,</hi> which is the cause of
                    <hi rend="italic">all</hi> its motions and changes. An overweening reverence for
                    Greek learning has had a great influence in reviving this doctrine of Aristotle.
                    The Greek and Roman languages are affirmed to be more accurate expressions of
                    human thought than the modern languages are. In those ancient languages, the
                    verbs which express motion are employed both in the active and passive voice;
                    whereas we have only the active verb <hi rend="italic">to move,</hi> for
                    expressing both the state of motion and the act of putting in motion. “The stone
                    <hi rend="italic">moves</hi> down the slope, and <hi rend="italic">moves</hi>
                    all the pebbles which lie in its way but in the ancient languages, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193327685" xml:id="kp-eb0708-7685-0350"/>the mere state of
                    motion is always expressed by the passive or middle voice. The accurate
                    conception of the speakers is therefore extolled. The state of motion is
                    expressed as it ought to be, as the result of a continual action. K∕nrra∕, <hi
                    rend="italic">movetur,</hi> is equivalent to “it is moved.” According to these
                    philosophers, every thing which <hi rend="italic">moves</hi> is mind, and every
                    thing that <hi rend="italic">is moved</hi> is body. ‘</p>
                <p>The argument is futile, and it is false; for the modern languages are, in
                    general, equally accurate in this instance: <hi rend="italic">“se mouvoir”</hi>
                    in French; “<hi rend="italic">jich</hi><hi rend="italic">bewegen”</hi> in
                    German; <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">dvigatsu”</hi> in Slavonic;
                    are all passive or reflected. And the ancients said that “rain falls, water
                    runs, smoke rises,” just as we do. The ingenious author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ancient Metaphysics</hi> has taken much pains to give us, at length, the
                    procedures of those elementary minds in producing the ostensible phenomena of
                    local motion; but it seems to be merely an abuse of language, and a very
                    frivolous abuse. This elemental mind is known and characterised only by the
                    effect which we ascribe to its action; that is, by the motions or changes of
                    motions. Uniform and unexcepted experience shows us that these are regulated by
                    laws as precise as those of mathematical truth. We consider nothing as more
                    fixed and determined than the common laws of mechanism. There is nothing here
                    that indicates any thing like spontaneity, intention, purpose; none of those
                    marks by which mind was first brought into view; but they are very like the
                    effects which we produce by the exertions of our corporeal forces; and we have
                    accordingly given the name <hi rend="italic">force</hi> to the causes of motion.
                    It is surely much more apposite than the name mind, and conveys with much more
                    readiness and perspicuity the very notions that we wish to convey.</p>
                <p>24. We now wish to know what reason we have to think that the continual action of
                    some cause is necessary for continuing matter in motion, or for thinking that
                    rest is its natural state. If we pretend to draw any argument from the nature of
                    matter, that matter must be known, as far as is necessary for being the
                    foundation of argument. Its very existence is known only from observation; all
                    our knowledge of it must therefore be derived from the same source.</p>
                <p>If we take this way to come at the origin of this opinion, we shall find that
                    experience gives us no authority for saying that rest is the natural condition
                    of matter. We cannot say that we have ever seen a body at rest; this is evident
                    to every person who allows the validity of the Newtonian philosophy, and the
                    truth of the Copernican system of the sun and planets; all the parts of this
                    system are in motion. Nay, it appears from many observations, that the sun, with
                    his attending planets, is carried in a certain direction, with a velocity which
                    is very great. We have no unquestionable authority for saying that any one of
                    the stars is absolutely fixed; but we are <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> that
                    many of them are in motion. Rest is therefore so rare a condition of body, that
                    we cannot say, from any experience, that it is its natural state.</p>
                <p>25. It is easy, however, to see that it is from observation that this opinion has
                    been derived; but the observation has been limited and careless. Our experiments
                    in this sublunary world do indeed always require continued action of some moving
                    force to continue the motion; and if this be not employed, we see the motions
                    slacken every minute, and terminate in rest after no long period. Our first
                    notions of sublunary bodies are indicated by their operation in cases where we
                    have some interest. Perpetually seeing our own exertions necessary, we are led
                    to consider matter as something not only naturally quiescent and inert, but
                    sluggish, averse from motion, and prone to rest (we must be pardoned this
                    metaphorical language, because we can find no other term). What is expressed by
                    it, on this occasion, is precisely one of the erroneous or inadequate
                    conceptions that are suggested to our thoughts by reason of the poverty of
                    language. We animate matter in order to give it motion, and then we endow it
                    with a sort of moral character in order to explain the appearance of those
                    motions.</p>
                <p>26. But more extended observation has made men gradually desert their first
                    opinions, and at last allow that matter has no peculiar aptitude to rest. All
                    the retardations that we <hi rend="italic">observe</hi> have been discovered,
                    one after another, to have a distinct reference to some external circumstances.
                    The diminution of motion is always observed to be accompanied by the removal of
                    obstacles, as when a ball moves through sand, or water, or air; or it is owing
                    to opposite motions which are destroyed; to roughness of the path, or to
                    friction, &amp;c. We find that the more we can keep these things out of the way,
                    the less are the motions diminished. A pendulum will vibrate but a short while
                    in water; much longer in air; and in the exhausted receiver it will vibrate a
                    whole day. We know that we cannot remove <hi rend="italic">all</hi> obstacles;
                    but we are led by such observations to conclude that, if they <hi rend="italic"
                    >could be completely removed,</hi> our motions would continue for ever. And this
                    conclusion is almost demonstrated by the motions of the heavenly bodies, to
                    which we know of no obstacles, and which we really observe to retain their
                    motions for many thousand years, without the smallest sensible diminution.</p>
                <p>27. Another set of philosophers maintain an opinion directly opposite to that of
                    the inactivity of matter, and assert, that it is essentially active, and
                    continually changing its state. Faint traces of this are to be found in the
                    writings of Plato, Aristotle, and their commentators. Mr Leibnitz is the person
                    who has treated this question most systematically and fully. He supposes every
                    particle of matter to have a principle of individuality, which he therefore
                    calls a <hi rend="italic">Monad.</hi> This monad has a sort of <hi rend="italic"
                    >perception</hi> of its situation in the universe, and of its relation to every
                    other part of this universe. Lastly, he says that the monad acts on the material
                    particle much in the same way that the soul of man acts on his body. It modifies
                    the motion of the material atom (in conformity, however, to unalterable laws),
                    producing all those modifications of motion that we observe. Matter, therefore,
                    or at least particles of matter, are continually active, and continually
                    changing their situation.</p>
                <p>It is quite unnecessary to enter on a formal confutation of Mr Leibnitz’s system
                    of monads, which differs very little from the system of elemental minds, and is
                    equally whimsical and frivolous; because it only makes the unlearned reader
                    stare, without giving him any information. Should it even be granted, it would
                    not, any more than the action of animals, invalidate the general proposition
                    which we are endeavouring to establish as the fundamental law of motion. Those
                    powers of the monads, or of the elemental minds, are the causes of all the
                    changes of motion; but the mere material particle is subject to the Jaw, and
                    requires the exertion of the monad in order to exhibit a change of motion.</p>
                <p>28. A third sect of philosophers, at the head of which we may place Sir Isaac
                    Newton, maintain the doctrine enounced in the proposition. But they differ much
                    in respect of the foundation on which it is built.</p>
                <p>Some assert that this truth flows from the nature of the thing. If a body be at
                    rest, and you assert that it will not remain at rest, it must move in some one
                    direction. If it be in motion in any direction, and with any velocity, and do
                    not continue its equable, rectilineal motion, it must either be accelerated or
                    retarded; it must turn either to one side or to some other side. The event,
                    whatever it be, is individual and determinate; but no cause which <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193327698" xml:id="kp-eb0708-7698-0351"/>can determine it is supposed;
                    therefore the determination cannot take place, and no change will happen in the
                    condition of the body with respect to motion. It will continue at rest, or
                    persevere in its rectilineal and equable motion.</p>
                <p>But considerable objections may be made to this argument of <hi rend="italic"
                    >sufficient reason,</hi> as it is called. In the immensity and perfect
                    uniformity of space and time, there is no determining cause why the visible
                    universe should exist in the place in which we see it rather than in another, or
                    at this time rather than at another. Nay, the argument seems to beg the
                    question. A cause of determination is required as essentially necessary—a
                    determination may be without a cause, as well as a motion without a cause.</p>
                <p>29. Other philosophers, who maintain this doctrine, consider it merely as an
                    experimental truth; and proofs of its universality are innumerable.</p>
                <p>When a stone is thrown from the band, we press it forward while in the hand, and
                    let it go when the hand has acquired the greatest rapidity of motion that we can
                    give it. Thg stone continues in that state of motion which it acquired gradually
                    along with the hand. We can throw a stone much farther by means of a sling,
                    because, by a very moderate motion of the hand, we can whirl the stone round
                    till it acquire a very great velocity, and then we let go one of the strings,
                    and the stone escapes, <hi rend="italic">by continuing</hi> its rapid motion. We
                    see it still more distinctly in shooting an arrow from a bow. The string presses
                    hard on the notch of the arrow, and it yields to this pressure and goes forward.
                    The string alone would go faster forward. It therefore <hi rend="italic"
                    >continues</hi> to press the arrow forward, and accelerates its motion. This
                    goes on till the bow is as much unbent as the string will allow. But the string
                    is now a straight line. '&gt; It came into this position with an accelerated
                    motion, and it therefore goes a little beyond this position, but with a retarded
                    motion, being checked by the bow. But there is nothing to check the arrow,
                    therefore the arrow quits the string and flies away.</p>
                <p>These are simple cases of perseverance in a state of motion, where the procedure
                    of nature is so easily traced that we perceive it almost intuitively. It is no
                    less clear in other phenomena which are more complicated; but it requires a
                    little reflection to trace the process. We have often seen an equestrian showman
                    ride a horse at a gallop, standing on the saddle, and stepping from it to the
                    back of another horse that gallops alongside at the same rate; and he does this
                    seemingly with as much ease as if the horses were standing still. The man has
                    the same velocity with the horse that gallops under him, and keeps this velocity
                    while he steps to the back of the other. If that other were standing still, the
                    man would fly over his head. And if a man should step from the back of a horse
                    that is standing still, to the back of another that gallops past him, he would
                    be left behind. In the same manner, a slackwire dancer tosses oranges from hand
                    to hand while the wire is in full swing. The orange, swinging along with the
                    hand, retains the velocity; and when in the air, follows the hand, and falls
                    into it when it is in the opposite extremity of its swing. A ball dropped from
                    the mast-head of a ship that is sailing briskly forward, falls at the foot of
                    the mast. It retains the motion which it had while in the hand of the person who
                    dropped it, and follows the mast during the whole of its fall.</p>
                <p>We also have familiar instances of the perseverance of a body in a state of rest.
                    When a vessel filled with water is drawn suddenly along the floor, the water
                    dash,es over the posterior side of the vessel. It is left behind. In the same
                    manner, when a coach or boat is dragged forward, the persons in it find
                    themselves strike against the hinder part of the carriage or boat. Properly
                    speaking, it is the carriage that strikes on them. In like manner, if we lay a
                    card on the tip of the finger, and a piece of money on the card, we may nick
                    away the card, by hitting it neatly on its edge; but the piece of money will be
                    left behind, lying on the tip of the finger. A ball will go through a wall and
                    fly onward; but the wall is left behind. Buildings are thrown down by
                    earthquakes; sometimes by being tossed from their foundations, but more
                    generally by the ground on which they stand being hastily drawn sidewise from
                    under them, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>30. But common experience seems insufficient for establishing this fundamental
                    proposition of mechanical philo-; sophy. We must, on the faith of the Copernican
                    system,’ grant that we never saw a body at rest, or in uniform rectilineal
                    motion; yet this seems absolutely necessary before we can say that we have
                    established this proposition experimentally.</p>
                <p>What we imagine, in our experiments, to be putting a body, formerly at rest, into
                    motion, is, in fact, only changing a mo^t rapid motion, not less, and probably
                    much greater, than 90,000 feet per second. Suppose a cannon pointed east, and
                    the bullet discharged at noon day with sixty times greater velocity than we have
                    ever been able to give it: it would appear to set out with this unmeasurable
                    velocity to the eastward, to be gradually retarded by the resistance of the air,
                    and at last brought to rest by hitting the ground. But, by reason of the earth’s
                    motion round the sun, the fact is quite the reverse. Immediately before the
                    discharge, the ball was moving to the westward with the velocity of 90,000 feet
                    per second nearly. By the explosion of the powder, and its pressure on the ball,
                    some of this motion is destroyed, and at the rnuzzle of the gun the ball is
                    moving slower, and the cannon is hurried away from it to the westward. The air,
                    which is also moving to the westward 90,000 feet in a second, gradually
                    communicates motion to the ball, in the same manner as a hurricane would do. At
                    last (the ball dropping all the while) some part of the ground hits the ball,
                    and carries it along with it.</p>
                <p>Other observations must therefore be resorted to, in order to obtain an
                    experimental proof of this proposition; and such are to be found. Although we
                    cannot measure the absolute motions of bodies, we can observe and measure
                    accurately their relative motions, which are the differences of their absolute
                    motions. Now, if we can show experimentally that bodies show equal tendencies to
                    resist the augmentation and the diminution of their relative motions, they, <hi
                    rend="italic">ipso facto,</hi> show equal tendencies to resist the augmentation
                    or diminution of their absolute motions. Therefore let two bodies, A and B, be
                    put into such a situation that they cannot (by reason of their impenetrability,
                    or the action of their mutual powers) persevere in their relative motions. The
                    change produced on A is the effect and the measure of B’s tendency to persevere
                    in its former state; and therefore the proportion of these changes will show the
                    proportion of their tendencies to maintain their former states. Therefore let
                    the following experiment be made at noon.</p>
                <p>Let A, apparently moving westward three feet per second, hit the equal body B
                    apparently at rest. Suppose, Is/, that A impels B forward without any diminution
                    of its own velocity. This result would show that B manifests no tendency to
                    maintain its motion unchanged, but that A retains its motion undiminished.</p>
                <p>2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> Suppose that A stops, and that B remains at rest.
                    This would show that A does not resist a diminution of motion, but that B
                    retains its motion unaugmented.</p>
                <p>2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> Suppose that both move westward with the velocity of
                    one foot per second. The change on A is a diminution of velocity, amounting to
                    two feet per second.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193327711" xml:id="kp-eb0708-7711-0352"/>
                <p>This is the effect and the measure of B’s tendency to maintain its velocity
                    unaugmented. The change on B is an augmentation of one foot per second made on
                    its velocity; and this is the measure of A’s tendency to maintain its velocity
                    undiminished. This tendency is but half of the former; and this result would
                    show that the resistance to a diminution of velocity is but half of the
                    resistance to augmentation. It is perhaps but one quarter, for the change on B
                    has produced a double change on A.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wily,</hi> Suppose that both move westward at the rate of one
                    and a half foot per second. It is evident that their tendencies to maintain
                    their states unchanged are now equal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">tsthly,</hi> Suppose A = 2 B, and that both move, after the
                    collision, two feet per second; B has received an addition of two feet per
                    second to its former velocity. This is the effect and the measure of A’s whole
                    tendency to retain its motion undiminished. Half of this change on B measures
                    the persevering tendency of the half of A; but A, which formerly moved with the
                    apparent or relative velocity three, now moves (by the supposition) with the
                    velocity two, having lost a velocity of one foot per second. Each half of A
                    therefore has lost this velocity, and the whole loss of motion is two. Now this
                    is the measure of B’s tendency to maintain its former state unaugmented; and
                    this is the same with the measure of A’s tendency to maintain its own former
                    state undiminished. The conclusion from such a result would therefore be, that
                    bodies have equal tendencies to maintain their former states of motion without
                    augmentation and without diminution.</p>
                <p>What is supposed in the fourth and fifth cases is really the result of all the
                    experiments which have been tried; and this law regulates all the changes of
                    motion which are produced by the mutual actions of bodies in impulsions. This
                    assertion is true without exception or qualification. Therefore it appears that
                    bodies have no preferable tendency to rest, and that no fact can be adduced
                    which should make us suppose that a motion once begun should suffer any
                    diminution without the action of a changing cause.</p>
                <p>But we must now observe, that this way of establishing the first law of motion is
                    very imperfect, and altogether unfit for rendering it the fundamental principle
                    of a whole and extensive science. It is subject to all the inaccuracy that is to
                    be found in our best experiments; and it cannot be applied to cases where
                    scrupulous accuracy is wanted, and where no experiment can be made.</p>
                <p>Let us therefore examine the proposition by means of principles which contain the
                    foundation of all our knowledge of active nature. These will, we imagine, give a
                    decision of this question that is speedy and accurate; showing the proposition
                    to be an axiom or intuitive consequence of the relations of those ideas which we
                    have of motion, and of the causes of its production and changes.</p>
                <p>31. It has been fully demonstrated that the powers or forces of which we speak so
                    much are never the immediate objects of our perception. Their very existence,
                    their kind, and their degree, are instinctive inferences from the motions which
                    we observe and class. It evidently follows from this experimental and universal
                    truth, l∙s∕, that where no change of motion is observed, no such inference is
                    made, that is, no power is <hi rend="italic">supposed</hi> to act. But whenever
                    any change of motion is observed, the inference is made; that is, a power or
                    force is supposed to have acted.</p>
                <p>In the same form of logical conclusion, we must say that, 2<hi rend="italic"
                    >dly,</hi> when no change of motion is <hi rend="italic">supposed</hi> or
                    thought of, no force is <hi rend="italic">supposed</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and that whenever we <hi rend="italic">suppose</hi> a change of motion, we in
                    fact, though not in terras, suppose a changing force. And, on the other hand,
                    whenever we suppose the action of a changing force, we suppose the change of
                    motion; for the action of this force, and the change of motion, is one and the
                    same thing. We cannot think of the action without thinking of the indication of
                    that action; that is, the change of motion. In the same manner, when we do not
                    think of a changing force, or suppose that there is no action of a changing
                    force, we in fact, though not in terms, suppose that there is no indication of
                    this changing force; that is, that there is no change.</p>
                <p>Whenever, therefore, we suppose that no mechanical force is acting on a body, we
                    in fact suppose that the body continues in its former condition with respect to
                    motion. If we suppose that nothing accelerates, or retards, or deflects the
                    motion, we suppose that it is not accelerated, nor retarded, nor deflected.
                    LIence follows the proposition in express terms— <hi rend="italic">We suppose
                    that the body continues in its former state of rest or motion, u7iless we
                    suppose, that it is changed by some mechanical force.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus it appears that this proposition is not a matter of experience or
                    contingency, depending on the properties which it has pleased the Author of
                    nature to bςstow on body; it is to us a necessary truth. The proposition does
                    not so much express any thing with regard to body, as it does the operations of
                    our mind when contemplating body. It may perhaps be essential to body to move in
                    some particular direction. It may be essential to body to stop as soon as the
                    moving cause has ceased to act; or it may be essential to body to diminish its
                    motion gradually, and finally come to rest. But this will not invalidate the
                    truth of this proposition. These circumstances in the nature of body, which
                    render those modifications of motion essentially necessary, are the causes of
                    those modifications; and in our study of nature they will be considered by us as
                    chauging forces, and will be known and called by that name. And if we should
                    ever see a particle of matter in such a situation that it is affected by those
                    essential properties alone, we shall, from observation of its motion, discover
                    what those essential properties are.</p>
                <p>This law turns out at last to be little more than a tautological proposition; but
                    mechanical philosophy, as we have defined it, requires no other sense of it; for
                    even if we should suppose that body, of its own nature, is capable of changing
                    its state, this change must be performed according to some law which
                    characterizes the nature of body; and the knowledge of the law can be had in no
                    other way than by observing the deviations from uniform rectilineal motion. It
                    is therefore indifferent whether those changes are derived from the nature of
                    the thing or from external causes; for, in order to consider the various motions
                    of bodies, we must first consider this nature of matter as a mechanical
                    affection of matter, operating in every instance; and thus we are brought back
                    to the law enounced in this proposition. This becomes more certain when we
                    reflect that the external causes (such as gravity or magnetism), which are
                    acknowledged to operate changes of motion, are equally unknown to us with this
                    essential original property of matter, and are, like it, nothing but inferences
                    from the phenomena.</p>
                <p>The above very diffuse discussions may appear superfluous to many readers, and
                    even cumbersome; but we trust that the philosophical reader will excuse our
                    anxiety on this head, when he reflects on the complicated, indistinct, and
                    inaccurate notions commonly had of the subject. We may include Sir Isaac Newton
                    in the number of those who have at least introduced modes of expression which
                    mislead the minds of incautious persons, and suggest inadequate notions,
                    incompatible with the pure doctrine of the proposition. Although in words they
                    disclaim the doctrine that rest is the natural state of body, and that force is
                    necessary for the continuation of its motion, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193327724" xml:id="kp-eb0708-7724-0353"/>yet in words they (and most
                    of them in thought) likewise abet that doctrine: for they say that there resides
                    in a moving body a <hi rend="italic">power or farce,</hi> by which it perseveres
                    in its motion. They call it the <hi rend="italic">vis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >insita,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">inherent force, of α moving body.</hi> This
                    is surely giving up the question: for if the motion is supposed to be continued
                    in consequence of a force, that force is <hi rend="italic">supposed</hi> to be
                    exerted; and it is supposed that if it were not exerted, the motion would cease;
                    and therefore the proposition must be false. Indeed it is sometimes expressed so
                    as seemingly to ward off this objection. It is said that the body continues in
                    uniform rectilineal motion, unless affected by some <hi rend="italic">external
                    cause.</hi> But this way of speaking obliges us, at first setting out in natural
                    philosophy, to assert that gravity, magnetism, electricity, and a thousand other
                    mechanical powers, are external to the matter which they put in motion. This is
                    quite improper. It is the business of philosophy to discover whether they be
                    external or not; and if we assert that they are, we have no principles of
                    argumentation with those who deny it. It is this one thing that has filled the
                    study of nature with all the jargon of ethers, and other invisible, intangible
                    fluids, which has disgraced philosophy, and greatly retarded its progress.</p>
                <p>32. We must observe, that the terms <hi rend="italic">vis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >insita,</hi> inherent force, are very improper. There is no dispute among
                    philosophers in calling every thing a force that produces a change of motion,
                    and in inferring the action of such a force whenever we observe a change of
                    motion. It is surely incongruous to give the same name to what has not this
                    quality of producing a change, or to infer (or rather to suppose) the energy of
                    a force when no change of motion is observed. This is one among many instances
                    of the danger of mistake when we indulge in analogical discussions. All our
                    language, at least, on this subject is analogous. I feel that in order to oppose
                    animal force I must exert force. But I must exert force in order to oppose a
                    body in motion; therefore I imagine that the moving body possesses force. A bent
                    spring will drive a body forward by unbending; therefore I say that the spring
                    exerts force. A moving body impels the body which it hits; therefore I say that
                    the impelling body possesses and exerts force. I imagine farther, that it
                    possesses force only by being in motion, or because it is in motion; because I
                    do not find that a quiescent body will put another into motion by touching it.
                    But we shall soon find this to be false in many, if not in all cases, and that
                    the communication of motion depends on the mere vicinity, and not on the motion
                    of the impelling body; yet we ascribe the exertion of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vis</hi><hi rend="italic">insita</hi> to the circumstance of the continued
                    motion. We therefore conceive the force as arising from or as consisting in the
                    impelling body’s being in motion; and, with a very obscure and indistinct
                    conception of the whole matter, we call it <hi rend="italic">the force by which
                    the body preserves itself in motion.</hi> Thus, taking it for granted that a
                    force resides in the body, and being obliged to give it some office, this is the
                    only one that we can think of.</p>
                <p>33. But philosophers imagine that they perceive the necessity of the exertion of
                    a force in order to the. continuation of a motion. Motion (say they) is a
                    continued action; the body is every instant in a new situation; there is the
                    continual production of an effect’, therefore the continual action of a
                    cause.</p>
                <p>This, however, is a very inaccurate way of thinking. We have a distinct
                    conception of motion; and we conceive that there is such a thing as a moving
                    cause, which we distinguish from all other causes by the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >force.</hi> It produces motion. If it does this, it produces the character of
                    motion, which is a continual change of place. Motion is not action, but the
                    effect of an action; and this action is as complete in the instant immediately
                    succeeding the beginning of the motion as it is a minute after. The subsequent
                    change of place is the continuation of an effect already produced. The <hi
                    rend="italic">immediate</hi> effect of the moving force is a <hi rend="italic"
                    >determination,</hi> by which, if not hindered, the body would go on for ever
                    from place to place. It is in this determination only that the state or
                    condition of the body can differ from a state of rest; for in any instant the
                    body does not describe any space, but has a determination by which it will
                    describe a certain space uniformly in a certain time. Motion is a condition, a
                    state, or mode of existence, and no more requires the continued agency of the
                    moving cause than yellowness or roundness does. It requires some chemical agency
                    to change the yellowness to greenness; and it requires a mechanical cause or a
                    force to change this motion into rest. When we see a moving body stop short in
                    an instant, or be gradually but quickly brought to rest, we never fail to
                    speculate about a cause of this cessation or retardation. The case is no way
                    different in itself although the retardation should be extremely slow. We should
                    always attribute it to a cause. It requires a cause to put a body out of motion,
                    as much as to put it into motion. This cause, if not external, must be found in
                    the body itself; and it must have a self-determining power, and may as well be
                    able to put itself into motion as out of it.</p>
                <p>If this reasoning be not admitted, we do not see how any effect can be produced
                    by any cause. Every effect supposes something <hi rend="italic">done</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and any thing done implies that the thing done may remain
                    till it be <hi rend="italic">undone</hi> by some other cause. Without this it
                    would have no existence. If a moving cause did not produce continued motion by
                    its instantaneous action, it could not produce it by any continuance of that
                    action; because in no instant of that action does it produce continued
                    motion.</p>
                <p>We must therefore give up the opinion, that there resides in a moving body a
                    force <hi rend="italic">by which it is hept in motion</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and we must find some other way of explaining that remarkable difference
                    between a moving body and a body at rest, by which the first causes other bodies
                    to move by hitting them, while the other does not do this by merely touching
                    them. We shall see, with the clearest evidence, that motion is necessary in the
                    impelling body, in order that it may permit the forces inherent in one or both
                    bodies to continue this pressure long enough for producing a sensible or
                    considerable motion. But these moving forces are inherent in bodies, whether
                    they are in motion or at rest.</p>
                <p>34. The foregoing observations show us the impropriety of the phrase <hi
                    rend="italic">communication of motion.</hi> By thus reflecting on the notions
                    that are involved in the general conception of one body being made to move by
                    the impulse of another, we perceive that there is nothing individual transferred
                    from the one body to the other. The determination to motion, indeed, existed
                    only in the impelling body before collision; whereas, afterwards, both bodies
                    are so conditioned or determined. But we can form no notion of the thing
                    transferred. With the same metaphysical impropriety we speak of the

                <p>35. Kepler introduced a term <hi rend="italic">inertia, vis inertiae,</hi> into
                    mechanical philosophy; and it is now in constant use. But writers are very
                    careless and vague in the notions which they affix to these terms. Kepler and
                    Newton seem generally to employ itfor expressing thefact, the perseverance of
                    the body in its present state of motion or rest: but they also frequently
                    express by it something like an indifference to motion or rest, <hi
                    rend="italic">manifested by its requiring the same quantity of force to make an
                    augmentation of its motion as to make an equal diminution of it.</hi> The
                    popular notion is <pb break="no" facs="nls:193327737"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-7737-0354"/>like that which we have of actual resistance; and
                    it always implies the notion of force <hi rend="italic">exerted</hi> by the
                    resisting body. We suppose this to be the exertion of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vis</hi><hi rend="italic">insita,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">inherent
                    force</hi> of a body in motion. But we have the same notion of resistance from a
                    body at rest which we set in motion. Now surely it is in direct contradiction to
                    the common use of the word <hi rend="italic">force,</hi> when we suppose
                    resistance from a body at rest; yet <hi rend="italic">vis inertiae</hi> is a
                    very common expression. Nor is it more absurd (and it is very absurd) to say,
                    that a body maintains its state of rest by the exertion of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >vis inertiae,</hi> than to say that it maintains its state of motion by the
                    exertion of an <hi rend="italic">inherent force.</hi> We should avoid all such
                    metaphorical expressions as <hi rend="italic">resistance, indifference,
                    sluggishness,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">proneness to rest</hi> (which some
                    express by <hi rend="italic">inertia)</hi> because they seldom fail to make us
                    indulge in metaphorical notions, and thus lead us to misconceive the <hi
                    rend="italic">modus</hi><hi rend="italic">operandi,</hi> or procedure of
                    nature.</p>
                <p>There is <hi rend="italic">no resistance whatever observed</hi> in these
                    phenomena, for the force employed always produces its <hi rend="italic"
                    >complete</hi> effect. When 1 throw down a man, and find that I have employed no
                    more force than was sufficient to throw down a similar and equal mass of dead
                    matter, I know by this that he <hi rend="italic">has not</hi> resisted; but I
                    conclude that he <hi rend="italic">has</hi> resisted if I have been obliged to
                    employ much more force. There is therefore no resistance, properly so called,
                    when the exerted force is observed to produce its full effect. To say that there
                    <hi rend="italic">is</hi> resistance, is therefore a real misconception of the
                    way in which mechanical forces have operated in the collision of bodies. There
                    is no more resistance in these cases than in any other natural changes of
                    condition. We are guilty, however, of the same impropriety of language in other
                    cases, where the cause of it is more evident. We say that colours in grain <hi
                    rend="italic">resist</hi> the action of soap and of the sun, but that Prussian
                    blue does not. We all perceive that in this expression the word resistance is
                    entirely figurative; and we should say that Prussian blue <hi rend="italic"
                    >resists</hi> soap, if we are right in saying that a body resists any force
                    employed to change its state of motion; for soap must be employed to discharge
                    or change the colour, <hi rend="italic">and it does change it.</hi> Force must
                    be employed to change a motion, <hi rend="italic">and it does change it.</hi>
                    The impropriety, both of thought and language, is <hi rend="italic">plain</hi>
                    in the one case, and it is no less <hi rend="italic">real</hi> in the other.
                    Both of the terms <hi rend="italic">inherent force</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >inertia</hi> may be used with safety for abbreviating language, if we be
                    careful to employ them only for expressing <hi rend="italic">either the simple
                    fact of persevering in the former state,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">the necessity
                    of employing a certain determinate force in order to change that state, and if
                    we avoid all thought of resistance.</hi></p>
                <p>36. From the whole of this discussion we learn that the deviations from uniform
                    motions are the indications of the existence and agency of mechanical forces,
                    and that they are the only indications. The indication is very simple— mere
                    change of place; it can therefore indicate nothing but what is very simple, the
                    something competent to the production of the very motion that we observe; and
                    when two changes of motion are precisely similar, they indicate the same thing.
                    Suppose a mariner’s compass on the table, and that by a small tap with my finger
                    I cause the needle to turn off from its quiescent position ten degrees. 1 can do
                    the same thing by bringing a magnet near it, or by bringing an electrified body
                    near it, or by the unbending of a fine spring pressing it aside, or by a puff of
                    wind, or by several other methods. In all these cases the indication is the
                    same; therefore the thing indicated is the same, namely, a certain intensity and
                    direction of a moving power. How it operates, or in what manner it exists and
                    exerts itself in these instances, outwardly so different, is not under
                    consideration at present. Impulsiveness, intensity, and direction, are all the
                    circumstances of resemblance by which the affections of matter are to be
                    characterized; and it is to the discovery and determination of these alone that
                    our attention is now to be directed. We are directed in this research by the</p>
                <p>SECOND LAW OF MOTION.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Every change of motion is proportional to the force impressed,
                    and is made in the direction of that force.</hi></p>
                <p>37. This law also may almost be considered as an identical proposition; for it is
                    equivalent to saying that the changing force is to be measured by the change
                    which it produces, and that the direction of this force is the direction of the
                    change. Of this there can be no doubt, when we consider the force in no other
                    sense than that of the cause of motion, paying no attention to the form or
                    manner of its exertion. Thus, when a pellet of tow is shot from a pop-gun by the
                    expansion of the air compressed by the rammer, or where it is shot from a toy
                    pistol by the unbending of the coiled wire, or when it is nicked away by the
                    thumb like a marble—if, in all these cases, it moves off in the same direction,
                    and with the same velocity, we cannot consider or think of the force, or at
                    least of its exertion, as any how different. Nay, when it is driven forward by
                    the instantaneous percussion of a smart stroke, although the manner of producing
                    this effect (if possible) is essentially different from what is conceived in the
                    other cases, we must still think that the propelling force, considered as a
                    propelling force, is one and the same. In short, this law of motion, as thus
                    expressed by Sir Isaac Newton, is equivalent to saying, “that we take the
                    changes of motion as the measures of the changing forces, and the direction of
                    the change for the indication of the direction of the forces for no reflecting
                    person can pretend to say that it is a deduction from the acknowledged
                    principle, that effects are proportional to their causes. We do not añirm this
                    law from having observed the proportion of the forces and the proportion of the
                    changes, and that these proportions are the same; and from having observed that
                    this has obtained through the whole extent of our study of nature. This would
                    indeed establish it as a physical law, an universal fact; and it is, in fact, so
                    established. But this does not establish it as a law of motion, according to our
                    definition of that term; as a law of human thought, the result of the relations
                    of our ideas, as an intuitive truth. The injudicious attempts of
                    philosopherstoprove it as a matter of observation, have occasioned the only
                    dispute that has arisen in mechanical philosophy. It is well known that a bullet
                    moving with double velocity penetrates four times as far. Many other similar
                    facts corroborate this: and the philosophers observe, that four times the force
                    has been expended to generate this double velocity in the bullet; it requires
                    four times as much powder. In all the examples of this kind it would seem that
                    the ratio of the forces employed has been very accurately ascertained; yet this
                    is the invariable result. Philosophers, therefore, have concluded that moving
                    forces are not proportional to the velocities which they produce, but to the
                    squares of those velocities. It is a strong confirmation to see that the bodies
                    in motion seem to possess forces in this very proportion, and produce effects in
                    this proportion; penetrating four times as deep when the velocity is only twice
                    as great, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>But if this be a just estimation, we cannot reconcile it to the concession of the
                    same philosophers, who grant that the velocity is proportional to the force
                    impressed, in the cases where we have no previous observation of the ratio of
                    the forces, and of its equality to the ratio of the velocities. This is the case
                    with gravity, which these <pb break="no" facs="nls:193327750"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-7750-0355"/>philosophers always measure by its accelerating
                    power, or the velocity which it generates in a given time. And this cannot be
                    refused by them; for cases occur where the force can be measured in the most
                    natural manner by the actual pressure which it exerts. Gravity is thus measured
                    by the pressure which a stone exerts on its supports. A weight which at Quito
                    will pull out the rod of a spring steelyard to the mark 312, will pull it to 313
                    at Spitzbergen; and it is a fact, that a body will fall 313 inches at
                    Spitzbergen in the same time that it falls 312 at Quito. Gravitation is the
                    cause both of the pressure and the fall, and it is a matter of unexcepted
                    observation that they have always the same ratio. The philosophers who have so
                    strenuously maintained the other measure of forces are among the most eminent of
                    those who have examined the motions produced by gravity, magnetism, electricity,
                    &amp;c.; and they never think of measuring those forces any other way than by
                    the velocity. It is in this way that the whole of the celestial phenomena are
                    explained in perfect uniformity with observation, and that the Newtonian
                    philosophy is considered as a demonstrative science.</p>
                <p>There must, therefore, be some defect in the principle on which the other
                    measurement of forces is built, or in the method of applying it. Pressure is
                    undoubtedly the immediate and natural measure of force; yet we know that four
                    springs, or a bow four times as strong, give only a double velocity to an
                    arrow.</p>
                <p>The truth of our law rests on this only, that we assume the changes of motion as
                    the measure of the changing forces, or at least as the measures of their
                    exertions in producing motion. In fact, they are the measures only of a certain
                    circumstance, in which the actions <hi rend="italic">of very</hi> different
                    natural powers may resemble each other, namely, the competency to produce
                    motion. They do not, perhaps, measure their competency to produce heat, or even
                    to bend springs. We can surely consider this apart from all other circumstances,
                    and it is worthy of separate consideration. Let us see what can be, and what
                    ought to be, deduced from this way of treating the subject.</p>
                <p>38. The motion of a body may certainly remain unchanged. If the direction and
                    velocity remain the same, we perceive no circumstance in which its condition
                    with respect to motion differs. Its change of place or situation can make no
                    difference; for this is implied in the very circumstance of the bodies being in
                    motion.</p>
                <p>But if either the velocity or direction change, then surely is its mechanical
                    condition no longer the same; a force has acted on it, either intrinsic or from
                    without, either accelerating, or retarding, or deflecting it. Supposing the
                    direction to remain the same, its difference of condition can consist in nothing
                    but its difference of velocity. This is the only circumstance in which its
                    condition can differ, as it passes through two different points of its
                    rectilineal path. It is this determination by which the body will describe a
                    certain determinate space uniformly in a given time, which defines its condition
                    as a moving body; the changes of this determination are the measures of their
                    own causes, and to those causes we have given the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >force.</hi> Those causes may reside in other bodies, which may have other
                    properties, characterized and measured by other effects. Pressure may be one of
                    those properties, and may have its own measures; these may or may not have the
                    same proportion with that property which is the cause of a change of velocity;
                    and therefore changes of velocity may not be a measure of pressure. This is a
                    question of fact, and requires observation and experience; but, in the mean
                    time, velocity, and the change of velocity, is the measure of moving force and
                    of changing force. When, therefore, the change of velocity is the same whatever
                    the previous velocity may be, the changing force must be considered as the same.
                    Therefore, finally, if the previous velocity is nothing, and consequently the
                    change on that body is the very velocity or motion that it acquires, we must
                    say, that the force which produces a certain change in the velocity of a moving
                    body is the same with the force which would impart to a body at rest a velocity
                    equal to this change or difference of velocity produced on the body already in
                    motion.</p>
                <p>39. This manner of estimating force is in perfect conformity to our most familiar
                    notions on these subjects. We conceive the weight or downward pressure of a body
                    as the cause of its motion downwards; and we conceive it as belonging to the
                    body at all times, and in all places, whether falling, or rising upwards, or
                    describing a parabola, or lying on a table; and, accordingly, we observe, that
                    in every state of motion it receives equal changes of velocity in the same or an
                    equal time, and all in the direction of its pressure.</p>
                <p>40. All that we have now said of a change of velocity might be repeated of a
                    change of direction. It is surely possible that the same change of direction may
                    be made on any two motions. Let one of the motions be considered as growing
                    continually slower, and terminating in rest. In every instant of this motion it
                    is possible to make one and the same change on it. The same change may therefore
                    be made at the very instant that the motion is at an end. In this case the
                    change is the very motion which the body acquires from the changing force.
                    Therefore, in this case also, we must say that a change of motion is itself a
                    motion, and that it is the motion which the force would produce in a body that
                    was previously at rest.</p>
                <p>4L The result of these observations is evidently this, that we must ascertain, in
                    every instance, what is the change of motion, and mark it by characters that are
                    conspicuous and distinguishing; and this mark and measure of change must be a
                    motion. Then we must say, that the changing force is that which would produce
                    this motion in a body previously at rest. We must see how this is manifest as a
                    motion in the difference between the former motion and the new motion; and, on
                    the other hand, we must see how the motion produceablc in a quiescent body may
                    be so combined with a motion already existing as to exhibit a new motion, in
                    which the agency of the changing force may appear.</p>
                <p>Suppose a ship at anchor in a stream, while one man walks forward on the quarter
                    deck at the rate of two miles per hour, another walks from stem to stern at the
                    same rate, a third walks athwart ship, and a fourth stands still. Let the ship
                    be supposed to cut or part her cable, and float down the stream at the rate of
                    three miles per hour. We cannot conceive any difference in the change made on
                    each man’s motion in absolute space; but their motions are now exceedingly
                    different from what they were: the first man, whom we may suppose to have been
                    walking westward, is now moving eastward one mile per hour; the second is moving
                    eastward four miles per hour, and the third is moving in an oblique direction,
                    about three points north or south of due east. All have suffered the same change
                    of condition with the man who had been standing still. He has now got a motion
                    eastward three miles per hour. In this instance, we see very well the
                    circumstance of sameness that obtains in the change of these four conditions. It
                    is the motion of the ship which is blended with the other motions. But this
                    circumstance is equally present whenever the same previous motions are changed
                    into the same new motions. We must learn to expiscate this; which we shall do by
                    considering the manner in which the motion of the ship is blended with each of
                    the men’s motions.</p>

                <p>42. This kind of combination has been called the <hi rend="italic">composition of
                    motion</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> because, in every point of the motion really
                    pursued, the two motions are to be found.</p>
                <p>The fundamental theorem on this subject is this: Two uniform motions in the sides
                    of a parallelogram compose an uniform motion in the diagonal.</p>
                <p>Suppose that a point A (fig. 1) describes AB uniformly in some given time, while
                    the line AB is carried uniformly along AC in the same time, keeping always
                    parallel to its first position AB. The point A, by the combination of these
                    motions, will describe AD, the diagonal of the parallelogram ABDC, uniformly in
                    the same time.</p>
                <p>For it is plain that the velocities in AB and AC are proportional to AB and AC,
                    because they are uniformly described in the same time. When the point has got to
                    E, the middle of AB, the line AB has got into the situation GH, half way between
                    AB and CD, and the point E is in the place e, the middle of GH. Draw Eel.
                    parallel to AC. It is plain that the parallelograms ABDC and AeeG are similar;
                    because AE and AG are the halves of AB and AC, and the angle at A is common to
                    both. Therefore, by a proposition in the elements, they are about the same
                    diagonal, and the point <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is in the diagonal of AD. In
                    like manner, it may be shown, that when A has described AF, three fourths of AB,
                    the line AB will be in the situation IK; so that AI is three fourths of</p>
                <p>AC, and the point <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> in which A is now found, is in the
                    diagonal AD. It will be the same in whatever point of AB the describing point A
                    be supposed to be found. The line AB will be on a similar point of AC, and the
                    describing point will be in the diagonal AD.</p>
                <p>Moreover, the motion in AD is uniform; for AE is described in the time of
                    describing AE; that is, in half the time of describing AB, or in half the time
                    of describing</p>
                <p>AD. In like manner, <hi rend="italic">Af</hi> is described in three fourths of
                    the time of describing AD, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Lastly, the velocity in the diagonal AD is to the velocity in either of the sides
                    as AD is to that side. This is evident, because they are uniformly described in
                    the same time.</p>
                <p>This is justly called <hi rend="italic">a composition of the motions</hi> AB <hi
                    rend="italic">and</hi> AC, as will appear by considering it in the following
                    manner: Let the lines AB, AC be conceived as two material lines like wires. Let
                    AB move uniformly from the situation AB into the situation CD, while AC moves
                    uniformly into the situation BD. It is plain that their intersection will always
                    be found on AD. The point e, for example, is a point common to both lines.
                    Considered as a point of EL, it is then moving in the direction cH or AB; and
                    considered as a point of GH, it is moving in the direction cL. Both of these
                    motions are therefore blended in the motion of the intersection along AD. We can
                    conceive a small ring at <hi rend="italic">c</hi> embracing loosely both of the
                    wires. This material ring will move in the diagonal, and <hi rend="italic">will
                    really partake</hi> of both motions.</p>
                <p>Thus we see how the motion of the ship is actually blended with the motions of
                    the three men; and the cir-cŉmstance of sameness which is to be found in the
                    four changes of motion is this motion of the ship, or of the man who was
                    standing still. By composition with each of the three former motions, it
                    produces each of the three new motions. Now, when each of two primitive motions
                    is the same, and each of the new motions is the same, the change is surely the
                    same. If one of the changes has been brought about by the actual composition of
                    motions, we know precisely what that change is; and this informs us what the
                    other is, in whatever way it was produced.</p>
                <p>Hence we infer that,</p>
                <p>43. <hi rend="italic">When a motion is any how changed, the change is that motion
                    which, when compounded with the former mo-</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> i</hi> ∕i'ora, <hi rend="italic">will produce the new motion.</hi>
                    Now, because we assume <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> the change as the measure
                    and characteristic of the changing force, we must do so in the present instance;
                    and we must say,</p>
                <p>44. <hi rend="italic">That the changing force is that which will produce in a
                    quiescent body the motion which, by composition with the former motion of a
                    body, will produce the new motion.</hi></p>
                <p>And, on the other hand, <hi rend="italic">When tile motion of a body is changed
                    by the action of any force, the new motion is that which is compounded of the
                    former motion, and of the motion which the force would produce in a quiescent
                    body.</hi></p>
                <p>When a force changes the direction of a motion, we see that its direction is
                    transverse in some angle BAC; because a diagonal AD always supposes two sides.
                    As we have distinguished any change of direction by the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >deflection,</hi> we may call the transverse force a <hi rend="italic"
                    >deflecting force.</hi></p>
                <p>In this way of estimating a change of motion, all the characters of both motions
                    are preserved, and it expresses every circumstance of the change; the mere
                    change of direction, or the angle BAD, is not enough, because the same force
                    will make different angles of deflection, according to the velocity of the
                    former motion, or according to its direction. But in this estimation the full
                    effect of the deflecting force is seen; it is seen <hi rend="italic">as a
                    motion</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for when half of the time is elapsed, the
                    body is at <hi rend="italic">e</hi> instead of E; when three fourths are elapsed
                    it is at/instead of F; and at the end of the time it is at D instead of B. In
                    short, the body has moved uniformly away from the points at which it would have
                    arrived independent of the change; and this motion has been in the same
                    direction, and at the same rate, as if it had moved from A to C by the changing
                    force alone. Each force has produced its full effect; for when the body is at D,
                    it is as far from AC as if the force AC had not acted on it; and it is as far
                    from AB as it would have been by the action of AC alone.</p>
                <p>For all these reasons, therefore, it is evident, that if we are to abide by our
                    measure and character of force as a mere producer of motion, we have selected
                    the proper characteristic and measure of a changing force; and our descriptions,
                    in conformity to this selection, must be agreeable to the phenomena of nature,
                    and retain the accuracy of geometrical procedure; because, on the other band,
                    the results which we deduce from the supposed influence of those forces are
                    formed in the same mould. It is not even requisite that the real exertions of
                    the natural forces, such as pressure of various kinds, &amp;c. shall follow
                    these rules; for their deviations will be considered as new forces, although
                    they are only indications of the differences of the real forces from our
                    hypothesis. We have obtained the precious advantage of mathematical
                    investigation, by which we can examine the law of exertion which characterizes
                    every force in nature.</p>
                <p>45. On these principles we establish the following fundamental elementary
                    proposition, of continual and indispensable use in all mechanical inquiries.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193327776" xml:id="kp-eb0708-7776-0357"/>
                <p><hi rend="italic">If a body or material particle be subjected at the same time to
                    the action of two moving forces, each of τvhich would separately cause it to
                    describe the side of a parallelogram uniformly in a given time, the body will
                    describe the diagonal uniformly in the same time.</hi></p>
                <p>For the body, whose motion AB was changed into AD, had gotten its motion by the
                    action of some force. It was moving along NAB, and when it reached the point A,
                    the force AC acted on it. The primitive motion is the same, or the body is in
                    the same condition in every instant of the primitive motion. It may have
                    acquired this motion when it was in N, or when at 0, or any other point of NA.
                    In all these cases, if AC act on it when it is in A, it will always describe AD;
                    therefore it will describe AD when it acquires the primitive motion also in A;
                    that is, if the two forces act on it at one and the same instant. The
                    demonstration may be neatly expressed thus: The change induced by each force on
                    the motion produced by the other is the motion which it would produce in the
                    body if previously at rest. Therefore the motion resulting from joint action is
                    the motion which is compounded of these two motions, or it is a motion in the
                    diagonal of the parallelogram, of which these motions are the sides.</p>
                <p>This is called the <hi rend="italic">composition of forces.</hi> The forces which
                    produce the motions along the sides of the parallelogram are called the <hi
                    rend="italic">simple forces,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">constituent
                    forces;</hi> and the force which would alone produce the motion along the
                    diagonal is called the <hi rend="italic">compound force,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">resulting force,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">equivalent
                    force.</hi></p>
                <p>46. On the other hand, the force which produces a motion along any line whatever
                    may be conceived as resulting from the combined action of two or more forces. We
                    may <hi rend="italic">know</hi> or <hi rend="italic">observe</hi> it to be so;
                    as when we see a lighter dragged along a canal by two horses, one on each side.
                    Each pulls the boat directly toward himself in the direction of the track-rope;
                    the boat cannot go both ways, and its real motion, whatever it is, results from
                    this combined action. This might be produced by a single force; for example, if
                    the lighter be dragged along the canal by a rope from another lighter which
                    precedes it, being dragged by one horse, aided by the helm of the foremost
                    lighter. Here the real force is not the resulting, or the compound, but the
                    equivalent force.</p>
                <p>This view of a motion mechanically produced is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >resolution of forces.</hi> The force in the diagonal is said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">resolved</hi> mto the two forces, having the directions and
                    velocities represented by the sides. This practice is of the most extensive and
                    multifarious use in all mechanical disquisitions. It may frequently be
                    exceedingly difficult to manage the complication of the many real forces which
                    concur in producing a phenomenon; and by substituting others, whose combined
                    effects are equivalent, our investigation may be much expedited. But more of
                    this afterwards.</p>
                <p>We must carefully remember, that when the motion AD is once begun, all
                    composition is at an end, and the motion is a simple motion. The two
                    determinations, by one of which the body would describe AB, and by the other of
                    which it would describe AC, no longer <hi rend="italic">co-exist</hi> in the
                    body. This was the case only <hi rend="italic">in the instant,</hi> in the very
                    act of changing the motion AB into the motion BD; yet is the motion AD
                    equivalent to a motion which is produced by the <hi rend="italic">actual
                    composition</hi> of two motions AB and AC; in which case the two motions
                    co-exist in every point of AD.</p>
                <p>47. Accordingly this is the way in which the composition of forces is usually
                    illustrated, and thought to be demonstrated. A man is supposed (for instance) to
                    walk uniformly from A to C on a sheet of ice, while the ice is carried uniformly
                    along AB by the stream. The man’s real motion is undoubtedly along AD; but this
                    is by no means a demonstration that the instantaneous or shortlived action of
                    two forces would produce that motion; the man must continue to exert force in
                    order to walk; and the ice is dragged along by the stream. Some indeed express
                    this proof in another way, saying, let a body describe AB, while the space in
                    which this motion is performed is carried along AC. The ice may be carried
                    along, and may, by friction or otherwise, drag the man along with it; but a
                    space cannot be removed from one place to another, nor, if it could, would it
                    take the man with it. Should a ship start suddenly forward while a man is
                    walking across the deck, he would be left behind, and fall toward the stern. We
                    must <hi rend="italic">suppose</hi> a transverse force, and we must <hi
                    rend="italic">suppose</hi> the composition of this force without proof. This is
                    no demonstration.</p>
                <p>We apprehend, that the demonstration given above of this fundamental proposition
                    is unexceptionable, when the terms force and deflection are used in the abstract
                    sense which we have affixed to them. The only circumstance in it which can be
                    the subject of discussion is, whether we have selected the proper measure and
                    characteristic of a change of motion. We never met with any objection to it.</p>
                <p>48. But some have still maintained that it does not evidently appear from these
                    principles, that the motion which results from the joint action of two natural
                    powers, whose known and measurable intensities have the same proportions with AB
                    and BC, and which also exert themselves in those directions, will produce a
                    motion having the direction and proportion of AD. They will not, if the
                    velocities produced by these forces are not in the proportion of those
                    intensities, but in the subduplicate ratio of them. Nay, they say that it is not
                    so. If a body be impelled along AC by one spring, and along AB by two springs
                    equally strong, it will not describe the diagonal of a parallelogram, of which
                    the side AB is double the side AC. They add, that an indefinite number of
                    examples can be given where a body <hi rend="italic">does not</hi> describe the
                    diagonal of the parallelogram by the joint action of two forces, which
                    separately would cause it to describe the sides. And lastly, they say that at
                    any rate it does not appear evident to the mind, that two <hi rend="italic"
                    >incitements</hi> to motion, having the directions and the same proportion of
                    intensity with that of the sides of a parallelogram, actually generate a third,
                    which is the immediate cause of the motion in the diagonal. An equivalent force
                    is not the same with a resulting force.</p>
                <p>49. Yet we see numberless cases of the composition of incitements to motion, and
                    they seem as determinate and as susceptible of being combined by composition, as
                    the things called moving forces, which are measured by the velocities. We see
                    them actually so combined in a thousand instances, as in the example already
                    given of a lighter dragged by two horses pulling in different directions.
                    Experiment even shows, that this composition follows precisely the same rule as
                    the composition of the forces which are measured by the velocities; for if the
                    point A (fig. 1) be pulled by a thread or pressed by a spring in the direction
                    AB, and by another in the direction AC, and if the pressures are proportional to
                    AB and AC, then it will be withheld from moving, if it be pulled or pressed by a
                    third force, acting in the direction AćZ, opposite to AD, the pressure being
                    also proportional to AD. This force acting in the direction <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ad,</hi> would certainly withstand an equal force acting in the direction AD;
                    therefore we must conclude that the two pressures AB and AC really generate a
                    force AD. This uniform agreement shows that the composition is deducible from
                    fixed principles; but it does not appear that it can be held as demonstrated by
                    the arguments employed in the case of motions. A demonstration of the
                    composition of pressures is farther <pb break="no" facs="nls:193327789"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-7789-0358"/>wanted, in order to render mechanics a
                    demonstrative science.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, philosophers of the first eminence have turned their attention to
                    this problem. It is by no means easy; being so nearly allied to first
                    principles, that it must be difficult to find axioms of greater simplicity by
                    which it may be proved.</p>
                <p>Mechanicians generally contented themselves with the solution given by Aristotle;
                    but this is merely a composition of motions; indeed he does not give it for any
                    thing else, and calls it <hi rend="italic">øuvos¢is τωv φυ ąv.</hi> The first
                    writer who appears to have considered it as different from the mere composition
                    of motions, was the celebrated Dutch engineer Stevinus, in his work <hi
                    rend="italic">on Sluices</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but his solutionis
                    obscure. It was sufficient, however, to convince Daniel Bernoulli of the
                    necessity and the difficulty of the problem. He has given the first complete
                    demonstration of it in the first volume of the commentaries of the Imperial
                    Academy of Sciences at St Petersburg. It is extremely ingenious; but it is
                    tedious and intricate, requiring a series of fifteen propositions to demonstrate
                    that two pressures, having the directions and magnitudes of the sides of any
                    parallelogram, compose a third, which has the direction and magnitude of its
                    diagonal. His first proposition is, that <hi rend="italic">two equalpressures,
                    acting at right angles, compose a third, in the direction of the diagonal of a
                    square, and having to either of the other two the proportion of the diagonal of
                    a square to its sides.</hi></p>
                <p>M. d’Alembert has greatly simplified and improved this demonstration, by
                    beginning with a case that is self-evident; namely, <hi rend="italic">if three
                    equal forces are inclined to each other in equal angles of</hi> 120°, <hi
                    rend="italic">any one of them will balance the combined action of the other
                    two.</hi> Surely; for neither of them can prevail. Therefore <hi rend="italic"
                    >two</hi> equal forces, inclined in an angle of 120°, produce a third, which has
                    the direction and proportion of the diagonal of the rhombus; for this is equal
                    and opposite to one of the three above mentioned. He then demonstrates the same
                    thing of two equal forces inclined in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> angle; and by a
                    series of eight propositions more, demonstrates the general theorem. This
                    dissertation is in the Memoirs of the Academy at Paris for 1769. He improves it
                    still farther in a subsequent memoir.</p>
                <p>Mr Riccati and Mr Fonsenex, in the Commentaries of me Academy of Turin, have
                    given analytical demonstrations, which are also very ingenious and concise, but
                    require acquaintance with the higher mathematics. There is another very
                    ingenious demonstration in the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Sçavans</hi> for
                    June 1764, but too obscure for an elementary proposition. It is somewhat
                    simplified by Belidor in his <hi rend="italic">Ingenieur</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >François.</hi> Frisius, in his <hi rend="italic">Cosmographia,</hi> has given
                    one, which is perhaps the best of all those that are easily comprehended without
                    acquaintance with the higher mathematics; but we imagine that, although no one
                    can doubt of the conclusion, it has not that intuitive evidence for every step
                    of the process that seems necessary.</p>
                <p>50. We here offer another, composed by blending together the methods of Bernoulli
                    and D’Alembert; and we imagine that no objection can be made to any step of it.
                    We limit it entirely to pressures, and do not at all consider nor employ the
                    motions which they may be supposed to produce.</p>
                <p>(A.) If two equal and opposite pressures or incitements to motion act at once on
                    a material particle, it suffers no change of motion; for if it yields in either
                    direction by their joint action, one of the pressures prevails, and they are not
                    equal.</p>
                <p>Equal and opposite pressures are said to <hi rend="italic">balance</hi> each
                    other; and such as balance must be esteemed equal and opposite.</p>
                <p>(B.) If <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> are two magnitudes
                    of the same kind, proportional to the intensities of two pressures which act in
                    the same direction, then the magnitude« + <hi rend="italic">b</hi> will measure
                    the intensity of the pressure, which is equivalent, and may be called equal to
                    the combined effort of the other two; for when we try to form a notion of
                    pressure as a measurable magnitude, distinct from motion or any other effect of
                    it, we find nothing that we can measure it by but another pressure. Nor have we
                    any notion of a double or triple pressure different from a pressure that is
                    equivalent to the joint effort of two or three equal pressures. A pressure <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> is accounted triple of a pressure <hi rend="italic">b,</hi>
                    if it balances three pressures, each equal to <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> acting
                    together. Therefore, in all proportions which can be expressed by numbers, we
                    must acknowledge the legitimacy of this measurement; and it would surely be
                    affectation to omit those which the mathematicians call <hi rend="italic"
                    >incommensurable.</hi></p>
                <p>In like manner, the magnitude <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> must be acknowledged to measure that pressure which arises
                    from the joint action of two pressures <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> acting in opposite directions, of which <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> is the greatest.</p>
                <p>(C.) Let ABCD and AZ&gt;Crf (fig. 2) be two rhombuses, which have the common
                    diagonal AC. Let the angles BA6, D <hi rend="italic">Ad,</hi> be bisected by the
                    straight lines AE and AF.</p>
                <p>If there be drawn from the points E and F the lines EG, EH, <hi rend="italic">Fg,
                    Fh,</hi> making equal angles on each side of EA and FA, and if <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gg, Hh</hi> be drawn, cutting the diagonal AC in I and L: then AI + AL will be
                    greater or less than AQ, the half of AC, according as the angles GEH, <hi
                    rend="italic">gFh,</hi> are greater or less than GAH, <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi><hi rend="italic">Ah.</hi></p>
                <p>Draw GII, <hi rend="italic">gh,</hi> cutting AE, AF, in 0 and <hi rend="italic"
                    >o,</hi> and draw Oo, cutting AC in K.</p>
                <p>Because the angles AEG and EAG are respectively equal to AEH and EAH, and AĽ is
                    common to both triangles, the sides AG, GE, are respectively equal to AH, HE,
                    and GH is perpendicular to AE, and is bisected in 0; for the same reasons <hi
                    rend="italic">gh</hi> is bisected in <hi rend="italic">o.</hi> Therefore the
                    lines <hi rend="italic">Gg, Oo,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Hä,</hi> are parallel,
                    and IL is bisected in K. Therefore AI + AL is equal to twice AK. Moreover, if
                    the angle GEH be greater than GAH, AO is greater than EO, and AK is greater than
                    KQ. Therefore AI + AL is greater than AQ; and if the angle GEH be less than G
                    AH, Al + AL is less than AQ.</p>
                <p>(D.) Two equal pressures, acting in the directions AB and AC (fig. 3), at right
                    angles to each other, compose a pressure in the direction AD, which bisects the
                    right angle; and its intensity is to the intensity of each of the constituent
                    pressures as the diagonal of a square to one of the sides.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193327802" xml:id="kp-eb0708-7802-0359"/>
                <p>It is evident, that the direction of the pressure, generated by their joint
                    action, will bisect the angle formed by their directions; because no reason can
                    be assigned for the direction inclining more to one side than to the other.</p>
                <p>In the next place, since a force in the direction AD does, in fact, arise from
                    the joint action of the equal pressures AB and AC, the pressure AB may be
                    conceived as arising from the joint action of two equal forces similarly
                    inclined and proportioned to it. Draw EAF perpendicular to AD. One of these
                    forces must be directed along AD, and the other along AE. In like manner, the
                    pressure AC may arise from the joint action of a pressure in the direction AD,
                    and an equal pressure in the direction AF. It is also plain that the pressures
                    in the directions AE and AF, and the two pressures in the direction AD, must be
                    all equal. And also, any one of them must have the same proportion to AB or to
                    AC, that AB or AC has to the force in the direction AD, arising from their joint
                    action.</p>
                <p>Therefore, if it be said that AD does not measure the pressure arising from the
                    joint action of AB and AC, let Ad, greater than AD, be its just measure, and
                    make Ad: AB = AB: <hi rend="italic">Ag =</hi> AB: Ac. Then <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ag</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ac</hi> have the same inclination and proportion
                    to AB that AB and AC have to <hi rend="italic">Ad.</hi> We determine, in „like
                    manner, two forces A∕and <hi rend="italic">Ag</hi> as constituents of AC.</p>
                <p>Now <hi rend="italic">Ad</hi> is equivalent to AB and AC, and AB is equivalent to
                    <hi rend="italic">AE</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ag</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and AC is equivalent to A/and <hi rend="italic">Ag.</hi> Therefore <hi
                    rend="italic">Ad</hi> is equivalent to <hi rend="italic">AE, Af, Ag,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Ag.</hi> But (A) <hi rend="italic">AE</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Af</hi> balance each other, or annihilate each other’s effect; and
                    there remain only the two forces or pressures <hi rend="italic">Ag, Ag.</hi>
                    Therefore (B) their measure is a magnitude equal to twice <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ag.</hi> But if <hi rend="italic">Ad</hi> be greater than the diagonal AD of
                    the square, whose sides are AB and AC; then <hi rend="italic">Ag</hi> must be
                    less than AI, the side of the square whose diagonal is AB. But twice <hi
                    rend="italic">Ag</hi> is less than AD, and much less than <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ad.</hi> Therefore the measure of the equivalent of AB and AC cannot be a line
                    <hi rend="italic">Ad,</hi> greater than AD. In like manner, it cannot be a line
                    Aő that is less than AD. Therefore it must be equal to AD, and the proposition
                    is demonstrated.</p>
                <p>(E.) <hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> Two equal forces, AB, AC, acting at right
                    angles, will be balanced by a force AO, equal and opposite to AD, the diagonal
                    of the square whose sides are AB and AC; for AO would balance AD, which is the
                    equivalent of AB and AC.</p>
                <p>(F.) Let AECF (fig. 4), be a rhombus, the acute angle of which, L’AF, is half of
                    a right angle. Two equal pressures, which have the directions and measures AE,
                    AF, compose a pressure having the direction and measure AC, which is the
                    diagonal of the rhombus.</p>
                <p>V/</p>
                <p>It is evident, in the first place, that the compound force has the direction AC,
                    which bisects the angle EAF. If AC be not its just measure, let it be AP less
                    than AC. Let ABCD be a square described on the same diagonal, and make AP: AQ =
                    AE: AO, = AF: Ao. Draw KOG, <hi rend="italic">~K,og</hi> perpendicular to AE,
                    AF; draw GL7, OHo, EG, EK, F&lt;y, FK, PF, and PE.</p>
                <p>The angles CAB and FAE are equal, each being half of a right angle. Also the
                    figures AEPF and AGEK are similar; because AP: AQ = AE: AO. Therefore FA: AP -
                    KA: AE, and EA: AP = GA: AE. Therefore, in the same manner that the forces AE,
                    AF are affirmed to compose AP, the forces AG and AK may compose the force AE,
                    and the forces <hi rend="italic">Ag</hi> and AK may compose the force AF.
                    Therefore (B) the force AP is equivalent to the four forces AG, AK, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ag,</hi> AK. But (D) AG and <hi rend="italic">Ag</hi> arc the
                    sides of a square, whose diagonal is equal to twice AI; and the two forces AK,
                    AK are equal to, or are measured by, twice AK. Therefore the four forces AG, AK,
                    <hi rend="italic">Ag,</hi> AK, are equivalent to 2 AI + 2 AK = 4 AH.</p>
                <p>But because AP was supposed less than AC, the angle FPE is greater than FAE, and
                    GEK is greater than GAK, AO is greater than OE, and AH is greater than HQ, and
                    2AH is greater than AQ; and therefore 4AH is greater than AC, and much greater
                    than AP. Therefore AP is not the just measure of the force composed of AE and
                    AF.</p>
                <p>In like manner it is shown that AE and AF do hot compose a force whose measure is
                    greater than AC. It is therefore equal to AC; and the proposition is
                    demonstrated.</p>
                <p>(G.) By the same process it may be demonstrated, that if BAD be half a right
                    angle, and EAF be the fourth of a right angle, two forces AE, AF will compose a
                    force measured by AC. And the process may be repeated for a rhombus, whose acute
                    angle is ģth, ∙⅛th, &amp;c. of a right angle; that is, any portion of a right
                    angle that is produced by continual bisection. Two forces, forming the sides of
                    such a rhombus, compose a force measured by the diagonal.</p>
                <p>(H.) Let ABCD, <hi rend="italic">Ab Cd,</hi> (fig. 5), be two rhombuses, formed
                    by two consecutive bisections of a right angle. Let AECF be another rhombus,
                    whose sides AE and AF bisect the angles BA6 and DA√.</p>
                <p>The two forces AE, AF, compose a force AC.</p>
                <p>Bisect AE and AF in 0 and 0. Draw the perpendiculars GOH, <hi rend="italic"
                    >goh,</hi> and the lines GLy, OKo, HL7⅛ and the lines EG, EH, F&lt;y, <hi

                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193327815" xml:id="kp-eb0708-7815-0360"/>
                <p>It is evident that AGEH and A^FΛ are rhombuses; because AO — OE, and Ao — oF. It
                    is also plain, that since <hi rend="italic">bAd</hi> is half of BAD, the angle
                    GAH is half of <hi rend="italic">bAd.</hi> It is therefore formed by a continual
                    bisection of a right angle. Therefore (G) the forces AG, AH, compose a force AE;
                    and <hi rend="italic">Ag, Ah,</hi> compose the force AF. Therefore the forces
                    AG, AH, <hi rend="italic">Ag, Ah,</hi> acting together, are equivalent to the
                    forces AE, AF, acting together. But AG, <hi rend="italic">Ag</hi> compose a
                    force — 2 Al; and the forces AH, <hi rend="italic">Ah</hi> compose a force = 2
                    AL. Therefore the four forces acting together are equivalent to 2 AI + 2 AL, or
                    to 4 AK. But because AO is <hi rend="italic">į</hi> AE, and the lines <hi
                    rend="italic">Gg, Oo, Hh, are</hi> evidently parallel, 4 AK is equal to 2 AQ, or
                    to AC; and the proposition is demonstrated.</p>
                <p>(I.) <hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> Let us now suppose that by continual bisection
                    of a right angle we have obtained a very small angle <hi rend="italic">a</hi> of

                <p>(K.) Let RAS (fig. 6) be perpendicular to AC, and let ABCD be a rhombus, whose
                    acute angle BAD is some multiple of 2α that is less than a right angle. Let <hi
                    rend="italic">Ab, Cd</hi> be another rhombus, whose sides <hi rend="italic">Ab,
                    Ad</hi> bisect the angles R AB, SAD. Then the forces <hi rend="italic">Ab,

                <p>Draw 6R, <hi rend="smallcaps">ćZS</hi> parallel to BA, DA. It is evident that
                    ARZ&gt;B and <hi rend="smallcaps">ASćZD</hi> are rhombuses, whose acute angles
                    are multiples of <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> that are each less than a right
                    angle. Therefore (I) the forces AR and AB compose the force <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ab</hi> and AS, AD compose <hi rend="italic">Ad</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    but AR and AS annihilate each other’s effect, and there remains only the forces
                    AB, AD. Therefore <hi rend="italic">Ab</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ad</hi> are
                    equivalent to AB and AD, which compose the force AC; and the proposition is
                    demonstrated.</p>
                <p>(L.) <hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> Thus is the corollary of last proposition
                    extended to every rhombus, whose angle at A is some multiple of <hi

                    be considered as demonstrated of every rhombus; and we may say,—</p>
                <p>(M.) <hi rend="italic">Two equal forces, inclined to each other in any angle,
                    compose a force which is measured by the diagonal of the rhombus, whose sides

                <p>(N.) Two forces AB, AC (fig. 7) having the direction and proportion of the sides
                    of a rectangle, compose a force AD, having the direction and proportion of the

                <p>Draw the other diagonal CB, and draw EAF parallel to it: draw BE, CF parallel to
                    DA.</p>
                <p>AEBG is a rhombus; and therefore the forces AE and AG compose the force AB. AFCG
                    is also a rhombus, and the force AC is equivalent to AF and AG. Therefore the
                    forces AB and AC, acting together, are equivalent to the forces AE, AF, AG, and
                    AG acting together, or to AE, AF, and AD acting together; but AE and AF
                    annihilate each other’s action, being opposite and equal (for each is equal to
                    the half of BC). Therefore AB and AC acting together are equivalent to AD, or
                    compose the force AD.</p>
                <p>(0.) Two forces, which have the direction and proportions of AB, AC (fig. 8) the

                    of the diagonal AD.</p>
                <p>Draw AF perpendicular to BD, and BG and DE perpendicular to AC.</p>
                <p>Then AFBG is a rectangle, as is also AFDE; and AG is equal to CE. Therefore (N)
                    AB is equivalent to AF and AG. Therefore AB and AC acting together, are
                    equivalent to AF, AG, and AC acting together; that is, to AF and AE acting
                    together; that is (N) to AD; or the forces AB and AC compose the force AD.</p>
                <p>51. Hence arises the most general proposition.</p>
                <p>Jįf <hi rend="italic">a material particle be urged at once by two pressures or

                    the same manner as if it were acted on by a single force, whose intensity is

                <p>52. Thus have we endeavoured to demonstrate from abstract principles the perfect
                    similarity of the composition of pressures, and the composition of forces
                    measured by the motions which they produce. We cannot help being of the opinion
                    that a separate demonstration is indispensably<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193327828" xml:id="kp-eb0708-7828-0361"/> necessary. What may be
                    fairly deduced from the one case cannot always be applied to the other. No
                    composition of pressures can explain the change produced by a deflecting force
                    on a motion already existing; for the changing pressure is the only one that
                    exists, and there is none to be compounded with it. And, on the other hand, our
                    notions and observations of the composition of motions will not explain the
                    composition of pressures, unless we take it for granted that the pressures are
                    proportional to the velocities; but this is perhaps a gratuitous assumption. At
                    any rate, it is not an intuitive proposition; and we have mentioned some facts
                    where it seems that they do not follow the same proportion. The pressure of four
                    equal springs produces only a double velocity. It would appear, therefore, that
                    there are circumstances which oblige us to say, that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >exertion</hi> of pressure, as a cause of motion, is not (always at least)
                    proportional to the real measurable pressure. We are therefore anxious to
                    discover in what the difference consists; and in the mean time must allow, that
                    the pressure exerted on a body at rest is different from its exertion in
                    producing motion. We cannot indeed state any immediate comparison between
                    pressure and motion, nor have we any clear conception of the connection between
                    them. It is only by our own sensations of touch that we have any notion of
                    pressure, and it is experience that teaches us that it always accompanies every
                    cause of motion. We can, however, observe the proportions of pressures, and
                    compare them with the proportions of motion. We very often observe them
                    different; and therefore it was indispensably necessary to investigate the laws
                    of combined pressure as we did the laws of combined motion in consequence of
                    pressure. Yet we should err if we hastily asserted that pressures are not
                    proportional to the motions which they produce; all that we are entitled to call
                    in doubt is, whether the pressures in their exertion, while they actually
                    produce motion, or. changes of motion, continue to be the same as when they do
                    not produce motion, being withstood or balanced by opposite pressures.
                    Considered as causes of motion, we ought to think that they do not vary while
                    they produce motion, and that the actual pressure, while it produces a double
                    motion, is really double, although it may be quadruple when the body exerting it
                    is made to act on a body that it cannot move. We are confirmed in this opinion
                    by observing, that other facts show us, that even while producingmotion, the
                    pressure which we call quadruple, because we have measured it by four equal
                    pressures balancing it, is really quadruple, considered as the cause of motion,
                    and produces a quadruple motion. A bow which requires four times the force to
                    draw it to any given extent, will communicate the same velocity to a bundle of
                    four arrows that a bow four times more easily drawn communicates to one arrow,
                    and will therefore produce a quadruple motion. Yet it will only produce a double
                    velocity in the arrow that acquired a simple velocity from a bow having one
                    fourth of the strength.</p>
                <p>These discrepancies should excite the endeavours of mechanicians to investigate
                    the laws observed in the action of pressures producing motion. Had this been
                    done with care and with candour, we should not have had the great difference of
                    opinion which still divides philosophers about the measures of moving forces.
                    But a spirit of party, which had arisen from other causes, gave importance to
                    what was at first only a difference of expression, and made the partizans of Mr
                    Leibnitz avail themselves of the figurative language which has done so much harm
                    in all the departments of philosophy. Notwithstanding all our caution, it is
                    hardly possible to avoid metaphorical conceptions when we employ the language of
                    metaphor. The abettors of the Leibnitzian measure of moving forces, or perhaps,
                    to speak more properly, the abettors of the Leibnitzian measure of that force
                    which is supposed to preserve bodies in their condition of motion, insist that
                    the force which is exerted in producing any change of motion is greater in
                    proportion as the motion changed is greater; and they give a very specious
                    argument for their assertion. They appeal to the exertions which we ourselves
                    make. Here we are conscious of the fact. Then they give similar examples of the
                    action of bodies. A clay ball, moving six fleet per second, will make the
                    addition of one foot to the velocity of an equal clay ball that is already
                    moving four feet per second in the same direction. But if this last ball be
                    already moving ten feet per second, we must follow it with a velocity of twelve
                    feet in order to increase its velocity one foot. But, without insisting on the
                    numberless paralogisms and inconsistencies which this way of conceiving the
                    matter would lead us into, it suffices to observe, that the phenomena give us
                    abundant assurance that there has been the same exertion in both these cases.
                    This acceleration is always accompanied by a compression of the balls, and the
                    compression is the same in both. This compression is a very good measure of the
                    force employed to produce it; and, in the present case, we need not even trouble
                    ourselves with any rule for its measurement: for Surely, when the compression is
                    not different, but the same, the force exerted is the same. This is farther
                    confirmed by observing, that it requires the same force to make the same pit, or
                    to give the same motion, to a piece of clay lying on the table of a ship’s
                    cabin, whether the ship be sailing two miles or ten miles per hour.</p>
                <p>Thus we see that there are strong reasons for believing, that the exertions of
                    pressure in producing motion, or that the pressures <hi rend="italic">actually
                    exerted,</hi> are proportional to the changes of motion observed, and that they
                    coincide in this respect with our abstract conceptions of moving forces.</p>
                <p>But we have Still better arguments. None of the Leibnitzians think of denying the
                    equal exertions of gravity, or of any of those powers which they call <hi
                    rend="italic">solicitations or accelerating forces.</hi> They all admit that
                    gravity, or any constant accelerating force, produces equal increments of
                    velocity in equal times, and that a double gravity will produce a double
                    increment in an equal time, and an equal increment in half of the time: and that
                    a quadruple gravity will produce a double velocity in half the time. All these
                    things are granted by them, and their writings are full of reasonings from this
                    principle. Now, from the fact, acknowledged by the Leibnitzians, that the
                    quadrupleforce of a bow gives a double velocity to the arrow, in every instant
                    of its action, it indisputably follows, that it has acted on it only for half
                    the time of the action of the four times weaker bow, which gives the arrow only
                    half the velocity; and thus has the discrepancy between the effects of pressures
                    and of our abstract moving forces entirely disappeared. For this circumstance of
                    the difference in the time of acting will be found, on strict examination, in
                    all the cases of the change of motion by pressures which we measure by their
                    effects on a body at rest. When this and the appreciable changes of actual
                    pressure, during the time of producing the motion, are taken into consideration,
                    all difference vanishes, and the composition of pressures is in perfect harmony
                    with the composition of motions, or of abstract moving forces. Dynamics is thus
                    made a demonstrative science, and affords the opportunity of investigating, by
                    observation and experiment, the nature of those mechanical powers which reside
                    in bodies, and which appear to us under the form of pressure, inducing us to
                    consider pressure as a cause of motion.</p>
                <p>In this, however, we are rather inaccurate. Pressure is one of the sensible
                    effects of that property which is also <pb break="no" facs="nls:193327841"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-7841-0362"/>the cause of motion. It is not the pressure of a
                    piece of lead, but its heaviness, that is the reason that it gives motion to a
                    kitchen jack. Pressure is merely a generic name, borrowed from a similar
                    instance, and given to moving forces, which have the same nature, but different
                    names that serve to mark their connection with certain substances, in which they
                    may be supposed to reside. Natural philosophy is almost entirely employed in
                    examining the nature of these various pressures or accelerative forces; and the
                    general doctrines of dynamics, by ascertaining what is common to them all,
                    enable us to mark with precision what is characteristic of each.</p>
                <p>53. We have now advanced very far in this investigation; for we have obtained the
                    criterion by which we learn the direction and the magnitude of every changing
                    force; and, on the other hand, we see how to state what will be the effect of
                    the exertion of any force that is known or suspected to act. All this we learn
                    by the composition of forces; and the greatest part of mechanical disquisition
                    consists in the application of this doctrine. For such reasons it merits minute
                    consideration; and therefore we must point out some general conclusions from the
                    properties of figure, which will greatly facilitate the use of the parallelogram
                    of forces.</p>
                <p>54. <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> The constituent and the resulting forces, or
                    the simple and compound forces, act in the same plane; for the sides and
                    diagonal of a parallelogram are in one plane.</p>
                <p>55. <hi rend="italic">Second,</hi> The simple and the compound forces are
                    proportional to the sides of any triangle which are parallel to their
                    directions. For if any three lines, <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >bd,</hi><hi rend="italic">ad,</hi> be drawn parallel to AB, AC, and AD (fig.
                    9), they will form a triangle similar to the triangle ABD. For the same reasons
                    they are proportional to the sides of a triangle <hi rend="italic"
                    >aΙ&gt;'d,</hi> which are respectively perpendicular to their directions.</p>
                <p>56. <hi rend="italic">Third,</hi> Therefore each is proportional to the sine of
                    the opposite angle of this triangle; for the sides of any triangle are
                    proportional to the sines of the opposite angles.</p>
                <p>57. <hi rend="italic">Fourth,</hi> Each is proportional to the sine of the angle
                    contained by the directions of the other two; for AD is to AB as the sine of the
                    angle ABD to the sine of the angle ADB. Now the sine of ABD is the same with the
                    sine of BAC contained between the directions AB and AC, and the sine of ADB is
                    the same with the sine of CAD; also AB is to AC, or BD, as the sine of ADB (or
                    CAD) to the sine of BAD.</p>
                <p>. 58. We now proceed to the application of this fundamental proposition. And we
                    observe, in the first place, that since AD may be the diagonal of an indefinite
                    number of parallelograms, the motion or the pressure AD may result from the
                    joint action of many pairs of forces. It may be produced by forces which would
                    separately produce the motions AF and AG. This generally gives us the means of
                    discovering the forces which concur in its production. If one of them, AB, is
                    known in direction and intensity, the direction AC, parallel to BD, and the
                    intensity, are discovered. Sometimes we know the directions of both. Then, by
                    drawing the parallelogram or triangle, we learn their proportions. The force
                    which deflects any motion AB into a motion AD, is had by simply drawing a line
                    from the point B (to which the body would have moved from A in the time of
                    really moving from A to D) to the point D. The deflecting force is such as would
                    have caused the body move from B to D in the same time. And, in the same manner,
                    we get the compound motion AD, which arises from any two simple motions AB and
                    AC, by supposing both of the motions to be accomplished in succession. The final
                    place of the body is the same, whether it moves along AD or along AB and BD in
                    succession.</p>
                <p>59. This theorem is not limited to the composition of two motions or two forces
                    only; for since the combined action of two forces puts the body into the same
                    state as if their equivalent alone had acted on it, we may suppose this to have
                    been the case, and then the action of a third force will produce a change on
                    this equivalent motion. The resulting motion will be the same as if only this
                    third force and the equivalent of the other two had acted on the body. Thus, in
                    fig. 10, the three forces AB, AC, AE, may act at once on a particle of matter.
                    Complete the parallelogram ABDC; the diagonal AD is the force which is generated
                    by AB and AC. Complete the parallelogram AEFD; the diagonal AF is the force
                    resulting from the combined action of the forces AB, AC, and AE. In like manner,
                    completing the parallelogram AGHF, the diagonal AH is the force resulting from
                    the combined action of AB, AC, AE, and AG, and so on of any number of forces.
                    ∙</p>
                <p>This resulting force and the resulting motion maybe much more expeditiously
                    determined, in any degree of composition, by drawing lines in the proportion and
                    direction of the forces in succession, each from the end of the preceding. Thus,
                    draw AB, BD, DF, FH, and join AH; AH is the resulting force. The demonstration
                    is evident.</p>
                <p>60. It is to be noticed here, that in the composition of more than two forces, we
                    are not limited to one plane. The force AD is in the same plane with AB and AC;
                    but AE may be elevated above this plane, and AG may lie below it. AF is in the
                    plane of AD and AE, and AH is in the plane of A F and AG.</p>
                <p>Complete the parallelograms ABLE, ACKE, ELFK. It is evident that ABLFKCD is a
                    parallelopiped, and thât AF is one of its diagonals. Hence∙we derive a more
                    general theorem of great use.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Three forces having the proportion and direction of the three
                    sides of a pαrallelopiped, compose a force having the proportion and direction

                <p>61. Any number of forces acting together on one par-∣ tide of matter are balanced
                    by a force that is equal and: opposite to their resulting force; for this force
                    would ba-1 lance their resulting force which is equivalent to them in <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> action. When this is duly considered, we perceive
                    that* each force is then in equilibrio with the equivalent of all <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193327854" xml:id="kp-eb0708-7854-0363"/>the others; for a force can
                    balance only what is equal and opposite to it. It appears very readily by the
                    geometrical construction. If, instead of the circuit A, B, D, F, H, we take B,
                    D, F, H, A, we have BA for the equivalent of the forces AC, AE, AG; but AB is
                    equal and opposite to BA. Therefore the force AB is in equilibrio with the
                    equivalent of all the others.</p>
                <p>62. When any number of forces act on one particle of matter, and are in
                    equilibrio, if they be considered as acting in parcels, the equivalents of these
                    parcels are in equilibrio; for let the forces AB, AC, AE, AG, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ah,</hi> be in equilibrio, and let them be considered in the two parcels AB,
                    AC, and AE, AG, <hi rend="italic">Ah,</hi> then AD is the equivalent of AB, BD
                    (or AC), and DA is the equivalent of DF, FH, HA (or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ah)</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> now AD and DA balance each other. This
                    corollary enables us to simplify many intricate complications of force; it also
                    enables us to draw accurate conclusions from very imperfect observations. In
                    most of our practical discussions we know, or at least we attend to, a part only
                    of the forces which are acting on a material particle; and in such cases we
                    reason as if we saw the whole: yet is our mathematical reasoning good with
                    respect to the equivalent of all the parcels which we are contemplating, and the
                    equivalents of the smaller parcels of which it consists; and the neglected
                    force, or parcel of forces, induces no error on our conclusions.</p>
                <p>63. In the spontaneous phenomena of nature, the investigation and discovery of
                    our ultimate object of search is frequently very’difficult, on account of the
                    multiplicity .of directions and intensities of the operating forces or mo- 1
                    tions. We may generally facilitate the process, by substituting equivalent
                    forces or motions acting in convenient</p>
                <p>•directions. It is in this way that the navigator computes the ship’s place with
                    very little trouble, by substituting equivalent motions in the meridional and
                    equatorial directions for the real oblique courses of the ship. Instead of
                    setting down ten miles on a course, S. 36° 52' W. he supposes that the ship has
                    sailed eight miles due south, and six miles due west, which brings her near to
                    the same place. Then, instead of fourteen miles south-west, he sets down ten
                    miles south and ten miles west; and he proceeds in the same way for every other
                    course and distance. He does this expeditiously by means of a traverse table, in
                    which are ready calculated the meridional and equatorial sides of right-angled
                    triangles, corresponding to every course and distance. Having done this for the
                    course of a whole day, he adds all the southings into one sum, and all the
                    westings into another; he considers these as forming the sides of a right-angled
                    triangle; he looks for them, paired together, in his traverse table, and then
                    notices what angle and what distance corresponds to this pair. This gives him
                    the position and magnitude of the straight line joining the beginning and end of
                    his day’s work.</p>
                <p>The miner proceeds in the same way when he takes the plan of subterraneous
                    workings, measuring, as he goes along, and noticing the bearing of each line by
                    the compass, and setting down, from his traverse table, the northing or
                    southing, and the easting or westing, for each oblique line: but there is
                    another circumstance which he must attend to, namely, the slope of the various
                    drifts, galleries, and other workings. This he does by noting the rise or the
                    dip of each sloping line. He adds all these into two sums, and taking the
                    risings from the dips, he obtains the whole dip. Thus he learns how far the
                    workings proceed to the north, how far to the east, and how far to the dip.</p>
                <p>The reflecting reader will perceive that the line joining the two extremities of
                    this progression will form the diagonal of a rectangular parallelopiped; one of
                    whose sides lies north and south, the other lies east and west, and the third is
                    right up and down.</p>
                <p>The mechanician proceeds in the very same way in the investigation of the very
                    complicated phenomena which frequently engage his attention. He considers every
                    motion as .compounded of three motions in some convenient directions, at right
                    angles to each other. He also considers every force as resulting from the joint
                    action of three forces, at right angles to each other, and takes the sum or
                    difference of these in the same or opposite directions. From this process he
                    obtains the three sides of a parallelopiped, and from these computes the
                    position and magnitude of the diagonal. This is the motion or force resulting
                    from the composition of all the partial ones.</p>
                <p>This procedure is called the <hi rend="italic">estimation</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">reduction</hi> of motions and forces.</p>
                <p>64. A motion or force AB (fig. 11) is said to be <hi rend="italic">estimated</hi>
                    in the direction EF, or to be <hi rend="italic">reduced</hi> to this direction
                    when it is conceived as compounded of the motions or forces AC, AD, one of
                    which, AC, is parallel to EF, and the other, AD, is perpendicular to it. This
                    expression is abundantly significant; for it is plain that the motion AD neither
                    promotes nor hinders the progress along EF, and that AC expresses the whole
                    progress in this direction.</p>
                <p>65. In like manner, a force AB (fig. 12) is said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >estimated in,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">reduced to,</hi> a given plane EFG when
                    it is conceived as resulting from the joint action of two forces</p>
                <p>AC, AD, one of which is parallel to a line <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> drawn in
                    that plane, and the other AD is perpendicular to it. The position of the line
                    <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> is determined by letting fall Bδ perpendicular to the
                    plane, and drawing 6P to the point P, in which BA meets the plane; then <hi
                    rend="italic">Aa</hi> being drawn parallel to B6, will cut off <hi rend="italic"
                    >ba,</hi> which is the reduction of the motion AB to the plane. Drawing AC
                    parallel to <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> and completing the parallelogram ACBD, it
                    is evident that the motion AB is equivalent to AD and AC, which is parallel to
                    <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> and the three forces AB, AC, AD, are, as they should
                    be, in one plane perpendicular to the plane EG.</p>
                <p>66. If three forces AB, AC, AD (fig. 13) are in equilibrio, and are reduced to
                    any one direction <hi rend="italic">dAl,</hi> or to one plane EFGH, the reduced
                    forces are also in equilibrio.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">First,</hi> let them be reduced to one direction d∕by drawing

                    ABLC must be a parallelogram, and AL is the force equivalent to AB and AC
                    combined; then, because the lines Dcř, Bδ, <hi rend="italic">Cc,</hi> LZ, are

                <p><hi rend="italic">Secondly,</hi> Let them be reduced to one plane, EFGH, and let
                    <hi rend="italic">aβ, ax,</hi> αδ, be the reduced forces. The lines Dδ, Aa, B∕3,
                    Cκ, Lλ, are all parallel, being perpendicular to the plane; therefore the planes
                    AB, <hi rend="italic">βa,</hi> and CL, λκ, are parallel, and α∕3, κλ, are
                    parallel. For similar reasons, <hi rend="italic">β</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∖</hi><hi rend="italic">, ax,</hi> are parallel; therefore α∕3λκ is a
                    parallelogram. Also, because the lines Dδ, Aα, Lλ, are parallel, and DA is equal
                    to AL; therefore δα is equal to αλ. But because α∕3λκ is a parallelogram, the
                    forces <hi rend="italic">aβ, ax,</hi> are equivalent to αλ; and αδ is equal and
                    opposite to αλ, and will balance it; and therefore will balance <hi
                    rend="italic">aβ</hi> and ακ, which are the reductions of AB and AC to the plane
                    EFGH, while αδ is the reduction of AD; therefore the proposition is
                    demonstrated.</p>
                <p>The most usual and the most useful mode of reduction is to estimate all forces in
                    the directions of three lines drawn from one point, at right angles to each
                    other, like the three plane angles of a rectangular chest, forming the length,
                    the breadth, and the depth of the chest. These are commonly called the three
                    co-ordinates. The resulting force will be the diagonal of this parallelopiped.
                    This process ocyurs in all disquisitions in which the mutual action of solids
                    and fluids is considered, and when the oscillation or rotation of detached free
                    bodies is the subject of discussion.</p>
                <p>67. The only other general theorem that remains to be deduced from this law of
                    motion is, that if a number of bodies are moving in any manner whatever, and an
                    equal force act on every particle of matter in the same or parallel directions,
                    their relative motions will suffer no change; for the motion of any body A (fig.
                    14), relative to another body B, which is also in motion, is compounded of the
                    real motion of A, and the opposite to the real motion of B; for let A move
                    uniformly from A to C, while B describes BD uniformly; draw AB, also draw AE
                    equal and parallel to BD; join EC, DC, ED. The motion of A, relative to B,
                    consists in its change of position and distance. Had A described AE, while B
                    described BD, there would have been no change of relative place or distance; but
                    A is now at C, and ÚC is its new direction and distance. The relative or
                    apparent motion of A therefore is EC. Complete the parallelogram ACFE; it is
                    plain that the motion EC is compounded of EF, which is equal and parallel to AC,
                    the real motion of A, and of EA, the equal and opposite to BD, the real motion
                    of B.</p>
                <p>Now let the motions of A and B sustain the same change; let the equal and
                    parallel motions AG, BH, be compounded with the motions AC and BD; or let forces
                    act at once on A and B, in the parallel directions AG, BH, and with equal
                    intensities; in either supposition, the resulting motions will be Ac, Brf, the
                    diagonals of the parallelograms AGcC and BH&lt;ζD. Construct the figure as
                    before, and we see that the relative motion is now <hi rend="italic">ec,</hi>
                    and that it is the same with EC both in respect of magnitude and position.</p>
                <p>Here we still see the constant analogy between the composition of motions and the
                    composition of forces. In the first case, the relative motions of things are not
                    changed, whatever common motion be compounded with them all; or, as it is
                    usually but inaccurately expressed, although the space in which they move be
                    carried along with any motion whatever. In the second case, the relative motions
                    and actions are not changed by any external force, however great, when equally
                    exerted on every particle in parallel directions.</p>
                <p>Thus it is that the evolutions of a fleet in a uniform current are the same, and
                    produced by the same means, as in still water. Thus it is that we walk about on
                    the surface of this globe in the same manner as if it neither revolved round the
                    sun, nor turned round its axis. Thus it is that the same strength of a bow will
                    communicate a certain velocity to an arrow, whether it is shot east, or west, or
                    north, or south. Thus it is that the mutual actions of sublunary bodies are the
                    same, in whatever directions they are exerted, and notwithstanding the very
                    great changes in their velocities by reason of the earth’s rotation and orbital
                    revolution. The real velocity of a body on the earth’s equator is about 3000
                    feet per second greater at midnight than at mid-day. For at midnight the motion
                    of rotation nearly conspires with the orbital motion, and at mid-day it nearly
                    opposes it. The difference between the velocities at the beginning of January
                    and the beginning of July is vastly greater. And at other times of the day, and
                    other seasons of the year, both motions of the earth are transversely compounded
                    with the easterly or westerly motion of an arrow or cannon bullet; yet we can
                    observe no change in the effects of the mutual actions of bodies.</p>
                <p>68. This is an important observation, because it proves that forces are to be
                    measured by no other scale than by the motions which they produce. We have had
                    repeated occasions to mention the very different estimation of moving forces by
                    Mr Leibnitz; and have shown how, by a very partial consideration of the action
                    of those natural powers called <hi rend="italic">pressures,</hi> he has
                    attempted to prove that moving forces are proportional to the squares of the
                    velocities; and we showed briefly in what manner a right consideration of what
                    passes when motion is produced by measurable pressures, proves that the forces
                    really exerted are as the velocities produced. But the most copious proof is had
                    from the present observation, that, in fact, the mutual actions of bodies depend
                    on their relative motions alone.</p>
                <p>69. The Leibnitzian measure of moving force is altogether incompatible with the
                    universal fact now mentioned, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193327880"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-7880-0365"/>viz. that the relative motions of bodies,
                    resulting from their mutual actions, are not affected by any common motion, or
                    the action of any equal and parallel force on both bodies; for this universal
                    fact imports, that when two bodies arc moving with equal velocities in the same
                    direction, a force applied to one of them, so as to increase its velocity, gives
                    it the same motion relative to the other, as if both bodies had been at rest.
                    Here it is plain that the space described by the body in consequence of the
                    primitive force, and of the force now added, is the sum of the spaces which each
                    of them would generate in a body at rest. Therefore the forces are proportional
                    to the velocities or changes of motion which they produce, and not to the
                    squares of those velocities. This measure of forces, or the position that a
                    force makes the same change on any velocity whatever, and the independence of
                    the relative motions on any motion that is the same on all the bodies of a
                    system, are counterparts of each other. Since this independence is a matter of
                    observation in all terrestrial bodies, we are entitled to say that the powers
                    which the Author of nature has imparted to natural bodies are no way different
                    from what are competent to matter once called into existence. And it also
                    follows from this, that we must always remain ignorant of the absolute motions
                    of bodies. The fact that it has required the unremitted study of ages to
                    discover even the relative motions of our solar system, is an argument to prove
                    that the influence of this mechanical principle extends far beyond the limits of
                    this sublunary world; nor has any phenomenon yet been exhibited which should
                    lead us to imagine that it is not universal.</p>
                <p>When we have made use of these arguments with some zealous partizans of Mr
                    Leibnitz’s doctrine, they have answered, that if indeed this independence of the
                    relative motions of terrestrial bodies were observed to obtain exactly, it would
                    be a conclusive argument. But the motion with which all is carried along is so
                    great in comparison with the motions which we can produce in our experiments,
                    that the small additions or diminutions thatwê can make to the velocity of this
                    common motion must observe very nearly the proportions of the additions or
                    diminutions of their squares. The differences of the squares of 2, 3, and 4, are
                    very unequal; but the differences of the squares of 9, 10, 11, are much nearer
                    to the ratio of equality; and the differences of the squares of 1000001,
                    1000002, 1000003, do not sensibly deviate from this ratio. But it is not fact
                    that we cannot produce motions which have a very sensible proportion to the
                    common motion. The motion of a cannon ball discharged with one third of its
                    weight of powder, is nearly equal to that of the rotation of the earth’s
                    equator. When, therefore, we discharge the ball eastward, we double its motion;
                    when to the westward, we destroy it. Therefore, according to Leibnitz, the
                    action in the first case is three times the action in the second. In the first
                    case it changes the square of the velocity (which we may call 1) from 1 to 4;
                    and, in the second, it changes it from 1 to 0. But, say the Leibnitzians, the
                    velocity of rotation is but of the orbital velocity of the earth, and our
                    observations of the velocities of cannon bullets are not sufficiently exact to
                    ensure us against an error of θ-∩-. But the latter observations on the peculiar
                    motions of the fixed stars concur in showing, that the sun, with his attending
                    planets, are carried along with a very great motion, which, in all probability,
                    has <hi rend="italic">a</hi> sensible ratio to the orbital motion of the earth.
                    This must make a prodigious change on the earth’s absolute motion, according as
                    her orbital motion conspires with, opposes, or crosses, this other motion; the
                    earth may even be at absolute rest in some points of its orbit. Thus will the
                    composition with the motions produced in our experiments be so varied that cases
                    <hi rend="italic">must</hi> occur when the difference of the results of the two
                    measures of force will be very sensible.</p>
                <p>But, further, they have not attended to the agreement of our experiments when the
                    discharges of cannon are made in a direction transverse to that of the common
                    motion. Here the immensity of the common motion, and the minuteness of our
                    experimental velocities, can have no effect in diminishing the difference of the
                    results of the two doctrines. This will appear distinctly to every reader who is
                    much conversant in disquisitions of this kind; and it is in these more moderate
                    motions that the complete independence of the relative motions on the common
                    motions most accurately appears. Pendulum clocks and watches have been often
                    executed which do not deviate from perfect equability of motion one part in
                    86,400. This could not be obtained in all directions of the oscillations, if the
                    forces deviated from the ratio of the velocities one part in 86,400.</p>
                <p>On the whole, we may consider it as established on the surest foundation, that
                    the action of those powers of natural bodies which we call <hi rend="italic"
                    >pressures,</hi> such as the force of springs, the exertions of animals, the
                    cohesion of bodies, as well as the action of those other incitements to motion
                    which we call <hi rend="italic">attractions</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >repulsions,</hi> süch as gravitation, magnetism, and electricity, is
                    proportional to the change of velocity produced by it. And we must observe here,
                    that this is not a mere mode of conception, the result of the laws of human
                    thought, which cannot conceive a natural power as the cause of motion otherwise
                    than by its producing motion, and which cannot conceive any degree of <hi
                    rend="italic">moving</hi> power different from the degree of the motion. This is
                    the abstract doctrine, and is true whether the pressures are proportional to the
                    velocities or to the squares of the velocities.</p>
                <p>But we see further, that whatever is the pressure of a spring (for example) on a
                    quiescent body, yet the pressure actually exerted in producing a double velocity
                    is only double, and not quadruple, as our first imperfect observations make us
                    imagine.</p>
                <p>70. Sir Isaac Newton has added another proposition to the number of laws of
                    motion; namely, that <hi rend="italic">every action is accompanied by an equal
                    and contrary re-action.</hi> But in affirming this to be a law of nature, he
                    only means that it is a universal fact: and he makes this affirmation on the
                    authority of what he conceives to be a law of human thought; namely, that those
                    qualities which we find in all bodies on which we can make experiments and
                    observations, are to be considered as universal qualities of body. But we have
                    limited the term <hi rend="italic">law of motion</hi> to those consequences that
                    necessarily flow from our notions of motion, of the causes of its production and
                    changes. Now this third Newtonian proposition is not such a result. A magnet is
                    said to act on a piece of iron, when, and only when, the vicinity of the magnet
                    is observed to be accompanied by certain motions of the iron. But it by no means
                    follows from this observation, that the presence of the iron shall be
                    accompanied by any motion, or any change of state whatever of the magnet, or any
                    appearance that can suggest the notion that the iron acts on the magnet. When
                    this was observed, it was accounted a discovery. Newton <hi rend="italic"
                    >discovered</hi> that the sun acts on the planets, and that the earth acts on
                    the moon; and Kepler <hi rend="italic">discovered</hi> that the moon re-acts on
                    the earth. Newton had observed that the iron re-acts on the magnet; that the
                    actions of electrified bodies were mutual; and that every action of sublunary
                    bodies was, in fact, accompanied by an equal and contrary re-action. On the
                    authority of his rule of philosophizing, he affirmed that the planets re-act on
                    the sun, and that the sun is not at rest, but is continually agitated<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193327893" xml:id="kp-eb0708-7893-0366"/> by a small motion
                    round the general centre of gravitation. He pointed out several consequences of
                    this reaction. Astronomers examined the celestial motions more narrowly, and
                    found that those consequences do really obtain, and disturb all the planetary
                    motions. It is now found that this reciprocity of action obtains throughout the
                    solar system with the utmost precision, and that the third Newtonian proposition
                    is really a law of nature, although it is not a law of human thought. It is a
                    discovery. The contrary involves no absurdity or contradiction. It would indeed
                    be contrary to experience; but things might have been otherwise. It is
                    conceivable and possible that a ball A shall strike another equal ball B, and
                    carry it along with it, without any diminution of its velocity. The fact that
                    the velocity of A is reduced to one half, is the indication of a force residing
                    in B, which force changes the motion of A; and the intensity of this force is
                    learned from the change which it produces. This is found to be equal to the
                    change produced by A on B. And thus the re-action of B is <hi rend="italic"
                    >discovered</hi> to be equal to the action of A.</p>
                <p>It is highly probable that this universality and equality of re-action to action
                    is the consequence of some general principle, which we may in time discover;
                    meanwhile we are entitled to suppose it universal, and to reason from this topic
                    in our disquisitions about the actions of bodies on each other.</p>
                <p>Although the celebrated philosophers of Europe have at last agreed in the
                    reception of the two propositions so largely discussed by us as the laws of
                    motion, they have differed exceedingly in their opinion about their origin and
                    validity. Some asserted that they are entirely matters of experience, while
                    others affirmed them to be necessary truths. The Royal Academy of Berlin made
                    this question the subject of their prize dissertation in the year 1744. Mr
                    Maupertuis, president of the academy, published a dissertation, in which he
                    endeavoured to prove that they are necessary truths, only because <hi
                    rend="italic">they are such as make the quantity of action the least
                    possible,</hi> an economy which is worthy of infinite wisdom, and therefore
                    certainly directs the choice of the Author of nature. On this account alone are
                    they necessary truths.</p>
                <p>But this is not the way to consider a question of this kind. We know too little
                    about infinite wisdom to be able to say, with Messrs Leibnitz and Maupertuis,
                    that the Deity should or should not impress on bodies laws different from those
                    which are essential to matter; and we are not to inquire whether God could or
                    could not do this. We know from our own experience, that matter, when subjected
                    to the action of intelligence, may be moved in a way extremely different from
                    what it would follow if left to itself, and that its motions may either be
                    regulated by fixed but contingent law, or may be without any constancy whatever,
                    and vary in every instance. When we suppose the existence of matter and motion,
                    a variety of truths are involved in the supposition, in the same manner as all
                    the theorems in the third book of Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> are
                    involved in the conception of a circle and a straight line. Our first employment
                    should be to evolve those truths. We can do this in no way but by first noticing
                    the relations of the ideas that we have of the different objects of
                    contemplation, and then following the laws of human thought in our judgments
                    concerning those relations. This process of the mind is expressed in the train
                    of a geometrical demonstration. The different parts or argumentations of this
                    train are not the causes of our conclusions, but the means by which we form our
                    judgment; not the reasons of the truth of our ultimate conclusion, but the steps
                    by which we arrive at the knowledge of it. The young geometer generally thinks
                    otherwise. But that this is the matter of fact, is plain from this, that more
                    than one demonstration, and often very different, can be given of the same
                    theorem. We must proceed in the same manner in the present question; and the
                    first general truths which we find involved in the notions of matter, motion,
                    and force, must be received as <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> truths. The
                    steps by which we arrive at the discovery are the laws of human thought; and the
                    expression of the discovery, involving both the truth itself, and the manner of
                    conceiving it, is a necessary law of motion. There may be other facts, perhaps
                    as general as any of those necessary laws, but which do not necessarily result
                    from the relations of our notions of motion and of force. These are discovered
                    by observation only, and they serve to characterize the forces which nature
                    presents to our view. These facts are <hi rend="italic">contingent</hi> laws of
                    motion.</p>
                <p>We apprehend that this method has been followed in treating this article. The
                    first proposition, termed <hi rend="italic">α law of motion,</hi> is only a more
                    convenient way of expressing our contemplation of a motion in body as an effect
                    of the general cause which we term <hi rend="italic">force.</hi> The second
                    proposition does nothing but express more distinctly the relation between this
                    cause and its effect; it expresses what we mean by the magnitude and the kind of
                    the cause. The proposition, stating the composition of forces, is but another
                    form of the same law, better suited to the ordinary procedure in geometrical
                    disquisitions.</p>
                <p>These propositions might have completed the doctrines of dynamics; but it appears
                    that, in order to the production of a material universe which should accomplish
                    the purposes of the Creator, it was necessary that there be certain
                    characteristic differences between the forces inherent in the various
                    collections of matter which compose this universe. The facts or physical laws
                    (for the above-mentioned laws are metaphysicaD of motion may be different from
                    those which would have been observed had matter been left entirely to itself.
                    This difference may have*introduced other laws of motion as necessarily
                    resulting from the nature of the forces. We have occasionally mentioned some
                    instances where this appears to obtain, but gave good reasons for affirming that
                    a due examination of all circumstances which may be observed in the production
                    or variation of motion by those forces, has demonstrated, that there are no such
                    deviations from the two laws of motion already determined, but that all the
                    mechanical powers of bodies, when considered merely as causes of motion, act
                    agreeably to the same laws. Careful examination was, however, said to be
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>This examination must consist in distinctly noticing the circumstances that occur
                    in the production of motion by any force whatever. It is by no means enough to
                    state simply the intensity of the force and the direction of its exertion. If a
                    force continue to act, it continues to vary the motion already produced. Should
                    the force change its intensity or direction while it is acting, these
                    circumstances must induce still farther changes in the motion; and it is not
                    till all action has ceased that the motion is brought to its ostensible state,
                    in which it is the object of our attention and our future discussions. Instances
                    of the effects of such continued and such varied actions are to be seen in most
                    of the phenomena of nature or art. The communication of motion by impulse is
                    perhaps the only instance (very frequent indeed) that can be produced where this
                    is not necessary; nay, we shall perhaps find reason to conclude that this
                    instance is not an exception, and that even the communication of motion from one
                    billiard ball to another is brought about by an action continued for some time,
                    and greatly varied during that time. Much preparation is therefore necessary
                    before we can apply the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193327906"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-7906-0367"/>general laws of motion to the solution of most of
                    the questions which come before us in the course even of our elementary
                    disquisitions. We must lay down some general propositions which determine the
                    results of the continued, and perhaps varied, actions of moving forces; and we
                    must mark the different effects of the simple continuation of action, and also
                    those of the variations in this continued action, both in respect of intensity
                    and direction. The effect of a mere continuance of action must be an
                    acceleration of the motion, or a retardation of it if the force continue to act
                    in the opposite direction. The effect of the continued action of a transverse
                    force must be a continual deflection, that is, a curvilineal motion. These must
                    therefore now occupy our attention in their order.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">of accelerated and retarded motions.</hi></p>
                <p>71. All men can perceive that a stone dropped from the hand, or sliding down an
                    uniform slope, has its motion continually accelerated, and that the motion of an
                    arrow rising perpendicularly through the air is continually retarded; and they
                    feel no difficulty in conceiving these changes of motion as the effects of the
                    continual operation of their weight or heaviness. The falling stone is in a
                    different condition in respect of motion in the beginning and end of its fall.
                    In what respect do these states of the body differ? Only in respect to what we
                    call its <hi rend="italic">velocity.</hi> This is an affection of motion; it is
                    an expression of the relation between the two notions or ideas which concur to
                    form the idea of motion, namely, the space and the time. These are all the
                    circumstances that we observe in a motion. Time elapses, and during its currency
                    a space is described. The term <hi rend="italic">velocity</hi> expresses the
                    magnitude of the space, which corresponds to some unit of time. Thus the rate of
                    a ship’s motion is determined when we say that it is nine miles in an hour, or
                    nine miles per hour. We sometimes say (but awkwardly) “the motion is at the rate
                    or with the velocity of a mile in three days.” It is most conveniently expressed
                    by a number of some given units of length, which completely make up the line
                    described during this unit of time. But the mechanicians express it in a way
                    more general by a fraction, of which the numerator is a number of inches, feet,
                    yards, fathoms, or miles, and the denominator is the number of seconds, minutes,
                    or hours employed in moving along this line. This is a very proper expression;
                    for when we speak of any velocity, and continue to reason from it, we conceive
                    ourselves to speak of something that remains the same, in the different
                    occasions of using the term. Now if the velocity be constant, it is indifferent
                    how long the line may be, because the time of its description will be lengthened
                    in the same proportion. Thus if 48 feet be described in 12 seconds, 36 feet will
                    be described in 9 seconds, 16 feet will be described in 4 seconds, &amp;c. Now
                    γ∣, <hi rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi><hi rend="italic">ŋ,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi>-^ <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi>, are fractions of
                    equal value, being equal to ∣, or 4, that is, to the velocity of 4 feet per
                    second. The value of this fraction, or the quotient of the number of the units
                    of length, divided by the number of units of time, is the number of those units
                    of length described uniformly in one unit of time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> But how shall we determine the velocity in any
                    instant or in any point of a motion that is continually changing? Suppose that a
                    body has fallen 144 feet, and that we would ascertain its velocity in that point
                    of its fall, or the velocity which it has in passing through that point. In the
                    next second the body falls 112 feet farther. This cannot be the measure of the
                    velocity at the beginning of the fourth or the end of the third second. It is
                    too great. The fall during the preceding second was 80 feet. This is too</p>
                <p>ιι mi <hi rend="subscript"> fłł&gt;</hi>, 80 + 112 192</p>
                <p>small. 1he mean of these two, or , = -ğ- = 96, is probably more exact. Due
                    attention to the nature of this motion shows us that 96 is the proper measure,
                    or that the motion at that instant is at the rate of 96 feet per second. But it
                    is peculiar to this kind of motion that the half sum of the spaces described in
                    two succeeding equal moments is the measure of the velocity in the middle
                    instant. Therefore this method will not generally give an accurate measure. Yet
                    it is indispensably necessary to obtain some accurate measure; for it is in this
                    particular alone that the state of the body differs from its similar state in
                    another instant. The difference of place makes no distinction; for if a body
                    continue its motion unchanged, its condition in every different instant of time,
                    or point of space, is unchanged, or the same. The change of place is not a
                    change of motion, but is involved in the very conception of the continuation of
                    the motion. The change of condition consists, therefore, in the change of
                    velocity: therefore the change of velocity is the only indication and the only
                    measure of the action (perhaps accumulated) of the changing force. It is
                    therefore the chief object of our search; and accurate measures of velocity are
                    absolutely necessary.</p>
                <p>72. When the velocity changes continually, there can be no <hi rend="italic"
                    >actual</hi> measure of it. In what then does the magnitude of a velocity
                    consist, when there is no actual measure of it? It is a certain undescribable
                    <hi rend="italic">determination,</hi> by which, if not changed, a certain space
                    <hi rend="italic">would</hi> be uniformly described in a given unit of time.
                    Thus we know, that if, when a stone has fallen sixteen feet, its motion be
                    directed along a horizontal plane, without diminution, it will move on for ever
                    at the rate of thirty-two feet per second. The space which would be thus
                    described is not the velocity, but the measure of the velocity. But the
                    proportions of those spaces, being the proportions of those measures, are the
                    proportions of the velocities themselves. We may discover these proportions in
                    the following manner:</p>
                <p>Let ACG (fig. 15) be a line described by a body with a motion any how continually
                    but gradually varied; and let it be required to determine the proportion of the
                    velocity in any point C to the velocity in any other point F.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Axiom.</hi> —If A be to B in a ratio that is greater than
                    any ratio less than that of C to D, but less than any ratio greater than that of
                    C to D, then A is to B as C to D.</p>
                <p>Take the straight line <hi rend="italic">acg</hi> to represent the time of the
                    body’s motion along ACG, so that the points <hi rend="italic">a, c,f g,</hi> may
                    represent the instants of time in which the body passes through the points A, C,
                    F, G; and the portions αc, <hi rend="italic">cf,fg,</hi> of the line <hi
                    rend="italic">ag,</hi> may represent the times employed in describing the
                    portions AC, CF, FG; and therefore <hi rend="italic">ac</hi> is to <hi

                <p>Moreover, let <hi rend="italic">hlino</hi> be a line so related to the straight
                    line <hi rend="italic">acfg,</hi> by the perpendicular ordinates <hi
                    rend="italic">ah, ch, fn, go,</hi> that the areas <hi rend="italic">achh, afnh,

                    by the moving body; and let this relation be true with respect to every point B,

                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Then it is affirmed that <hi rend="italic">the velocity in the point</hi> C <hi
                    rend="italic">is to the velocity in the point</hi> F <hi rend="italic">as ch is

                    passing at the instants <hi rend="italic">b, d, e, g.</hi> Then the areas <hi
                    rend="italic">bihe, chid, emnf, fnog,</hi> will represent, and be proportional
                    to, the spaces BC, CD, EF, FG, which are described during the moments <hi

                <p>If the motions had been uniform during the moments <hi rend="italic">bc</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">fg,</hi> that is, if the spaces BC and FG had been uniformly
                    described, then the velocity in the point C would have been to the velocity in
                    the point F as <hi rend="italic">cp</hi> to <hi rend="italic">fs</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> for since the rectangles <hi rend="italic">btpe</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">fsxg</hi> are respectively equal to the trapeziums <hi
                    rend="italic">bihe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fnog,</hi> and since <hi
                    rend="italic">bihe</hi> is to <hi rend="italic">fnog</hi> as BC is to FG, the
                    rectangle <hi rend="italic">btpe</hi> is to the rectangle <hi rend="italic"
                    >fsxg</hi> as BC to FG. But because these two rectangles have equal altitudes
                    <hi rend="italic">bc</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fg,</hi> they are to each other
                    in the proportion of their bases <hi rend="italic">cp</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >gx,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cp</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fs.</hi> Therefore
                    BC is to FG as <hi rend="italic">cp</hi> to <hi rend="italic">fs.</hi> But if BC
                    and FG are uniformly described in equal times, they are proportional to the
                    velocities of those uniform motions. Therefore <hi rend="italic">cp</hi> is to
                    <hi rend="italic">fs</hi> as the velocity with which BC is uniformly described
                    to the velocity with which FG is uniformly described in an equal time.</p>
                <p>But the motion expressed by the figure is not uniform, because the line <hi
                    rend="italic">hlo</hi> recedes from the axis <hi rend="italic">ag,</hi> and the
                    areas, cut off by the parallel ordinates, increase in a greater proportion than
                    the corresponding parts of the axis; that is, the spaces increase faster than
                    the times; for the moments <hi rend="italic">bc, cd, er, fg,</hi> being all
                    equal, it is evident that the corresponding slips of the area continually
                    augment. The motion is swifter at the instant <hi rend="italic">c</hi> than at
                    the instant <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and the velocity at the instant <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> is <hi rend="italic">greater</hi> than that with which the
                    space BC would be uniformly described in the same time. For the same reason, the
                    velocity at the instant <hi rend="italic">f</hi> is fess .than that with which
                    the space FG would be uniformly described in the same time. Therefore the
                    velocity at the instant <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is to the velocity at the
                    instant <hi rend="italic">f</hi> in a greater ratio than that of <hi
                    rend="italic">cp</hi> to <hi rend="italic">fs.</hi> In the very same manner, it
                    will appear, by comparing the motion during the moment <hi rend="italic">cd</hi>
                    with the motion during the moment <hi rend="italic">er,</hi> that the velocity
                    at the instant <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is to the velocity at the instant yin a
                    less ratio than that of <hi rend="italic">cq</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                    >fr.</hi></p>
                <p>Therefore the velocity in the point C is to the velocity in the point F in a
                    greater ratio than that of <hi rend="italic">cp</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                    >fs,</hi> but in a less ratio than that of <hi rend="italic">cq</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">fr.</hi></p>
                <p>But by continually diminishing the equal moments ⅛, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >cćZ,</hi><hi rend="italic">er, fg,</hi> it is evident that <hi rend="italic"
                    >cp</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cq</hi> continually approach to equality with <hi
                    rend="italic">ch,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fr</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >fs</hi> continually approach to equality with <hi rend="italic">fn</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> that whencp is less than <hi rend="italic">ch,fs</hi> is
                    greater than <hi rend="italic">fn,</hi> and when <hi rend="italic">cq</hi> is
                    greater than <hi rend="italic">ch,fr</hi> is less than∕n.</p>
                <p>Therefore the velocity in the point C is to the velocity in the point F in a
                    ratio that is greater than the ratio of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> line less
                    than <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> to <hi rend="italic">any</hi> line greater than
                    <hi rend="italic">fn,</hi> but which is less than the ratio of any line greater
                    than <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> to any line less than <hi rend="italic">fn.</hi>
                    Therefore the ratio of the velocity in C to the velocity in F is greater than
                    any ratio that is less than that of <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">fn</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but it is less than any ratio that
                    is greater than that of <hi rend="italic">eh</hi> to <hi rend="italic">fn.</hi>
                    Therefore the velo city in the point C is to the velocity in the point F as <hi

                    &amp;c. are proportional to the times in which they are described, and may
                    therefore be taken to measure or to represent those times.</p>

                    FG, or CD, EF of the spaces generated in very small and equal times.</p>
                <p>It is also evident, that because the ratio of <hi rend="italic">ck</hi> to <hi

                    >cp</hi> to <hi rend="italic">fs</hi> and of the ratio <hi rend="italic">of cq
                    tofr,</hi> these ultimate ratios are the same, and that we may say that the
                    velocity in C is to the velocity in F in the ultimate ratio of BC to EF, or in
                    the ultimate ratio of CD to FG.</p>
                <p>We also can easily perceive that the ratio of the area <hi rend="italic"

                    ratio of <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> to <hi rend="italic">fn</hi> as we take the
                    moments <hi rend="italic">bc</hi> and <hi rend="italic">er</hi> smaller.
                    Therefore, in many cases of practice, where it may be easy to measure the spaces
                    described in the different small moments of the motion, but difficult to
                    ascertain their ultimate ratio, so as to obtain accurate measures of <pb

                    proportions of the velocities, we may reduce the errors I of measurement to
                    something very insignificant, by taking <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> these
                    moments extremely small; and we shall diminish , the error still more by taking
                    the proportion of the half sum of BC and CD to the half sum of EF and FG for the
                    proportion of the velocities in C and F.</p>
                <p>It often happens that we have it not in our power to compare the spaces described
                    in small moments which are precisely equal. Still we can find the exact
                    proportion of the velocities, if we can ascertain the ultimate ratio of the
                    increments of the spaces, and the ultimate ratio of the moments of time in which
                    these increments are described; for it is plain, by considering the gradual
                    approach of the points <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">τ</hi> to
                    the points <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> that the ratio
                    of <hi rend="italic">eh</hi> to <hi rend="italic">fn</hi> is still the ultimate
                    ratio of the bases of rectangles equal to the mixtilineal areas, whether the
                    altitudes (representing the moments) are equal or not. Now the bases of two
                    rectangles are in the proportion of the rectangles directly, and of their
                    altitudes inversely. But the ultimate ratio of the altitudes is the ultimate
                    ratio of the moments, and the ultimate ratio of the rectangles is the ultimate
                    ratio of the spaces described in those unequal moments. Therefore, in such
                    cases, we have,</p>

                <p>It most commonly happens that we can only observe the accumulated results of
                    varied motions, and in them we only observe a space passed over, and a certain
                    portion of time that has elapsed during the motion; but being able to
                    distinguish the portions of the whole space which are described in known
                    portions of the whole time, and having made such observations in several parts
                    of the motion, we discover the general law that the motion affects, and we
                    affirm this law to hold universally, even though we have not observed it in <hi
                    rend="italic">every</hi> point. We do this with a degree of probability and
                    confidence proportioned to the frequency of our observation. It is not till we
                    have done this that we can make use of the first of these two propositions,
                    which enables us to ascertain the velocity of the motion in its different
                    moments. Thus, if we observe that a stone in falling descends one foot in the
                    quarter of a second, 16 feet in a second, 64 feet in two seconds, and 144 feet
                    in three seconds, the general law immediately observed is, “that the spaces
                    described are as the squares of the times for 1 is to 16 as the square of į to
                    the square of L Again, 16 is to 64 as 1 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> to 2 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, and 16 is to 144 as 1 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    to 3 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. Hence we infer, with great probability,
                    that the stone would fall 36 feet in a second and a half; for 16 is to 36 as l
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> to I&lt;} <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>; and we
                    conclude in the same way for all other parts of the motion.</p>
                <p>78. This immediate observation of the analogy between the spaces and the squares
                    of the times suggests an easy determination of the velocity in this particular
                    kind of motion, and it merits particular notice, being very often referred to.
                    We can take <hi rend="italic">ag</hi> to represent the time, and then, because
                    the areas which are to represent the spaces described must be proportioned to
                    the squares of the portions of <hi rend="italic">ag,</hi> we perceive that the
                    line which comes in place of <hi rend="italic">hho</hi> must be a straight line
                    drawn from <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for example, the
                    straight line <hi rend="italic">aδγ</hi>; for this is the only boundary which
                    will give areas <hi rend="italic">abβ, aeκ, adδ,</hi> &amp;c. proportional to
                    <hi rend="italic">alr, ae</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">, ad</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >,</hi> &amp;c. And we perceive that <hi rend="italic">any</hi> straight line
                    drawn from <hi rend="italic">a</hi> will have this property.</p>
                <p>Having thus got our representations of the times and the spaces, we say, on the
                    authority of our theorem, that the velocity at the instant <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> is to the velocity at the instant <hi rend="italic">d</hi> as <hi
                    rend="italic">bβ</hi> to <hi rend="italic">do,</hi> &amp;c. And now we begin to
                    make inferences purely geometrical, and express our discovery of the velocities
                    in a very general and simple manner.&lt; We remark, that <hi rend="italic"
                    >bβ</hi> is to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> as <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> is to <hi
                    rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and we make the same affirmation
                    concerning the magnitudes represented by these lines. We say that the velocity
                    at the instant <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is to the velocity at the instant <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> as the time <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> is to the time <hi
                    rend="italic">ad.</hi> We say, in terms still more general, that the velocities
                    are proportional to the times from the beginning of the motion. We moreover
                    perceive, that the spaces are <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> In this article, as
                    originally printed, the symbols <hi rend="italic">s, ì,</hi> and <hi

                <p>also proportional to the squares of the acquired velocities; or the velocities
                    are as the square roots of the spaces.</p>
                <p>We can further infer, from the properties of the triangle, that the momentary
                    increments of the spaces are proportional to the momentary increments of the
                    squares of the times, or of the squares of the velocities.</p>
                <p>We also observe, that not only the whole acquired velocities are proportional to
                    the whole elapsed times, but that the increments of the velocities are
                    proportional to the times in which they are acquired; for <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">of,</hi> &amp;c. Equal increments of velocity are therefore
                    acquired in equal times. Therefore such a motion may, in great propriety of
                    language, be denominated a <hi rend="italic">uniformly accelerated

                    ratio of the times form the ostensible characteristic of an uniformly

                <p>79. Lastly, if we draw sλ parallel to the axis <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> we
                    perceive that the rectangle <hi rend="italic">ααλ</hi> is double of the triangle
                    <hi rend="italic">act.</hi> Now, because <hi rend="italic">ae</hi> represents

                    which would be uniformly described with the velocity <hi rend="italic">eg</hi>
                    during the time <hi rend="italic">ae.</hi> But the triangle <hi rend="italic"
                    >aei</hi> represents the space really described with the uniformly accelerated
                    motion during the same time. Hence we infer, that the space that is described in
                    any time, with a motion increasing uniformly from nothing, is one half of the
                    space which would be uniformly described during the same time with the final
                    velocity.</p>
                <p>These are but a part of the inferences which we may draw from the geometrical
                    properties of those representations which we had selected of the different
                    measureable affections of motion. We may affirm, with respect to the motions
                    themselves, all the inferences which relate to magnitude and proportion, and
                    thus improve our knowledge of the motions.</p>
                <p>We took the opportunity of this very simple and perspicuous example, to give our
                    readers a just conception of the <hi rend="italic">mathematical method</hi> of
                    prosecuting mechanical knowledge, and to make them sensible of the
                    unquestionable authority for every theorem deduced in this manner.</p>
                <p>One of the most important is, to discover the accumulated result of a motion of
                    which we only observe the momentary increments. This is to be done by finding
                    the area, or portions of the area, of the mixtilineal space <hi rend="italic"
                    >agoh</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and it is evidently analogous to the inverse
                    method of fluxions, or the integral calculus.</p>
                <p>In most cases, we must avail ourselves of the corollary <hi rend="italic">ds ==
                    vdt,</hi> and we obtain the solution of our question only in the cases where our
                    knowledge of the quantities <hi rend="italic">ds, dt,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >v</hi> (considered as geometrical magnitudes, that is, as lines and surfaces),
                    enables us to discover 5 and <hi rend="italic">t.</hi></p>
                <p>OF ACCELERATING AND RETARDING FORCES.</p>
                <p>80. Having thus discovered the proportions of the velocities in motions varying
                    in any manner whatever, we can observe the variations which happen in them.
                    These variations are the effects, and the only marks and measures, of the
                    changing forces. They are the characteristics of their kinds (considered merely
                    as moving forces); that is, the indications of the directions in which they act;
                    for this is the only difference <hi rend="italic">in hind</hi> of which they are
                    susceptible in this general point of view. If they increase the velocity, their
                    direction must be conceived as the same with that of the previous motion;
                    because the result of the action of a force is equivalent to the composition of
                    the motion which that force would produce in a quiescent body with the motion
                    already existing; and an increase of velocity is equivalent to the composition
                    of a motion in the same direction.</p>
                <p>Having no other mark of the force but the acceleration, we have no other name for
                    it in the abstract doctrines of dynamics, and we call it an <hi rend="italic"
                    >accelerating force.</hi> Had it retarded the motion, we should have called it a
                    <hi rend="italic">retarding force.</hi></p>
                <p>In like manner we have no measure of the <hi rend="italic">magnitude</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">intensity</hi> of an accelerating force, but the acceleration
                    which it produces. In order therefore to investigate the powers which produce
                    all the changes of motion, we must endeavour to obtain measures of the
                    acceleration.</p>
                <p>A continual increase of velocity is the effect of the continued action of
                    accelerating forces. If equal increments of velocity are produced in every
                    succeeding equal moment of time, we cannot conceive that there is any change in
                    the accelerating force. Therefore a uniformly accelerated motion is the mark of
                    the unvaried action of an accelerating force, that is, of the continued action
                    of a constant force; of a force whose intensity is always the same. When
                    therefore we observe a body describe spaces proportional to the squares of the
                    times, we must infer that it is urged forward by a force whose intensity does
                    not change; and, on the other hand, a constant force must produce a uniformly
                    accelerated motion by its continued action. And if any previous circumstances
                    assure us of this continued action of an invaried force, we may make all the
                    inferences which were mentioned under the article of uniformly accelerated
                    motion.</p>
                <p>81. That force must surely be accounted double which produces a double increment
                    of velocity in the same time by its uniform action; we can form no other
                    estimation of its magnitude. And in general, <hi rend="italic">accelerating
                    forces must be accounted proportional to the increments of velocity which they
                    produce, by acting uniformly during the same or equal times.</hi></p>
                <p>Supposing them to act on a body at rest. Then the velocity produced is itself the
                    increment; and we must say that accelerating forces are proportional to the
                    velocities which they generate in a body in equal times. And because we found
                    (No. 79), that the space described with a uniformly accelerated motion is half
                    the space which would be uniformly described in the same time with the final
                    velocity, which space is the direct measure of this velocity, and because halves
                    have the same proportion with the wholes—we may say that <hi rend="italic"
                    >accelerating forces are proportional to the spaces through which they impel a
                    body from rest in equal times by their uniform action.</hi></p>
                <p>This is an important remark; because it gives us an easy measure of the force,
                    without the trouble of first computing the velocities. It also gives as the only
                    distinct notion that we have of the measurement of forces by the motions which
                    they produce. When speaking of the composition of forces, we distinguished or
                    denominated them by the sides and diagonal of a parallelogram. These lines must
                    be conceived as proportional to the spaces through which the forces urge the
                    body <hi rend="italic">uniformly</hi> during the small and insensible time of
                    their action, which time is supposed to be the same for both forces; for the
                    sides of the parallelogram are supposed to be separately described in equal
                    times, and therefore to be proportional to the velocities generated by the
                    constituent forces. If indeed the forces do not act uniformly, nor similarly,
                    nor during equal times, we cannot say (without farther investigation) what is
                    the proportion of the intensity of the forces, nor can we infer the composition
                    of their action. We must at least suppose, that in every instant of this very
                    small time of their joint action, their direction remains unchanged, and that
                    their intensities are in the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193327958"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-7958-0371"/>same ratio. We shall see by and by, that with
                    these conditions the sides of the parallelogram are still proportional to the
                    velocities generated. In the mean time we may take the spaces through which a
                    body is uniformly impelled from rest (that is, with a uniformly accelerated
                    motion) as the measures of the forces; yet these spaces are but the halves of
                    the measures of the velocities. Then, if a body be moving with the velocity of
                    thirty-two feet per second, and an accelerating force acts on it during a
                    second, and if this force be such that it would impel the body (from a state of
                    rest) sixteen feet, it will add to the body a velocity of thirty-two feet per
                    second.· Accordingly, this is the effect of gravity—the weight of a pound of
                    lead may be considered as a force which does not vary in its intensity. We know
                    that it will cause the lead to fall sixteen feet in a second; but if the body
                    has already fallen sixteen feet, we know that it is then moving with the
                    velocity of thirty-two feet per second. And the fact is, that it will fall
                    forty-eight feet farther in the next second, and will have acquired the velocity
                    of sixty-four feet per second. It has therefore received an augmentation of
                    thirty-two feet of velocity by the action of gravity during the second second;
                    and gravity is in fact a constant force, causing equal increments of velocity in
                    equal times, however great the velocities may be. It does not act like a stream
                    of fluid, whose impulse or action diminishes as the solid body withdraws from it
                    by yielding.</p>
                <p>But supposing that we have not compared the increments of velocity uniformly
                    acquired during equal times, in what manner shall we measure the accelerating
                    forces? In such a case that force must be accounted double which generates the
                    same velocity, by acting uniformly during half the time; for when the force is
                    supposed invariable, the changes of velocity which it produces are proportional
                    to the times of its action; therefore if it produces an equal velocity in half
                    the time, it will produce a double velocity in an equal time, and is therefore a
                    double force. The same maybe said of every proportion of time in which an equal
                    change of velocity is produced by the uniform action of an accelerating force.
                    The force must be accounted greater in the same proportion that the time
                    required for the production of a given velocity in a body is less. Hence we
                    infer that <hi rend="italic">accelerating forces are inversely proportional to
                    the times in which a given change of velocity is produced by their uniform
                    action.</hi></p>
                <p>82. By combining these two propositions, we establish this general theorem:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">[Accelerating forces are proportional to the changes of
                    velocity which they produce in a body by their uniform action directly, and to
                    the times in which these changes are produced inversely.</hi></p>
                <p>If, therefore, A and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> are the forces, V' and <hi
                    rend="italic">v'</hi> the changes of velocity, and T' and <hi rend="italic"
                    >t’</hi> the portions of time in which they are uniformly produced, we have</p>
                <p>V' √ A: <hi rend="italic">a = V't’</hi>: √T', = ⅛: y and <hi rend="italic">α

                <p>The formula <hi rend="italic">a ==</hi> — is not restricted to any particular
                    magnitude of <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">t’.</hi> It is true,
                    therefore, when the portion of time is diminished without end; for since the
                    action is supposed uniform, the increment of velocity is lessened in the same
                    proportion, and the value of the frac- <hi rend="italic">. v</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">. -,</hi> tion — remains the
                    same. The characters or symbols <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >t’</hi> are commonly used to express <hi rend="italic">finite</hi> portions of
                    <hi rend="italic">v</hi> and ž. The symbols <hi rend="italic">v</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> are used by Newton to express the same things taken in the
                    ultimate or limiting ratio. (These have been changed to <hi rend="italic"
                    >dv</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dt</hi> throughout this article.) They are
                    usually considered as <hi rend="italic">indefinitely small</hi> portions of <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi> and <hi rend="italic">t.</hi> We shall abide by the formula
                    <hi rend="italic">a =</hi></p>
                <p>83. It must always be kept in mind, that <hi rend="italic">v</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> are abstract numbers; and that <hi rend="italic">v</hi>
                    refers to some unit of space, such as a foot, an inch, a yard; and that <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> refers to some unit of time, such as an hour, a minute, a
                    second; and especially that <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is the number of the same
                    units of space, which will be uniformly described in <hi rend="italic">one</hi>
                    unit of the time with the velocity generated, by the force acting uniformly
                    during <hi rend="italic">that</hi> unit. It is twice the space actually
                    described by the body during that unit when impelled from rest by the
                    accelerating force. It is necessary to keep hold of these clear ideas of the
                    quantities expressed by the symbols.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, when the measure of the accelerating force is previously
                    known, we employ the theorem <hi rend="italic">at = v'</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> that is, the addition made to the velocity during the whole or any part
                    of the time of the action of the force is obtained by multiplying the
                    acceleration of one unit of time by the number of such units contained in <hi
                    rend="italic">t'.</hi></p>
                <p>These are evidently leading theorems in dynamics, because all the mechanical
                    powers of nature come under the predicament of accelerating or retarding forces.
                    It is the collection of these in any subject, and the manner in which they
                    accompany or are inherent in it, which determine the mechanical character of
                    that subject; and therefore the phenomena by which they are brought into view
                    are the characteristic phenomena. Nay, it may even be questioned whether the
                    phenomena bring any thing more into view. This force, of which we speak so
                    familiarly, is no object of distinct contemplation; it is merely <hi
                    rend="italic">dν</hi> a something that is proportional to —. And when we
                    ob-d’V</p>
                <p>serve that the -≈=,, found in the motions that result from αl the vicinity of a
                    body A, is double of the which results from the vicinity of another body B, we
                    say that a force resides in A, and that it is double of the force residing in B.
                    The accelerations are the things immediately and truly expressed by these
                    symbols. And the whole science of dynamics may be completely taught without once
                    employing the word <hi rend="italic">force,</hi> or the conception which we
                    imagine that we form of it. It is of no use till we come to study the mechanical
                    history of bodies. Then, indeed, we must have some way of expressing the fact,
                    32 fθθt that an acceleration = —p— is observed in every thing on the surface of
                    this globe; and that an acceleration 4 ’ 18 fθθt</p>
                <p>= —— is observed over all the surface of the sun.</p>
                <p>These facts are characteristic of this earth and of the sun; and we express them
                    shortly by saying that such and such forces reside in the earth and in the sun.
                    It will preserve us from many mistakes and puzzling doubts, if we resolutely
                    adhere to this meaning of the term <hi rend="italic">force</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and this will carry mathematical evidence through the whole of our
                    investigations.</p>
                <p>84. As velocity is not an immediate object of contemplation, and all that we
                    observe of motion is a space and a time, it may be proper to give an expression
                    of this measure of accelerating force which involves no other idea. Supposing
                    the body to have been previously at rest, we <pb break="no" facs="nls:193327971"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-7971-0372"/><hi rend="italic">V ∙</hi> have α==-. Multiply
                    both parts of the fraction by <hi rend="italic">t</hi> which does not change its
                    value, and we have <hi rend="italic">a ==</hi><hi rend="italic">s</hi> But <hi
                    rend="italic">vt — s;</hi> and therefore <hi rend="italic">a == r</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">§</hi></p>
                <p>The formula <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> is equivalent to the
                    proportion ∕ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∙. 1=s: <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">α</hi> would then be the space
                    through which the accelerating force would impel the body in one unit of the
                    time <hi rend="italic">t.</hi> But this is only half of the measure of the
                    velocity which the accelerating force generates during that unit of time. For
                    this reason we did not express the accelerating force by an ordinary equation,
                    but used the symbol ==. In this case, therefore, of uniform action, we 2s may
                    express the accelerating force by <hi rend="italic">a =</hi></p>
                <p>85. The following theorem is of still more extensive use in all dynamical

                <p>Let A'B, A'C, and AD (fig. 16) be three lines, described in the same or equal
                    times by the uniform action of accelerating forces; the motions along these
                    lines will be uniformly accelerated, and the lines themselves will be
                    proportional to the forces, and may be employed as their measures. On the
                    greatest of them, AD, describe the semicircle ABCD, and apply the other two
                    lines A'B, A ʹ C as chords</p>
                <p>AB, AC. Draw EB, FC perpendicular to AD. Take any small portions B6, Cc of AB and

                <p>Then, because the triangles DAB and BAE are similar, we have AD: AE = AD <hi

                    to AB as the velocity generated at D is to the velocity generated at B (the
                    times being equaD, we have AD to ÁE as the square of the velocity at D to the

                <p>AD: AE = V <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, D: V <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>,

                <p>For the same reasons we have also</p>

                <p>But because in any uniformly accelerated motion, the spaces are as the squares of

                <p>AE: <hi rend="italic">Αe =</hi> V <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, B: V <hi

                <p>AF: A∕ = V <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, C: V⅛.</p>
                <p>Therefore Ee is to <hi rend="italic">if</hi> as the increment of the square of
                    the velocity acquired in the motion along Bó to the increment of the square of

                <p>But by similarity of the triangles ABD and EeA, we have</p>
                <p>AB: AD = Ee: EΛ; and in like manner,</p>
                <p>AD: AC = FÄ: F∕. Therefore</p>

                <p>Now AB and AC are proportional to the forces which accelerate the body along the

                    >Remark.</hi> —Because the motion along any of these three lines is uniformly
                    accelerated, the relation between spaces, times, and velocities, may be
                    represented by means of the triangle ABC (fig. 17); where AB represents the
                    time, BC the velocity, and ABC the space. If BC be taken equal to AB, the
                    triangle is half of the square ABC F of the velocity BC; and the triangle ADE is
                    half of the square ADEG of the velocity DE. Let <hi rend="smallcaps">DíZ</hi>
                    and Bδ be two moments of time, equal or unequal. Then DdeEand BócC are half the
                    increments of the squares of the velocities DE and BC, acquired during the
                    moments Dcř and Bó. It was demonstrated that the ratio of the area DíZeE to the
                    area BôcC is compounded of the ratio of DE to BC, and the ultimate ratio of DrZ
                    to Bó. But Dd and Bó are respectively equal to <hi rend="italic">ιe</hi> and κc.
                    Therefore D√eE is to BòcC, in the ratio compounded of the ratio of DE to BC. and
                    the ultimate ratio of <hi rend="italic">οe</hi> to <hi rend="italic">κc.</hi> If
                    we represent DE and BC by V and <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> then εe and <hi
                    rend="italic">×c</hi> must be represented by V' and <hi rend="italic">v</hi> ’

                    rend="italic">;</hi> and then the compound ratio will be the ratio of VV' to
                    vzf; and if we take the ultimate ratio of the moments, and consequently the
                    ultimate ratio of the increments of the velocities, we have the ratio of V¢ZV to
                    <hi rend="italic">vdv.</hi> If therefore V <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> and

                    the increments of those squares, but half the increments of them.</p>
                <p>We may now represent this proposition concerning accelerating forces by the

                    rend="italic">a</hi> is that number of units of the scale on which S and s are

                <p>This will be more clearly conceived by taking an example. Let us ascertain the
                    accelerative power of gravity, supposing it to act uniformly on a body. Let the
                    spaces be measured in feet and the time in seconds. It is a matter of
                    observation, that when a body has fallen 64 feet, it has acquired a velocity of
                    64 feet per second; and that when it has fallen 144 feet, it has acquired the
                    velocity of 96 feet per second. We want to determine what velocity gravity
                    communicated to it by acting on it during one second. We have V <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = 9216, and + = 4096; and therefore V <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> — + = 5120. S = 144, and s = 64, and 5120</p>
                <p>S— s = 80, and 2 (S — <hi rend="italic">s) =</hi> 160. Now <hi rend="italic">a
                    =</hi>, = 32.</p>
                <p>160</p>
                <p>Therefore gravity has generated the velocity 32 feet per second by acting
                    uniformly during one second.</p>
                <p>86. <hi rend="italic">The augmentation of the square of the velocity is
                    proportional to the force and to the space jointly.</hi> For, because α =⅛ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi>, we have <hi rend="italic">ads</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi><hi rend="italic">vdv.</hi><hi rend="italic">ds</hi></p>
                <p>Thus we learn, that a given force, acting uniformly on a body along a given
                    space, produces the same increment of the square of the velocity, whatever the
                    previous velocity may have been. Also, in the same manner as we formerly found
                    that the augmentation of the velocity was proportioned to the time during which
                    the force has acted, so the augmentation of the square of the velocity is
                    proportional to the space along which it has acted.</p>
                <p>It is pretty plain, that all that we have said of the uniform action of an <hi
                    rend="italic">accelerating</hi> force may be affirmed of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >retarding</hi> force, taking a diminution or decrement of velocity in place of
                    an increment. A uniformly retarded motion is that in which the decrements of
                    velocity in equal terms are equal, and the whole decrements are proportional to
                    the whole times of action. Such a motion is the indication of a constant or
                    invariable force acting in a direction opposite to that of the motion. We
                    conceive this to be the case, when an arrow is shot perpendicularly upwards; its
                    weight is conceived as a force continually pressing it perpendicularly
                    downwards.</p>
                <p>In such motions, however great the initial velocity may be, the body will come to
                    rest; because a certain determined velocity will be taken from the body in each
                    equal successive moment, and some multiple of this will exceed the initial
                    velocity. Therefore the velocity will be extinguished before the end of a time
                    that is the same multiple of the time in which the velocity was diminished by
                    the quantity above mentioned. It is no less evident that the time in which any
                    velocity will be extinguished by an opposing or retarding force, is equal to the
                    time in which the same force would generate this velocity in the body previously
                    at rest. Therefore,</p>
                <p>87. (1.) The times in which different initial velocities will be extinguished by
                    the same opposing force are proportional to the initial velocities.</p>
                <p>88. (2.) The distances to which the body will go till the extinction of its
                    velocity, are as the squares of the initial velocities.</p>
                <p>(3.) They are also as the squares of the times elapsed.</p>
                <p>89. (4.) The distance to which a body, projected with any velocity, will go till
                    its motion be extinguished by the uniform action of a retarding force, is one
                    half of the space which it would describe uniformly during the same time with
                    the initial velocity.</p>
                <p>It very rarely happens that the force which accelerates the body acts uniformly,
                    or with an unvaried intensity. The attraction of a magnet, for example,
                    increases as the iron approaches it. The pressure of a spring diminishes as it
                    unbends. The impulse of a stream of water or wind diminishes as the impelled
                    surface retires from it by yield ing. Therefore the effects of accelerating
                    forces are very imperfectly explained, till we have shown what motions result
                    from any given variation of force, and how to discover the variation of force
                    from the observed motion. This last question is perhaps the most important in
                    the study of mechanical nature. It is only thus that we learn what is usually
                    called <hi rend="italic">the nature of a mechanicalforce.</hi> This chiefly
                    consists in the relation subsisting between the intensity of the force and the
                    distance of the substance in which it resides. Thus the nature of that power
                    which produces all the planetary motions, is considered as ascertained, when we
                    have demonstrated that its pressure or intensity is inversely as the square of
                    the distance from the body in which it is supposed to reside.</p>
                <p>Acceleration expresses some relation of the velocity and time. This relation may
                    be geometrically expressed in a variety of ways. In fig. 18 the uniform
                    acceleration, or the unvaried relation between the velocity and the time, is
                    very aptly expressed by the constant ratio of the ordinates and abscisses of the
                    triangle <hi rend="italic">agν.</hi> The ratio of <hi rend="italic">dl</hi> to
                    <hi rend="italic">ad</hi> is the same with that of e≡ to <hi rend="italic"
                    >ae,</hi> or that of <hi rend="italic">fφ</hi> to <hi rend="italic">af</hi><hi
                    rend="italic                 subscript"> i</hi> &amp;c.; or the ratio of the

                    >βπ</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bc,</hi> or that of <hi rend="italic">κρ</hi> to
                    f∕, &amp;c <hi rend="italic">dν</hi></p>
                <p>This ratio w%: <hi rend="italic">βπ</hi> is equivalent to the symbol —.</p>
                <p>But when the spaces described in a varied motion are represented by the areas
                    bounded by a curve line <hi rend="italic">hho,</hi> we no longer have that
                    constant ratio of the increments of the ordinates and abscisses.</p>
                <p>90. Therefore, in order to obtain measures of the accelerating forces, or at
                    least of their proportions, let the ab-: scissa <hi rend="italic">aeg</hi> (fig.
                    18) of the line <hi rend="italic">hho</hi> again represent the time of a motion.
                    But let the areas bounded by parallel ordi-ļ nates now represent the velocities;
                    that is, let the whole, area increase during the time &lt;¾7attlle same rate
                    with the velocities of the motion along the line AG. In this case the ordinates
                    <hi rend="italic">bi, ck, dl,</hi> &amp;c. will be as the accelerations at the
                    instants <hi rend="italic">b, c, d,</hi> &amp;c. or in the points B, C, D, &amp;
                    <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> c.</p>
                <p>This is demonstrated in the same way as the former proposition (No. 72). If the
                    accelerating force be supposed constant during any two equal moments ócand <hi

                    rend="italic">fs</hi> would have the ratio of the accelerations, or of the
                    accelerating forces. But as the velocities expressed by the figure increase
                    faster than the times during every moment, the force at the instant <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> is to the force at the instant yin a greater ratio than

                    therefore (as in the other proposition) the force at the instant <hi

                    observe the motion, and represent it by a figure analogous to fig. 18, where the
                    abscissa represents the times, and the area is made to increase at the same rate
                    with the spaces described. Then the ordinates will represent the velocities, or
                    have the proportion of the velocities. Then we may draw a second curve on the
                    other side of the same abscissa, such that the areas of this last curve shall be
                    proportional to the ordinates of the first. The ordinates of this last curve are
                    proportional to the accelerating forces.</p>
                <p>92. On the other hand, when we know from other circumstances that a force,
                    varying according to some known law, acts on a body, we can determine its
                    motion. The intensity of the force in every instant being known, we can draw a
                    line so related to another line representing the time, that the ordinates shall
                    be proportional to the forces. The areas will be proportional to the velocities.
                    We can draw another curve to the same absciss, such that the ordinates of this
                    shall be proportional to the areas of the other, that is, to the velocities of
                    the motion. The areas of this second curve will be proportional to the spaces
                    described.</p>
                <p>93. We must now observe, that all that has been said concerning the effects of
                    accelerating forces continually varying, relates to <hi rend="italic"
                    >changes</hi> of motion, independent of what the absolute motions may be. The
                    areas of the line whose ordinates represent the velocities do not necessarily
                    represent the spaces described, but the change made on the spaces described in
                    the same time; not the motions, but the changes of motion. If, indeed, the body
                    be supposed to be at,rest when the forces begin to act, these areas represent
                    the very spaces that are passed over, and the ordinates are the very velocities.
                    In every case, however, the accelerations are the real increments of the
                    velocities.</p>
                <p>This circumstance gives a great extension to our theorems, and enables us to
                    ascertain the disturbances of any species of regular motion, apart from the
                    motions themselves, and thus avoid a complication which would frequently be
                    inextricable in any other way. And this process, which is merely mathematical,
                    is perfectly conformable to mechaňical principles. It is in fact an application
                    of the doctrine of the composition of motion; a doctrine rigidly demonstrated
                    when we measure a mechanical force by the <hi rend="italic">change</hi> of
                    motion which it produces. Acceleration is the continual composition of a new
                    motion with the motion already produced.</p>
                <p>We may learn from this investigation of the value of an accelerating force, that
                    no finite change of velocity is effected in an instant by the action of an
                    accelerating force. When the fig. 18 is used for the scale of accelerations, and
                    they are represented by the ordinates of the line <hi rend="italic">hhο,</hi>
                    the increment of velocity is represented by an area, that is, by a slip of the
                    whole area; which slip must have some altitude, or must occupy some portion of
                    the abscissa which represents time. Some portion of time, however small it may
                    be, must elapse before any measurable addition can be made to the velocity. The
                    velocity must change <hi rend="italic">continually.</hi> As no motion can be
                    conceived as instantaneous, because this would be to conceive that in one
                    instant the moving particle is in every point of its momentary path,—so no
                    velocity can change, by a finite quantity, in one instant, because this would be
                    to conceive that in that instant the particle had all the intervening
                    velocities. The instant of change is at once the last instant of the preceding
                    velocity, and the first of the succeeding, and therefore must belong to both.
                    This cannot be conceived, or is absurd. As a body, in passing from one part of
                    space to another, must pass in succession through all the intermediate places;
                    so, in passing from one velocity to another, it must in succession have all the
                    intermediate velocities. It must be <hi rend="italic">continually</hi>
                    accelerated—we must not say <hi rend="italic">gradually</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> however small the steps.</p>
                <p>But to return from this digression:</p>
                <p>94. The most frequent cases which come under examination do not show us the
                    relation between the forces and times, but the relation between the forces and
                    spaces. Thus, when a piece of iron is in the neighbourhood of a magnet, or a
                    planet is considered in the neighbourhood of the sun, a force is acting on it in
                    every point of its path, and we have discovered that the intensity of this force
                    varies in a certain proportion. Thus, a spring varies in its pressure as it
                    unbends; gunpowder presses less violently as it expands, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Our knowledge is generally confined to some such effect as this. We know, that
                    while a body is moving along a line, ADE (fig 19), it is urged forward by a
                    force, of which the intensity varies in the proportion of the ordinates BF, CG,
                    DH, EI, &amp;c. of the line FGHI.</p>
                <p>To investigate the motion or change of motion produced by the action of this
                    force, let CD be supposed a very small portion of the space <hi rend="italic"
                    >s,</hi> which we may express by s'. Draw GK perpendicular to DII. Then, if we
                    suppose that the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328010"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-8010-0375"/>force acts with the unvaried intensity CG through
                    the whole space CD, the rectangle CDKG will express half of the increment of the
                    square of the velocity (No. 85). We may suppose that the force acts uniformly
                    along the adjoining small space Dr with the intensity DII. The rectangle DHor
                    will in like manner express another half increment of the square of the
                    velocity. And in like manner we may obtain a succession of such increments. The
                    aggregate or sum of them all will be half the difference between the square of
                    the velocity at B and the square of the velocity at E.</p>
                <p>If we employ <hi rend="italic">f</hi> to express the indetermined or variable
                    intensity of the accelerating force, and <hi rend="italic">v</hi> to express the
                    variable velocity, and <hi rend="italic">v</hi> ’ its increment <hi
                    rend="italic">uniformly</hi> acquired, then the rectangle CDKG will be expressed
                    by <hi rend="italic">fs</hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript">
                    1</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> We have seen that this is equal to <hi
                    rend="italic">vv∕.</hi> Therefore, in every case where we can tell the aggregate
                    of all the quantities <hi rend="italic">fs,</hi> it is plain that we will obtain
                    half the difference between the squares of the velocities in B and E, on the
                    supposition that the intensity of the force was constant along each little
                    space, and varied by starts. Then, by increasing the number and diminishing the
                    magnitude of those little portions of the space without end, it is evident that
                    we terminate in the expression of the real state of the case, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i. e.</hi> of a force varying continually; and that in this case the aggregate
                    of these rectangles occupies the whole area AEIF, and is equivalent to the
                    fluent of <hi rend="italic">fds,</hi> or to the symbol <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jfds∙&gt;</hi> used to express this fluent, which is conceived an aggregate of
                    small rectangles <hi rend="italic">fs</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> And we see that this area expresses
                    half of the augmentation of the square of the velocity. Therefore,</p>
                <p>95. <hi rend="italic">If the abscissa</hi> AE (fig. 19) <hi rend="italic">of a

                <p>Observe that the areas BCGF and DEIH are also proportional to the augmentations
                    made on the squares of the velocities in B and in D.</p>
                <p>Observe also, that it is indifferent what may have been the original velocity.
                    The action of the forces represented by the ordinates make always the same
                    addition to its square; and this addition is half the square of the velocity
                    which those forces would generate in the body by impelling it from rest in the
                    point A.</p>
                <p>96. Lastly, on this head, observe, that we can state what constant or variable
                    force will make the same augmentation of the square of the velocity by impelling
                    the body uniformly along the same space BE, or along what space a given force
                    must impel the body in order to produce the same increase of the square of its
                    velocity. In the first case, we have only to make a rectangle BENp, equal to the
                    area BEIF, and then Bp is the intensity of the constant force wanted. In the
                    second case, in which the force EO is given, we must make the rectangle AαOE
                    equal to the area BEIF, and AE is the space required.</p>
                <p>97. The converse of this proposition, viz. <hi rend="italic">if the areas are as
                    the increments of the square of the velocity, the ordinates are as the
                    forces,</hi> is easily demonstrated in the same way; for if the elementary areas
                    CDKG and EIMe represent increments of the squares of the velocity, the
                    accelerating forces are in the ratio compounded of the direct ratio of these
                    rectangles and the inverse ratio of their altitudes, because these altitudes are
                    the increments of the space (No. 85). Now the base CG of the rectangle CDKG is
                    to the base El of the rectangle EIMe in the same compounded ratio; therefore the
                    force in C is to the force in Ľ as CG to EI.</p>
                <p>98. The line <hi rend="italic">hko</hi> (fig. 18) was called by Dr Barrow (who
                    first introduced this extensive employment of motion into geometry) the <hi

                    may call <hi rend="italic">hho</hi> of fig. 18 the <hi rend="italic">scale
                    oĩ</hi> accelerations, when the areas represent the velocities. Sir Isaac Newton
                    added another scale of very great use, viz. a scale of times. It is constructed
                    as follows.</p>
                <p>99. Let ABE (fig. 19) be the line along which a body is accelerated, and let FHI
                    be the scale of forces, that is, having its ordinates FB, HD, IE, &amp;c.
                    proportional to the forces acting at B, D, E, F, &amp;c.; let <hi rend="italic"
                    >fhi</hi> be another line so related to ABE, that <hi rend="italic">Cg</hi> is
                    to Ez in the inverse subduplicate ratio of the area BFGC to the area BFIE; or,
                    to express it more generally, let the squares of the ordinates to the line <hi
                    rend="italic">fgi</hi> be inversely as the areas of the line FHI intercepted
                    between these ordinates and the first ordinate dnpvn through B; then the times
                    of the bodies moving from a state of rest in B are as the intercepted areas of
                    the curve <hi rend="italic">fgi.</hi></p>
                <p>For let CD and Ee be two very small portions of the space described in equal
                    times. They will be ultimately as the velocities in C and E. The area FBCG is to
                    the area FBEI as the square of Ez to the square of <hi rend="italic">Cg</hi> (by
                    construction); but the area FBCG is to FBEI as the square of the velocity at C
                    to the square of the velocity at E (by the proposition); therefore the square of
                    the velocity at C is to the square of the velocity at E as the square of E? to
                    the square of <hi rend="italic">Cg</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> therefore Ez is
                    to <hi rend="italic">Cg</hi> as the velocity at C to the velocity at E, that is,
                    as CD to Ee.∙ but since Ez: <hi rend="italic">Cg</hi> = CD: Ee, we have Eż × Ee
                    <hi rend="italic">= Cg</hi> × CD, and the elementary rectangles CyĀD and <hi
                    rend="italic">Εime</hi> are equal, and may represent the equal moments of time
                    in which CD and Ee were described. Thus the areas of the line <hi rend="italic"
                    >fgh</hi> will represent or express the times of describing the corresponding
                    portions of the abscissa.</p>
                <p>We may express the nature of this scale more briefly thus. Let BE be the space
                    described with any varied motion, and <hi rend="italic">fgh</hi> a curve, such
                    that its ordinates are inversely as the velocities in the different points of
                    the abscissa, then the area will be as the times of describing the corresponding
                    portions of the abscissa.</p>
                <p>100. In all the cases where our mathematical knowledge enables us to assign the
                    values of the ordinates of the figure 19, we can obtain the law of action of the
                    forces, or the nature of the force; and where we can assign the value of the
                    areas from our knowledge of the proportions of the ordinates or forces, we can
                    ascertain the velocities of the motion. We shall give an example or two, which
                    will show the way in which we avail ourselves of the geometrical properties of
                    figure in order to ascertain the effects of mechanical forces.</p>
                <p>(1.) In fig. 19, let the accelerating force which impels the body along the line
                    AB be constant, and let the body be previously at rest in B; the line which
                    bounds the ordinates that represent the forces must be some line pHN parallel to
                    AB. The area BDHp is to the area BENp as the square of the velocity at D to the
                    square of the velocity at E. These areas, having equal bases DH and EN, are as
                    their altitudes BD and BE; that is, the spaces described are as the squares of
                    the acquired velocities. And we see that this characteristic mark of uniformly
                    accelerated motion is included in this general proposition.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328023" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8023-0376"/>
                <p>101. (2.) Let us suppose that the body is impelled from A (fig. 20), towards the
                    point C, by a force proportional to its distance from that point. This force may
                    be represented by the ordinates DΛ, EB, eó, &amp;c. to the straight line DC. We
                    may take any magnitude of these ordinates; that is, the line DC may make any
                    angle with AC. It will simplify the investigation if we make the first force AD
                    = AC. About C describe the circle AHa, cutting the ordinate EB in F; let <hi

                <p>The area DABE is to the area DAKL as the square of the velocity at B to the
                    square of the velocity at K. But DABE is the excess of the triangle ADC above
                    the triangle EBC, or it is half of the excess of the square of CA or CF above
                    the square of CB, that is, half the square of BF. In like manner, the area DAKL
                    is equal to half the square of KM; but halves have the same ratio as the
                    integers; therefore the square of BF is to the square of KM as the square of the
                    velocity at B to the square of the velocity at K; therefore the velocity at B is
                    to the velocity at K as BF is to KM. The velocities are proportional to the
                    sines of the arches of the quadrant AFII described on AC.</p>

                    C is to the velocity in any other point B as radius to the sine of the arch

                    velocity acquired by the uniform action of the force DA; and this is double of
                    the triangle DAC; therefore the squares of these velocities are as 1 and 2, and
                    the velocities are as √1, and √2, or as 1 to √2.</p>

                    describing AC as the arch AF to the quadrant AFH.</p>
                <p>For when the arch <hi rend="italic">Ff</hi> is diminished continually, it is
                    plain that the triangle <hi rend="italic">fiF</hi> is ultimately similar to CFB,
                    by reason of the equal angles <hi rend="italic">Cib</hi> (or CFB) and ∕ιF, and
                    the right 'angles CBF and <hi rend="italic">fn</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    therefore the triangles <hi rend="italic">fgF</hi> and CBF are also similar.
                    Moreover, BZ&gt; is equal to Fy, F/iŝ equal to AH, which is ultimately equal to
                    <hi rend="italic">cC</hi>; therefore, since the triangles <hi rend="italic"
                    >fgF</hi> and CFB are similar, we have F&lt;∕: <hi rend="italic">Ff</hi> = FB:
                    CF = FB: HC; therefore Bδ is to <hi rend="italic">cC</hi> as FB to HC, that is,
                    as the velocity at B to the velocity at C; therefore <hi rend="italic">Bb</hi>
                    and cC are described in equal moments when indefinitely small; therefore equal

                    MH, &amp;c. are proportional to the times of describing AB, BK, KH, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> 4. The time of describing AC with the unequally
                    accelerated motion, is to the time of describing it uniformly with the final
                    velocity as the quadrantal arch is to the radius of a circle; for if a point
                    move in the quadrantal arch so as to be in F, <hi rend="italic">f</hi> M, H,
                    &amp;c. when the body is in B, <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> K, C, it will be moving
                    uniformly, because the arches are proportional to the times of describing those
                    portions of AC; and it will be moving with the velocity with which the body
                    arrives at C, because the arch AH is ultimately = Cc. Now if two bodies move
                    uniformly with this velocity, one in the arch AFH, and the other in the radius
                    AC, the times will be proportional to the spaces uniformly described; but the
                    time of describing AFH is equal to the time of the accelerated motion along AC,
                    therefore the proposition is manifest.</p>
                <p>103. <hi rend="italic">Cor. 5. If</hi> the body proceed in the line <hi
                    rend="italic">Ca,</hi> and be retarded in the same manner that it was
                    accelerated along AC, the time of describing AC uniformly with the velocity
                    which it acquires in C is to the time of describing ACa with the varied motion,
                    as the diameter of a circle to the circumference; for because the momentary
                    retardations at K', B', &amp;c. are equal to the accelerations at K and B,
                    &amp;c. the time of describing ACa is the same with that of describing AH«
                    uniformly with the greatest velocity; that is, to the time of describing AC
                    uniformly as AHa to AC, or as the circumference of a circle to the diameter;
                    therefore, &amp;c. N. B. In this case of retarding forces it is convenient to
                    represent them by ordinates K ʹ L, ΒΈ, αD', lying on the other side of the axis
                    ACa,∙ and to consider the areas bounded by these ordinates as subtractive from
                    the others. Thus the square of the velocity at K' is expressed by the whole area
                    DACK'L'C, the part C ’ K'L' being negative in respect of the point DAC. This
                    observation is general.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> 6. The time of moving along KC, the half of AC, by
                    the uniform action of the force at A, is to that of describing AC« by the varied
                    action of the force directed to C, and proportional to the distance from it, as
                    the diameter of a circle to the circumference; for when the body is uniformly
                    impelled along KC by the constant force IK, the square of the velocity acquired
                    at C is represented by half the rectangle IKCH, and therefore it is equal to the
                    velocity which the variable force generates by impelling it along AC (by the
                    way, an important observation). The body will describe AC uniformly with this
                    velocity in the same time that it is uniformly accelerated along KC. Therefore
                    by <hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> 5 the proposition is manifest.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> 7. If two bodies describe AC and KC by the action of
                    forces which are everywhere proportional to the distances from C, their final
                    velocities will be proportional to the distances run over, and the times will be
                    equal.</p>
                <p>For the squares of the final velocities are proportiona to the triangle ADC, LKC,
                    that is, to AC <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, KC <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>, and therefore the velocities are as AC, KC. The times of describing AC
                    and KC uniformly, with velocities proportional to AC and KC, must be equal; and
                    these times are in the same ratio (viz. that of radius to į· of the
                    circumference) to the times of describing AC and KC with the accelerated motion.
                    Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Thus, by availing ourselves of the properties of the circle, we have discovered
                    all the properties or characters of a motion produced by a force always directed
                    to a fixed point, and proportional to the distance from it. Some of these are
                    remarkable, such as the last corollary; and they are all important, for there
                    are innumerable cases where this law of action obtains in nature. It is nearly
                    the law <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328036" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8036-0377"/>of
                    action of a bowstring, and of all elastic bodies, when their change of figure
                    during their mutual action is moderate; and it has been by the help of this
                    proposition first demonstrated in a particular case by Lord Brouncker and Mr
                    Huygens, that we have been able to obtain precise measures of time, and
                    consequently of actual motions, and consequently of any of the mechanical powers
                    of nature. It is for this reason, as well as for the easy and perspicuous
                    employment of the mathematical method of proceeding, that we have selected
                    it.</p>
                <p>Instead of giving any more particular cases, we may observe in general, that if
                    the intensity of the force be proportional to any power whose index is <hi

                <p>This proposition, <hi rend="italic">fds==vdy, oχf== -ŗ-,</hi> is the 39th of the
                    first book of Newton’s <hi rend="italic">Principia,</hi> and is perhaps the most
                    important in the whole doctrine of dynamics, whether employed for the
                    investigation of forces or for the explanation of motions. It furnishes the most
                    immediate data for both purposes, but more especially for the last. By its help
                    Sir Isaac Newton was able to point out the numerous disturbances of the
                    planetary motions, and to separate them from each other; thus unravelling, as it
                    were, that most intricate motion in which all arc blended together. He has given
                    a most wonderful specimen of its application in his Lunar Theory.</p>
                <p>We now are able to explain all the puzzling facts which were adduced by Leibnitz
                    and his partisans in support of their measure of the forces of bodies in motion.
                    We see why four springs, equally bent, communicate but a double velocity, and
                    nine springs but a triple velocity; why a bullet moving twice as fast will
                    penetrate an earthen rampart to a quadruple depth, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                <p>This theorem also gives a most perspicuous explanation of the famous doctrine
                    called <hi rend="italic">conservatio virium vivarum.</hi> When perfectly elastic
                    bodies act on each other, it is found that the sum of the masses multiplied by
                    the squares of the velocities is always the same. This has been substituted,
                    with great encomiums, by the German philosophers, in place of Descartes’s
                    principle, that the quantity of motion in the universe, estimated in one
                    direction, remains always the same. They are obliged, however, to acknowledge,
                    that in the actions of perfectly hard bodies, there is always a loss of <hi
                    rend="italic">vis viva,</hi> and therefore have denied the existence of such
                    bodies. But there is the same loss in the mutual actions of all soft or ductile,
                    or even imperfectly elastic, bodies; and they are miserably puzzled liow to
                    explain the fact; but both the <hi rend="italic">conservatio</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">amissio</hi> are necessary consequences of this theorem.</p>
                <p>In the collision of elastic bodies, the whole change of motion is produced during
                    the short time that the bodies are compressed, and while they regain their
                    figure. When this is completed, the bodies are at the same distance from each
                    other as when the mutual action began. Therefore the preceding body has been
                    accelerated, and the following body has been retarded along equal spaces; and in
                    every point of this space the accelerating and the retarding force has been
                    equal. Consequently the same area of fig. 20 expresses the change made on the
                    square <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> of the velocity of both bodies. Therefore,
                    if V and U are’ the velocities before collision, and <hi rend="italic">v</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> the velocities after collision, of the two bodies A
                    and B, we must have A × V <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> — <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> B × zz <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> — U <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, and therefore A ×
                    V <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + B × U <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> — A ×
                    <hi rend="italic">v</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi> + B × <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >.</hi></p>
                <p>But in the other class of bodies, which do not completely regain their figure,
                    but remain compressed, they are nearer to each other when their mutual action is
                    ended than when it began. The foremost body has been accelerated along a shorter
                    space than that along which the other has been retarded. The mutual forces have
                    in every instant been equal and opposite. Therefore the area which expresses the
                    diminution of the square of the velocity must exceed the area expressing the
                    augmentation by a quantity that is always the same when the permanent
                    compression is the same; that is, when the relative motion is the same. A × V*—
                    <hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’ must exceed</p>
                <p>B × <hi rend="italic">τr</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> U <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>, and A × V <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + B × U <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> must exceed A × <hi rend="italic">v</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    2</hi> + B × <hi rend="smallcaps">m</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps">
                    2</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">.</hi></p>
                <p>This same theorem is of the most extensive use in all practical questions in
                    mechanic arts; and without it mechanics can go no farther than the mere
                    statement of equilibrium.</p>
                <p>Hermann, professor of mathematics at Pavia, one of the ornaments of the
                    mathematical class of philosophers, has given a pretty demonstration of this
                    valuable proposition,' in the <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Eruditorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Lipsiae</hi> for 1709; and says, that having
                    searched the writings of the mathematicians with great care, he found himself
                    warranted to say, that Newton was the undoubted author, and boasts of his own as
                    the first synthetical demonstration. The purpose of this assertion was not very
                    apparent at the time; but long after, in 1746, when Hermann’s papers, preserved
                    in the town-house of Pavia, were examined, in order to determine a dispute
                    between Maupertuis and Koenig about the claim to the discovery of <hi
                    rend="italic">the principle of least action,</hi> letters of Leibnitz’s were
                    found, requesting Hermann to search for any traces of this proposition in the
                    writings of the mathematicians of Europe. Leibnitz was by this time the envious
                    detractor from Newton’s reputation, and could not but perceive that all his
                    contorted arguments for his doctrine received a clear explanation by means of
                    this proposition, in perfect conformity to the usual measure of moving forces.
                    Newton had discovered this theorem long before the publication of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Principia,</hi> and even before the discovery of the chief
                    proposition of that book in 1666; for in his Optical Lectures, the materials of
                    which were in his possession in 1664, he makes frequent use of a proposition
                    founded on this. (See No. 42.) We may here remark, that Hermann’s demonstration
                    is in every step the same with Dr Barrow’s demonstration of it as a theorem
                    merely geometrical, without speaking of moving forces (see <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lcct. Geometr.</hi> xi. p. 85* edit. 16), but giving it as an instance of the
                    transformation of curves, which he calls <hi rend="italic">scales</hi> of
                    velocity, of time, of acceleration, &amp;c. It is very true that Barrow in these
                    mathematical lectures approached very near to both of Newton’s discoveries, the
                    fluxionary geometry, and the principles of dynamics; and the junto on the
                    Continent, who were his continual detractors, charge him with impudent
                    plagiarism from Dr Barrow, and even say that he has added nothing to the
                    discoveries of his teacher. But surely Dr Barrow was the best judge of this
                    matter; and, so far from resenting the use which Newton has made of what he had
                    taught him, he was charmed with the genius of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fwenis</hi><hi rend="italic">spectatissimus</hi> his scholar, and of his own
                    accord gave him his professorial chair, and ever after lived in the utmost
                    harmony and friendship with him. Nay, it would even appear <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193328049" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8049-0378"/>from some expressions in
                    those very lectures, that Dr Barrow owed to young Newton the first thought of
                    making such extensive use of motion in geometry. We recommend this work of
                    Barrow’s to the serious perusal of our readers, who wish to acquire clear
                    notions of the science of motion, and an elegant taste in their mechanical
                    disquisitions. After all the cultivation of this science by the commentators and
                    followers of Newton, after the <hi rend="italic">Phoro~ nomia</hi> of Hermann,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mechanica</hi> of Euler, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dynamique</hi> of D’Alembert, and the <hi rend="italic">Mechanique</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Analytique</hi> of De la Grange, which are undoubtedly works of
                    transcendent merit and utility, the <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> of Newton
                    will still remain the most pleasing, perspicuous, and elegant specimen of the
                    application of mathematics to the science of <hi rend="italic">universal
                    mechanics,</hi> or what we call <hi rend="smallcaps">Dynamics.</hi></p>
                <p>The two fundamentaI theorems <hi rend="italic">fdt = dv,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">fds — vdy,</hi> enable us to solve every question of motion
                    accelerated or retarded by the action of the mechanical powers of nature. But
                    the employment of them may be greatly expedited and simplified by noticing two
                    or three general cases which occur very frequently.</p>
                <p>104. <hi rend="italic">These may be called similar instants of time,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">similar points of space which divide given portions of time,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">of space in the same ratio.</hi> Thus the middle is a
                    similar instant of an hour or of a day, and is the similarly situated point of a
                    foot or of a yard. The beginning of the 21st minute, and of the 9th hour, are
                    similar instants of an hour and of a day. The beginning of the fifth inch, and
                    of the second foot, are similar points of a foot and of a yard.</p>
                <p>105. <hi rend="italic">Forces may be said to act similarly when their in-</hi> ’
                    <hi rend="italic">tensities in similar instants of time, or in similar points of
                    space, are in a constant ratio.</hi> Thus in fig. 20, when one body is impelled
                    towards C from A, and another from K, each with a force proportional to the
                    distance of every point of its motion from C, these forces maybe said to act
                    similarly along the spaces AC and KC, or during the times represented by the
                    quadrantal arches AFH, KNO. The following propositions on similar actions will
                    be found very useful on many occasions; but we must premise a geometrical
                    lemma.</p>
                <p>106. If there be two lines EFGH (fig. 21), <hi rend="italic">efgh,</hi> so
                    related to their abscisses AD, <hi rend="italic">ad,</hi> that the ordinates BF,
                    <hi rend="italic">bf</hi> drawn from similar points B and <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> of the abscisses, are in the constant ratio of AE to <hi rend="italic"
                    >ae</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> then the area ADHE is to the area <hi
                    rend="italic">adhe</hi> as the rectangle of AD × AE to the rectangle <hi
                    rend="italic">ad X ae.</hi></p>
                <p>For, let each abscissa be divided into the same number of equal and very small
                    parts, of which let CD and <hi rend="italic">cd</hi> be one in each. Inscribe
                    the rectangles CGID, <hi rend="italic">cgid.</hi> Then because the number of
                    parts in each axis is the same, the lengths of the portions CD and <hi
                    rend="italic">cd</hi> will be proportional to the whole abscisses AD and <hi
                    rend="italic">ad.</hi> And because C and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> are similar
                    points, CG is to <hi rend="italic">eg</hi> as AE is to <hi rend="italic"
                    >oe.</hi> Therefore CD × CG: <hi rend="italic">cd × eg</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> AD × AE: <hi rend="italic">ad × ae.</hi> This is true of each pair of
                    corresponding rectangles, and therefore it is true of their sums. But when the
                    number of these rectangles is increased, and their breadth diminished without
                    end, it is evident that the ultimate ratio of the sum of all the rectangles,
                    such as,CDHG, to the sumofall the rectangles <hi rend="italic">cdhg,</hi> is the
                    same with that of the area ADHE to the area <hi rend="italic">adhe,</hi> and the
                    proposition is manifest.</p>
                <p>107. <hi rend="italic">If two particles of matter are similarly impelled during
                    given times, the changes of velocity are as the times and as the forces
                    jointly.</hi></p>
                <p>Let the times be represented by the straight lines ABC (fig. 22), and <hi
                    rend="italic">abc,</hi> and the forces by the ordinates AD, BE, CF, and <hi
                    rend="italic">ad, be, cf.</hi> Then if B and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> are
                    similar instants (suppose the middles) of the whole times, we have BE: <hi

                    the area ACFD is to ŕ/ç/eř as AC × AD to <hi rend="italic">ac × ad.</hi> But
                    these areas are proportional to the velocities (No. 72), and the proposition is
                    demonstrated. For the same reason, the change of velocity during the time AB is
                    to the change during <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> as AB × AD to <hi rend="italic"

                    and forces are reciprocally proportional, the changes of velocity are equal; and
                    if the forces are inversely as the times, the changes of velocity are equal-</p>
                <p>108. <hi rend="italic">If two particles be similarly urged along given spaces,
                    the changes made on the squares of the velocities are as the forces and spaces

                <p>For if AC (fig. 22) and <hi rend="italic">ac</hi> are the spaces along which the

                <p><hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> 3. If the spaces along which the particles have been
                    impelled from a previous state of rest, are directly as the forces, the
                    velocities are also as the forces. For, because the changes of the squares of
                    the velocities are as the spaces and forces jointly, they are in this case as
                    the squares of the forces or of the spaces; but the changes of the squares of
                    the velocities are in this case the whole squares of the velocities; therefore
                    the squares of the velocities are as the squares of the forces, and the
                    velocities are as the forces. N. B. This includes the motions represented in
                    fig. 20.</p>
                <p>109. Jįf <hi rend="italic">two particles be similarly impelled along given

                <p>Let ABC (fig. 22), <hi rend="italic">ab</hi>?c, be the spaces described, and AD,

                    uniformly accelerated motions, or uniform actions.</p>
                <p>There remains one thing more to be said concerning the action of accelerating
                    forces. Their magnitude is ascertained by their effect. Therefore that is to be
                    considered as a double force which produces a double quantity of motion.
                    Therefore when a body A contains twice the number of equal atoms of matter, and
                    acquires the same velocity from the action of the force F, that another body <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> containing half the number of atoms, acquires from the
                    action of a force <hi rend="italic">f</hi> we conceive F to be double of <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> That this is a legitimate inference appears clearly from
                    this, that we conceive the sensible weight of a body, or that pressure which it
                    exerts on its supports, as the aggregate of the equal pressure of every atom
                    accumulated perhaps on one point; as when the body hangs by a thread, and, by
                    its intervention, pulls at some machine. Without inquiring in what manner or by
                    what intervention this accumulation of pressure is brought about, we see clearly
                    that it results from the equal accelerating force of gravity acting immediately
                    on each atom. When this weight is thus employed to move another body by the
                    intervention of the thread, which is attached to one point perhaps of that body,
                    it puts the whole into motion, generating a certain velocity <hi rend="italic"
                    >v</hi> in every atom, by acting uniformly during the time λ We conceive each
                    atom to have sustained the action of an equal accelerating</p>
                <p>, î? .</p>
                <p>force whose measure is —. Without considering how this force is exerted on each
                    atom, or by what it is immediately exerted, or how it is diffused through the
                    body from the point to which the weight of the other body is applied by means of
                    the thread; we still consider it as the aggregate of the action of gravity on
                    each atom of that other body. Moreover, attending only to the motion produced by
                    it, and perhaps not knowing the weight of the impelling body, we measure it, as
                    a moving force, by considering it as the aggregate of the forces propagated to
                    each atom of the impelled body, and measured by —. If we know that the impelled
                    body contains the number <hi rend="italic">m</hi> of atoms, the <hi rend="italic

                <p>But since we measure forces by the quantity of motion which they produce, we must
                    conceive, that when the same force is applied to a body which consists of <hi

                <p>110. Sir Isaac Newton found it absolutely necessary, in the disquisitions of
                    natural philosophy, to keep this circumstance of acceleration clear of all
                    notions of quantity of matter, or other considerations, and to contemplate the
                    affections of motion only. He therefore con-</p>

                    force, and <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> as an aggregate. He
                    therefore calls the aggregate a <hi rend="italic">vis motrix,</hi> a <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">V</hi> nient, therefore, also to confine the symbol <hi

                    retain the symbol <hi rend="italic">a</hi> for expressing the accelerating
                    force</p>
                <p>This appellation of <hi rend="italic">motive force</hi> is perfectly just and
                    simple; for we may conceive it as the same with the accelerating force which
                    produces the velocityantimes <hi rend="italic">v</hi> in one particle, by acting
                    on it uniformly during the time <hi rend="italic">t.</hi> This motion of one
                    particle having the velocity <hi rend="italic">mv,</hi> is the same with that of

                    >v.</hi></p>
                <p>If therefore a motive force <hi rend="italic">f</hi> act on a body consisting of

                <p>OF DEFLECTING FORCES.</p>
                <p>111. When we observe the direction of a body to change, we unavoidably infer the
                    agency of a force which acts in a direction that does not coincide with that of
                    the body’s motion; .and we may distinguish this circumstance by calling it a <hi
                    rend="italic">deflecting farce.</hi> We have already shown how to estimate and
                    measure this deflecting force, by considering it as competent to the production
                    of that mo tion which, when compounded with the former motion, will produce the
                    new motion (No. 44). Now, as all changes of motion are really compositions of
                    motions or forces, it <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328075"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-8075-0380"/>is evident that we shall explain the action of
                    Reflecting forces when we show this composition.</p>
                <p>We may almost venture to say <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> that all
                    deflections must be continual, or exhibit curvilineal motions: for as no finite
                    velocity, or change of velocity, can be produced in an instant by the action of
                    an accelerating force, no polygonal or angular deflection can be produced;
                    because this is the composition of a finite velocity produced in an instant.
                    Deflective motions are all produced by the composition of the former motion,
                    having a finite velocity, with a transverse motion continually accelerated from
                    a state of rest. Of this we can form a very distinct notion, by taking the
                    simplest case of such accelerated motion, namely, a uniformly accelerated
                    motion.</p>
                <p>112. Let a body be moving in the direction AC (fig. 23) with any constant
                    velocity, and when it comes to A, let it be exposed to the action of an
                    accelerating force, acting uniformly in any other direction AE. This alone would
                    cause the body to describe AE with a uniformly accelerated motion, so that the
                    spaces AD, AE, would be as the squares of the times in which they are described.
                    Therefore, if AB be the space which it would have described uniformly in the
                    time that it describes AD by the action of the accelerating force, and AC the
                    space which it would have described uniformly while it describes AE by the
                    action of the accelerating force, nothing more is wanted for ascertaining the
                    real motion of the body but to compound the uniform motion in the direction AC
                    with the uniformly accelerated motion in the direction AE. AD is to AE as the
                    square of the time of describing AD to the square of the time of describing AE;
                    that is, as the square of the time of describing AB to the square of the time of
                    describing AC; that is, as AB <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> to AC <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> (by reason of the uniform motion in AC). This
                    composition is performed by taking the simultaneous points B, D, and the
                    simultaneous points C, E, and completing the parallelograms ABFD, ACGE. The body
                    will be found in the points F and G in the instants in which it would have been
                    found at B and C by the uniform motion, or in D and E by the accelerated motion.
                    In the same manner may be found as many points of the real path as we please. It
                    is plain that these points will be in a line AFG, so related to AE that AD: AE =
                    DF <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>: EG <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>; or so
                    related to the original motion AC, that AB <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>: AC
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = BF: CG, &amp;c. This line is therefore a
                    parabola, of which AE is a diameter, DF and EG are ordinates, and which touches
                    AC in A.</p>
                <p>Having thus ascertained the path of the body, we can also ascertain the motion in
                    that path; that is, the velocity in any point of it. We know that the velocity
                    in the point G is to the velocity of the uniform motion in the direction AC as
                    the tangent TG is to the ordinate EG; because this is the ultimate ratio of the
                    momentary increment of the arch AFG to the momentary increment of the ordinate
                    EG. Thus is the velocity in every point of the curve determined. We have taken
                    it for granted that the line of projection touches the pa£li, and that the
                    direction in every point is that of the tangent. To suppose that the curve, in
                    any portion of it, coincides with the tangent, is to suppose that the body is
                    not deflected, that is, is not acted on by a transverse accelerating force; and
                    to suppose that the tangent makes a finite angle with any part of the path, is
                    to suppose that the deflection is not continual, but by starts, both of which
                    are contrary to the conditions of the case. No straight line can be drawn
                    between the direction of the body and the succeeding portion of the path,
                    otherwise we must again suppose that the deflection is subsultory, and the
                    motion angular.</p>
                <p>113. But while the investigation is so easy when the direction and intensity of
                    the deflecting force in every point of the curve are known, the investigation of
                    the deflecting force from the observed motion is by no means easy. The observed
                    curvilineal motion always arises from a composition of a uniform motion in the
                    tangent with some transverse motion; but the same curvilineal motion may be
                    produced by compounding the uniform motion in the tangent with an infinity of
                    transverse motions, and the law of action will be different in these transverse
                    motions according as their directions differ. We must learn not only the
                    intensity of the deflecting force, and the law of its variation, but also its
                    direction in every point of the curve. It is not easy to find general rules for
                    discovering the direction of the transverse force; most commonly this is
                    indicated by extrinsic circumstances. The deflecting force is frequently
                    observed to reside in or to accompany some other body. It may be presumed,
                    therefore, that it acts in the direction of the line drawn to or from that body;
                    yet even this is uncertain. The most general rule for this investigation is to
                    observe the place of the body at several intervals of time before and after its
                    passing through the point of the curve, where we are interested to find its
                    precise direction. We then draw lines joining those places of the tangent where
                    the body would have been by the uniform motion only. We shall perhaps observe
                    these lines of junction keep in parallel positions: we may be assured that the
                    direction of the transverse force is the same with that of any of these lines.
                    This is the case in the example just now given of a parabolic motion; but when
                    these lines change position they will change it gradually, and their position in
                    the point of contact is that to which their positions on both sides of it
                    gradually approximate.</p>
                <p>But all this is destitute of the precision requisite in philosophical discussion.
                    We are indebted to Sir Isaac Newton for a theorem which ascertains the direction
                    of the transverse force with all exactness, in the cases in which we most of all
                    wish to attain mathematical accuracy, and which not only opened the access to
                    those discoveries which have immortalized his name, but also pointed out to him
                    the path he was to follow, and even marked his first steps. It therefore merits
                    a very particular treatment.</p>

                <p>114. If a body describes a curve line ABCDEF (fig. 24) lying in one plane, and if
                    there be a point S so situated in this plane that the line joining it with the
                    body describes areas ASB, ASC, ASD, &amp;c. proportional to the times in which
                    the body describes the arches AB, AC, AD, &amp;c. the force which deflects the
                    body from rectilineal motion is continually directed to the fixed point S.</p>
                <p>Let us first suppose that the body describes the polygon ABCDEF, &amp;c. formed
                    of the chords AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, &amp;c. of this curve, and, for greater
                    simplicity of argument, let us consider areas described in equal successive
                    times; that is, let us suppose that the triangles ASB, BSC, CSD, &amp;c. are
                    equal, and described in equal times. Make Be = AB, and draw cS.</p>
                <p>Had the motion AB suffered no change in the point B, the body would have
                    described Be in the equal moment succeeding the first; but it describes BC. The
                    body has therefore been deflected by an external force, and BC is the diagonal
                    of a parallelogram (No. 45, 46), of which Be is one side, and cC is another. The
                    deflecting force will be discovered, both in respect of direction and intensity,
                    by completing the parallelogram BcC5. BZ» is the space which the deflecting
                    force would have caused the body to describe in the time that it describes Be or
                    BC. Because Be is equal to BA, the triangles BSc, BSA are equal. But, by the
                    nature of the motion, BSA is equal to BSC; therefore the triangles BSC and BSc
                    are equal. They are also on the same base BS; therefore they lie between the
                    same parallels, and <hi rend="italic">Cc</hi> is parallel to SB. But cC is
                    parallel to <hi rend="italic">Bb</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> therefore Bó
                    coincides with BS, and the deflecting force at B is directed toward S. By the
                    same argument, the deflecting force at the angles D, E, F, &amp;c. is directed
                    to S.</p>
                <p>Now, let the sides of the polygon be diminished, and their number increased
                    without end. The demonstration remains the same, and continues, when the polygon
                    finally coalesces with the curve, and the deflection is continual.</p>
                <p>When areas are described proportional to the times, equal areas are described in
                    equal times; and therefore the deflection is always directed to S. Q. E. D.</p>
                <p>The point S may, with equal propriety of language, be • called the <hi

                <p>The line joining the centre of forces with the body, and&lt; which may be

                    in one plane, in which S is situated, and areas! are described proportional to
                    the times, is easily demon-&lt; strated by reversing the steps of this
                    demonstration. The! motion will be in the plane of the lines SB and Be, be-*
                    cause the diagonal BC of the parallelogram of forces is in the plane of the
                    sides. Areas are described proportional to the times; for Cc being parallel to
                    SB, the triangles SCB and ScB are equal; and therefore SCB and SAB are equal,

                    for since the triangles ASB, ESF are equal, their bases AB, EF are inversely as

                    magnitude of the angle described in equal times by the radius vector, is
                    inversely proportional to the square of the distance from S. For when the arches
                    AB, EF are diminished continually, the perpendiculars Bα and <hi

                    with arches described round S with the radii SB and SF. Now the magnitude of an
                    angle is proportional to the length of the arch which measures it directly, and
                    to the radius of the arch inversely. In any circle, an arch of two inches long
                    measures twice as many degrees as an arch one inch long; and an arch one inch
                    long contains twice as many degrees of a circle whose radius is twice as short.
                    Therefore, ultimately, the angle ASB is to the angle ESF as Bα to Fε, and as SF
                    to SB jointly; that is, as Bα × SF to Fε × SB. But Bα: Fε = SE: S A (Cor. 2);
                    therefore ASB: ESF = SE × SF: SB × SA, = ultimately SE <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>This corollary gives us an ostensible mark, in many very important cases, of the
                    action of a deflecting force being always directed to a fixed point. We are
                    often able to measure the angular motion when we cannot measure the real
                    velocities.</p>
                <p>Having thus discovered the chief circumstances which enable us to ascertain the
                    direction of the deflecting force, we proceed to investigate the quantity of
                    this deflective determination in the different points of a curvilineal motion.
                    This is a. more difficult task. The momentary effect of the deflecting force is
                    a small deviation from the tangent; and this deviation is made with an
                    accelerated motion. The law of this acceleration regulates the curvature of the
                    path, and is to be determined by it. We may be allowed to observe by the way,
                    that it appears clearly, from the form in which Newton has presented all his
                    dynamical theorems, that we are indebted to these problems for the immense
                    improvement which he has made in geometry by his invention of fluxions. The
                    purposes he had in view suggested to his penetrating mind the means for
                    attaining them; and the connection between dynamics and geometry is so intimate,
                    that the same theorems are in a manner common to both. This is <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193328101" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8101-0382"/>particularly the case in all
                    that relates to curvature. Or shall we say that the geometry of Dr Barrow
                    suggested the dynamical theorems to Newton? We have seen how the curvature of a
                    parabola is produced by a force acting uniformly. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >momentary</hi> action of all finite forces may be considered as uniform, and
                    therefore the curvature will be that of some portion of some parabola; but it
                    will be difficult to determine the precise degree without some farther help. We
                    are best acquainted with the properties of the circle, and will have the
                    clearest notions of the curvature of other curves by comparing them with
                    circles.</p>
                <p>The curvature of a circular arch of given length is so much greater as its radius
                    is shorter, for it will contain so many more degrees in the same length; and
                    therefore the change of direction of its extremities is so much greater.
                    Curvatures may always be measured by the length of the arch directly, and the
                    radius inversely.</p>
                <p>119. Suppose a thread made fast at one end of a material curve ABCD (fig. 25),
                    and applied to it in its whole length. Taking hold of its extremity D, unfold it
                    gradually from the curve DCBA; the extremity D will describe another curved <hi
                    rend="italic">Dcba.</hi> This geometrical operation is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">evolution</hi> of curves, and <hi rend="italic">Dcba</hi> is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">evolute</hi> of DCBA, which is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">involute</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Ωcba.</hi> Perhaps this
                    denomination has been given from the genesis of the area or surface contained by
                    the two lines, which is folded up and unfolded somewhat like a fan. When the
                    describing point is in δ, the thread 6B is undoubtedly the momentary radius of a
                    circle <hi rend="italic">ebf,</hi> whose centre is B, the point of the involute
                    which it is just going to quit. The momentary motion of <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    is the same, whether it is describing an arch of the evolute passing through <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> or an arch of a circle round the centre B. The same line
                    <hi rend="italic">bt,</hi> perpendicular to the thread 6B, touches the circle
                    <hi rend="italic">ebf</hi> and the curve <hi rend="italic">Dba</hi> in the point
                    <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> This circle <hi rend="italic">ebf</hi> must lie within
                    the curve Dfø on the side of òB toward <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> because on this
                    side the momentary radius is continually increasing. For similar reasons, the
                    circle e6flies without the curve on the other side of òB. Therefore the circle
                    eófboth touches and cuts the curve D6α in the point <hi rend="italic">b.</hi>
                    Moreover, because every portion of the curve between <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    and D is described with radii that are shorter than óB, it must be more
                    incurvated than any portion of the circle <hi rend="italic">ebf.</hi> For
                    similar reasons, every portion of the curve between <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> must be less incurvated than this circle; therefore the
                    circle has that precise degree of curvature that belongs to the curve in the
                    point <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> it is therefore called
                    the <hi rend="italic">equicurve circle,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">circle of
                    curvature,</hi> and B is called the centre, and B6 the <hi rend="italic">radius
                    of curvature.</hi> It is easy to perceive that no circle can be described which
                    shall touch the curve in <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and come between it and the
                    circle <hi rend="italic">ebf;</hi> for its centre must be in some point <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> of the radius òB. If <hi rend="italic">ib</hi> be less than
                    B6, it must fall within the curve on both sides of <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and
                    if <hi rend="italic">ib</hi> is greater than <hi rend="italic">V&gt;b,</hi> the
                    circle must fall without the curve on both sides of B6. The circle <hi
                    rend="italic">ebf</hi> lies closer to the curve, has closer contact with it than
                    any other, and has therefore got the whimsical name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >osculating circle</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and this sort of contact was
                    called <hi rend="italic">osculation.</hi></p>
                <p>This view of the genesis of curve lines is of particular use in dynamical
                    discussions. It exhibits to the eye the perfect sameness of the momentary
                    motion, and therefore of the momentary deflection, in the curve and in the
                    equicurve circle, and leaves the mind without a doubt but that the forces which
                    produce the one will produce the other. A great variety of curves may be
                    described in this way. If perpendiculars be drawn to the curve Dfø in every
                    point, they will intersect each other, each its immediate neighbour, in the
                    circumference of the curve DBA; and geometry teaches us how to find the curve
                    DBA which shall produce the curve <hi rend="italic">Ωba</hi> by evolution. (See
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Fluxions.)</hi></p>
                <p>It is a matter worthy of remark, that the path of a body that is deflected from
                    rectilineal motion by a <hi rend="italic">finite</hi> force, varying according
                    to any law whatever, may always be described by evolution. This includes almost
                    every case of the action of deflecting forces; none being excepted but when, by
                    the opposite action of different forces, the body is in equilibrio in one single
                    point of its path.</p>
                <p>Our task is noav brought within a very narrow compass, namely, to measure the
                    deflection in the arch of a circle.</p>
                <p>Had the motion represented in fig. 26 been polygonal, it is plain that the
                    deflecting force in the point B is to that in the point E as the diagonal B6 of
                    the parallelogram ABCó to the diagonal Ez of the parallelogram DEFz; therefore
                    let ABCZY be a circle passing through the points A, B, and C, and let the radius
                    vector BS cut the circumference in Z; draw AZ, CZ, and the diagonal AC, which
                    necessarily bisects and is bisected by the diagonal B6. The triangles Z&gt;BC
                    and CBZ are similar; for the angle C6B is equal to the alternate angle ABó or
                    ABZ, which is equal to the angle ACZ, standing on the same chord AZ. And the
                    angle CB6, or CBZ, is equal to CAZ, standing on the same chord CZ; therefore the
                    remaining angle óCB is equal to the remaining angle <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193328114" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8114-0383"/>AZC; therefore ZA is to AC as
                    BC to B6, and Bò</p>
                <p>AC×BC <hi rend="subscript"> τ r</hi>. <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>,. DF×EF</p>
                <p>AZ <hi rend="italic">L)z</hi></p>
                <p>’ Now let the points A and C continually approach, and ultimately coalesce with
                    B; it is evident that the circle ABCZY is ultimately the equicurve or coinciding
                    circle at the point B, and that AS ultimately coalesces with and is equal to BS,
                    and that AC × BC is ultimately 2BC <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> 2EF <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> 2BC <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>; therefore
                    ultimately Bó: Ez = ^+χ <hi rend="superscript"> -: or</hi></p>
                <p>_ BC <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="underline">EF</hi><hi

                <p>“⅛BZ <hi rend="superscript">:</hi> ∣E√</p>
                <p>Now BC and EF being described in equal times, are as the velocities: B6 and Ez
                    are the measures of the velocities which the deflective forces at B and E would
                    generate in the time that the body describes BC or EF, and are therefore the
                    measures of those forces. <hi rend="italic">They are as the squares of the
                    velocities directly, and inversely as those chords of the equicurve circles
                    which have the directwns of the deflection.</hi></p>
                <p>Observe that BZ&gt; or Ez is the third proportional to half of BZ the chord and
                    the arch described; for B6: BC = BC: —.</p>
                <p>It is evident, that as the arches AB, BC, continually diminish, AC is ultimately
                    parallel to the tangent Br, and BO is equal to the actual deflection from the
                    tangent.</p>
                <p>OC <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi></p>
                <p>The triangles BOC and AOZ are similar, and BO = <hi rend="italic">~fy∕f</hi></p>
                <p>BC <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> or ultimately = -ŋ=-. We may measure the forces
                    by the 15Z</p>
                <p>actual deflections, because they are the halves of the measures of the generated
                    velocities; and we may say that f 120. <hi rend="italic">The actual momentary
                    deflection from the tangent is a third proportional to the deflective chord of
                    the equicurve circle and the arch described during the moment.</hi></p>
                <p>Either of these measures may be taken, but we must take care not to confound
                    them. The first is the most proper, because the change produced on the body
                    (which is the <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> effect and measure of the force)
                    is the determination left inherent in it to move with a certain velocity. This
                    is the measure also which we obtain by means of the differential or fluxionary
                    calculus; but the other measure must be obtained when our immediate object is to
                    mark the actual path of the body. The steps of this demonstration, which is
                    Newton’s, naturally terminate in the equicurve circle, and give at once the
                    immediate measure of the deflecting force. At the same time the reader must
                    perceive that this measure does not depend on the force being always directed to
                    one centre; it is enough that the two sides of the polygon, in immediate
                    succession, are described in equal times. This is necessary in order that ABC6
                    may be a parallelogram, and that the diagonals AC and B⅛ may mutually bisect
                    each other.</p>
                <p>Thus have we obtained a measure of deflecting force, and, in the most important
                    cases, a method of discovering its direction. It only remains to point out the
                    relation between the intensity of the force, the curvature of the path, and the
                    velocity of .the motion. These three circumstances have a necessary connection;
                    for we see that the intensity is expressed by certain values of the other <hi

                <p>flective velocity Bδ is acquired in the time that the body describes BC;
                    therefore the deflective velocity is to the velocityin the curve as Βά to BC.
                    The velocity B6 is acquired by an accelerated motion along BO; for while, by
                    progressive motion, the body describes BC, it deflects from the tangent through
                    a space equal to the half of B6, because the momentary action of the deflecting
                    force may be considered as uniform. The progressive velocity BC may be generated
                    by the same force uniformly acting through a space greater than BC; call this
                    space <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> The spaces along which a body must be uniformly
                    impelled in order to acquire different velocities are as the squares of those

                    >x</hi> is of BZ; that is,</p>
                <p>121. <hi rend="italic">The velocity in any point of a curvilineal path is that
                    which the deflecting forces in that point would generate in the body by

                    circle must increase; that is, the path becomes less incurvated. If the force be
                    increased, the curvature will also increase, for the chord of curvature will be
                    less.</p>
                <p>There is another general observation to be made on the velocity of a curvilineal

                <p>Let one body be impelled from A (fig. 27) toward C along the straight line A

                <p>Then, because the centripetal forces are supposed to be the same for both bodies

                    the equal lines DE and IN; but the force IN is not wholly employed in
                    accelerating the body along the arch IK, but, acting transversely, it is partly
                    employed in in-curvating the path. It is equivalent to the two forces IO and IT,
                    of which only IT accelerates the body. Now IKN is a right-angled triangle, as is
                    also the triangle INT; and they are similar; therefore IN: IT = IK: IN, or DE:
                    IT = IK: DE; that is, the force which accelerates the body along DE is to the
                    force which accelerates the body along IK as the space IK is to the space DE;
                    therefore (No. 86) the increment of the square of the velocity acquired along DE
                    is equal to the increment of the square of the velocity acquired alongIK. But
                    the velocities at D and I were equal, and consequently their squares were equal;
                    and these having received equal increments, therefore the squares of the
                    velocities at E and K are equal, and the velocities themselves are equal. And
                    since this is the case in all the corresponding points of the line AC and the
                    curve VIK, the velocities at all equal distances from C will be equal.</p>
                <p>It is evident that the conclusion will be the same, if the bodies, instead of
                    being accelerated by approaching the centre in the straight line AC, and in the
                    curve VIK, are moving in the opposite directions from E to A, or from I to V,
                    and are therefore retarded by the centripetal force.</p>
                <p>123. <hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> Hence it follows, that if a body be projected
                    from any point, such as V, of the curve, in a line tending straight from the
                    centre, with the velocity which it had in that point of the curve, it would go
                    to a distance VÁ, such, that if it were impelled along AV by the centripetal
                    force, it would acquire its former velocity in the point V; also in any point
                    between V and A it will have the same velocity in its recess from the centre
                    that it has there in its approach to the centre.</p>
                <p>The line BLFG, whose ordinates are as the intensities of the centripetal force in
                    A, V, D, E, or in A, V, I, K, may be called the <hi rend="italic">scale</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">exponent</hi> of force; the areas bounded by the ordinates AB,
                    VL, DF, EG, &amp;c. drawn from any two points of the axis, are as the squares of
                    the velocity acquired by acceleration along the intercepted part of the axis, or
                    in any curvilineal path, while the body approaches the centre, or which are lost
                    while the body retires from it. When we can compute these areas we obtain the
                    velocities (see No. 102).</p>
                <p>We are now in a condition to solve the chief problem in the science of dynamics,
                    to which the whole of it is in a great measure subservient. The problem is
                    this:</p>
                <p>124. Let a body be projected with a known velocity from a given point and in a
                    given direction, and let it be under the influence of a mechanical force, whose
                    direction, intensity, and variation, are all known; it is required to determine
                    its path, and its motion in this path, for any given time.</p>
                <p>This problem is susceptible of three distinct classes of conditions, which
                    require different investigation.</p>
                <p>1. The force may act in one constant direction; that is, in parallel lines.</p>
                <p>2. The force may be always directed to a fixed point.</p>
                <p>3. It may be directed to a point which is continually changing its place.</p>
                <p>1. When the force acts in parallel lines, the problem is solved by compounding
                    the rectilineal accelerated motion which the force would produce in its own
                    direction with the uniform motion which the projection alone would have
                    produced. The motion must be curvilineal when the accelerating force is
                    transverse, in any degree whatever, to the projectile motion; and the
                    curvilineal path must be concave on that side to which the deflecting force
                    tends, for the force is supposed to act incessantly. The place of the body will
                    be had for any time, by finding where the body would have been at the end of
                    that time by each force acting alone, and by completing the parallelogram. Thus,
                    suppose a body projected along AB (fig. 23), while it is continually acted on by
                    a force whose direction is AD. Let D and B be the places where the body would be
                    at the end of a given time. Then the body will, at the end of that time, be in
                    F, the opposite angle of the parallelogram ABFD. But it has not described the
                    diagonal AF, because its motion has been curvilineal, as we shall find by
                    determining its place at other instants of this time.</p>
                <p>The velocity in any point F is found by first determining the velocity at D, and
                    making Dr7 to DF as the velocity at D to the velocity at B (that is, the
                    velocity of projection, because the motion along AB is uniform). Then draw √F.
                    Then AB is to <hi rend="italic">dF</hi> as the constant velocity of projection
                    to the velocity at F. We have seen already (No. 112-119) that <hi rend="italic"
                    >di</hi> is a tangent to the curve in F. Hence we may determine the velocity at
                    F in another way. Having determined the form of the path in the way already
                    described, by finding its different points, draw the tangent <hi rend="italic"
                    >Εd,</hi> cutting the line DA in <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> Then the velocity at
                    A is to that at F as AB to &lt;ZF. Hence also we see that the velocities in
                    every point of the curve are proportional to the portion of the tangents at
                    those points which are intercepted between <hi rend="italic">any</hi> two lines
                    parallel to AD.</p>
                <p>Either of these methods for ascertaining the velocity, in this case of parallel
                    deflections, 'will in general be easier than the general method in No. 121, by
                    the equicurve circle.</p>
                <p>It was thus that Galileo discovered the parabolic motion of heavy bodies.</p>
                <p>2. We must consider the motions of bodies affected by centripetal or centrifugal
                    forces, always tending to one fixed point. This is the celebrated <hi
                    rend="italic">inverse problem of centripetal forces,</hi> and is the
                    forty-second proposition of the first book of Newton’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principia.</hi> We shall give the solution after the manner of its illustrious
                    author, because it is elementary in the purest sense of the word, keeping in
                    view the two leading circumstances, and these only, namely, the motion of
                    approach and recess from the centre, and the motion of revolution. By this
                    judicious process, it becomes a pattern by which more refined, and, in some
                    respects, better solutions should be modelled. At the same time we shall supply
                    some steps of the investigation which his elegant ponciseness has made him
                    omit.</p>
                <p>125. Let a body which tends to C (fig. 28) with a force proportional to the
                    ordinates of the exponent BLFG, having the axis CA, be projected from V in the
                    direction VQ, with the velocity which the centripetal force would generate in it
                    by accelerating it along AV. It is required to determine the path or orbit VIK1
                    of the body, and its place I in this orbit, at the end of the assigned time
                    T.</p>
                <p>Suppose the thing done, and that I is the place of the body. About the centre C,
                    with the distances CV and CI, describe the circles YV and ID. Draw CIX to the
                    circumference, and draw the ordinate DF of the exponent of forces, producing it
                    toward <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> and produce the ordinate VL toward <hi
                    rend="italic">a.</hi> Let <hi rend="italic">Nt</hi> be the distance to which the
                    body would go along the tangent VQ in the time T, and join <hi rend="italic"
                    >tC.</hi> Let this be supposed done for every point of the curve. Let <hi
                    rend="italic">aik</hi> and <hi rend="italic">axy</hi> be two curves so related
                    to the curve VIK, that the ordinate DF cuts off an area Vαz'D equal to the
                    orbital sector VCI, and an area <hi rend="smallcaps">VűxD</hi> equal to the
                    circular sector VCX.</p>
                <p>Then, because the velocity of projection is given, the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193328140" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8140-0385"/>distance Vtis known, and the
                    area of the triangle VCi. •But this is equal to the area VCI, by the laws of
                    central forces. (No. 115.) Therefore the area Vm'D is given. Also, because the
                    area VCI increases in the proportion of the time, the area VożD increases at the
                    same rate.</p>
                <p>Therefore, having these subsidiary curves <hi rend="italic">aik, axy,</hi> the
                    problem is solved as follows:</p>
                <p>Draw an ordinate Dí, cutting off an area VαzD proportional to the time, and
                    describe a circle DIR. Then draw a line CX, cutting off a sector VCX, equal to
                    the area VαaτD cut off by the ordinate Dz⅛. This line will cut the circle DR in
                    the point I, which is the point of the orbit that was demanded.</p>
                <p>But the chief difficulty of the problem consists in the description of the two
                    subsidiary curves <hi rend="italic">aik</hi> and <hi rend="italic">axy,</hi>
                    into which the lines VIK and VXY are transformed. We attain this construction by
                    resolving the motion in the arch of the orbit into two motions, one of which is
                    in the direction of the transverse force, or of the radius vector, and the other
                    is in the direction of revolution, or perpendicular to the radius.</p>
                <p>Let VÄ and IK be two very small arches described in equal moments, and therefore
                    ultimately in the ratio of the velocities in V and I (No. 73). Describe the
                    circle KE, cutting IC in N. Draw KC and ÄC, and <hi rend="italic">kn</hi>
                    perpendicular to VC.</p>
                <p>IC v KN</p>
                <p>The element ICK of the orbit is = — , or to</p>
                <p>⅜ IC × KN. This is equal to the element <hi rend="smallcaps">DžáE</hi> of the
                    area V«zD, or to D? × DE, or to Dz × IN. Therefore IN: KN = ⅜ 1C: Dz, or 2IN: KN
                    = IC: Dz, and Di = 1C × KN “</p>

                <p>Now let <hi rend="italic">Áĳgh</hi> be the exponent of the velocities, that is

                    to LV produced. Let <hi rend="italic">mrz</hi> be an equilateral hyperbola,
                    having VC, ZC, for its asymptotes, and cutting FD produced in r. Then the
                    ordinates <hi rend="italic">Vm,</hi> Dr, are inversely proportional to. CV, CD,
                    or <hi rend="italic">Vm</hi>: Dr = CD: CV, = CI: CV. But because the momentary

                    Therefore,</p>

                <p>129. Such is the solution of this celebrated problem given by Sir Isaac Newton,
                    who may justly be called the inventor of the science of which it is the chief
                    result, as well as of the geometry by help of which it is prosecuted. For we
                    cannot give this glory to Galileo; for his simple problem of the motion of
                    bodies affected by uniform and parallel gravity, however just and elegant his
                    solution may be, was peculiar; and the same must be said of Mr Huygens’s
                    doctrine of centrifugal forces. Besides, these theorems had been investigated by
                    Newton several years before, <hi rend="italic">sua mathesi facem</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">preferente,</hi> as corollaries which he could not pass unnoticed,
                    from his general method. This is proved by letters from Huygens. Newton’s
                    investigation is extremely but elegantly concise, and is one of the best
                    exertions of his sagacious mind.</p>
                <p>130. Whether we consider this problem as a piece of mere mathematical
                    speculation, or attend to its consequences, which include the whole of the
                    celestial motions in all their extent and complication, we must allow it to be
                    highly interesting, and likely to have engaged much attention in the period of
                    ardent inquiry which closed the last century. Accordingly, it was no sooner
                    known, by the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Mathematical Principles of
                    Natural Philosophy</hi> in 1686, than it occupied the talents of the most
                    eminent mathematicians; and many solutions were published, some of which differ
                    considerably from Newton’s, and some are more expeditious, and better fitted for
                    computation. Of these, the most remarkable for originality and ingenuity are
                    those of De Moivre, Hermann, Keill, and Stewart. The last differs most from the
                    methods pursued by others. M‘Laurin’s propositions on this subject, and in that
                    part of his fluxions which treats of curvature, are highly valuable, classing
                    the chief affections of curvilineal motions geometrically, as they are suggested
                    by the fluxionary method; and then showing, in a very instructive manner, the
                    connection between these mathematical affections of motion and the powers of
                    nature which produce them. This part of his excellent work is a fine example of
                    the real nature of all inquiries in dynamics, showing that it differs from
                    geometry little more than in the language, in which the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >force</hi> is substituted for <hi rend="italic">acceleration, retardation,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">deflection.</hi> We recommend the careful perusal of these
                    propositions to all who wish to have clear conceptions of the subject. Dr John
                    Keill and Dr Horsley (bishop of Rochester) have given particular treatises on
                    the motions of bodies deflected by centripetal forces inversely proportional to
                    the cubes of the distances; induced by the singular motions which result from
                    this law of action, and the multitude of beautiful propositions which they
                    suggest to the mathematician. Newton, indeed, first perceived both of these
                    peculiarities, and has begun this branch of the general problem. He first
                    demonstrated the description of the logarithmic and hyperbolic spirals, and
                    indicated a variety of curious recurring elliptical spirals, which would be
                    described by means of this force, showing that they are all susceptible of
                    accurate quadrature. Several of those authors affect to consider their solutions
                    as more perfect than Newton’s, and as more immediately indicating the remarkable
                    properties of such motions; and also affect to have deduced them from different
                    and original principles. But we cannot help saying that their claims to
                    superiority are very ill founded; there is not a principle made use of in their
                    solutions which was not pointed out by Newton, and employed by him. The
                    appearance of originality arises from their having taken a more particular
                    concern in some general property of curvilineal motions, such as the curvature,
                    the centrifugal force, &amp;c. and the making that the leading Step of their
                    process. But Newton’s is still the best, because it is strictly elementary,
                    aiming at the two leading circumstances, the motion to or from the centre, and
                    the motion of revolution round that centre. To these two purposes he adapted his
                    two subsidiary curves.</p>
                <p>131. Is it not surprising, that, twenty-five years after the! publication of
                    Newton’s <hi rend="italic">Principia,</hi> a mathematician on the Continent
                    should publish a solution in the Memoirs of the' French Academy, and boast that
                    he had given the first demonstration of it? Yet John Bernoulli did this in 1710
                    Is it not more remarkable that this should be precisely the solution given by
                    Newton, beginning from the same theorem, the 40th <hi rend="italic">i Prin.</hi>
                    following Newton in every step, and using the same subsidiary lines? Yet so it
                    is. Bernoulli actually reduces the whole to two functions, namely, <hi

                <p>Bernoulli’s chief boast in this dissertation is, that <hi rend="italic">now</hi>
                    philosophers may be assured that the planets will always describe conic
                    sections; a truth of which they had notas yet received any proof; because, says
                    he, Newton’s argument for it in the corollary of the 13th proposition is
                    inconclusive, and because he had not been able to accommodate his demonstration
                    of the 4lst and 42d propositions to the particular case of the planetary
                    gravitation. Newton’s demonstration in the corollary of the 13th proposition is
                    just founded on the principle on which the very demonstration of the 42d,
                    adopted by Bernoulli, proceeds, and without which that demonstration is of no
                    force; namely, that a body, in given circumstances of situation, velocity,
                    direction, and centripetal force, can describe no other figure than what it
                    really describes. Newton did not accommodate the demonstration of the 42d
                    proposition to the planetary motions, because he had already demonstrated the
                    nature of their orbits; but mentions the case of a force proportional to the
                    reciprocal of the cubes of their distance, not as a deduction from the 42d, but
                    because it <hi rend="italic">was not</hi> a deduction from it, and admitted a
                    very singular and beautiful investigation by methods totally and essentially
                    different.</p>

                <p>132. It cannot be expected that, in the narrow limits prescribed to a work like
                    ours, we can proceed to consider the various departments of this celebrated
                    problem. We are only giving the outlines of the general doctrines of dynamics;
                    and we have bestowed more time on those which are purely elementary than some
                    readers may think they deserve. We were anxious to give just conceptions of the
                    fundamental principles of dynamics; because we know that nothing else can
                    entitle it to the name of a demonstrative science, and because we see much
                    indistinctness and uncertainty, and a general vagueness or want of precision, in
                    several elementary works which are put into the hands of persons entering on the
                    study. This leads to errors of more consequence than a person is apt to think;
                    because they affect our leading thoughts of mechanism itself, and our notions of
                    the intimate nature of the visible universe.</p>
                <p>133. But we must conclude the article with this great <hi rend="superscript"
                    >!</hi> problem. Many very general doctrines of dynamics remain untouched; all,
                    namely, that relate to the rotative motion of rigid bodies, and all that relate
                    to the mutual action of bodies on each other in the way of impulse.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding these great omissions, we must observe that no new principle
                    remains to be considered. We have given all that are necessary; and there is no
                    question that occurs in the cases omitted which cannot be completely answered by
                    means of the propositions already established. We have taught how to discover
                    the existence and agency of a mechanical force, to measure and characterize it,
                    and then to state what will be its various effects, according to the
                    circumstances of the case.</p>
                <p>134. Proceeding by these principles, men have discovered an universal fact, that
                    every <hi rend="italic">action</hi> of one body on another is accompanied by an
                    equal <hi rend="italic">re-action</hi> of that other on the first in the
                    opposite direction; that is, to express it in the language of dynamics, “all the
                    phenomena which make us infer that the body A possesses a force by which it
                    changes the motion of the body B, show, at the same time, that B possesses a
                    force by which it makes an equal and opposite alteration in the motion of A.”
                    This, however, is not a doctrine of abstract dynamics; it does not flow from our
                    idea of force; therefore it was not included in our list of the <hi
                    rend="italic">laws of motion.</hi> It is a part of the mechanical history of
                    nature, just as the law of universal gravitation is; and it might be called the
                    law of <hi rend="italic">universal re-αctioii.</hi> Sir Isaac Newton has, in our
                    humble apprehension, deviated from his accustomed logical accuracy, when he
                    admits, as a third <hi rend="italic">axiom</hi> or law of motion, that re-action
                    is always equal and contrary to action. It is a physical law, in as far as it is
                    <hi rend="italic">observed</hi> to obtain through the whole extent of the solar
                    system. But Neavton himself did not, in the subsequent part of his noble work,
                    treat it as a logical axiom; that is, as a law of human thought with respect to
                    motion; for he labours with much solicitude, and with equal sagacity, to prove,
                    by <hi rend="italic">fact and observation,</hi> that it really obtains through
                    the whole extent of the solar system; and it is in this discovery that his chief
                    claim to unequalled penetration and discernment appears.</p>
                <p>135. Availing ourselves of this fact, we, with very little trouble, state all the
                    laws of impulsion. The body A, for example, moving to the westward at the rate
                    of eight feet per minute, overtakes the double body B, moving at the rate of
                    four feet per minute. What must be the consequence of their impenetrability, and
                    of the equality and contrariety of action and re-action? Their motions must be
                    such that both sustain equal and opposite changes. They must give, in some way
                    or other, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> indication of possessing equal and
                    opposite forces. This will be the case if, when the changes are completed, A and
                    B move on in contact at the rate of four feet per minute; for here A has
                    produced in each half of B a change of motion« two, and therefore a totality of
                    change equal to four. This is the effect, the mark, the measure of the <hi
                    rend="italic">impulsive</hi> force of A; for it is the whole žmputoon. B has
                    produced in A a change of motion four, equal to the former, and in the opposite
                    direction. This is the effect, mark, and measure of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >repulsive</hi> force of A; for it is the whole <hi rend="italic"
                    >repulsion.</hi> And this is all that we observe in the collision of two lumps
                    of clay; and the observation is one of the facts on which the reality of the
                    physical law of equal action and re-action is founded; and we can make no
                    further inference from <hi rend="italic">this</hi> fact.</p>
                <p>But the event might have been very different. A and B may be two magnets floating
                    on corks on water, with their north poles fronting each other. We know, by other
                    means, that they really possess forces by which they equally repel each other.
                    The dynamical principles already established tell us also what must happen in
                    this case. That both conditions of equal re-action and sensible repulsion may be
                    fulfilled, A must come to rest, and B must move forward at the rate of four feet
                    per minute. The same thing must happen in the meeting of perfectly elastic
                    bodies, such as billiard balls. If elasticities are known to be imperfect in any
                    degree, our dynamical principles will still state the effect of their collision
                    in conformity to the law of equal reaction.</p>
                <p>136. In like manner, all the motions of rotation are explained or predicted by
                    means of the same principles of dynamics applied to the force of cohesion. This
                    is considered as a moving force, because, when the attraction of a magnet acts
                    on a bit of iron attached to one end of a long lath floating on water, the whole
                    lath is moved, although the magnet does not act on it at all; some other force
                    acts on it; it is its cohesion, which is therefore a moving force, and the
                    subject of dynamical discussion.</p>
                <p>137. And thus it appears that these subjects do not come necessarily, nor perhaps
                    with scientific propriety, under the category of dynamics, but are parts of the
                    mechanical history of nature. Yet, did a work like ours give room in this place,
                    the study of mechanical nature might be considerably improved, by giving a
                    system of such <hi rend="italic">ge-ĩieral</hi> doctrines as involve no other
                    notions but those of force and its measures, and the hypothesis of equal
                    re-action. Some very general, nay universal, consequences of this combination
                    might be established, which would greatly assist the mechanician in the solution
                    of difficult and complicated problems. Such is the proposition, that <hi
                    rend="italic">the mutual actions of bodies depend on their relative motions
                    only, and require no knowledge of their real motions.</hi> This principle
                    simplifies in a wonderful manner the most difficult and the most frequent cases
                    of action which nature presents to our view; but at the same time gives a severe
                    blow to human vanity, by forcing us to acknowledge that we know nothing of the
                    real motion of any thing in the universe, and never shall know any thing of it,
                    till our intellectual constitution, or our opportunities of observation, are
                    completely changed.</p>
                <p>138. M. d’Alembert had made this principle still more serviceable for extricating
                    ourselves from the immense complication of actions that occurs in all the
                    spontaneous phenomena of nature, by presenting it to us in a different form,
                    which more distinctly expresses what may be called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >elements</hi> of the actions of bodies on each other. His proposition is as
                    follows (see his <hi rend="italic">Dynamique,</hi> page 73):</p>
                <p>“In whatever manner a number of bodies change their motions, if we suppose that
                    the motion which each body would have in the following moment, if it were
                    perfectly free, is decomposed into two others, one of which is the motion which
                    it really takes in consequence of their mutual actions, the other will be such,
                    that if each body were <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328179"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-8179-0388"/>impressed by this force alone (that is, by the
                    force which would produce this motion), the whole system of bodies would be in
                    equilibrio.”</p>
                <p>This is almost self-evident; for if these second constituent forces be not such
                    as would put the system in equilibrio, the other constituent motions could not
                    be those which the bodies really take by the mutual action, but would be changed
                    by the first.</p>
                <p>For example, let there be three bodies P, Q, R, and let the forces A, B, C, act
                    on them, such as would give them the velocities/», <hi rend="italic">q, r,</hi>
                    in any directions whatever, producing the momenta, or quantities of motion, P
                    <hi rend="italic">×p,</hi> Q × <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> R × <hi rend="italic"
                    >r,</hi> which we may call A, B, C, because they are the proper measures of the
                    moving force. Let us moreover suppose, that, by striking each other, or by being
                    any how connected with each other, they cannot take these motions, A, B, and C,
                    but really take the motions <hi rend="italic">a, b,</hi> and c. It is plain that
                    we may conceive the motion A impressed on the body P, to be composed of the
                    motion <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> which it really takes, and of another motion α.
                    In like manner, B may be resolved into <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> which it takes,
                    and another <hi rend="italic">β</hi>; and C into c and <hi rend="italic">X.</hi>
                    The motions will be the same, whether we act on P with the force A, or with the
                    two forces <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and α; whether we act on Q with the force B,
                    or with <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">β</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and on R with the force C, or with <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and κ. Now,
                    by the supposition, the bodies actually take the motions <hi rend="italic">a,
                    b,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> therefore the
                    motions α, <hi rend="italic">β,</hi> and κ, must be such as will not derange the
                    motions <hi rend="italic">a, b,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> that is to say, that if the bodies had only the motions α,
                    <hi rend="italic">β,</hi> and κ, impressed on them, they would destroy each
                    other, and the system would remain at rest.</p>
                <p>M. d’Alembert has applied this proposition with great address and success to the
                    very difficult questions that occur in the motions and actions of fluids, and
                    many other most difficult problems, such as the precession of the equinoxes,
                    &amp;c. The cause of its utility is, that in most cases it is not difficult to
                    find what forces will put a system in equilibrio; and, combining these with the
                    known extraneous forces whose effects we are interested to discover, we obtain
                    the motions which really follow the mutual action of the bodies.</p>
                <p>This is not, properly speaking, a principle; it is a form in which a general fact
                    may be conceived. In the same way the celebrated mathematician De la Grange
                    observed, that a system of bodies, acting on each other in any way, is in
                    equilibrio, if there be impressed on its parts forces in the inverse proportion
                    of the velocities which each body takes in consequence of their action or
                    connection; and he expresses this universal fact by a very simple formula; and,
                    calling this also a principle, he solves every question with ease and neatness,
                    by reducing it to the investigation of those velocities. In this way he has
                    written a complete system of dynamics, to which he gives the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Mechanique</hi><hi rend="italic">Analytique,</hi> full of the most
                    ingenious and elegant solutions of very interesting and difficult problems; and
                    all this without drawing a line or figure, but accomplishing the whole by
                    algebraic operations.</p>
                <p>But this is not teaching mechanical philosophy; it is merely employing the reader
                    in algebraic operations, each of which he perfectly understands in its quality
                    of an algebraic or arithmetical operation, and where he may have the fullest
                    conviction of the justness of his procedure. But all this may be (and, in the
                    hands of an expert algebraist, it generally is), without any notions, distinct
                    or indistinct, of the things or the process of reasoning that are represented by
                    the symbols made use of. <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. b. b.)</hi></p>
