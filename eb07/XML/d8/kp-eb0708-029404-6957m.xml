                <p><label type="entry">DWARF</label>, in general, an appellation given to things
                    greatly inferior in size to that which is usual in their several kinds. Thus
                    there are dwarfs of the human species, dwarf dogs, dwarf trees, and the
                    like.</p>
                <p>The Romans were passionately fond of dwarfs, whom they called <hi rend="italic"
                    >nani</hi> or <hi rend="italic">nance,</hi> insomuch that they often used
                    artificial methods to prevent the growth of boys designed for dwarfs, by
                    inclosing them in boxes, or by the use of tight bandages. Augustus’s niece,
                    Julia, was extremely fond of a dwarf called Sonopas, who was only two feet and a
                    handbreadth in height. We have many other accounts of human dwarfs, but most of
                    them deformed in some way or other, besides the smallness of their size. Many
                    relations concerning dwarfs we must necessarily look upon as not less fabulous
                    than those concerning giants. The following history, however, which there is
                    reason to regard as authentic, is too remarkable not to be acceptable to the
                    generality of our readers.</p>
                <p>Jeffery Hudson, the famous English dwarf, was born at Oakham, in Rutlandshire, in
                    1619; and about the age of seven or eight, being then but eighteen inches high,
                    he was retained in the service of the Duke of Buckingham, who resided at
                    Burleigh-on-the-Hill. Soon after the marriage of Charles 1. the king and queen
                    being entertained at Burleigh, little Jeffery was served up at table in a cold
                    pie, and presented by the duchess to the queen, who kept him as her dwarf. From
                    seven years of age till thirty he never grew taller; but after thirty he shot up
                    to three feet nine inches, and there remained fixed. Jeffery became a
                    considerable part of the entertainment of the court. Sir William Davenant wrote
                    a poem called <hi rend="italic">Jeffreidos,</hi> on a battle between him and a
                    turkey-cock; and in 1638 was published a very small book, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">New Years Gift,</hi> presented at court by the Lady Parvula to the
                    Lord Minimus, commonly called <hi rend="italic">Little Jeffery,</hi> her
                    majesty’s servant, written by Microphilus, with a little print of Jeffery
                    prefixed. Before this period Jeffery was employed on a negotiation of great
                    importance; he was sent to France to fetch a midwife for the queen; and on his
                    return with this gentlewoman and her majesty’s dancing-master, and many rich
                    presents to the queen from her mother Mary de’Medicis, he was taken by the
                    Dunkirkers. Jeffery, being thus made of consequence, began to think himself
                    really an important personage. He had borne with little temper the teasing of
                    the courtiers and domestics, and had many squabbles with the king’s gigantic
                    porter. At last, being provoked by Mr Crofts, a young gentleman of family, a
                    challenge ensued; and Mr Crofts coming to the rendezvous armed only with a
                    squirt, the little creature was so enraged that a real duel ensued; and the
                    appointment being on horseback with pistols, to put them more on a level,
                    Jeffery, with the first fire, shot his antagonist dead. This happened in France,
                    whither he had attended his mistress in the troubles. He was again taken
                    prisoner by a Turkish rover, and sold into Barbary. But he probably did not
                    remain long in slavery; for at the beginning of the civil war he was made a
                    captain in the royal army, and in 1644 attended the queen to France, where he
                    remained till the Restoration. At last, upon suspicion of his being concerned in
                    the Popish plot, he was seized in 1682, and confined in the Gatehouse,
                    Westminster, where he ended his life, in the sixty-third year of his age. This
                    little hero cuts a considerable figure in Sir Walter Scott’s novel of <hi
                    rend="italic">Peveril of the Peak.</hi></p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences,</hi> a
                    relation is given by the Count de Tressau, of a dwarf called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hebe,</hi> kept by Stanislaus, king of Poland, and who died in 1764, at the age
                    of twenty-three, when he measured only thirty-two inches. At the time of his
                    birth he measured only between eight and nine inches. Diminutive as were his
                    dimensions, his reasoning faculties were not less scanty, appearing indeed not
                    to have been superior to those of a well-taught pointer. But that the size and
                    strength of the intellectual powers are not affected by the d’minutiveness or
                    tenuity of the corporeal organs, is evident from a still more striking instance
                    of littleness, given us by the same nobleman, in the person of M. Borulawski, a
                    Polish gentleman, whom he saw at Luneville, and who at the age of twenty-two
                    measured only twenty-eight inches. This miniature of a man, considering him only
                    with reference to his bodily dimensions, appeared a giant with regard to his
                    mental powers and attainments. He is described by the count as possessing all
                    the graces of wit, united with a sound judgment and an excellent memory; so that
                    we may with justice say of Μ. Borulawski, in the words of Seneca, and nearly in
                    the order in which he has used them, <hi rend="italic">posse</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ingenium fortissimum ac beatissimum sub quolibet corpusculo
                    latere.</hi></p>
