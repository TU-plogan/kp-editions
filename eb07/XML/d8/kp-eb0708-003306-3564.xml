                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    of a metropolitan.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Diocaesis (δ</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >οoοηδ</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">ς)</hi> was originally a
                    civil government, or prefecture, composed of different provinces.</p>
                <p>The first division of the empire into dioceses is ordinarily ascribed to
                    Constantine, who distributed the whole Roman world into four, namely, the
                    diocese of Italy, the diocese of Illyria, that of the East, and that of Africa.
                    And yet long before the time of Constantine, Strabo, who wrote under Tiberius,
                    takes notice (lib. xiii. p. 432), that the Romans had divided Asia into
                    dioceses; and he complains of the confusion which such a division occasioned in
                    geography, Asia being no longer divided by people, but by dioceses, each of
                    which had a tribunal or court, where justice was administered. Constantine,
                    therefore, was only the institutor of those large dioceses, which comprehended
                    several metropolises and governments; the former dioceses only comprehending one
                    jurisdiction or district, or the country which had resort to one judge, as
                    appears from the above passage in Strabo, and also from two in Cieero (lib. iii.
                    <hi rend="italic">epist. ad Eamil.</hi> 9, and lib. xiii. <hi rend="italic"
                    >ep.</hi> 67).</p>
                <p>Thus at first a province included different dioceses, and afterwards a diocese
                    came to comprehend different provinces. In after times the Roman empire became
                    divided into thirteen dioceses or prefectures; though, including Rome and the
                    suburbic regions, there were fourteen. These fourteen dioceses comprehended a
                    hundred and twenty provinces; each province had a proconsul, who resided in the
                    capital or metropolis; and each diocese of the empire had a consul, who presided
                    in the principal city of the district.</p>
                <p>On this civil constitution the eeclesiastical one was afterwards regulated; and
                    each dioecse had an ecclesiastical vicar or primate, who judged finally of all
                    the concerns of the church within his territory. At present, however, diocese
                    does not signify an assemblage of different provinces, but is limited to a
                    single province under a metropolitan, or more commonly to the single
                    jurisdiction of a bishop.</p>
                <p>Brito affirms that diocese is properly the territory and extent of a baptismal or
                    parochial church; and hence various authors use the word to signify a simple
                    parish. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Parish.</hi></p>
