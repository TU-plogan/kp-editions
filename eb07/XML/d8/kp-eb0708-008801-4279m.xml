                <p><label type="entry">DOCTOR</label>, a person who has passed all the degrees of a
                    faculty, and is empowered to teach or practise the same. Thus we say, doctor in
                    divinity, doctor in physic, doctor of laws.</p>
                <p>The establishment of the <hi rend="italic">doctorate,</hi> as now in use amongst
                    us, is ordinarily attributed to Irnerius, who himself drew up the formulary. The
                    first ceremony of this kind was performed at Bologna, in the person of Bulgarus,
                    who began to profess the Roman law, and on that occasion was solemnly promoted
                    to the <hi rend="italic">doctorate,</hi> that is, installed <hi rend="italic"
                    >juris utriusque doctor.</hi> But the custom was soon transferred from the
                    faculty of law to that of theology; the first instance of which was given in the
                    university of Paris, where Peter Lombard and Gilbert de la Portree, the two
                    leading divines of those days, were created doctors in theology, <hi
                    rend="italic">sacree theologiae doctores.</hi></p>
                <p>Spelman conceives the title of doctor not to have commenced till after the
                    publication of Lombard’s sentences, about the year 1140. Others, however, go
                    much higher, holding Bede to have been the first doctor at Cambridge, and John
                    de Beverley at Oxford, where the latter died in the year 721. But Spelman
                    contends that doctor was not the name of any title or degree in England till the
                    reign of King John, that is, about the year 1207. As to the qualifications or
                    course of study necessary to obtain the degree of doctor in the different
                    faculties of theology, law, and medicine, see the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Universities.</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Doctor</hi><hi rend="italic">of
                    the Law,</hi> a title of honour among the Jews. The investiture, if we may so
                    speak, of this order, was performed by putting a key and a table book in their
                    hands; and this is what some authors imagine our Saviour had in view (Luke, xi.
                    52) when, speaking of the doctors of the law, he says, “Wo unto you, lawyers!
                    for ye have taken away the key of knowledge; ye enter not in yourselves, and
                    them that were entering in ye hindered.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Doctor</hi><hi rend="italic">of the Church,</hi> a
                    title given to certain of the fathers whose doctrines and opinions have been the
                    most generally followed and authorized. We usually reckon four doctors of the
                    Greek church and three of the Latin. The former are, St Athanasius, St Basil, St
                    Gregory Nazianzen, and St Chrysostom; the latter are St Jerome, St Augustin, and
                    Gregory the Great. In the Roman breviary there is a particular office for the
                    doctors, which only differs from that of the confessors by the anthem of the
                    Magnificat and the lessons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Doctor</hi> is also an appellation adjoined to a specific
                    epithet, expressing the merit of some eminent schoolman. Thus, Alexander Hales
                    is called the irrefragable doctor; Thomas Aquinas, the angelic doctor; St
                    Bonaventure, the seraphic doctor; John Duns Scotus, the subtile doctor<pb

                    the illuminated doctor; Roger Bacon, the admirable doctor; and so of the
                    rest.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Doctor</hi> (∆∕δαtfκαλoς), in the Greek church, is a
