                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">DICTATOR</label>, a magistrate at Rome invested with regal
                    authority. This officer was first chosen during the Roman wars against the
                    Latins. The consuls being unable to raise forces for the defence of the state,
                    because the plebeians refused to inlist if they were not discharged of all the
                    debts which they had contracted with the patricians, the senate found it
                    necessary to elect a new magistrate with absolute and uncontrollable power to
                    take care of the state. The dictator remained in office for six months, after
                    which he was again elected if the affairs of the state seemed to be desperate;
                    but if tranquillity was re-established, he generally resigned his power before
                    the time had expired. He knew no superior in the republic, and even the laws
                    were subjected to him. He was called dictator, because <hi rend="italic"
                    >dictus,</hi> named by the consul, or <hi rend="italic">quoniam dictis ejus
                    parebat populus,</hi> because the people implicitly obeyed his command. He was
                    named by the consul in the night, <hi rend="italic">viva voce,</hi> and his
                    election was confirmed by the augurs. As his power was absolute, he could
                    proclaim war, levy forces, conduct them against an enemy, and disband them at
                    his pleasure. He punished as he pleased, and from his decision there lay no
                    appeal, at least till later times. He was preceded by twenty-four lictors with
                    the <hi rend="italic">fasces</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and during his
                    administration, all other officers, except the tribunes of the people, were
                    suspended. In short, he was the master of the republic. But amidst all this
                    independence he was not permitted to go beyond the borders of Italy; he was
                    always obliged to march on foot in his expeditions; and he never could ride in
                    difficult and laborious marches without previously obtaining formal leave from
                    the people. He was chosen only when the state was in imminent danger from
                    foreign enemies or inward seditions. In the time of a pestilence a dictator was
                    sometimes elected, as also in order to hold the <hi rend="italic">comitia,</hi>
                    or to celebrate the public festivals, or drive a nail into the capitol, by which
                    superstitious ceremony the Romans believed that a plague could be averted or the
                    progress of an enemy stopped. But this office, so <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193323265" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3265-0010"/>respectable and illustrious
                    in the first ages of the republic, became excessively odious by the usurpations
                    of Sylla and Julius Caesar; and after the death of the latter, the Roman senate
                    passed a decree abolishing for ever the dictatorship in Rome. The dictator, as
                    soon as elected, chose a subordinate officer, who was called his master of
                    horse, <hi rend="italic">magister</hi><hi rend="italic">equitum.</hi> This
                    officer was respectable; but he was totally subservient to the will of the
                    dictator, and could do nothing without the express order of the latter. This
                    subordination, however, was some time afterwards removed; and during the second
                    Punic war the master of the horse was invested with a power equal to that of the
                    dictator. A second dictator was also chosen for the election of magistrates at
                    Rome after the battle of Cannae. The dictatorship was originally confined to the
                    patricians; but the plebeians were afterwards admitted to share it. Titus
                    Lartius Flavus was the first dictator, in the year of Rome 253.</p>
