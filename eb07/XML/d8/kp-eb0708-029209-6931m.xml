                <p><label type="entry">DUSSAULX, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, a French
                    writer, best known as the translator of <hi rend="italic">Jzwenal,</hi> was born
                    at Chartres, on the 28th of December 1728. He studied first at La Fleche, and
                    afterwards at Paris; and having obtained the situation of a commissary in the
                    <hi rend="italic">gendarmerie,</hi> he served under the Marshal de Richelieu, in
                    Hanover, during the seven years’ war. At the age of twenty-one he was admitted a
                    member of the academy at Nanci; and in 1770 he published his translation of <hi
                    rend="italic">Juvenal.</hi> This work procured him admission into the Academy of
                    Inscriptions; and he was also appointed ordinary secretary to the Duke of
                    Orleans.</p>
                <p>For some years he quietly prosecuted his literary occupations at Paris; but, upon
                    the breaking out of the Revolution, his enthusiastic disposition led him to
                    adopt its principles; and he took part in the debates of the legislative
                    assembly. He spoke and voted, however, at all times for moderate measures; and,
                    on several occasions, he was employed to calm the passions of the people during
                    public tumults. At the memorable sitting of the convention of the 15th of
                    January 1793, he voted that the king should be detained in custody during the
                    war, and banished on the return of peace. It is rather remarkable, that when the
                    committee of public safety wished to send him to the scaffold, his pardon was
                    obtained by Marat, who represented him as an old dotard, incapable of becoming
                    dangerous. He became president of the council of ancients in the month of July
                    1796, but left it in 1798. At the sitting of the 27th of April, he took leave of
                    the assembly in a speech which was ordered to be printed. He died on the 16th of
                    March 1799, after a long and painful illness.</p>
                <p>Dussaulx was a man of considerable literary attainments, and amiable, upright,
                    and disinterested in his conduct. His translation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Juvenal</hi> is esteemed the best version of that poet in the French language.
                    His other works are, <hi rend="italic">Mémoires sur les Satiriques Latins;
                    Lettres et</hi><hi rend="italic">Deflexions</hi><hi rend="italic">sur la fureur

                    throws considerable light on the character of that celebrated man.</p>
                <p>Marie-Jeanne Lieutau, the widow of Dussaulx, published memoirs of his life, which
                    are exceedingly interesting. See also Palissot, <hi rend="italic">Mémoires sur
