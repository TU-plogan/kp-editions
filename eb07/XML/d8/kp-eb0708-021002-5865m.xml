                    at Hawthornden on the 13th of December 1585. His father was Sir John Drummond,
                    descended from the family of Carnock, a branch of the more illustrious family of
                    Stobhall, from which the king derives his remote lineage through Ana-bella
                    Drummond, the mother of James the First. The poet’s mother was Anne the daughter
                    of William Fowler;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>He is
                    commonly described as Sir William Fowler, secretary to the queen, but this
                    account of his quality is evidently erroneous. The secretary was his son, who
                    bore the same name with himself; nor does it appear that either of them received
                    the honour of knighthood. The son followed the queen to England; and a list of
                    the officers of her council, dated in October 1603, describes him as
                    “Secretarie, and Master of the Requests.” (Lodge’s Illustrations of British
                    History, vol. iii. p. 209.) In 1587, we find him denominated parson of Hawick;
                    and the records of the presbytery, 2 Sept. 1612, mention him as then dead. It is
                    however more than probable that he continued a layman, and, at a period when
                    such irregular proceedings were not uncommon, enjoyed the temporalities of that
                    living without residence and without qualification. His poems are not unknown to
                    those who are acquainted with the literary history of that age. Of some of his
                    manuscripts, as well as those of his nephew, Mr Laing has given an account in
                    the Transactions of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, vol. iv.</p></note>
                    and she is described as it a woman of excellent breeding, and of a good and
                    virtuous life.” William was the eldest of four sons, and there were three
                    daughters by the same marriage. The earlier part of his education he received at
                    the High School of Edinburgh, where he began to distinguish himself by the
                    superiority of his talents; and being afterwards removed to the university,
                    which was then a very recent institution, he took the degree of A. Μ. in the
                    year 1605. We are particularly informed that he did not confine his attention to
                    the metaphysical learning commonly taught in the schools, but likewise applied
                    himself to the study of mathematics and of ancient authors. During the following
                    year, his father sent him to complete his education in France; and in the
                    university of Bourges he is said to have devoted himself with great assiduity
                    and success to the study of the civil law; a study necessary to a lawyer, and
                    useful to a scholar. After an absence of four years, he returned to his native
                    country in 1610; and his friends now expected that he would devote himself to
                    the practice of a lucrative profession, for which he seemed eminently qualified
                    by his talents and learning.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>President Lockhart is said to have averred, that if he had
                    followed the legal profession, he might have made the best figure of any lawyer
                    in his time. But the accuracy of this tradition, says Mr Maitland, “may
                    reasonably be doubted. Drummond has left a record of the books read by him
                    between 1606 and 1614, from which it is apparent that literature occupied a much
                    larger portion of his attention than law. In the detail of his studies, which
                    were in a great measure confined to the most popular poetry and romances of the
                    time, he mentions no other work on law than the Institutes of Justinian.”
                    (Introduction to Drummond’s Poems. Edinb. 1832, 4to.)</p></note> The bar must
                    however have presented very few attractions to a youth of his elegant taste and
                    delicate sensibility: the municipal law was then but a dreary path, beset with
                    thorns which never blossomed; and, what was particularly discouraging, there was
                    not a single elementary book, there were no institutions of our law, from which
                    a young student could derive a comprehensive knowledge of those principles which
                    were afterwards to direct his practice. His systematic doctrines were indeed to
                    a great extent borrowed from the ancient civilians, and the study of the civil
                    law was generally prosecuted in some foreign university; but, besides an
                    indispensable attendance in the courts, his final preparation for the practice
                    of his profession consisted in reading the statute law, and such collections of
                    maxims and reports as were then circulated in manuscript. Nor was Drummond
                    compelled by any domestic considerations to overcome his repugnance: he was
                    beyond the reach of that original impulse which has directed many a lawyer to
                    reputation and emolument; for, about the period of his return from the
                    continent, the death of his father left him in possession of an estate
                    sufficient to maintain him in the liberal style of a gentleman.</p>

                <p>He now retired to his family resldence at Hawthornden, six miles from Edinburgh,
                    and resumed the study of the Greek and Latin classics. The immediate vicinity
                    presents an air of such romantic beauty, that a poet could scarcely have found a
                    more suitable habitation: his house is erected on the edge of a woody cliff
                    which overhangs the river Esk; and at one extremity of the variegated and
                    sequestered glen stand the ruins of the baronial castle and the collegiate
                    church of Roslin. The ancient caves of Hawthornden, and the adjacent moor of
                    Roslin, where Comyn and Fraser gained a signal victory over the English, have
                    likewise their peculiar effect in impressing the imagination. Near the poet’s
                    house is a seat hewn in the solid rock, and still described by the name of the
                    Cypress-grove; a name which it obtained from the circumstance of his having
                    frequented this spot when engaged in the composition of a work which bears that
                    title.</p>
                <p>Here Damon <hi rend="superscript"> ς</hi> sat’ whose songs did sometime grace</p>
                <p>The murmuring Esk; may roses shade the place.</p>
                <p>In this delightful seclusion he devoted himself to the general improvement of his
                    mind, and to the occasional exercise of his fine talents; and many of his poems
                    appear to have been composed about this period of his life.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The first edition of his poems has the
                    following title: “Poems, amorous, funerali, diuine, pastorali, in Sonnets,
                    Songs, Sextains, Madrigals. By W. D. the author of the Teares on the Death of
                    Aloeliades.” Edinbvrgh, printed by Andro Hart, 1616, 4to. Another edition, or
                    the same edition with a new title, bears “Poems, by William Drvmmond of
                    Hawthorne-denne. The second impression.” Edinbvrgh, printed by Andro Hart, 1616,
                    4to.</p></note> He chiefly cultivated the familiarity of the university men, and
                    other individuals of genius and learning: among his own countrymen, he enjoyed
                    the particular friendship of the earl of Stirling, the earl of Ancram, Arthur
                    Johnston, and John Adamson; and among the English poets, his greatest intimacy
                    and correspondence was with Ben Jonson and Michael Drayton. The grandfather of
                    Jonson was originally from Annandale, where Johnstone is still a very prevalent
                    name. In the year 1619, when this celebrated poet had attained the age of
                    forty-five, he travelled from London on foot, for the express purpose of paying
                    Drummond a visit; and at Hawthornden he spent three or four weeks with every
                    appearance of satisfaction.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>To this visit another poet of exquisite talents makes the following
                    allusion:</p><p>Then will I dress once more the faded bower,</p><p>Where Jonson
                    sat in Drummond’s classic shade· <hi rend="smallcaps">Collins’s</hi> Ode to John
                    Home.</p></note> The heads of some of Jonson’s conversations on subjects of
                    literature, together with his own impressions of Jonson’s character, he
                    committed to writing, with the manifest intention of occasionally referring to
                    this as a private record: many years after his death, this paper was
                    communicated to the public, apparently in a somewhat mutilated form; and as it
                    does not represent his distinguished guest as altogether faultless, the amiable
                    and esteemed writer has incurred the virulent and unmeasured censure of Mr
                    Gifford, the late editor of Jonson’s works.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Gifford’s Memoirs of Jonson, p. cxxx.—This charge has been

                    Scotland, vol. ii∙ p. 133. See likewise Dr Drake’s Mornings in Spring, vol. i.
                    p. 286.</p></note> If Drummond had resembled some more recent authors, who have
                    violated all the decencies of private life by ministering to the gross appetite
                    of the public with ridiculous or disparaging tales of their friends and
                    acquaintance, the justice of this strong condemnation could not safely have been
                    disputed; but what person of ordinary candour will thus censure an act which, to
                    all human appearance, was entirely unconnected with malevolent or ungenerous
                    motives?</p>
                <p>The poet’s tranquillity was exposed to a severe interruption from the unfortunate
                    issue of his first love. He became deeply enamoured of a beautiful young lady,
                    the daughter of Cunningham of Barns; he met with a suitable return, and a day
                    was fixed for their nuptials, but before that day arrived, her life was
                    terminated by a rapid fever. Such an event as this, which would have affected a
                    lover of the most ordinary sensibility, could not but sink deeply into the heart
                    of one who had assiduously cherished the softer feelings, and whose habits of
                    seclusion were so directly calculated to preserve a lasting impression of
                    melancholy. He was so overwhelmed with grief that he found it necessary to try
                    the effect of a change of objects; and he accordingly retired to the continent,
                    where he spent about eight years. His longest residence was at Paris and Rome;
                    but he travelled through France, Germany, and Italy, visited the most celebrated
                    universities, and conversed with men of learning. In the course of his
                    peregrinations, he is said to have formed an excellent collection, not only of
                    the ancient classics, but likewise of the best writers in the French, Italian,
                    and Spanish languages. He presented to the university of Edinburgh a collection
                    of books and manuscripts, of which he printed a catalogue in the year 1627,
                    prefixing to it an appropriate preface written in Latin. Of this well-known
                    collection, the value, that is, the extrinsic or pecuniary value, which was far
                    from being inconsiderable at first, has been immensely encreased by the lapse of
                    two centuries. It contains many Scotish and English publications of singular
                    rarity. When Drummond returned to Scotland, he found his countrymen divided by
                    fears and animosities. He now spent some time at the residence of his
                    brother-in-law Sir John Scot of Scotstarvet, a learned man, and an encourager of
                    learning. Having continued in a state of celibacy till the age of forty-seven,
                    he in 1632 married Elizabeth Logan; a lady in whom he traced a strong
                    resemblance to his first mistress. She is commonly represented as the
                    grand-daughter of Sir Robert Logan of Restalrig; but, according to Hay, her
                    father, who was altogether unconnected with that family, was minister of
                    Edleston in the county of Peebles, and her mother was the daughter of a
                    shepherd.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hay’s Memoirs,

                    tragical fate of his sovereign is said to have hastened his own dissolution: we
                    are informed by Bishop Sage that Drummond, being weakened by hard study and
                    disease, was so overwhelmed with extreme grief and anguish that he died on the

                    render the biographer’s inference somewhat questionable. He had nearly completed

                    Lasswade, which stands at the distance of about a mile from Hawthornden. He
                    appears through life to have maintained a character of uniform respectability;
                    uniting with his other qualities that of consistent piety, and blending morality
                    with his devotion. His death was affectionately lamented by his friend Colonel
                    Lauder of Hatton, who has left several other specimens of his poetical talents,
                    and who was not the only Scotish soldier of this period that evinced his love of
                    the Muses.</p>
                <p>Drummond was evidently a man of superior talents and accomplishments. We are
                    informed that he was familiarly acquainted with the best Greek and Latin
                    authors: his long residence on the continent afforded him an excellent
                    opportunity of acquiring a knowledge of the living languages; and he is said to
                    have spoken French, Italian, and Spanish, as fluently as his native tongue. To
                    his graver qualifications he added no mean proficiency in music; and he
                    occasionally sought a relaxation from his studies by playing on the lute, “which
                    he did to admiration.” He seems to have devoted a considerable portion of his
                    time to the invention or improvement of various instruments and machines,
                    applicable to various purposes of peace or war. They are curiously enumerated,
                    to the extent of sixteen, in a patent which he obtained in the year 1627, and
                    which secured to him the sole right and property within the kingdom of Scotland
                    for the space of twenty-one years.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>His literary productions exhibit considerable variety. His compositions in prose
                    chiefly consist of the Cypress Grove, some political tracts, and the History of
                    the five Jameses; a work which embraces the history of Scotland from 1423 to

                    “The best of Drummond’s prose works,” says Mr Headley, “is his Cypress Grove,
                    which, though quaint in its style, is worth reading for its vein of dignified
                    morality.” His history, which has alternately been the object of extravagant
                    commendation and unsparing censure, cannot now be regarded as a work of much
                    value or interest: the author’s materials are not generally drawn from recondite
                    sources, and his manner is too rhetorical. For tþe reputation which he still
                    retains, Drummond is chiefly indebted, not to his historical, but to his
                    poetical excellence; and, in the opinion of competent judges, he is entitled to
                    a distinguished place among the English poets of that age. As few of his poems
                    extend to a considerable length, his genius cannot be estimated by the success
                    of any great and continued effort; but notwithstanding the shortness of his
                    flights, he gene-, rally soars on bright and steady wings. He is conspicuous for
                    his delicate sensibility and warmth of fancy; and with these qualities, so
                    essential in an amatory poet, he unites uncommon skill in versification. His
                    taste seems in a great measure to have been formed upon the Italian model, nor
                    are his compositions entirely free from Italian conceits; but he commonly
                    maintains a degree of elegant simplicity to which few English poets of that age
                    have attained.</p>
                <p>The reputation which Drummond enjoyed during his life, appears to have suffered
                    some diminution after his death. He was a gentleman, says Edward Phillips, “who
                    imitating the Italian manner of versifying, vented his amours in sonnets,
                    canzonets, and madrigals, and, to my thinking, in a style sufficiently smooth
                    and delightful; and therefore why so utterly disregarded and layd aside at
                    present, I leave to the more curious palats in poetry.”<note anchored="true"

                    interval of more than a century, the same complaint of unmerited neglect was
                    repeated by Mr Headley. “Without ostentatious praise (which is always to be
                    suspected), it is but truth to observe that many of his sonnets, those more
                    especially which are divested of Italian conceits, resemble the best Greek
                    epigrams in their best taste, in that exquisite delicacy of sentiment, and
                    simplicity of expression, for which our language has no single term, but which

                    means applicable; it is neither applicable to the vein of poetry, nor to the

                    >a</hi> song, is written in heroic couplets, and contains such passages as
                    this:</p>
                <p>And tell me, thou who dost so much admire</p>
                <p>This little vapour, smoke, this spark or fire,</p>

                    imagery and expression. Some of the topics cannot be very safely approached by a
                    poet, who must place his chief reliance on the exercise of his fancy; and the
                    subsequent lines of this writer may sometimes occur to the recollection of his
                    reader:</p>

                <p>One of the longest poems in this collection, entitled a Hymne on the fairest
                    Faire, contains the following among many other striking passages:</p>
                <p>Ah! as a pilgrim who the Alps doth pass, Or Atlas’ temples crown’d with winter’s
                    glass, The airy Caucasus, the Apennine, Tyrenes cliffs where sun doth never
                    shine, When he some heaps of hills hath over-went, Begins to think on rest, his
                    journey spent, Till, mounting some tall mountain, he doth find More heights
                    before him than he left behind: With halting pace so while I would me raise To
                    the unbounded circuits of thy praise, Some part of way I thought to have
                    o’er-run, But now I see how scarce I have begun, With wonders new my spirits
                    range possest, And wan d’ring way less in a maze them rest.</p>
                <p>It has been suggested by Mr Headley that one would be induced to suppose Pope
                    must have remembered these lines when he wrote a well-known passage in his Essay
                    on Criticism. The subsequent couplet, which occurs in the same hymn, is
                    remarkable for its energetic simplicity:</p>

                <p>So seeing earth, of angels once the inn, Mansion of saints, defloured all by sin,
                    And quite confus’d by wretches here beneath, The world’s great sovereign moved

                    did throughout the heavenly place: The stars, though fixed, in their rounds did
                    quake, The earth, and earth-embracing sea did shake: Carmel and Haemus felt it,
                    Athos’ tops Affrighted shrunk, and near the Ethiops Atlas, the Pyrenees, the

                    considered as his best performance; it abounds with poetical imagery, and the
                    versification possesses uncommon terseness and harmony. In all poems of the same
                    age and denomination, the reader must necessarily expect a certain sprinkling of
                    mythology; this is a prevailing vice, an endemic disease, among the poets of
                    that period; but Forth Feasting is enlivened by an elegant vein of fancy, and
                    contains various passages of distinguished felicity. In the following nervous
                    lines, he pays a warm and not unmerited compliment to the monarch’s love of
                    peace:</p>
                <p>Now, where the wounded knight his life did bleed,</p>
                <p>The wanton swain sits piping on a reed,</p>
                <p>And where the cannon did Jove’s thunder scorn,</p>
                <p>The gaudy huntsman winds his shrill-tun’d horn;</p>
                <p>Her green locks Ceres without fear doth dye,</p>
                <p>The pilgrim safely in the shade doth lie, Both Pan and Pales careless keep their
                    flocks, Seas have no dangers save the winds and rocks: Thou art this isle’s
                    Palladium, neither can, While thou art kept, it be o’erthrown by man. Let others
                    boast of blood and spoils of foes, Fierce rapines, murders, Iliads of woes, Of
                    hated pomp, and trophies reared fair, Gore-spangled ensigns streaming in the
                    air, Count how they make the Scythian them adore, The Gaditan, the soldier of
                    Aurore;</p>
                <p>Unhappy vauntry! to enlarge their bounds,</p>
                <p>Which charge themselves with cares, their friends with wounds, Which have no law
                    to their ambitious will,</p>
                <p>But, man plagues, born are human blood to spill: Thou a true victor art, sent
                    from above, What others strain by force to gain by love;</p>
                <p>Wörld-wand’ring Fame this praise to thee imparts, To be the only monarch of all
                    hearts.</p>
                <p>When the successor of this king visited his northern dominions in the year 1633,
                    Drummond contributed the verses for the pageants which welcomed his arrival in

                    verses, although they do not exhibit passages equal to those which we have

                    harmony of his couplets, every reader must be sufficiently aware; and the
                    excellence of his versification has been highly extolled by an English critic.
                    Waller and Denham are often regarded as the great improvers of a mode of
                    versification which was carried to greater perfection by Dryden; but the Tears
                    on the Death of Moeliades, and Forth Feasting, were composed several years
                    before either of those poets had reached the age of manhood.<note

                    1828. The date of his birth we have not been able to ascertain, and consequently
                    cannot pretend to determine his age at the time of his decease.</p>
                <p>He seems to have been early ambitious of literary distinction, and in 1794 he
                    published <hi rend="italic">A Review of die Government of Sparta and
                    Athens,</hi> large 8vo; a work which, though not destitute of merit, and
                    exhibiting considerable traces of a vigorous mind, yet gave no promise of that
                    bold spirit of speculation for which its author was afterwards so much
                    distinguished. At the close of the year 1795, he was returned to parliament for
                    the borough of St Mawes, in the representation of which a vacancy had occurred;
                    and in the two following parliaments, which met respectively in 1796 and 1801,
                    he sat for the town of Lostwithiel. At the time of his second election he had
                    been appointed envoy-extraordinary to the court of Naples.</p>
                <p>In the year 1798, he published <hi rend="italic">The Satires of Persius
                    Translated,</hi> 8vo, which happened to appear about the same time with the
                    rival translation of the Roman satirist by Mr Gifford, author of the Baviad and
                    Maeviad, and afterwards editor of the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review.</hi>
                    This translation alone would have been sufficient to fix his reputation as an
                    accomplished classical scholar; and, in point of fact, it has been much admired
                    by all who are competent to appreciate the difficulty of the task which he so
                    successfully performed. It would not be easy, indeed, to overrate the skill with
                    which the niceties of Persius have been discriminated, or the felicity with
                    which the idiomatic peculiarities of that difficult author have been converted
                    into equivalent forms of expression. Drummond’s versification is easy, graceful,
                    and precise; and though it wants the piquancy of allusion, the congenial
                    bitterness of spirit, and the occasional point and concentration, which impart
                    so strong a zest to the translation of Mr Gifford, it is yet distinguished for
                    greater freedom and equal fidelity, two things which Drummond has shown that it
                    is not impossible to reconcile.</p>
                <p>In the year 1801, Mr Drummond being then ambassador to the Ottoman Porte, was
                    honoured with the order of the Crescent, which was confirmed by license, in the
                    London Gazette, dated the 8th of September 1803.</p>
                <p>In 1805 Sir William published his <hi rend="italic">Academical Questions,</hi> in
                    4to, and thereby greatly extended his fame as an author. Hitherto he had
                    appeared only in the character of an elegant and accomplished scholar; but in
                    this work he boldly entered the domain of philosophy, and in a free and fearless
                    spirit attacked every species of dogmatism, whether consecrated by time, or
                    sustained by authority, exposing the weakness of the human understanding, and
                    mortifying the pride of pretended wisdom, by a collection of what appear to be
                    insoluble cases and indeterminate problems. In this work, however, it is only
                    the task of demolition which he proposes to accomplish; and it must be owned
                    that he has spread abroad the rubbish and scattered the dust of philosophical
                    systems in a somewhat appalling<pb break="no" facs="nls:193325930"

                    >Academical Questions,"</hi> says the able critic of the work in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> “is indubitably a person of great reading,
                    and much natural acuteness; but he has taken too wide a range, and indulged
                    somewhat too much in a vein of controversial declamation. He often seems to
                    think more of demolishing his antagonist than of enlightening his reader; and
                    sometimes appears to enlarge upon a topic as much for the display of his
                    eloquence as for the support of his reasoning. By frequent reference to the
                    Greek writers, and continual allusions to the usages of antiquity, he expected
                    perhaps to seduce the scholars of the South into metaphysical investigations,
                    and to engage the attention of polite readers by a certain vivacity and polish
                    in the turn of his expression. If this was his view, however, he certainly ought
                    not to have plunged at first into the great gulf of substance and entity.” <hi
                    rend="italic">ŲEdinburgh Review,</hi> vol. vii. p. 185.) To these observations,
                    however, it is proper to add, that the author avowedly reserved the full
                    exposition of his own theory for a subsequent volume, though in point of fact it
                    never appeared; and that in this preliminary publication he conceived himself to
                    be only clearing out the foundation on which it was his intention afterwards to
                    build.</p>
                <p>In the year 1810, Sir William Drummond, in conjunction with Robert Walpole, Esq.
                    published <hi rend="italic">Herculanensia,</hi> in 4to, containing
                    archaeological and philological dissertations, and a copy of a manuscript found
                    amongst the ruins of Herculaneum; and in 1811 appeared an <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essay on a Punic Inscription found in the Isle of Malta,</hi> royal 8vo; both
                    works of great merit and erudition. Sir William was also an occasional, if nota
                    frequent, contributor to the <hi rend="italic">Classical Journal</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> in which his papers on subjects of antiquity, particularly
                    the zodiac of Denderah, which occupied without exhausting his ingenuity,
                    attracted the general admiration of the learned, if not always on account of
                    their soundness, at least by reason of the acuteness and originality they
                    display, and the resources of learning which the author had always at command
                    for the illustration of his peculiar views. About this time, Sir William
                    Drummond, whose residence at Constantinople had turned his attention to oriental
                    literature, sacred as well as profane, consigned the fruits of his researches
                    and investigations into the historical books of the Old Testament, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Oedipus Jzidaicus.</hi> This singular work was never published,
                    having been printed solely for distribution amongst the author’s friends and
                    acquaintance; but as he had caused a considerable impression to be struck off,
                    copies of it soon found their way into the hands of persons connected with the
                    periodical press, and those of others; and, as might have been expected, it was
                    most fiercely attacked. The first onset was made by a churchman of the name of
                    D’Oyly, in <hi rend="italic">Letters to the Right lion. Sir William Drummond, in
                    Defence of particular Passages of the Old Testament against his late work
                    entitled</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Oedipus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Judaicus</hi> and the attack was renewed in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quarterly Review,</hi> with equal vigour and ability. Whether it was altogether
                    fair thus openly to stigmatize a book which had never been published, we shall
                    not stop to inquire; more especially as the principal cause of regret is, not
                    that it was severely criticised, but that it was ever written, far less printed.
                    In the controversy which thus arose, however, Sir William was overmatched, both
                    in science and in Hebrew, with which D’Oyly and the Reviewer evinced a most
                    intimate acquaintance; and although his reply displayed much ingenuity, no skill
                    could evade, far less destroy, the force of some of the criticisms. The truth
                    is, the allegorical theory which he undertook to establish was taken at
                    secondhand from the work of Dupuis; and although the author, notwithstanding all
                    the errors charged against him, brought great stores of learning and erudition
                    to bear upon it, yet the absurdities to which it leads are so glaring, and the
                    consequences which follow from it are so pernicious, that it is surprising Sir
                    William Drummond should not have foreseen the one, or been prudent enough not to
                    hazard the other. The preface, too, though beautifully written, contains
                    observations which nothing can excuse, and irreverences so gross as even to
                    shock persons the least scrupulous about subjects of religion. The profane joke
                    about veal cutlets is worthy only of Mr Thomas Paine, and fit to appear in no
                    work where the ordinary humanities of taste and reason are duly observed.</p>
                <p>In 1818 Sir William Drummond published, experimentally we believe, the first part
                    of a poem entitled <hi rend="italic">Odin,</hi> 4to, the object of which was to
                    embody in verse some of the more striking features of the Scandinavian
                    mythology. The poem, however, did not succeed in attracting public attention,
                    which was then almost exclusively fixed on some of the great masters of song,
                    whose deep voice of inspiration filled the land; and although it contained
                    passages of very considerable power and beauty, it fell into almost immediate
                    oblivion.</p>
                <p>But the work on which the reputation of Sir William Drummond as a scholar and
                    antiquary must chiefly rest, is his <hi rend="italic">Origines,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">or Remarks on the Origin of several Empires, States, and
                    Cities,</hi> in 3 vols. 8vo. The first volume, embracing the origin of the
                    Babylonian, the Assyrian, and the Iranian empires, appeared in 1824; the second,
                    which is wholly devoted to the subject of Egypt, including the modern
                    discoveries in hieroglyphics, came out in 1825; and the third, which treats of
                    the Phoenicians and Arabia, was published in 1826. It would be exceedingly
                    difficult, by a general statement, or by critical observations apart from
                    details, to convey an accurate idea of the real character and merits of this
                    work; which, with much that is strained, exaggerated, or defective, to say
                    nothing of errors into which the author iŝ sometimes betrayed by the excessive
                    refinements of an ever active ingenuity, is in several respects one of the most
                    remarkable productions of modern times. A principal feature of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Origines,</hi> though certainly the least obtrusive, is, that here
                    the author labours quietly to build up and fortify the authority of the
                    historical books of the Old Testament, which, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oedipus</hi><hi rend="italic">Judaicus,</hi> he had (probably without intending
                    it) contributed to impair, if not to pull down: whilst by concentrating, as it
                    were, into one focus the various scattered lights of tradition, history,
                    philosophy, science, etymology, and archaeology, he has contrived to illuminate
                    many of the darkest passages in the records of the ancient world; to dispel no
                    inconsiderable portion of the obscurity which overshadowed the origin and annals
                    of the great empires of antiquity; and, even in the merest archaeological
                    discussions, to interweave incidental illustrations, alike curious in
                    themselves, and valuable to the scholar, the theologian, and the antiquary. Upon
                    this work, therefore, as on a fixed and enduring pedestal, the fame of Drummond
                    as a scholar must in a great measure rest. Besides its other great and singular
                    merits, it has that which indeed is peculiar to almost all Drummond’s works, of
                    being written in a pure, chaste, classical style, full of vivacity and vigour,
                    and sometimes even rising into a rich and lofty strain of eloquence. The
                    dialogue between Neomathes and Philo-thoth, in the second volume, where the one
                    impugns and the other defends the astronomical and mathematical skill of the
                    ancient Egyptians, may be instanced as a specimen of the grace, elegance, and
                    force of Drummond’s style, when it flows in a continuous stream, unbroken by the
                    projecting corners and edges of a hard and rugged erudition.</p>
                <p>Sir William Drummond’s appreciation of the modern discoveries in hieroglyphics (a
                    subject to which three consecutive chapters of the second volume are devoted)

                    general, sound and discriminating; and he foresaw sooner than almost any one
                    else, that the powers of the phonetic alphabet, as an instrument of discovery,
                    would be found to have been greatly over-rated. In a letter, dated Naples, 27th
                    ∕lpril 1827, and addressed to the author of this imperfect notice, he very
                    distinctly shows how fully he had estimated the difficulty which Μ. Champollion
                    had overlooked, and which now appears to be nearly, if not altogether
                    insuperable. “That Μ. Champoilion’s system is accurate to a certain extent,”
                    says he, “I admit; and his discoveries do him great honour. Whether he be right
                    in all the details of his system is another question. He establishes the
                    existence of a very great number (I forget the precise number) of phonetic
                    hieroglyphs;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>About <hi
                    rend="italic">α hundred and forty</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> whilst, even by
                    the lowest estimate, the total number of hieroglyphs on the monuments exceeds
                    <hi rend="italic">eight hundred.</hi></p></note> and to these, he says, are to
                    be traced all the characters of the running hand, which he reads with so much
                    ease. Now I cannot help observing, that where there are so many signs to
                    represent each alphabetical letter, and where consequently there must have been
                    various contractions for each of these signs in the running hand, the task of
                    learning all these contractions without the aid of a master, and of accurately
                    referring them to their prototypes, must be immense. In Sanscrit there are
                    fifty-two letters, and yet there are above eight hundred contractions. To refer
                    these Sanscrit contractions to their original letters is not always very easy;
                    but the difficulty in Egyptian must have been much greater, in which language
                    the phonetic characters, and consequently the contractions, arc far more
                    numerous.” Here we have the germ of those principles which, developed and
                    applied by Klaproth to the values of characters as set down by M. Champollion,
                    have made terrible havoc of his discoveries, and left him at last little more
                    than what he took without acknowledgment from Dr Young.</p>
                <p>Of Sir William Drummond in his public capacity we are not prepared to speak with
                    any degree of confidence, having little knowledge of his services as a
                    diplomatist, or of his capabilities for acting in that character. The habit of
                    his mind was a cautious or rather tentative boldness, accompanied with
                    perseverance, yet tempered with a conciliating blandness of disposition, and an
                    amenity of manners, native to his character; and it is to be presumed that this
                    prevailing tendency showed itself in the conduct of affairs, as well as in
                    abstract or speculative pursuits. In 1808, we find him, whilst resident at the
                    court of Palermo, ostensibly embarked in a scheme for securing the regency of
                    Spain, which had then just risen in arms to throw off the yoke of France, to
                    Prince Leopold of Sicily. As might have been expected, the project misgave at
                    the very commencement, and Sir William Drummond has not escaped censure for the
                    part he had in it. “Sir William Drummond, the British envoy at Palermo, Mr
                    Viale, and the Duke of Orleans,” says Colonel Napier,” were the ostensible
                    contrivers of this notable scheme, by which, if it had succeeded, a small party
                    in a local junta (that of Seville) would have appointed a regency for Spain,
                    paved the way for altering the laws of succession in that country, established
                    their own sway over the other juntas, and created interminable jealousy between
                    England, Portugal, and Spain; but with whom the plan originated does not very
                    clearly appear. Sir William Drummond’s representations induced Sir Alexander
                    Ball to provide the ship of war, nominally for the conveyance of the Duke of
                    Orleans [now king of the French, who had made no secret of his intention to
                    negociate for the regency of Spain], but in reality for Prince Leopold, with
                    whose intended voyage Sir Alexander does not appear to have been made
                    acquainted. That the prince should have, desired to be regent of Spain was
                    natural; but that he should have been conveyed to Gibraltar in a British ship of
                    the line, when the English government disapproved of his pretensions, was really
                    curious. Sir William Drummond could scarcely have proceeded such lengths in an
                    affair of so great consequence, without secret instructions from some member of
                    his own government; yet Lord Castlereagh expressed unqualified approbation of
                    Sir Hew Dalrymple’s decisive conduct upon the occasion.” (Napier’s <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Peninsular War,</hi> vol. i. p. 177.) In politics
                    Sir William Drummond appears to have known his ground well, and to have given
                    entire satisfaction to the governments which employed him, at periods of no
                    ordinary difficulty, in transacting affairs of the greatest importance.</p>
                <p>Such is an imperfect outline of the literary and political character of this
                    distinguished person. In private life he was a man of modest, retiring,
                    unobtrusive manners, perfectly unconscious that he differed from or had any
                    claims to distinction superior to the most ordinary and commonplace person who
                    fell in his way. Throughout his whole life he was a close and assiduous student,
                    often preferring the company of his books to the promiscuous and frivolous
                    intercourse of company; and hence he was sometimes considered as eccentric, if
                    not cold, distant, and haughty, by those who neither knew nor could sympathise
                    with the habits which are gradually formed by a studious and contemplative life;
                    habits which continue unconsciously to grow upon men whose days and nights are
                    devoted to the pursuit of knowledge. But he was, nevertheless, one of the
                    kindest, mildest, and most generous and humane men that ever existed. To his
                    tenants and dependents he was indulgent even to the injury of his own private
                    fortune; to his friends he was most stedfastly and fervently devoted. In him
                    rising merit was always sure to find a ready and active patron; and not a few
                    individuals have owed their establishment and success in life to the
                    circumstance of having attracted his notice, or of being pointed out to him as
                    deserving of support or encouragement. Latterly, owing to the precarious state
                    of his health, which made it necessary for him to resort to a warmer climate, he
                    resided almost constantly abroad; chiefly, we believe, at Naples, where he
                    continued to indulge in those learned pursuits which formed the main solace and
                    delight of his life, <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
