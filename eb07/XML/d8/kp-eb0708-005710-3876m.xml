                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">DIVINATION</label>, the knowledge of things obscure or
                    future, which cannot be attained by any natural means.</p>
                <p>It was a received opinion amongst the heathens that the gods were wont to
                    converse familiarly with some men, whom they endotved with extraordinary powers,
                    and admitted to the knowledge of their councils and designs. Plato, Aristotle,
                    Plutarch, Cicero, and others, divide divination into two sorts or species, viz.
                    natural and artificial.</p>
                <p>The former tvas so called, because not attained by any rules or precepts of art,
                    but infused or inspired into the diviner, without his taking any further care
                    about it than to purify and prepare himself for the reception of the divine
                    afflatus. Of this kind were all those who delivered oracles, and foretold future
                    events by inspiration, without observing external signs or accidents.</p>
                <p>The second species of divination was called <hi rend="italic">artificial,</hi>
                    because it was not obtained by immediate inspiration, but proceeded upon certain
                    experiments and observations arbitrarily instituted, and mostly superstitious.
                    Of this sort there were various kinds, as by sacrifices, entrails, flame,
                    cakes,flour, wine, water, birds, lots, verses, omens,and soon.</p>
                <p>In holy Scripture we find mention made of nine different kinds of divination. The
                    first was performed by the inspection of planets, stars, and clouds. It is
                    supposed to be the practisers of this whom Moses calls ριyn, <hi rend="italic"
                    >meonen,</hi> from ρx, <hi rend="italic">anaιι,</hi> cloud (Deut. chap, xviii.
                    ver. 10). 2. Those whom the prophet calls in the same place ^∏3n, <hi
                    rend="italic">menache-seh,</hi> which the Vulgate and the generality of
                    interpreters render <hi rend="italic">augur.</hi> 3. Those who in the same place
                    are called <pb break="no" facs="nls:193323889" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3889-0058"
                    />.ntzoo, <hi rend="italic">mecascheph,</hi> which the Septuagint and Vulgate
                    translate “a man given to ill practices.” 4. Such others whom Moses in the same
                    chapter, verse 11, calls min, <hi rend="italic">hhober. 5.</hi> Those who
                    consult the spirits called <hi rend="italic">Python</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    or, as Moses expresses it in the same book, btrx □]x, “those who ask questions
                    of Python.” 6. Witches or magicians, whom Moses calls <hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> v</hi><hi rend="italic">Wr', judeoni.</hi> 7. Those who consult
                    the dead, <hi rend="italic">necromancers.</hi> 8. The prophet Hosea (chap. iv.
                    ver. 12), mentions such as consult staves, 'bpn b<hi rend="italic">m</hi>; which
                    kind of divination may be called <hi rend="italic">rhabdomancy.</hi> 9. The last
                    kind of divination mentioned in Scripture is <hi rend="italic">hepatascopy,</hi>
                    or the consideration of the liver.</p>
                <p>Divination of all kinds was necessarily made an occult science, which naturally
                    remained in the hands of the priests and priestesses, the magi, the soothsayers,
                    the augurs, the visionaries, the priests of the oracles, the false prophets, and
                    other like professors, till the time of the coming of Jesus Christ. The light of
                    the gospel, it is true, has dissipated much of this darkness; but it is more
                    difficult than is commonly conceived to eradicate from the human mind a
                    deep-rooted superstition, even though the truth be set in the strongest light,
                    especially when the error has been believed almost from the origin of the world;
                    so that we still find existing among us the remains of this Pagan superstition
                    in the chimeras which enthusiastic and designing men have formed into arts and
                    sciences, though it must be owned, to the honour of the nineteenth century, that
                    the pure doctrines of Christianity, and the spirit of philosophy, which become
                    every day more diffused, equally concur in banishing these visionary opinions.
                    The vogue for these pretended sciences and arts, moreover, is past, and they can
                    no longer be named without exciting ridicule in all sensible people. By relating
                    them here, therefore, and drawing them from their natural obscurity, we only
                    mean to show their futility, and to mark those rocks against which the human
                    mind, without the assistance of a pilot, might easily split.</p>
                <p>For the attaining these supernatural qualifications, there are still existing in
                    the world the remains of</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Astrology</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a conjectural
                    science, which teaches to judge of the effects and influences of the stars, and
                    to predict future events by the situation of the planets and their different
                    aspects. It is divided into <hi rend="italic">natural astrology,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">meteorology</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> which is confined to the
                    foretelling of natural effects, as the winds, rain, hail, and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">s∩oλv,</hi> frosts and tempests. In this consists one branch of
                    the art of almanack-makers; and by merely confronting these predictions in the
                    calendar with the weather which each day produces, every man of sense will see
                    what regard is to be paid to this part of astrology. The other part, which is
                    called <hi rend="italic">judicial astrology,</hi> is still more illusive and
                    absurd than the former; and having been at first the wonderful art of
                    visionaries, it afterwards became that of impostors; a very common fate with all
                    those chimerical sciences of which we are here treating. This art pretends to
                    teach the method of predicting all sorts of events which shall happen upon the
                    earth, as well such as relate to the public as those which concern private
                    persons; and this by the same inspection of the stars and planets, and their
                    different constellations. The <hi rend="italic">cabbala</hi> signifies, in like
                    manner, the knowledge of things which are above the moon, as the celestial
                    bodies and their influences; and in this sense it is the same with judicial
                    astrology, or forms part of it.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Horoscopy,</hi> which may also be considered as a part of
                    astrology, is the art of drawing a figure, or celestial scheme, containing the
                    twelve houses, in which are marked the disposition of the heavens at a certain
                    moment; for example, that at which a man is born, in order to foretel his
                    fortune, or the incidents of his future life. In a word, it is the disposition
                    of the stars and planets at the moment of any person’s birth. But as there
                    cannot be any probable or possible relation between the constellations and the
                    human race, all the principles they lay down, and the prophecies they draw from
                    them, are chimerical, false, absurd, and a criminal imposition on mankind.</p>
                <p>3. The art of <hi rend="italic">augury</hi> consisted, amongst the ancient
                    Romans, in observing the flight, the singing, and eating of birds, especially
                    such as were held sacred. See Au-GURY.</p>
                <p>4. The equally deceitful art of <hi rend="italic">haruspicy</hi> consisted, on
                    the contrary, in the inspection of the entrails of animals, but principally of
                    victims, and from these predicting grand incidents relative to the republic, and
                    the good or bad events of its enterprises.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Aeromancy</hi> was the art of divining by the air. This vain
                    science has also come to us from the Pagans; but it is rejected by reason as
                    well as Christianity, as false and absurd.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Pyromancy</hi> is a divination made by the inspection of a
                    flame, either by observing to which side it turns, or by throwing into it some
                    combustible matter, or a bladder filled with wine, or any thing else from which
                    it was imagined that predictions might be drawn.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">IIydromancy</hi> is the supposed art of divining by water.
                    The Persians, according to Varro, invented this art. Pythagoras and Numa
                    Pompilius both made use of it.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Geomancy</hi> was a divination made by observing cracks or
                    clefts in the earth. It was also performed by points made on paper, or any other
                    substance, at a venture; and future events were judged of from the figures which
                    thence resulted. This was certainly very ridiculous; but it is nothing less so
                    to pretend to predict future events by the inspection of the grounds of a dish
                    of tea or coffee, or by cards, and many other like matters. Thus have designing
                    men made use of the four elements to deceive their credulous brethren.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Chiromancy</hi> is the art which teaches to know, by
                    inspecting the hand, not only the inclinations of a man, but his future destiny
                    also. The fools or impostors who practise this art pretend that the different
                    parts or the lines of the hand have a relation to the internal parts of the
                    body, as some to the heart, others to the liver, spleen, &amp;c. On this false
                    supposition, and on many others equally extravagant, the principles of
                    chiromancy are founded; and on which, however, several authors, as Robert Flud
                    an Englishman, Artemidorus, Μ. de la Chambre, John of In-dagina, and many
                    others, have written treatises.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Physiognomy,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >pliysiognomancy,</hi> is a science that pretends to teach the nature, the
                    temperament, the understanding, and the inclinations of men, by the inspection
                    of their countenances, and is therefore very little less frivolous than
                    chiromancy; though Aristotle, and a number of learned men after him, have
                    written express treatises concerning it.</p>
