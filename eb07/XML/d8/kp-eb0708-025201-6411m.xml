                <p><label type="entry">DUEL</label>, a combat between two persons. To distinguish it
                    from the unpremeditated combat or rencontre, it must take place at a time and
                    place appointed in consequence of a cartel or challenge, and generally in
                    presence of two or more witnesses or umpires.</p>
                <p>The word is derived from <hi rend="italic">duellum,</hi> used by the barbarous
                    Latin writers <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi><hi rend="italic">duorum
                    bellum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, as a judicial trial, it has been
                    defined “singularis pugnus inter duos ad probandum litem, et qui viciţ probâsse
                    intelligitur.” <hi rend="italic">(Fleta.')</hi></p>
                <p>The origin of duelling may be traced to that barbarous state of society in which
                    personal courage was followed as the ruling principle, and esteemed as the
                    noblest ornament, of life. Under the influence of such principles, the
                    considerations of justice and humanity were little regarded; and patience under
                    injuries being branded as infamous and cowardly, men were naturally impelled,
                    not only to avenge their own wrongs, but to gratify their private resentments,
                    at the point of the sword.</p>
                <p>Before the dawn of Christianity had thrown its light upon the interesting
                    doctrine of a providence superintending the affairs of men, the belief of an
                    adequate distribution of rewards and punishments in the present life seems to
                    have been generally received. The rich, the prosperous, and the happy, were apt
                    to be considered as the peculiar favourites of Heaven; whilst disease,
                    misfortune, and sudden or violent death, were regarded as the inflictions of
                    divine vengeance on the crimes of the sufferers. Hence, in a superstitious age,
                    arose the practice of making a direct appeal to the deity in the single combat,
                    under the persuasion that the justice of Heaven would infallibly declare for the
                    innocent, and visit the perjured and the guilty with dishonour and death.</p>
                <p>The duel, as a judicial trial, prevailed at an early period amongst the Germans,
                    Danes, and Franks; and by a law instituted in 501, by Gondeband, king of
                    Burgundy, it was allowed in legal proceedings in lieu of swearing.,</p>
                <p>Louis le Débonnaire was the first French monarch who permitted to litigants the
                    trial by arms; and the same mode of trial was introduced into England, with
                    other Norman customs, by William the Conqueror. It was only used, however, in
                    three cases; in the court martial or court of chivalry, in appeals of felony,
                    and in civil cases upon issue joined in a writ of right; in which last it was
                    the only decision, until Henry IL, with consent of parliament, introduced the
                    grand assize. None were exempt from the trial by battle but females, the sick
                    and the maimed, and persons under fifteen or above sixty years of age;
                    ecclesiastics, priests, and monks, being allowed to produce champions in their
                    stead.</p>
                <p>The trial by battle, however, soon degenerated into a convenient pretext for
                    gratifying private revenge under sanction of the law, or on pretence of
                    discovering truth and punishing perjury. Under the feudal system it was of
                    course warmly patronized, being but too congenial with the feelings and habits
                    of the fierce and haughty barons, who, uncontrolled by any principles of law or
                    religion, disdained to submit their differences to any arbitration, or to seek
                    any reparation for an injury but by the sword. Arms were the sport, plunder and
                    revenge the business, of their lives. And to such a height did the evils arising
                    from their private quarrels and petty warfare increase, that it became necessary
                    to adopt some means for controlling and directing the torrent of military
                    violence, which threatened to sweep away every feeling of justice and humanity,
                    and subject the peace and comfort of the community to the unrestrained passions
                    of a fierce and lawless aristocracy. Martial societies were accordingly
                    instituted, whose duty it was to protect the weak and defenceless, to relieve
                    the oppressed, to correct abuses, and to promote the public good.</p>
                <p>Hence arose chivalry and knight-errantry, which, although they modified in some
                    degree the evil of duelling, by imposing a minute and punctilious system of
                    observances, had yet a tendency to perpetuate the practice, by instituting those
                    false and fantastic principles of honour, the evils of which are still felt in
                    the modern duel. With the code of punctilious regulations, the grounds and
                    motives of the duel were changed and extended. Malice and revenge gave place to
                    the gratification of personal vanity, and the desire of that renown for deeds of
                    arms which was considered as the glory of the age. Tilts and tournaments were
                    the pastime of the nobles, and were not only countenanced by the presence of the
                    prince, who not unfrequently shared the dangers of the field, but graced by the
                    attendance of female beauty and distinction, from whose hands the successful
                    champion received the prize of his achievements, and at whose feet he longed to
                    lay the trophies of his victory. jSee <hi rend="smallcaps">Chivalry.</hi></p>
                <p>The tournament continued in high estimation, notwithstanding the many valuable
                    lives sacrificed on the most frivolous occasions, until the middle of the
                    sixteenth century, when the death of Henry II. of France, in a tournament given
                    in honour of his sister’s marriage, gave a check to these sanguinary amusements.
                    At this entertainment Henry sent his lance to Count Montgomerie, the captain of
                    his guards, who at first declined the challenge; but on the king repeating his
                    commands, he was compelled to obey. At the encounter, Montgomerie purposely
                    broke his lance against the king’s breastplate; but unhappily for the monarch he
                    wore his helmet open, and a splinter of the lance flying up into his eye,
                    pierced his brain. He survived for about a month in great agony, and died on the
                    10th July 1559. (Cockburn <hi rend="italic">on Duels.)</hi></p>
                <p>In no country has the duel on private and personal quarrels prevailed to so great
                    an extent as in France. Francis I. encouraged the practice by his well-known
                    determination “that the lie was never to be borne without satisfaction but by a
                    base-born fellow.” By his challenge to the Emperor Charles V. he set an example
                    which his high-minded nobles were but too eager to follow; and under the
                    countenance of their monarch their native propensity to the single combat was
                    indulged to an extent which all the power of his successors was scarcely able to
                    control.</p>
                <p>The power of the church was frequently exerted to restrain these bloody
                    proceedings, especially by a council at Valentia in 855, and lastly by the
                    council of Trent, session XXV. chap. 19, which excommunicated not only the
                    combatants, but their associates, and even the spectators of the battle;
                    declaring the custom to be detestable, introduced by Satan for the destruction
                    both of body and soul. It adds, that “all advisers, supporters, witnesses,
                    orthose in any way concerned, are likewise excommunicated. Princes also who
                    connive at duels are to be deprived of all temporal power, jurisdiction, and
                    dominion over the places where they have permitted duels to be fought.”</p>
                <p>Philip the Fair, at the close of the thirteenth century, forbade all gages or
                    pledges of battle; but this prohibition was afterwards relaxed in several
                    instances, and in 1306 a royal ordonnance was published, prescribing rules,
                    conditions, and ceremonies for the combat.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Henry II. a noted duel was fought in the king’s presence between
                    Guy Chabot de Jarnac and Francis de la Chastaignerie, in which the latter was
                    slain; and on this occasion Henry is said to have taken an oath never to allow
                    another during his reign. An edict was published accordingly; but this, which
                    appears to have been the first royal prohibition of the duel, was productive<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193326424" xml:id="kp-eb0708-6424-0253"/> of no good
                    effects. The prohibition indeed arose rather from the king’s grief for the loss
                    of his friend Chastaignerie than from any desire on public grounds to abolish
                    the custom; and it appears rather to have aggravated the evil, by increasing the
                    number of private duels: for the same punctilious notions of honour from which
                    the duel generally originated, and the same dread of the imputation of cowardice
                    which kept it alive, were still entertained; and as the royal permission,
                    without which the duel had formerly been high treason, could not now be
                    obtained, each man became the judge in his own cause; and in those delicate
                    cases, of which the law could take no cognizance, the point of honour was more
                    likely to be stretched than curtailed.</p>
                <p>The parliament of Paris in 1599 declared all persons who had assisted or been
                    present at the prosecution of these unlawful quarrels to be rebels to the king,
                    transgressors of the laws, and disturbers of the public peace.</p>
                <p>Henry IV., during the first eighteen years of whose reign no less than four
                    thousand gentlemen are said to have perished by the duel, alludes in his edict
                    at Blois, 1602, to the disorders arising from this barbarous custom; and in 1609
                    he added to the penalties already imposed, punishment by death, confiseation of
                    goods, fines, imprisonment, and degradation from honour, on all who were in any
                    way concerned in these combats, not only principals and seconds, or bearers of
                    challenges, but spectators, and even those who, being accidentally present, did
                    not interfere to prevent bloodshed. The severity of these edicts might have
                    contributed greatly to diminish the evil; but unfortunately they arose rather
                    from the complaints of the people, and the persuasions of the Duke of Sully,
                    than from any desire on the part of Henry himself to abolish a custom for which
                    he privately entertained a great partiality, as was evident from the readiness
                    with which he granted pardons to offenders, and even privately encouraged
                    particular duels. He readily gave permission to Crequi to fight Don Philip of
                    Savoy, and even added this encouraging compliment, “If I were not a king I would
                    gladly offer myself to be your second.”</p>
                <p>It was not be expected that laws, however severe, the open violation of which was
                    thus countenanced by the monarch himself, could be productive of any beneficial
                    effects; and we find the passion for the single combat continuing unabated
                    during the reign of the succeeding monarch Louis XIII. To such extent indeed did
                    it prevail, that the common inquiry when acquaintances met was not, “what is the
                    news to-day,” but “who fought yesterday;” and Lord Herbert, who was ambassador
                    at the court of Louis, says, that “there is scarce a Frenchman worth looking on
                    who has not killed his man in a duel.”</p>
                <p>Two noblemen, however, Montmorellei count de Boutte-ville, the most renowned
                    duellist of the day, and the Marquis de Beuoron, persisting to fight in defiance
                    of the royal interdict, were tried according to law, and both beheaded. This
                    execution caused for a time a cessation of the sanguinary custom; but it was
                    reserved for Louis XIV. to give the first effectual check to the continuance of
                    the practice.</p>
                <p>During the minority of this prince a very desperate battle was fought between the
                    Dukes de Beaufort and de Nemours, each attended by four friends. The seconds of
                    the Duke de Nemours were the Marquis de Villars, the Chevalier de la Chaise,
                    D’Uzerches, and Compan; and the Duke de Beaufort was attended by D’Henricort, De
                    Ris, Buri, and Brillet. They fought five against five, with swords arid pistols.
                    Nemours was shot by Beaufort, the Marquis de Villars killed D’Henricort, and
                    D’Uzerches slew De Ris: the rest were only slightly wounded.</p>
                <p>This, with another desperate encounter fought in 1663, four against four,
                    determined the king on taking some decided step to prevent the recurrence of
                    such disgraceful and bloody quarrels. The famous edict published in 1679, with
                    the solemn agreement entered into by the principal nobility, “that they would
                    never fight a duel on any pretence whatever,” and the firmness of Louis in
                    refusing pardon to all offenders, contributed more to restrain this unhappy
                    propensity than all the efforts of his predecessors.</p>
                <p>The practice of duelling in England, although it never prevailed to such an
                    extent as in France, may be traced to the same causes which gave rise to it on
                    the Continent. The duel, as we have already mentioned, was early in use amongst
                    the Franks and Normans, and was probably by them introduced into England.</p>
                <p>One of the latest instances of the trial by battle occurred in the reign of
                    Elizabeth in the year 1571, of which Sir Henry Spelman, who was eye-witness,
                    gives an account of the whole proceedings, which were conducted, he says, “non
                    sine magna jurisconsultorum perturbatione.” A proceeding having been instituted
                    in the Court of Common Pleas, for recovery of some manorial rights in the Isle
                    of Hartic, Kent, the defendant offered to maintain his right to possession by
                    the duel. The petitioners accepted the challenge, and as the court does not
                    appear to have had the power of refusal, champions were appointed, and all the
                    requisite forms adjusted. The queen, to prevent bloodshed, had commanded the
                    parties to compromise; but, anxious at once to save the credit of the defendant,
                    who demanded the combat, and to support the authority of the law, which enjoined
                    its being fulfilled, the ceremony of the duel was allowed to proceed. On the
                    appointed day the justices of the common pleas and the counsellors appeared at
                    Tothil Fields as umpires of the combat; but as the petitioners did not appear to
                    acknowledge their champion, they were nonsuited, and victory declared for the
                    defendant. Thus ended the last judicial combat we read of in a civil case.
                    Another, however, occurred in the court of chivalry in 1631, and in the county
                    palatine of Durham in 1638; and the trial by battle was claimed so late as 1818,
                    in the ease of Thornton v. Ashford, in an appeal of murder.</p>
                <p>But although the duel was disused in judicial proceedings, the tantastie notions
                    of honour to which it gave rise still prevailed; and as the law could take∙no
                    cognizance of points of honour and personal affronts, private duelling rather
                    increased in the reigns of Elizabeth and James 1.</p>
                <p>During the civil wars the minds of men were too much occupied with the agitating
                    events of the time to pay much attention to the settlement of points of
                    etiquette; and as the contest was between the commonalty and all that was royal
                    and noble in the land, private feuds were forgotten, and those who would have
                    turned their swords against each other in private quarrel, disdained to employ
                    them in such a cause against men of mean birth and ignoble sentiment.</p>
                <p>The custom, however, again gained ground after the restoration of Charles II.;
                    and although he did issue a proclamation to put the existing laws in force, this
                    object was defeated by his great laxity in pardoning offenders.</p>
                <p>In consequence of a duel between the Duke of Hamilton and Lord Mohura in 1712,
                    which was fought with the greatest ferocity and apparent determination of
                    murder, and in which both parties were killed, the subject again came under the
                    consideration of government. At the meeting of parliament in the following year,
                    the queen’s speech alluded to the subject in this sentence: “thepra-tice of
                    duelling requires some speedy and effectual remedy.” No preeise notice was taken
                    of this part of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193326437"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-6437-0254"/>speech in the address from the House of Commons;
                    and a bill which was brought in for the more effectual restraint of the duel was
                    thrown out on a second reading.</p>
                <p>Since the fashion of wearing the sword has been abandoned, private duels have
                    become less frequent in this country, and we have not now to deplore the
                    numerous and often fatal rencontres which, during the last century, were so
                    frequently begun and concluded in the moment and heat of passion, and not seldom
                    on the most frivolous occasions. Such was the duel between Lord Byron and Mr
                    Chaworth in 1765, which originated in a dispute during dinner about the quantity
                    of game on their respective manors. The parties retired to an adjoining room,
                    where they fought by the uncertain light of one small tallow candle, and Mr
                    Chaworth, although the more expert swordsman, was mortally wounded.</p>
                <p>By the laws of this country all the parties concerned in a duel which terminates
                    fatally are guilty of murder, however fairly the combat may have been conducted,
                    and however great the provocation.</p>
                <p>The suddenness of the provocation, and the agitation of excited feelings, which
                    in other cases may be pled in extenuation of the crime, cannot be urged in
                    favour of those who, after ample time for deliberation, meet for the avowed
                    purpose of murder. It is seldom indeed that the extreme penalty is inflicted,
                    except in cases where unfair advantage has been taken, or which are otherwise
                    attended with peculiar aggravation.</p>
                <p>The duel between Major Campbell and Captain Boyd, for which the former was
                    executed in 1808, is well known, and was considered as little better than
                    deliberate assassination. But in the case of Lieutenant Blundell, who was killed
                    in a duel at Carisbrooke Castle, in the Isle of Wight, in 1813, every thing
                    appears to have been conducted with perfect fairness; yet the surviving
                    principal, the seconds, and two others who were considered accessary, were
                    convicted of murder at the Hampshire assizes, and sentenced to death; and
                    although the royal pardon was obtained, they were all dismissed from his
                    majesty’s service.</p>
                <p>Foster expresses the following opinion: “Deliberate duelling, if death ensueth,
                    is in the eye of the law murder. For duels are generally founded on deep
                    revenge. And though a person should be drawn into a duel, not upon a motive so
                    criminal, but merely upon a punctilio of what swordsmen falsely call honour,
                    that will not excuse. For he that deliberately sheddeth the blood of another,
                    upon a private quarrel, acteth in defiance of all laws, human and divine,
                    whatever his motive may be.” And Judge Blackstone: “When both parties meet
                    avowedly with an intent to murder, thinking it their duty as gentlemen, and
                    claiming it as their right, to wanton with their own lives, and those of their
                    fellow-creatures, without any warrant or authority from any power either divine
                    or human, but in direct contradiction to the laws both of God and man, the law
                    has justly fixed the crime and punishment of murder on them, and on their
                    seconds also."</p>
                <p>In a moral point of view the practice admits of no defence, for the very
                    principle on which the duellist proceeds is one which, if universally adopted,
                    would be subversive of all good order, namely, that an individual may be the
                    judge of his own cause, and the avenger of his own wrongs. The legislature has
                    provided a reparation for all those injuries which the wisdom of legislators has
                    thought it reasonable to redress; and for an individual, or body of individuals,
                    to adopt a law for the regulation of their own conduct, differing in spirit and
                    opposed in principle to the laws of the country, is alike inconsistent with
                    sound moral and political philosophy. Such is the law of honour, as it is
                    called, a law by which no wise or sober-minded man would desire to regulate his
                    life: it prescribes none,of those duties which we owe to God as his creatures,
                    it admits or connives at many direct violations of his laws, and it imposes no
                    restraint on that indulgence of the sensual <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    passions, which is degrading to human nature, injurious to society, and opposed
                    to all that is really good and honourable in the character of man. But
                    unfortunately “the law of honour having annexed the imputation of cowardice to
                    patience under an affront, challenges are given and accepted with no other
                    design than to prevent or wipe off this suspicion, and without any other concern
                    than to preserve the duellist’s own reputation and reception in the world.”</p>
                <p>Every man of experience in the world must be convinced of the truth of this
                    remark. And it is not one of the least evils of this system, that the word <hi
                    rend="italic">honour·,</hi> which, rightly understood, denotes all that is truly
                    noble and virtuous, should be prostituted as a pretext for gratifying the most
                    malignant of human passions, or as a cover for that moral cowardice, the fear of
                    being thought afraid.</p>
                <p>“Duels,” says Sir George Mackenzie, “are but illustrious murders. It is an
                    imperious crime, which triumphs both over public revenge and private virtue, and
                    tramples boldly upon the laws of the nation and the life of our enemy. Courage
                    thinks law here to be but pedantry, and honour persuades men that obedience here
                    is cowardice.” It has been the aim of every moral writer to expose the folly,
                    and of every wise legislature to check the prevalence, of this pernicious
                    practice; yet so powerful is the domineering influence of fashion, that a custom
                    originating in barbarism, and cherished only by pride and selfishness, has for
                    ages stood its ground against all the arguments of reason and religion. Its
                    prevalence is indeed abated in our country, and it is to be hoped there are not
                    many men in the present day who fight for the mere gratification of revenge; but
                    it is to be feared that there are not a few who, condemning the custom in their
                    hearts, are yet compelled to “go as an ox to the slaughter,” and to “die as a
                    fool dieth,” under the dread of an imputation of cowardice, which they would not
                    otherwise deserve. Nor is it likely that the duel will ever be entirely
                    abolished by the law as at present administered. Death, which the law of honour
                    views as but an adequate reparation for an offensive word, is thought too severe
                    a punishment for what the laws of God and man both declare to be murder. The
                    penalty, therefore, is seldom inflicted; and where many are acquitted, all will
                    hope to escape.</p>
                <p>“Death,” says Mr Addison, “is not sufficient to deter men who make it their glory
                    to despise it; but if every one who fought a duel were to stand in the pillory,
                    it would quickly diminish the number of these imaginary men of honour, and put
                    an end to so absurd a practice.”</p>
