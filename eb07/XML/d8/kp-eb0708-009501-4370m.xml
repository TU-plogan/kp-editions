                    mineralogist and geologist, son of Francis de Gratet de Dolomieu, and Frances de
                    Berenger, was born on the 24th of June 1750, in the province of Dauphine.</p>
                <p>He was admitted a member of the order of Malta during his earliest infancy, as if
                    he had been devoted from his cradle to glory and to misfortune. At eighteen he
                    embarked in one of the galleys belonging to the order, and soon afterwards
                    unhappily found himself under the necessity of fighting a duel, in which his
                    adversary fell. The laws condemned him to die, but he received a pardon from the
                    grand master; it was, however, necessary that it should be approved by the pope,
                    who for a long time refused to confirm it, notwithstanding the solicitations of
                    several European powers in behalf of the offender, until his consent was at last
                    obtained by the Cardinal Torre-giani. Dolomieu, in the mean time, was closely
                    imprisoned in the island for nine months, and this period of solitude seems to
                    have contributed materially to increase the seriousness <hi rend="subscript">
                    χ</hi> of his character, and to confirm him in a contemplative turn of mind.</p>
                <p>At the age of twenty-two he went to Metz as an officer in the regiment of
                    carabineers, in which he had held a commission for seven years; and he displayed
                    great courage and personal activity on occasion of an accidental conflagration
                    which occurred soon afterwards. His leisure hours were employed in the study of
                    chemistry and natural history, with the assistance of Mr Thirion, an apothecary
                    residing in this city. About the same time he also <pb break="no"

                    Rochefoucault, with whom he maintained an unshaken friendship ever after.</p>
                <p>1. He commenced his literary career with an <hi rend="italic">Italian translation
                    of Bergmans Work on Volcanic Substances,</hi> to which he added some <hi
                    rend="italic">Notes,</hi> and some observations on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >classification</hi> of those substances.</p>
                <p>2. He also furnished some <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi> to a translation of
                    Cron-stedt’s Mineralogy.</p>
                <p>3. In 1775 he published <hi rend="italic">Researches on the Weight of Bodies at
                    different distances from the Earth</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s Centre</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and upon the recommendation of La Rochefoucault, was made a
                    correspondent of the Academy of Sciences at Paris. This compliment seems to have
                    contributed to his determination to relinquish his prospects of success in the
                    army, and to devote himself exclusively to science. Having resigned his
                    commission, he commenced his geological labours with a tour in Sicily, Italy,
                    and Switzerland.</p>
                <p>4. This expedition afforded him the materials for his <hi rend="italic">Voyage
                    aux Iles de Lipari,</hi><hi rend="italic">fait en</hi> 1781, which he published
                    in 1783, with some other tracts. He describes a singular kind of volcano at
                    Macaluba, in Sicily, formed by air bubbling up from the crater, and causing its
                    contents to overflow. The <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Climate of Malta</hi>
                    is rendered inconclusive by the imperfection of the eudiometrical apparatus that
                    was then commonly employed.</p>
                <p>5. He spent a part of the same year in examining the effects of the earthquake in
                    Calabria, which are described in his <hi rend="italic">Mémoire sur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">les tremblemens de Terre</hi><hi rend="italic">de la
                    Calabric,</hi> 8vo, Rome, 1784. Among other observations, he notices the
                    singular fact, that all those parts of Calabria to which the earthquake extended
                    arc of a calcareous nature, without any traces of volcanic substances.</p>
                <p>6. He published, in the <hi rend="italic">Journal de Physique,</hi> vol. xxv. p.
                    191, a paper <hi rend="italic">on the extinct volcanoes</hi> of the Vai di Noto
                    in Sicily.</p>
                <p>7. His <hi rend="italic">Mémoire sur</hi><hi rend="italic">les Iles Ponces,</hi>
                    1788, contains also a catalogue of the productions of Mount Etna, and an account
                    of the eruption of 1787.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of the revolution Dolomieu embarked, together with his friend La
                    Rochefoucault, in that which appeared to be the cause of liberty. He was in
                    Paris on the 14th of July, but he did not accept of any office under the
                    newly-modified government. La Rochefoucault soon fell a victim to the horrors of
                    the times. Dolomieu was present in his last moments, and received the
                    affectionate messages which he sent to his mother and his wife, who were more
                    distant witnesses of the dreadful scene.</p>
                <p>8. No longer hoping for any benefit to his country from the political events of
                    the day, he appears to have resumed his geological studies in other parts of
                    Europe. In a <hi rend="italic">Letter on the Origin of Basalt,</hi> dated Rome,
                    1790, <hi rend="italic">Journ. Phys.</hi> vol. xxxvii. p. 193, he considers some
                    stones of this description, for instance, the black trapps of Saxony, as the
                    productions of water; and others, particularly the varieties found in the south
                    of Europe, as of volcanic origin.</p>
                <p>9. He writes, in 1791, a <hi rend="italic">Letter from Malta,</hi> describing a
                    species of limestone found in the Tyrol, hard enough to become phosphorescent
                    upon collision, and not effervescing with acids until powdered. It was
                    afterwards called the Dolomite. <hi rend="italic">Jowm. Phys.</hi> vol. xxxix.
                    p. 3.</p>
                <p>10. In a paper of <hi rend="italic">Directions for Naturalists,</hi> he gives
                    some useful advice to the circumnavigators about to sail to the South Seas. <hi
                    rend="italic">Jourm Phys.</hi> vol. xxxix. p. 310.</p>
                <p>11. A series of his essays <hi rend="italic">On Compound Stones and Rocks</hi>
                    appeared from time to time in the <hi rend="italic">Journal de Physique,</hi>
                    vol. xxxix. p. 374; vol. xl. p. 41, 203, 372. In these he insists on the
                    necessity of supposing that the ocean must have acted with great violence in
                    reducing the continents into their present state; neither the slow subsidence of
                    a general deluge, nor the continued action of ordinary rivers, being sufficient
                    to explain the phenomena; and he remarks, that a violent agitation, such as must
                    necessarily be supposed to have taken place, would naturally cause several
                    alternations in the state of the waters, like immense waves or tides, which must
                    have contributed to the modifications impressed on the earth’s form. Indeed, the
                    facts which support this opinion appear to be so obvious and so numerous, that
                    it is difficult to understand how the opposite hypothesis should ever have
                    become popular.</p>
                <p>12. In the same volume there is a short paper <hi rend="italic">On Petroleum
                    found in Rock Crystal,</hi> and on some elastic fluids obtained from it, p.
                    318.</p>
                <p>13. The progress of his memoirs was now interrupted by the proscription, in which
                    many of the best and wisest of his countrymen were indiscriminately involved.
                    “His duty and his inclination,” he says, in a <hi rend="italic">Note</hi>
                    without a date, “required the devotion of his time and his arm to the defence of
                    his king ;” and he was obliged to submit to a temporary dereliction of his
                    pursuits of science. P. 481.</p>
                <p>14. But the cause was hopeless, and it was impossible for him to render it any
                    essential service. He soon resumed his pen, and took occasion to express, with
                    great spirit and energy, his political feelings, in his <hi rend="italic">Memoir
                    on the Physical Constitution of Egypt. Journ. Phys.</hi> vol. xlii. p. 41, 108,
                    194. In Egypt, he observes, there are many calcareous rocks and sands, which
                    cannot have been brought down by the Nile; but there is also much of the soil
                    which has the appearance of having been derived from the mud, with an admixture
                    of sand only. The same cause, he thinks, may possibly have raised the bed of the
                    river, so that the relative height of the inundations may have been little
                    altered. He conceives that the Delta has increased even in modern times, though
                    far less rapidly than it appears to have done formerly; for he is disposed to
                    admit the credibility of the Homeric account of the distance of the Pharos from
                    the continent, although he attempts to explain a part of the supposed change by
                    the filling up of the lake Mareotis only; and, on the whole, he imagines that
                    about a thousand square leagues of the surface of Egypt have been gained from
                    the sea. He has not, however, thought it necessary to discuss the arguments
                    which Bruce and others have brought against the established opinion, and against
                    the facts asserted by Herodotus in its support; although some of the best
                    informed of modern travellers have allowed the accuracy of Bruce’s statements
                    relating to this subject.</p>
                <p>15. In a short paper <hi rend="italic">On the Figured Stones of Florence,</hi> Mr
                    Dolomieu attributes the appearance of the arborescent and architectural figures
                    which characterize them, to the process of slow decomposition and oxidation,
                    gradually producing the stains in the extremely minute fissures, which favour
                    these changes. <hi rend="italic">Journ. Phys.</hi> vol. xliii. p. 285.</p>
                <p>16. Upon the establishment of the school of Mines, in 1795, he accepted the
                    situations of professor of geology and inspector of mines. He was also made one
                    of the original members of the National Institute of Sciences and Arts, then
                    organized by a law of the existing government. From this time he appears to have
                    redoubled the energy with which he had before laboured in the pursuit of natural
                    knowledge, and he published a great number of memoirs in the course of a very
                    few years. One of the first of these consisted of <hi rend="italic">Observations
                    on a pretended Coal Mine, called the Desiree. Journal des Mines,</hi> year iii.
                    N. ix. p. 45.</p>
                <p>17. His <hi rend="italic">Methodical Distribution of Volcanic</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Substances</hi> appeared in the new <hi rend="italic">Journal de
                    Physique,</hi> vol. (i.) xliii. p. 102, 175, 241, 406; vol. (ii.) xliv. p. 81.
                    Of the five classes which he had before proposed in his notes on Bergman, the
                    first comprehends substances actually pro-duced<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193324396" xml:id="kp-eb0708-4396-0097"/> by volcanoes; the second,
                    substances thrown out by them unaltered; the third, bodies altered by the
                    volcanic vapours; the fourth, bodies altered in the moist way; and the last,
                    substances illustrative of the history of volcanoes only. The subsequent papers
                    are partly continuations of the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs on Compound
                    Pocks</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and they also relate particularly to the
                    nature of lavas, some of which are shown to be formed from
                    argillaceo-ferruginous stones. The heat of lavas has been pretty accurately
                    entertained, in some cases, by the fusion of silver coins exposed to it, whilst
                    those of copper remained entire; there is, however, an account of a stream of
                    lava over which some nuns are stated to have walked while it was yet fluid; and
                    this circumstance Mr Dolomieu attributes to a mixture of sulphur, which remained
                    melted at a temperature comparatively low. Some objections to this opinion have,
                    however, been advanced by Mr Sage. <hi rend="italic">Journ. Phys.</hi> vol. xlv.

                    Mines,</hi> year vi. p. 385. He visited the south of France, the Alps, and the
                    neighbouring lakes and mountains, almost always on foot, and with his hammer in
                    his hand, accompanied by Brochart, Cordier, Bonniers, and his brother-in-law the
                    Marquis de Drée. From his observations in Auvergne, in particular, he concludes
                    that the foundation or origin of the volcanoes there is certainly below the
                    granite rocks, which therefore cannot, properly speaking, be called primitive;
                    and he proceeds to a much bolder and less admissible conjecture, that the
                    central parts of the globe are at present in a state approaching to fluidity,
                    which he attempts to support by the ready transmission of the shocks of
                    earthquakes to distant places; and he even quotes the authority of Lagrange as
                    having been disposed to encourage the opinion. Volcanoes, in general, he divides
                    into ancient and modern, as separated by the intervention of the changes which
                    have reduced the continents to their present form. With respect to the heat of
                    the lava, he observes, that it has not been sufficient to expel the carbonic
                    acid from the limestone which has been exposed to it. He also remarks, that,
                    where basalt in fusion has been suddenly cooled by water, the contraction has
                    caused it to divide into columns, which are not crystalline, because their
                    angles are irregular, and which are smaller and more uniform in proportion as
                    the water is deeper. He contrasts the horizontal strata of France with the
                    vertical tables of the Alps, and particularly describes the accretion of a
                    mantle of calcareous substances, two miles in height, which has attached itself
                    to the north-east faces of the Alps, subsequently to their first formation as
                    mountains. From this expedition he brought home an immense collection of rocks
                    and stones, principally valuable for their arrangement with a view to the
                    illustration of his particular doctrines in geology, which, with the rest of his
                    cabinet, have since formed a part of the superb museum of Μ. de Drée.</p>
                <p>32. He published, about the same time, a paper <hi rend="italic">On the Mountains

                <p>34. The only communication of Mr Dolomieu printed in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoirs of the Institute,</hi> is rather on a mechanical than a mineralogical
                    subject, containing an <hi rend="italic">Account of the Art of Making

                <p>He was engaged, after his return from Switzerland, in some mineralogical
                    contributions to the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie Méthodique,</hi> when he was
                    invited to take a part in the scientific arrangements of the expedition to
                    Egypt. He did not, however, strictly confine himself to this department, but was
                    successfully employed as a negociator for the surrender of Malta. In Egypt he
                    visited the pyramids, and examined some of the mountains which form the limits
                    of the country, but his health soon compelled him to return to Europe. In this
                    voyage the vessel on board of which he had embarked was nearly overwhelmed by a
                    tempest, and appears to have been only saved by the temporary expedient of
                    throwing overboard pounded biscuit mixed with straw, which entered the leaks
                    with the water, and afforded a partial remedy, which was repeated from time to
                    time, until the vessel, at the last extremity, was driven into a port in the
                    Gulf of Tarentum. The counter-revolution of Calabria had occurred but a few days
                    before, and Dolomieu, with his companion Cordier, and many others of his
                    countrymen, were thrown into prison, and they even owed their lives to the great
                    exertions of an individual among the insurgents in their favour. They were
                    afterwards removed to Sicily, but with the loss of their collections and their
                    manuscripts; and Dolomieu being denounced, as a member of the order of Malta,
                    for high treason, was separated from his countrymen, and closely confined in a
                    dungeon. Solicitations were addressed to the kiqg of Naples on his behalf, by
                    the National Institute, by the French government, by the king of Spain, and in
                    the name of the Royal Society of London, although its illustrious president was
                    certainly not “at the time in Sicily,” as the <hi rend="italic">Nouveau</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Dictionnaire Historique</hi> affirms; but the captive derived
                    essential assistance from the good offices of an English gentleman at Messina,
                    and some Danes accommodated him in his pecuniary arrangements. Whilst still a
                    prisoner, he was appointed successor to Daubenton, at the Museum of Natural
                    History; and the very circumstance of his captivity seemed to give him an
                    advantage <pb break="no" facs="nls:193324409" xml:id="kp-eb0708-4409-0098"/>over
                    his competitor. In the treaty made by the French with the king of Naples, after
                    the battle of Marengo, it was expressly stipulated that Dolomieu should be set
                    at liberty.</p>
                <p>35. Upon his return to Paris he was made a member of the Conservative Senate, and
                    he delivered soon afterwards a course of lectures on the philosophy of
                    mineralogy. He had written part of an essay on this subject during his
                    imprisonment in Sicily, with a bone for a pen, and a mixture of soot and water
                    instead of ink, on the margins of such books as were allowed him; and his last
                    publication was <hi rend="italic">Sur la Philosophie Minéralogique, et sur
                    l’espece Minéralogique.</hi> Paris, 1801. His classification depended on
                    considering the species as determined by the integrant molecule, and on
                    arranging the different external forms as varieties, whether regular as
                    modifications, or irregular as imperfections; besides the variations of colour
                    and appearance, and the more essential affections of the consistence of the
                    substance, which may be called contamination; but the whole essay may be
                    considered as rather of a logical than of a physical nature.</p>
                <p>After the delivery of his lectures, he set out upon a new expedition to his
                    favourite mountains, in company with Mr Neergard and Mr d’Eymar, who published
                    an account of the journey. Paris, 1802. He meditated a tour into Germany and to
                    the north of Europe; but his return to Paris was interrupted by indisposition,
                    when he had arrived, by way of Lyons, at Chatcauneuf, where he met his sister
                    and his brother-in-law, and this journey was his last.</p>
                <p>The merits of, Dolomieu consisted as much in his personal character as in his
                    scientific attainments. His conversation was modest, though his courage was
                    heroic; his manners were simple though refined; and though his talents were
                    considerable, they seem to have been surpassed by his industry. It has been
                    remarked, that he often undertook, more than he had any reasonable prospect of
                    completing; but, in the mean time, he was perhaps as happy in the pursuit as he
                    would have been in the attainment of his object. He died, universally regretted,
                    at Dree, near Maçon, on the 27th of November 1801, in the midst of his
                    affectionate family, who had been the partakers in his pursuits, and the
                    consolation of his misfortunes.</p>
