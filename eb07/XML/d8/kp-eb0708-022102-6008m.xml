                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">DRYANDER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Jonas</hi></label>, a Swedish
                    naturalist of eminent talents, and a distinguished pupil of the great Linnaeus,
                    was born in 1748. His father, a clergyman near Gottenburg, died during the
                    minority, if not the infancy, of his son; in consequence of which the care of
                    the education of the latter devolved on a maternal uncle. This was Dr Lars
                    Montin, a member of the Stockholm Academy, known to the world by several
                    botanical writings, and, amongst others, by an inaugural dissertation on the
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Splaclιnum,</hi> published under the presidency of
                    Linnaeus, 28th March 1750; and reprinted in the <hi rend="italic">Amaenitates
                    Academicae,</hi> vol. ii. 263. The early education of young Dryander, as far as
                    we can learn, was chiefly in the University of Gottenburg; but he afterwards
                    removed to Lund, where he took his degree of master of arts, or doctor in
                    philosophy, under the presidency of Lidbeck, in 1776; on which occasion he
                    published a dissertation, <hi rend="italic">fungos</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >regno</hi><hi rend="italic">vegetabili vindicans.</hi> He combated the ideas of
                    certain philosophers, who, led by analogy rather than observation and judgment,
                    were disposed to believe that <hi rend="italic">fungi</hi> might, like corals
                    and corallines, be the production of animals. But though Mr Dryander thus
                    asserted the vegetable nature of these bodies, he subsequently imbibed, from his
                    friend and preceptor Linnaeus, an insuperable dislike to their use as food; nor
                    could the most delicate mushrooms of the most luxurious table ever tempt him to
                    overcome this prejudice. We know not at what period he went to study at Upsal,
                    nor how long he remained there. He became for some time domestic tutor to a
                    young Swedish nobleman, after which he visited England, under the patronage of
                    his countryman the well-known Dr Solander, who introduced him to the
                    acquaintance of Sir Joseph Banks; and on the sudden death of Solander in 1782,
                    he succeeded to the place of that eminent man, in the confidence and friendship
                    of his distinguished patron. He was, in like manner, domesticated under the roof
                    of Sir Joseph as his librarian, and continued in that situation as long as he
                    lived. Mr Dryander also held the offices of librarian to the Royal and the
                    Linnaean Societies. He was one of the first founders of the latter in 1788; and
                    took a principal interest in all its concerns, especially in drawing up its laws
                    and regulations, when this society was incorporated by royal charter in 1802.
                    He, moreover, fulfilled the duties of a very active vice-president, till the
                    time of his decease, which happened towards the end of October 1810, in the
                    sixty-third year of his age. His remains were deposited in the vault of St Ann’s
                    Church, Soho, the funeral being attended by a number of his friends, principally
                    members of the Linnaean Society.</p>
                <p>The acknowledged publications of Mr Dryander on the subject of botany consist of
                    the following dissertations: 1. <hi rend="italic">An Account of the Genus
                    Albuca,</hi> in the Stockholm <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> for 1784, in
                    Swedish; 2. <hi rend="italic">Observations on the Genus Begonia,</hi> in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions of the Linnaean Society,</hi> vol. i. In this essay
                    twenty-one species are determined, with an indication of nine doubtful ones,
                    though the genus was previously supposed to consist of a solitary species only.
                    3. <hi rend="italic">On Genera and Species of Plants</hi> which occur twice or
                    three times in Professor Gmelin’s edition of Linnaeus’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Systema</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturae; Trails, of Linn. Soc.</hi> vol. ii.
                    These corrections unfortunately extend no farther than the class <hi
                    rend="italic">Octandria.</hi> Their author intended to have completed them, but
                    other occupations intervened; and the book which was the object of his
                    correction soon fell into absolute neglect, as far as regards botany; insomuch
                    that its errors, however great and numerous, became harmless. 4. <hi
                    rend="italic">Lindsea, a new Genus of Ferns</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Trans, of Linn. Soc.</hi> vol. iii. This genus is distinguished
                    from <hi rend="italic">Pteris,</hi> by the <hi rend="italic">involucrum</hi>
                    opening outward. 5. <hi rend="italic">Botanical Description of the Benjamin Tree
                    of Sumatra,</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trqns.</hi> vol. lxxvii. The
                    tree in question, about which great mistakes had arisen, is here shown to be a
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Styrax.</hi> This paper has been republished and
                    translated.</p>
                <p>The principal works published under the superintendence and correction of the
                    subject of this memoir, were, the <hi rend="italic">Hortus Kewensis</hi> of Mr
                    Alton, printed in 1789, and about half the second edition of the same work,
                    interrupted by his death; as well as Dr Roxburgh’s <hi rend="italic">Plants of
                    the Coast of Coromandel,</hi> a splendid and highly valuable publication, for
                    which the world is indebted to the munificence of the East India Company. To
                    both these the critical learning and accuracy of Mr Dryander were most usefully
                    applied, especially in the typographical department. It would be vain to seek
                    for an error in the printing of any thing which had passed through his hands. We
                    have only to regret that the same critical correctness was not extended as a
                    principle to every other department of the works in which he took a part. Had
                    this been the case, the erroneous essential character of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oldenlandia,</hi> copied in <hi rend="italic">Hortus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Kewensis</hi> from Linnaeus and Willdenow, would not have been allowed to
                    contradict the plate and description of Roxburgh, cited underneath. But, above
                    all, various inaccuracies and faults in nomenclature are propagated and
                    confirmed by an authority which Mr Dryander himself never intended to give. He
                    has often assured the writer of this notice, that, had he published in his own
                    name, he would not have adopted such inaccuracies; which is mentioned here to
                    prevent the errors of others being laid to his charge. The popular <hi
                    rend="italic">Species</hi><hi rend="italic">Plantarum</hi> of Willdenow being
                    the avowed guide, the author of that work must be responsible for matters which
                    it did not come within the scope of the author or editor of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hortus</hi><hi rend="italic">Kewensis</hi> to correct. Many
                    subjects, however, are most skilfully elucidated in this publication, as well as
                    in the sequel of its second edition by Mr Brown, and these cannot escape the
                    discrimination of an intelligent reader. Practical botany was but a secondary or
                    occasional pursuit of Mr Dryander, and he had a diffidence of his powers, and a
                    consequent distaste for the technical and descriptive parts of the science. The
                    descriptions he had prepared for Mr Bauer’s splendid figures of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ericae,</hi> published by Mr Alton, were readily and even gladly
                    thrown into the fire, on occasion of a difference of opinion respecting the
                    intended title of the work.</p>
                <p>The study in which this most acute and correct man found ample scope for the
                    exercise of his talents was bibliography. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catalogus</hi><hi rend="italic">Bibliothecae HistoricoNaturalis Josephi
                    Banks,</hi> is a model for all future writers in this line; but a model rather
                    calculated to check than to excite imitation. A work so ingenious in design, and
                    so perfect in execution, can scarcely be produced in any science; so faultless a
                    specimen of typography we have never elsewhere seen. The frank and unvarnished
                    sincerity of Mr Dryander’s character was secondary only to his universal and
                    fastidious exactness upon every subject that came under his notice. He could not
                    be a silent witness of the slightest injustice, misrepresentation, or.
                    misconception. His impatience of contradiction arose more from the quickness of
                    his penetration into the confusion and inaccuracy of ordinary intellects and
                    characters<pb break="no" facs="nls:193326021" xml:id="kp-eb0708-6021-0222"/>,
                    than from any natural severity. All clearness, honesty, and precision himself,
                    he had little indulgence for those who fell short of his standard, and these
                    were the greater part of mankind. On being asked what share Dr Smith had in the
                    composition of the <hi rend="italic">Flora Grceca,</hi> he replied, with a
                    vehemence which startled the inquirer, “Every word !” When teazed, as was too
                    often his lot, by the questions of the heedless and superficial, he never
                    neglected the duties of the office he had undertaken, if he coul¢ not always
                    conceal his impatience under their performance. But when the humblest cultivator
                    of real science applied for his assistance, all his stores were laid open; the
                    most condescending liberality graced his conversation; and he was careful that
                    what he communicated should not only be heard but understood. The versatility of
                    his genius and conversation was no less admirable than their exactness. Whether
                    the subject were a question in science, or a point of history; the politics of
                    Europe, or the tittle-tattle of an obscure German court; the literary talents
                    and performances of any distinguished man, or his private transactions; the
                    intrigues for a place at court, a professorship, or a domestic establishment; he
                    was sure to throw some light upon it. Few men are more missed in the circle in
                    which he moved, nor can his place in general society be readily supplied. (x.
