                    rend="smallcaps">Druidae</hi></label>, the priests or ministers of religion
                    amongst the ancient Celtae or Gauls, the Britons, and the Germans.</p>
                <p>Some authors derive the word from the Hebrew DWn, <hi rend="italic"
                    >derussim,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">drussim,</hi> which they translate <hi
                    rend="italic">contemplatores.</hi> Picard (<hi rend="italic">Celtopoed.</hi>
                    lib. ii. p. 58) believes the druids to have been thus called from <hi
                    rend="italic">Druis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Dryins,</hi> their leader, the
                    fourth or fifth king of the Gauls, and father of Saron or Naumes. Pliny,
                    Salmasius, Vigenère, and others, derive the name from <hi rend="italic"
                    >δguς,</hi><hi rend="italic">quercus,</hi><hi rend="italic">oak,</hi> on account
                    of their inhabiting, or at least frequenting and teaching, in forests; or
                    perhaps because, as Pliny says, they never sacrificed except under the oak. But
                    it is hard to imagine how the druids should have come to speak Greek, even
                    although Caesar assures us that they had the Greek letters. Menage derived the
                    word from the old British <hi rend="italic">drus,</hi> a daemon or magician; and
                    Borel, from the Saxon <hi rend="italic">dry,</hi> a magician, or rather from the
                    old British <hi rend="italic">dru</hi> or <hi rend="italic">derw,</hi> an oak;
                    whence he supposes δgυς to be derived, which indeed is not an improbable
                    supposition. Becanus (lib. i.) takes <hi rend="italic">druis</hi> to be an old
                    Celtic and German word, formed from <hi rend="italic">trowis</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">trιιwis,</hi> a doctor of the truth and the faith; and in this
                    etymology Vossius is disposed to acquiesce.</p>
                <p>The druids were the first and most distinguished order among the Gauls and
                    Britons. They were chosen out of the best families; and the honours of their
                    birth, joined with those of their function, procured them the highest veneration
                    among the people. They were conversant in astrology, geometry, natural
                    philosophy, politics, and geography: they were the interpreters of religion, and
                    the judges in secular affairs: whoever refused obedience to them was declared
                    impious and accursed. We know but little as to their peculiar doctrines, only
                    that they believed the immortality of the soul, and, as is generally supposed,
                    in the metempsychosis; though it appears highly probable that they did not
                    believe in this last doctrine, at least not in the sense of the
                    Pythagoreans.</p>
                <p>The chief settlement of the druids in Britain was in the isle of Anglesey, the
                    ancient <hi rend="italic">Alona,</hi> which they chose for this purpose, as it
                    was well stored with spacious groves of their favourite oak·. They were divided
                    into several classes or branches, namely, the <hi rend="italic">vacerri,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">bardi,</hi><hi rend="italic">cubages, symnothii</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">semnothei,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">saronidae.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">vacerri</hi> are held to have been the priests; the <hi
                    rend="italic">bardi</hi> were the poets; the <hi rend="italic">cubages</hi> were
                    the augurs; and the <hi rend="italic">saronidae.</hi> were the civil judges and
                    instructors of youth. As to the <hi rend="italic">sernnothei,</hi> who are said
                    to have been immediately devoted to the service of religion, it is probable that
                    they were the same with the <hi rend="italic">vacerri.</hi> Strabo, however, and
                    Picard after him in his <hi rend="italic">Celtopaedia,</hi> do not comprehend
                    all these different orders under the denomination of Druids, as species under
                    their genus, or parts under the whole, but make them quite different conditions
                    or orders. Strabo in effect only distinguishes<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193325787" xml:id="kp-eb0708-5787-0204"/> three kinds, <hi
                    rend="italic">bardi, vates,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">druids.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">bardi</hi> were the poets; the <hi rend="italic">vates,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ουamς,</hi> apparently the same with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vacerri,</hi> were the priests and naturalists; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >druids</hi> were those who, besides the study of nature, applied themselves to
                    that of morality.</p>
                <p>Diogenes Laertius assures us in his prologue, that the druids were the same among
                    the ancient Britons with the sophoi or philosophers among the Greeks, the magi
                    among the Persians, the gymnosophists among the Indians, and the Chaldeans among
                    the Assyrians.</p>
                <p>Their garments were remarkably long; and, when employed in religious ceremonies,
                    they always wore a white surplice. They generally carried a wand in their hands;
                    and wore a kind of ornament enchased in gold about their necks, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">druids egg.</hi> Their necks were likewise decorated with gold
                    chains, and their hands and arms ornamented with bracelets. They wore their hair
                    very short, and their beards remarkably long.</p>
                <p>The druids had one chief or arch-druid in every nation, who acted as high priest,
                    or <hi rend="italic">pontifex maximus.</hi> He possessed absolute authority over
                    the rest, and commanded, decreed, or punished, at pleasure. At his death he was
                    succeeded by the most considerable amongst the survivors; and if there were
                    several pretenders, the matter was ended by an election, or else put to the
                    decision of arms.</p>
                <p>The druids, we have observed, were in the highest esteem. They presided at
                    sacrifices and other ceremonies, and had the direction of every thing relating
                    to religion. The British and Gallic youth flocked to them in crowds to be
                    instructed by them. With the children of the nobility, Mela tells us, they
                    retired into caves, or the most desolate parts of forests, and kept them there
                    sometimes for twenty years under their discipline. Besides the immortality and
                    metempsychosis, their disciples were here instructed in the motion of the
                    heavens and the course of the stars, the magnitude of the heavens and the earth,
                    the nature of things, the power and wisdom of the gods, and a variety of other
                    doctrines. They preserved the memory and actions of great men in their verses,
                    which they never allowed to be written down, but made their pupils get by heart.
                    In their common course of learning, they are said to have taught them
                    twenty-four thousand such verses. By this means their doctrines appeared more
                    mysterious by being unknown to all but themselves; and having no books to recur
                    to, they were the more careful to fix these doctrines in their memory.</p>
                <p>They worshipped the Supreme Being under the name of <hi rend="italic">Esus</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Hesus,</hi> and the symbol of the oak; and had no other
                    temple than a wood or a grove, where all their religious rites were performed.
                    Nor was any person admitted to enter that sacred recess, unless he carried with
                    him a chain, in token of his absolute dependence on the Deity. Indeed their
                    whole religion originally consisted in acknowledging that the Supreme Being, who
                    madebis abode in these sacred groves, governed the universe, and that every
                    creature ought to obey his laws and pay him divine homage.</p>
                <p>They considered the oak as the emblem, or rather the peculiar residence, of the
                    Almighty; and accordingly chaplets of it were worn both by the druids and the
                    people in their religious ceremonies, whilst the altars were strewed with its
                    leaves and encircled with its branches. The fruit of it, especially the
                    misletoe, was thought to contain a divine virtue, and to be the peculiar gift of
                    heaven. It was therefore sought for on the sixth day of the moon with the
                    greatest earnestness and anxiety, and when found it was hailed with raptures of
                    joy. As soon as the druids were informed of this fortunate discovery, they
                    prepared every thing for the sacrifice under the oak, to which they fastened two
                    white bulls by the horns; then the archdruid, attended by a prodigious number of
                    people, ascended the tree, dressed in white, and, with a consecrated golden
                    knife or pruning-hook, cropped the misletoe, which he received in his <hi
                    rend="italic">sagum</hi> or robe, amidst the rapturous exclamations of the
                    people. Having secured this sacred plant, he descended the tree; the bulls were
                    sacrificed; and the Deity invoked to bless his own gift, and render it
                    efficacious in those distempers in which it should be administered.</p>
                <p>The consecrated groves, in which they performed their religious rites, were
                    fenced round with stones, to prevent any person’s entering between the trees,
                    except through the passages left open for that purpose, and which were guarded
                    by some inferior druids, to prevent any stranger from intruding into their
                    mysteries. These groves were of different forms; some quite circular, others
                    oblong, and more or less capacious as the votaries in the districts to which
                    they belonged were more or less numerous. The area in the centre of the grove
                    was encompassed with several rows of large oaks set very close together. Within
                    this large circle were several smaller ones surrounded with large stones; and
                    near the centre of these smaller circles were stones of a prodigious size and
                    convenient height, on which the victims were slain and offered. Each of these
                    being a kind of altar, was surrounded with another row of stones, the use of
                    which cannot now be known, unless they were intended as cinctures to keep the
                    people at a convenient distance from the officiating priest.</p>
                <p>Suetonius, in his life of Claudius, assures us that the druids sacrificed men;
                    and Mercury is said to have been the god to whom they offered these victims.
                    Diodorus Siculus observes, that it was only upon extraordinary occasions they
                    made such offerings; as, to consult*what measures to take, or to learn what
                    should happen to them, by the fall of the victim, the tearing of his members,
                    and the manner in which his blood gushed out. Augustus condemned the custom, and
                    Tiberius and Claudius punished and abolished it.</p>
                <p>We learn from Caesar that the druids were the judges and arbiters of all
                    differences and disputes, both public and private; they took cognizance of
                    murders, inheritances, boundaries, and limits, and decreed rewards and
                    punishments. Such as disobeyed their decisions they excommunicated, which was
                    their principal punishment; the criminal being thereby excluded from all public
                    assemblies, and avoided by all the world, so that nobody durst speak to him, for
                    fear of being polluted.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    >ignis</hi><hi rend="italic">interdictio</hi> of the Homan law was probably
                    borrowed from and founded on the druidical excommunication, just as the “letters
                    of interconimuning” in the reigns of Charles II. and James II. were a
                    reproduction of the Roman penalty.</p></note> Strabo observes they had sometimes
                    interest and authority enough to stop armies upon the point of engaging, and
                    accommodate their differences.</p>
                <p>It has been disputed whether the druids were themselves the inventors of their
                    opinions and systems of religion and philosophy, or received them from others.
                    Some have imagined that the colony of Phocians which left Greece and built
                    Marseilles in Gaul about the 57th olympiad, imported the first principles of
                    learning and philosophy, and communicated them to the Gauls and other nations in
                    the west of Europe. It appears indeed that this famous colony contributed not a’
                    little to the improvement of that part of Gaul where it settled, and to the
                    civilization of its inhabitants. “The Greek colony of Marseilles,” <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193325800" xml:id="kp-eb0708-5800-0205"/> says Justin,
                    “civilized the Gauls, and taught them to live under laws; to build cities, and
                    enclose them with walls; to raise corn; to cultivate the vine and olive; and, in
                    a word, made so great a change both in the face of the country and the manners
                    of its inhabitants, that Gaul seemed to be translated into Greece, rather than a
                    few Greeks transplanted into Gaul.” But though we may allow that the druids of
                    Gaul and Britain borrowed some hints and embellishments of their philosophy from
                    this Greek colony, and perhaps from other quarters, there is some reason to
                    believe that the substance of it was their own. Others have suggested that the
                    druids derived their philosophy from Pythagoras, who published his doctrines at
                    Crotona in Italy, where he lived above twenty years, in the highest reputation
                    for his virtue, wisdom, and learning. This conjecture seems to be confirmed by
                    the remarkable expression of Ammianus Marcellinus, “That the druids were formed
                    into fraternities, as the authority of Pythagoras decreed.” It has also been
                    observed, that the philosophy of the druids bore a much greater resemblance to
                    that of Pythagoras than to that of any of the other sages of antiquity. But it
                    seems probable that Ammianus meant no more by the above expression than to
                    illustrate the nature of the druidical fraternities, by comparing them to those
                    of the Pythagoreans, which were well known to the Romans; and the resemblance
                    between the Pythagorean and druidical philosophy may perhaps be best accounted
                    for, by supposing that Pythagoras learned and adopted some of the opinions of
                    the druids, as well as imparted to them some of his discoveries, or that both
                    were derived from a common source. It is well known that this philosopher,
                    animated by the most ardent love of knowledge, travelled into many countries in
                    pursuit of it, and got himself admitted into every society that was famous for
                    its learning. It is therefore highly probable in itself, as well as directly
                    asserted by several authors, that Pythagoras heard the druids of Gaul, and was
                    initiated into their philosophy.</p>
                <p>From the concurring testimonies of several authors, it appears that physiology or
                    natural philosophy was the favourite study of the druids of Gaul and Britain.
                    Cicero tells us that he was personally acquainted with one of the Gaulish
                    druids, Divitiacus the Aeduan, a man of quality in his own country, who
                    professed to have a thorough knowledge of the laws of nature, or of that science
                    which the Greeks called <hi rend="italic">physics</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >physiology.</hi> According to Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, Caesar, Mela, Ammianus
                    Marcellinus, and others, they entered into many disquisitions and disputations
                    in their schools, concerning the form and magnitude of the universe in general,
                    and of this earth in particular, and even concerning the most sublime and hidden
                    secrets of nature. On these and similar subjects they formed a variety of
                    systems and hypotheses, which they delivered to their disciples in verse, that
                    the latter might the more easily retain them in their memories, since they were
                    not allowed to commit them to writing. Strabo has preserved one of the
                    physiological opinions of the druids concerning the universe, viz. that it was
                    never to be entirely destroyed or annihilated, but was to undergo a succession
                    of great changes and revolutions, which were to be produced sometimes by the
                    power and predominacy of water, and sometimes by that of fire. This opinion, he
                    intimates, was not peculiar to them, but was entertained also by the
                    philosophers of other nations; and Cicero speaks of it as a truth universally
                    acknowledged and undeniable. “It is impossible for us,” says he, “to attain a
                    glory that is eternal, or even of very long duration, on account of those
                    deluges and conflagrations of the earth, which must necessarily happen at
                    certain periods.” This opinion, which was entertained by the most ancient
                    philosophers of many different and very distant nations, was probably neither
                    the result of rational inquiry in all these nations, nor communicated from one
                    of them to others, but descended to them all from their common ancestors of the
                    family of Noah by tradition, though corrupted and misunderstood through length
                    of time. The agreement of the druids with the philosophers of so many other
                    nations in this opinion about the alternate dissolution and renovation of the
                    world, gives us reason to believe that they agreed with them also in their
                    opinion of its origin from two distinct principles: the one intelligent and
                    omnipotent, which was God; the other inanimate and inactive, which was matter.
                    We are told by Caesar that they had many disquisitions about the power of God;
                    and, no doubt, amongst other particulars, about his creative power. But whether
                    they believed with some that matter was eternal, or with others that it was
                    created, and in what manner they endeavoured to account for the disposition of
                    it into the present form of the universe, we are entirely ignorant, though they
                    certainly had their speculations on these subjects. We are only informed that
                    they did not express their sentiments on these and similar heads in a plain and
                    natural, but in a dark, figurative, and enigmatical manner. This might incline
                    us to suspect that Pythagoras had borrowed from them his doctrines about
                    numbers, to the mystical energy of which he ascribes the formation of all
                    things; for nothing can be more dark and enigmatical than that doctrine. The
                    druids disputed likewise about the magnitude and form of the world in general,
                    and of the earth in particular, of which things they pretended to have a perfect
                    knowledge. We know not what their opinions were about the dimensions of the
                    universe or of the earth, but there is reason to think that they believed both
                    to be of a spherical form. This is visibly the shape and form of the sun, moon,
                    and stars, the most conspicuous parts of the universe; and hence it was natural
                    and easy to infer that such was also the form of the world and of the earth.
                    Accordingly this seems to have been the opinion of the philosophers of all
                    nations; and the circle was the favourite figure of the druids, as appears from
                    the form both of their houses and places of worship. Besides these general
                    speculations about the origin, dissolution, magnitude, and form of the world and
                    of the earth, the druids engaged in particular inquiries into the natures and
                    properties of the different kinds of substances. But all their discoveries in
                    this most useful and extensive branch of natural philosophy, whatever they were,
                    have been entirely lost.</p>
                <p>Astronomy also appears to have been one of the chief studies of the druids of
                    Gaul and Britain. “The druids,” says Caesar, “have many disquisitions concerning
                    the heavenly bodies and their motions, in which they instruct their disciples.”
                    Mela, speaking of the same philosophers, observes, “that they profess to have
                    great knowledge of the motions of the heavens and of the stars.” Some knowledge
                    of this science indeed was not only necessary for measuring time in general,
                    marking the duration of the different seasons, regulating the operations of the
                    husbandman, directing the course of the mariner, and for many other purposes in
                    civil life; but it was especially necessary for fixing the times and regular
                    returns of their religious solemnities, of which the druids had the sole
                    direction. Some of these solemnities were monthly, and others annual. It was
                    therefore necessary for them to know, with some tolerable degree of exactness,
                    the number of days in which the sun and moon performed their revolutions, that
                    thι≈se solemnities might be observed at their proper seasons." This was the more
                    essential, as some of these solemnities were attended by persons from different
                    and very distant countries, who were all to meet at one place <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193325813" xml:id="kp-eb0708-5813-0206"/>on one day, and who must have
                    had some rule to discover the annual return of that day.</p>
                <p>The most perceptible division of time by means of the two great luminaries is
                    into day and night; the former occasioned by the presence of the sun above the
                    horizon, the latter by his absence, which is in some measure supplied by the
                    moon and stars. The druids computed their time by nights, and not by days; a
                    custom which they had received by tradition from their most remote ancestors,
                    and in which they were confirmed by measuring their time very much by the
                    motions of the moon, the mistress and the queen of night. As the changes in the
                    aspect of that luminary are most conspicuous, they engaged theattention of the
                    most ancient astronomers of all countries, and particularly of the druids, who
                    regulated all their great solemnities, both sacred and civil, by the age and
                    aspect of the moon. “When no unexpected accident prevents it, they assemble upon
                    stated days, either at the time of the new or full moon; for they believe these
                    to be the most auspicious times for transacting all affairs of importance."
                    Their most august ceremony, that of cutting the misletoe from the oak by the
                    archdruid, was always performed on the sixth day of the moon. Nay, they even
                    regulated their military operations by this luminary, and avoided, as much as
                    possible, to engage in battle whilst the moon was on the wane. As the attention
                    of the druids was so much fixed on this planet, it could not be very long before
                    they discovered that she passed through all her various aspects in about thirty
                    days; and by more accurate observations, they would gradually find, that the
                    real time of her performing an entire revolution was very nearly twenty-nine and
                    a half days. This would furnish them with the division of their time into
                    months, or revolutions of the moon; of which we know with certainty they were
                    possessed. But this period, though of great use, was evidently too short for
                    many purposes, and particularly for measuring the seasons; which, they could not
                    fail to perceive, depended on the influences of the sun. By continued
                    observation they discovered that about twelve revolutions of the moon included
                    all the variety of seasons, which began again and revolved every twelve months.
                    This suggested to them that larger division of time called a year, consisting of
                    twelve lunations or three hundred and fifty-four days, which was the most
                    ancient measure of the year in almost all nations. That this was for some time
                    at least the length of the druidical year, is both probable in itself, and
                    apparent from the expression of Pliny, that “they began both their months and
                    years, not from the change, but from the sixth day of the moon ;” which is a
                    demonstration that their years consisted of a certain number of lunar
                    revolutions, as they always commenced on the same day of the moon. But as this
                    year of twelve lunar months falls eleven days and nearly one fourth of a day
                    short of a real revolution of the sun, this error would soon be perceived, and
                    call for reformation; though we arc not informed of the particular manner in
                    which it was rectified. Various arguments might be collected to render it very
                    probable that the Britons were acquainted with a year exact enough for every
                    purpose of life when they were first invaded by the Romans; but it will be
                    sufficient to mention one, which is taken from the time and circumstances of
                    that invasion. The learned Dr Halley has demonstrated that Caesar arrived in
                    Britain, in his first year’s expedition, on the 26th day of August; and Caesar
                    himself informs us, that at his arrival the harvest was finished, except in one
                    field, which by some means or other was more backward than the rest of the
                    country. This is a proof that the British husbandmen knew and used the most
                    proper seasons for ploughing, sowing, and reaping. The druids, as we are told by
                    Pliny, had also a cycle or period of thirty years, which they called an age, and
                    which likewise commenced on the sixth day of the moon; but that author has not
                    acquainted us on what principle this cycle was formed, nor to what purpose it
                    was applied. We can hardly suppose that this was the cycle of the sun, which
                    consists of twenty-eight years, and regulates the dominical letters. It is more
                    probable, that whilst the druids made use of the year of twelve lunar months,
                    and had not invented a method of adjusting it to the real revolution of the sun,
                    they observed that the beginning of this year had passed through all the
                    seasons, and returned to the point whence it set out, in a course of about
                    thirty-three years; which they might therefore denominate an age. Others may
                    perhaps be of opinion that this thirty years cycle of the druids is the same
                    with the great year of the Pythagoreans, or a revolution of Saturn. Some have
                    imagined that the druids were also acquainted with the cycle of nineteen years,
                    which is commonly called the cycle of the moon. But the evidence of this depends
                    entirely on the truth of that supposition, that the Hyperborean island, which is
                    described by Diodorus Siculus, was Britain, or some of the British isles.
                    Amongst many surprising things, that author states, concerning the Hyperborean
                    island, that “its inhabitants believed that Apollo descended into their island
                    at the end of every nineteen years; in which period of time the sun and moon,
                    having performed their various revolutions, return to the same point, and begin
                    to repeat the same revolutions. This is called by the Greeks the great year, or
                    the cycle of Meton.”</p>
                <p>We are told both by Caesar and Mela, that the druids studied the stars as well as
                    the sun and moon; and that they professed to know, and taught their disciples,
                    many things concerning the motions of these heavenly bodies. From these
                    testimonies we may conclude that the druids were acquainted with the planets,
                    distinguished them from the fixed stars, and carefully observed their motions
                    and revolutions. If this discovery was the result of their own observations, it
                    would be gradual, and it would be a long time before they found out all the
                    planets. They might perhaps have received assistance and information from
                    Pythagoras, or from some other quarter. But whether this discovery of the
                    planets was their own, or communicated to them by others, it is highly probable
                    that they were acquainted with the precise number of these wandering stars. Dio
                    Cassius says, that the custom of giving the name of one of the planets to each
                    of the seven days of the week was an invention of the Egyptians, and from them
                    was gradually communicated to all the other nations of the world; and that in
                    his time this custom was so firmly established, not only among the Romans, but
                    among all the rest of mankind, that in eveŗy country it appeared to be a native
                    institution. The knowledge of the planets, and perhaps the custom of giving
                    their names to the days of the week, was brought out of Egypt into Italy by
                    Pythagoras, more than five hundred years before the beginning of the Christian
                    era; and from thence it could not be very long before it reached Gaul and
                    Britain. But though we have little or no reason to doubt that the druids knew
                    the number and observed the motion of the planets, yet it may be questioned
                    whether they had discovered the times in which these bodies performed their
                    several revolutions. Some of the planets, as Jupiter and Saturn, take so great a
                    number of years in revolving, that it required a very extraordinary degree of
                    patience and attention to discover the precise periods of their revolutions. If
                    we could be certain that the island in which the ancients imagined Saturn lay
                    asleep was one of the British isles, as Plutarch intimates it was, we might be
                    inclined to think that the British druids were not ignorant of the length of the
                    period <pb break="no" facs="nls:193325826" xml:id="kp-eb0708-5826-0207"/>in
                    which the planet Saturn performs a revolution; for that same author, in another
                    treatise, tells us, that “the inhabitants of that island kept every thirtieth
                    year a solemn festival in honour of Saturn, when his star entered into the sign
                    of Taurus.” If we could depend <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> upon this
                    testimony, we should have one positive proof that the druids of the British
                    isles were acquainted with the constellations, and even with the signs of the
                    zodiac; and that they measured the revolutions of the sun and planets, by
                    observing the length of time between their departure from and return to one of
                    these signs. But history supplies no direct evidence that this was really the
                    case. The druids of Gaul and Britain, indeed, as well as the ancient
                    philosophers of other countries, had a general plan or system of the universe,
                    and of the disposition and arrangement of its various parts, in which they
                    instructed their disciples. This is both probable in itself, and is plainly
                    intimated by several authors of the greatest authority. But we cannot be certain
                    whether this druidical system of the world was of their own invention, or was
                    borrowed from others. If it was borrowed, it was most probably from the
                    Pythagoreans, to whom they were the nearest neighbours, and with whom they had
                    the greatest intercourse; or at all events from some oriental sect, order, or
                    caste, of which many are of opinion that they originally sprung.</p>
                <p>It has been imagined that the druids had instruments of some kind or other, which
                    answered the same purposes as our telescopes, in making observations on the
                    heavenly bodies. The only foundation of this very improbable conjecture is an
                    expression of Diodorus Siculus, in his description of the famous Hyperborean
                    island. “They say further, that the moon is seen from that island, as if she
                    were but at a little distance from the earth, and having hills or mountains like
                    ours on the surface.” But no such inference can be reasonably drawn from this
                    expression, which in reality merits little more regard than that which,
                    according to Strabo, was said of some of the inhabitants of Spain, that “they
                    heard the hissing noise of the sun every evening when he fell into the western
                    ocean.”</p>
                <p>The application of the druids to the study of philosophy and astronomy amounts
                    almost to a demonstration that they applied also to the study of arithmetic and
                    geometry; for some knowledge of both these sciences is indispensably necessary
                    to the natural philosopher and astronomer, as well as of great and daily use in
                    the common affairs of life. If we were certain that Abaris, the famous
                    Hyperborean philosopher, the friend and scholar of Pythagoras, was really a
                    British druid, as some have imagined, we should be able to produce direct
                    historical evidence of their arithmetical knowledge. For Iamblicus, in the life
                    of Pythagoras, says, that “he taught Abaris to find out all truth by the science
                    of arithmetic.” It maybe thought improbable that the druids had made any
                    considerable progress in arithmetic, as this may seem to have been impossible by
                    the mere strength of memory, without the assistance of figures and of written
                    rules. But it is very difficult to ascertain what may be done by memory alone,
                    when it has been long exercised in this way. We have had examples of persons who
                    could perform some of the most tedious and difficult operations in arithmetic by
                    the mere strength of memory. The want of written rules could be no great
                    disadvantage to the druids, as the precepts of this, as well as of the other
                    sciences, were couched in verse, which would be easily got by heart and long
                    remembered. Though the druids were unacquainted with the Arabic numeral
                    characters, which are now in use, we have no reason to suppose that they were
                    destitute of marks or characters of another kind, which, in some measure,
                    answered the same purposes, both in making and recording their calculations. In
                    particular, it is believed that they made use of the letters of the Greek
                    alphabet for both these purposes. This seems to be pretty distinctly intimated
                    by Caesar, who, in speaking of the druids of Gaul, observes, that “in almost all
                    other public transactions and private accounts or computations, they make use of
                    the Greek letters.” And this is further confirmed by what he says of the
                    Helvetii, a people of the same origin, language, and manners, with the Gauls and
                    Britons. “Tables were found in the camp of the Helvetii written in Greek
                    letters, containing an account of all the men capable of bearing arms who had
                    left their native country, and also separate accounts of the boys, old men, and
                    women.” There is historical evidence of the druids being also well acquainted
                    with geometry. “When any disputes arise,” says Caesar, “about their
                    inheritances, or any controversies about the limits of their fields, they are
                    entirely referred to the decision of their druids.” But besides the knowledge of
                    mensuration which this implies, both Caesar and Mela plainly intimate that the
                    druids were conversant in the most sublime speculations of geometry; “in
                    measuring the magnitude of the earth, and even of the world.”</p>
                <p>There are still many monuments remaining in Britain and the adjacent isles, which
                    cannot so reasonably be ascribed to any race as to that of the ancient Britons,
                    and which lead us to think that they had made great progress in this department
                    of knowledge, and could apply the mechanical powers so as to produce very
                    astonishing effects. As these monuments appear to have been designed for
                    religious purposes, we may be certain that they were erected under the direction
                    of the druids. Many obelisks or pillars, of one rough unpolished stone each, are
                    still to be seen in Britain and its isles. Some of these pillars are both very
                    thick and lofty, erected on the summits of barrows and of mountains; and some of
                    them, as at Stonehenge, have ponderous blocks of stone raised aloft, and resting
                    on the tops of the upright pillars. We can hardly suppose that it was possible
                    to cut these prodigious masses of stone, some of them above forty tons in
                    weight, without wedges, or to raise them out of the quarry without levers. But
                    it certainly required still greater knowledge of the mechanical powers, and of
                    the method of applying them, to transport those huge stones from the quarry to
                    the places of their destination; to erect the perpendicular pillars, and to
                    elevate the imposts to the tops of these pillars. If the prodigious stone in the
                    parish of Constantine, Cornwall, was really removed by art from its original
                    place, and fixed where it now stands, it is a demonstration that the druids
                    could perform the most astonishing feats by their skill in mechanics. That the
                    British druids were acquainted with the principles and use of the balance, we
                    have reason to believe, not only from the great antiquity of that discovery in
                    other parts of the world, but also from some druidical monuments which are still
                    remaining in this island. These monuments are called <hi rend="italic">logon
                    stones,</hi> or rocking stones, and each of them consists of one prodigious
                    block of stone, resting upon an upright stone or rock, and so equally balanced,
                    that a very small force, sometimes even that of a child, can move it up and
                    down, though hardly any force is sufficient to remove it from its station. Some
                    of these stones may have fallen into this position by accident, but others of
                    them evidently appear to have been placed in it by art. That the ancient Britons
                    understood the construction and use of wheels, the great number of their
                    war-chariots and other wheel carriages is a sufficient proof; and that they)knew
                    how to combine them together and with the other mechanical powers, so as to form
                    machines capable of raising and transporting very heavy weights, we have good
                    rea-sori<pb break="no" facs="nls:193325839" xml:id="kp-eb0708-5839-0208"/> to
                    believe. In a word, if the British druids were wholly ignorant of the principles
                    and the use of any of the mechanical powers, it was most probably of the screw,
                    though even of this we cannot be certain.</p>
                <p>In Germany and in the northern nations of Europe the healing art was chiefly
                    committed to the old women of every state; but in Gaul and Britain it was
                    entrusted to the druids, who were the physicians as well as the priests of these
                    countries. Pliny says expressly, that “Tiberius Caesar destroyed the druids of
                    the Gauls, who were the poets and physicians of that nation and he might have
                    added, of the Britons. The people of Gaul and Britain were probably induced to
                    devolve the care of their health on the druids, and to apply to these priests
                    for the cure of their diseases, not only by the high esteem they had of their
                    wisdom and learning, but also by the opinion which they entertained, that a very
                    intimate connection subsisted between the arts of healing and the rites of
                    religion, and that the former were most effectual when they were accompanied by
                    the latter. It appears indeed to have been the prevailing opinion of the nations
                    of antiquity, that all internal diseases proceeded immediately from the anger of
                    the gods; and that the only way of obtaining relief from these diseases was by
                    applying to the priests to appease their anger by religious rites and
                    sacrifices. This was evidently the opinion and practice of the Gauls and
                    Britons, who in some dangerous cases sacrificed one man as the most effectual
                    means of curing another. “They are much addicted,” says Caesar, “to
                    superstition, and hence those who are afflicted with a dangerous disease
                    sacrifice a man, or promise that they will sacrifice one, for their recovery.
                    For this purpose they make use of the ministry of the druids, because the latter
                    have declared that the anger of the immortal gods cannot be appeased, so as to
                    spare the life of one man, but by the life of another.” This way of thinking
                    also gave rise to that great number of magical rites and incantations with which
                    the medical practices of the druids, and indeed of all the physicians of
                    antiquity, were attended. “Nobody doubts,” says Pliny, “that magic derived its
                    origin from medicine, and that, by its flattering but delusive promises, it came
                    to be esteemed the most sublime and sacred part of the art of healing.”</p>
                <p>That the druids made great use of herbs for medicinal purposes, there is
                    sufficient evidence. They not only had a most superstitious veneration for the
                    misletoe of the oak, on a religious account, but they also entertained a very
                    high opinion of its medicinal virtues, and esteemed it as a kind of panacea, or
                    remedy for all diseases. “They call it,” says Pliny, “by a name which in their
                    language signifies <hi rend="italic">All-heal,</hi> because they have an opinion
                    that it cures all diseases.” They believed it to be in particular a specific
                    against barrenness, and a sovereign antidote against the fatal effects of
                    poisons of all kinds. It was also esteemed an excellent emollient and discutient
                    for softening and discussing hard tumours, and good for drying up scrofulous
                    sores, and curing ulcers and wounds; and, provided it was not suffered tô touch
                    the earth after it was cut, it was thought to be a very efficacious medicine in
                    epilepsy. It has been thought useful in this last calamitous disease by some
                    modem physicians. The pompous ceremonies with which the misletoe was gathered by
                    the druids have been already described. The selago, a kind of hedge hyssop
                    resembling savin, was another plant much admired by the druids of Gaul and
                    Britain for its supposed medicinal virtues, particularly in all diseases of the
                    eyes. But its efficacy, according to them, depended very much upon its being
                    gathered exactly in the following manner: The person who gathered it was to be
                    clothed in a white robe; to have his feet bare, and washed in pure water; to
                    offer a sacrifice of bread and wine before he proceeded to cut it, which he was
                    to do with his right hand covered with the skirt of his garment, and with a hook
                    of some more precious metal than iron. When it was cut, it was to be received
                    and kept in a new and very clean cloth. Gathered exactly according to this
                    whimsical ritual, it was affirmed to be not only an excellent medicine, but also
                    a powerful charm and preservative against misfortunes and unhappy accidents of
                    all kinds. The druids also entertained a high opinion of the herb samolus or
                    mashwort, from its sanative qualities, and gave directions for gathering it, not
                    less fanciful than those which have already been mentioned. The person who was
                    to perform that office was to do it fasting, and with his left hand; he was on
                    no account to look behind him, nor to turn his face from the herbs he was
                    gathering. It would be tedious to relate the extravagant notions they
                    entertained of the many virtues of the vervain, and to recount the ridiculous
                    mummeries which they practised in gathering and preparing it, both for the
                    purposes of divination and physic. It is easy to see that Pliny’s information
                    was very imperfect; and that, like many of the other Greek and Roman writers, he
                    designedly represented the philosophers of Gaul and Britain in an unfavourable
                    light. The herb called <hi rend="italic">Eritannica</hi> by the ancients, which
                    some think was the great water-dock, and others the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cochlearia</hi> or scurvy-grass, was probably much used in this island for
                    medicinal purposes, as it derived its name from Britain, and was thence exported
                    to Rome and other parts. Though these few imperfect hints are all that we can
                    now collect of the botany of the British druids, yet there is some reason to
                    think that they were not contemptible botanists. Their circumstances were
                    peculiarly favourable for the acquisition of this kind of knowledge. For as they
                    spent most of their time in the recesses of mountains, groves, and woods, the
                    spontaneous vegetable productions of the earth constantly presented themselves
                    to their view, and courted their attention.</p>
                <p>The opinions which, it is said, the druids of Gaul and Britain entertained of the
                    anguinum or serpent’s egg, both as a charm and as a medicine, are romantic and
                    extravagant in a very high degree. This extraordinary <hi rend="italic">egg</hi>
                    was formed, as they pretended, by a great number of serpents, interwoven and
                    twined together; and when it <hi rend="subscript"> x</hi> had been formed, it
                    was raised up in the air by the hissing of these serpents, and was then to be
                    caught in a clean white cloth before it fell to the ground. The person who
                    caught it was obliged to mount a swift horse, and to ride away at full speed to
                    escape from the serpents, who pursued him with great rage, until they were
                    stopped by some river. The way of making trial of the genuineness of the egg was
                    no less extraordinary. It was to be encased in gold, and thrown into a river,
                    and if it was genuine it would swim against the stream. “I have seen,” says
                    Pliny, “that egg; it is about the bigness of a moderate apple, its shell is a
                    cartilaginous incrustation, full of little cavities, such as are on the legs of
                    the polypus; it is the insignia or badge of distinction of the druids.” The
                    virtues which they ascribed to this egg were many and wonderful. It was
                    particularly efficacious in rendering those who carried it about with them
                    superior to their adversaries in all disputes, and in procuring them the favour
                    and friendship of great men. Some have thought that this whole affair of the
                    serpent’s egg was a mere fraud, contrived by the druids to excite the admiration
                    and pick the pockets of a credulous people, who purchased these wonder-working
                    eggs from them at a high price. Others have imagined that this story of the
                    anguinum, of which there is an ancient monument in the cathedral at Paris, was
                    an emblematical representation of the doctrine of the druids concerning the
                    creation of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193325852" xml:id="kp-eb0708-5852-0209"
                    />world. The serpents, say they, represent the divine wisdom forming the
                    universe, and the egg is the emblem of the world formed by that wisdom. It may
                    be added, that the virtue ascribed to the anguinum, of giving those who
                    possessed it a superiority over others, and endearing them to great men, may
                    perhaps be intended to represent the natural effects of learning and philosophy.
                    But in so doubtful a matter every one is of course at liberty to form what
                    judgment he thinks proper.</p>
                <p>As the influence and authority of the druids in their country depended very much
                    upon the reputation of their superior wisdom and learning, they wisely applied
                    to the study of those sciences which most directly contributed to the support
                    and advancement of that reputation. In this number, besides those already
                    mentioned, we may justly reekon rhetoric, which was diligently studied and
                    taught by the druids of Gaul and Britain, who to the charms of their eloquence
                    were indebted for much of the admiration and authority which they enjoyed. They
                    had indeed many calls and opportunities to display thfcir eloquence, and to
                    discover its great power and efficacy; as, when they were teaching their pupils
                    in their schools; when they discoursed in public to the people on religious and
                    moral subjects; when they pleaded causes in the courts of justice; and when they
                    harangued in great councils of the nation, and at the heads of armies ready to
                    engage in battle, sometimes with a view to inflame their courage, and at other
                    times with a design to allay their fury, and dispose them to make peace. Though
                    this last was ecrtainly a difficult task amongst fierce and warlike nations, yet
                    such was the authority and eloquence of the druids, that they frequently
                    succeeded in it. “They pay a great regard,” says Diodorus Siculus, “to their
                    exhortations, not only in the affairs of peace, but even of war; and these are
                    respected both by their friends and enemies. They sometimes step in between two
                    hostile armies, who are standing with their swords drawn and their spears
                    extended, ready to engage; and by their eloquence, as by an irresistible
                    enchantment, they prevent the effusion of blood, and prevail upon them to sheath
                    their swords. So great are the charms of eloquence and the power of wisdom even
                    amongst the most fierce barbarians.” The British kings and chieftains, who were
                    educated by the druids, were famous for their eloquence. This is evident from
                    the many noble speeches which are ascribed to them by the Greek and Roman
                    writers. For though these speeches may not be genuine, yet they are a proof that
                    it was a well-known faet that these princes were accustomed to make harangues on
                    such occasions. This we are expressly told by Tacitus: “The British chieftains,
                    before a battle, fly from rank to rank, and address their men with animating
                    speeches, tending to inflame their courage, increase their hopes, and dispel
                    their fears.” These harangues were called, in the ancient language of Britain,
                    <hi rend="italic">brosnichty hah,</hi> which is literally translated by Tacitus,
                    <hi rend="italic">incitamenta</hi><hi rend="italic">belli,</hi> incentives to
                    war. The genuine posterity of the ancient Britons long retained their taste for
                    eloquence, and their high esteem for those who excelled in that art. “Orators,”
                    says Mr Martin, <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>. <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>
                    were in high esteem, both in these islands (the Hebrides) and the continent,
                    until within these forty years. They sat always among the nobles or chiefs of
                    families in the streah or circle. Their houses and little villages were
                    sanetuaries, as well as churches, and they took place before doctors of physic.
                    The orators, after the druids were extinet, were brought in to preserve the
                    genealogy of families, and to repeat the same at every succession of a chief;
                    and upon the eceasion of marriages and births, they made epithalamiums and
                    panegyrics, which the poet or bard pronounced. The orators, by the force of
                    their eloquence, had a powerful ascendant over the greatest men in their time.
                    For if any orator did but ask the habit, arms, horse, or any other thing
                    belonging to the greatest man in these islands, it was readily granted him;
                    sometimes out of respect, and sometimes for fear of being exclaimed against by a
                    satire, which in those days was reckoned a great dishonour.”</p>
                <p>If the British druids, considering the times in which they lived, had made no
                    contemptible proficieney in several parts of real and useful learning, it cannot
                    be denied that they were also great pretenders to superior knowledge in certain
                    vain and fallacious sciences, by which they excited the admiration, and took
                    advantage of the ignorance and credulity, of mankind. These were the sciences,
                    if they may be so called, of magie and divination, by means of which they
                    pretended to work a kind of miraeles, and exhibit astonishing appearances in
                    nature; to penetrate into the counsels of heaven; to foretel future events, and
                    to discover the success or miscarriage of public or private undertakings. Their
                    own countrymen not only believed that the druids of Gaul and Britain were
                    possessed of these powers, but they were celebrated on this account by the
                    philosophers of Greece and Rome. “In Britain,” says Pliny, “the magie arts are
                    cultivated with such astonishing success, and so many ceremonies, at this day,
                    that the Britons seem to be capable of instructing even the Persians themselves
                    in these arts. They pretend to discover the designs and purposes of the gods.
                    The Eubates or Vates in particular investigate and display the most sublime
                    seerets of nature; and by auspices and sacrifices they foretel future events.”
                    They were so famous for the supposed veracity of their predictions, that they
                    were not only consulted on all important occasions by their own princes and
                    great men, but even sometimes by the Roman emperors. Nor is it very difficult to
                    account for all this. The druids finding that the reputation of their magical
                    and prophetical powers contributed not a little to the advancement of their
                    wealth and influence, naturally endeavoured to strengthen and establish it by
                    all their art and cunning. Their knowledge of natural philosophy and mechanics
                    enabled them to execute such works, and to exhibit such appearances, or to make
                    the world believe that they did exhibit them, as were sufficient to gain them
                    the character of great magicians. The truth is, that nothing is more easy than
                    to acquire this character in a dark age, and among an unenlightened people. When
                    the minds of men are haunted with dreams of charms and enchantments, they are
                    apt to fancy that the most common occurrences in nature are the effects of
                    magical arts. The following strange story, which we meet with in Plutarch’s
                    Treatise of the Cessation of Oraeles, was probably occasioned by something of
                    this kind. “There are many islands which lie scattered about the isle of
                    Britain, after the manner of our Sporades. They are generally unpeopled, and
                    some of them are called the <hi rend="italic">Islands of the Heroes.</hi> One
                    Demetrius was sent by the emperor Improbably Claudius] to discover these parts.
                    He arrived at one of these islands ^supposed by some to'be Anglesey, but more
                    probably one of the Hebrides] next adjoining to the isle of Britain before
                    mentioned, which was inhabited by a few Britons, who were esteemed sacred and
                    inviolable by their countrymen. Immediately after his arrival the air grew black
                    and troubled, and strange apparitions were seen; the winds rose to a tempest,
                    and fiery spouts and whirlwinds appeared daneing towards the earth.” This was
                    probably no more than a storm of wind, accompanied with rain and lightning, a
                    thing neither unnatural nor uncommon; but Demetrius and his companions having
                    heard that the British druids, by whom this isle was chiefly inhabited, were
                    great magicians, imagined that it was raised by them, and fancied that they saw
                    many strange and unnatural sights.</p>

                <p>The druids did not think proper to undeceive them; for when they inquired about
                    the cause of this storm, they were told that it was occasioned by the death of
                    one of those invisible beings or genii who frequented their isle; a wonderful
                    and artful tale, very well calculated to increase the superstitious terrors of
                    Demetrius and his crew, and to determine them to abandon this enchanted isle,
                    with a resolution never to return. Stonehenge, and several other works of the
                    druids, were, for many ages after the destruction of their whole order, believed
                    to have been executed by the arts of magic and enchantment; nor is it improbable
                    that they persuaded the vulgar in their own .times to entertain the same opinion
                    of these works, by concealing from them the real arts by which they had been
                    erected. The natural and acquired sagacity of the druids, with their long
                    experience and great concern in the conduct of affairs, enabled them to form
                    very probable conjectures about the event of enterprises. These conjectures they
                    pronounced as oracles when they were consulted; and they pretended to derive
                    them from the inspection of the entrails of victims, the observation of the
                    flight and feeding of certain birds, and many other mummeries. By these and
                    similar arts they obtained and preserved the reputation of prophetic foresight
                    among an ignorant and credulous people. But these pretensions of the druids to
                    magic and divination, which contributed so much to the advancement of their fame
                    and fortune in their own times, have brought very heavy reproaches upon their
                    memory, and have made some learned moderns declare that they ought to be
                    expunged out of the catalogue of philosophers, and esteemed no better than mere
                    cheats and jugglers. This censure is evidently too severe, and might have been
                    pronounced with equal justice upon all the ancient philosophers of Egypt,
                    Assyria, Persia, Greece, and Rome, who were great pretenders to magic and
                    divination, as well as the druids. “I know of no nation in the world, “says
                    Cicero, “either so polite and learned, or so savage and barbarous, as not to
                    believe that future events are presignified to us, and may by some men be
                    discovered and foretold.” The only conclusion, therefore, that can be fairly
                    drawn from the successful pretensions of the British druids to the arts of magic
                    and of divination, is this: That they had more knowledge than their countrymen
                    and contemporaries, but had not so much virtue as to resist the temptation of
                    imposing upon their ignorance to their own advantage.</p>
