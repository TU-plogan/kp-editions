                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">DREAMS</label> are all those thoughts which pass through the
                    mind, and those imaginary transactions in which we often fancy ourselves engaged
                    when in the state of sleep.</p>
                <p>Scarcely any part of nature is less open to our observation than the human mind
                    in this state. The dreamer himself cannot well observe the manner in which
                    dreams arise or disappear in his own mind. When he awakes, he cannot recollect
                    t)ιe circumstances of his dreams with sufficient accuracy. Were we to watch over
                    him with the most vigilant attention, we could not perceive with certainty what
                    emotions were excited in his mind, or what thoughts passed through it, during
                    his sleep. But though we could ascertain these phenomena, many other
                    difficulties would still remain. What parts of a human being are active, and
                    what dormant, when he dreams? Why does he not always dream while asleep? Or why
                    dreams he at all? Do any circumstances in our constitution, situation, and
                    peculiar character, determine the nature of our dreams?</p>
                <p>In treating of this subject, we shall endeavour to lay before our readers such
                    facts as have been ascertained concerning dreaming, together with the most
                    plausible conjectures which have been offered to explain the phenomena of
                    dreams.</p>
                <p>In dreaming we are not conscious of being asleep. This is well known from a great
                    variety of circumstances. When awake, we often recollect our dreams; and we
                    remember, on such occasions, that whilst those dreams were passing through our
                    minds, it never occurred to us that we were separated by sleep from the active
                    world. Persons are often observed to act and talk in dreaming as if they were
                    busily engaged in the intercourse of social life.</p>
                <p>In dreaming we do not consider ourselves as witnessing or bearing a part in a
                    fictitious scene. We seem not to be in a similar situation with the actors in a
                    dramatic performance, or the spectators before whom they exhibit, but engaged in
                    the business of real life. All the varieties of thought that pass through our
                    minds when awake may also occur in dreams; all the images which imagination
                    presents in the former state may be called up in the latter; the same emotions
                    may be excited, and we are often actuated by equal violence of passion; none of
                    the transactions in which we are capable of engaging whilst awake is impossible
                    in dreams; in short, our range of action and observation is as wide in the one
                    state as in the other; and whilst dreaming, we are not sensible of any
                    distinction between our dreams and the events and transactions in which we are
                    actually concerned in our intercourse with the world.</p>
                <p>It is said that all men are not liable to dream. Dr Beattie, in a very pleasing
                    essay on this subject, relates that he knew a gentleman who never dreamed except
                    when his health was in a disordered state; and Locke mentions that a certain
                    person of his acquaintance was almost a stranger to dreaming until the
                    twenty-sixth year of his age, when he began to dream in consequence of having
                    had a fever. These instances, however, are too few, and we have not been able to
                    obtain more; and, besides, it does not appear that those persons had always
                    attended, with the care of a philosopher making an*experiment, to the
                    circumstances of their sleep. They might dream, but not recollect their dreams
                    on awaking; and they might both dream and recollect their dreams immediately
                    upon awaking, yet afterwards suffer the remembrance of them to slip out of their
                    memory. We do not advance this, therefore, as a certain fact concerning
                    dreaming; we are rather inclined to consider it as a mistake. But though it
                    appears to be by no means certain that any of the human race are throughout the
                    whole of life absolute strangers to dreaming; yet it is well known that all men
                    are not equally liable to dream. The same person dreams more or less at
                    different times; and as one person may be more exposed than another to those
                    circumstances which promote this exercise of fancy, one person may therefore
                    dream more than another. The same diversity will naturally take place in this as
                    in other accidents to which mankind are in general liable <hi rend="subscript">
                    s</hi></p>
                <p>Though in dreams imagination appears to be free from all restraint, and indulges
                    in the most wanton freaks, yet it is generally agreed that the imaginary
                    transactions of the dreamer bear always some relation to his particular
                    character in the world, his habits of action, and the circumstances of his life.
                    The lover, we are told, dreams of his mistress, the miser of his money; the
                    philosopher renews his researches in sleep often with the same pain and fatigue
                    as when awake; and even the merchant at times returns to balance his books, and
                    computes the profits of an adventure, when slumbering on his pillow. And not
                    only do the more general circumstances of a person’s life influence one’s
                    dreams; the passions and habits are nearly the same when asleep as when awake. A
                    person whose habits of life are virtuous, does not in his dreams plunge into a
                    series of crimes; nor are the vicious reformed when they pass into this
                    imaginary world. The choleric man finds himself offended by slight provocations
                    in his dreams as well as in his ordinary intercourse with the world; and a mild
                    temper continues pacific even in sleep.</p>
                <p>The character of a person’s dreams is influenced by his circumstances when awake
                    in a still more unaccountable manner. Certain dreams usually arise in the mind
                    after a person has been in certain situations. Dr Beattie relates that once,
                    after riding thirty miles in a high wind, he passed a part of the succeeding
                    night in dreams beyond description terrible. The state of a person’s health, and
                    the manner in which the vital functions are carried on, have a considerable
                    influence in determining the character of dreams. After too full a meal, or
                    after eating of an unusual sort of food, a person is very apt to be harassed
                    with uncomfortable dreams.</p>
                <p>In dreaming, the mind for the most part carries on no intercourse through the
                    senses with surrounding objects. Touch a person gently who is asleep, and he
                    feels not the impression. You may awake him by a smart blow; but when the stroke
                    is not sufficiently violent to awake him, he remains insensible of it. We speak
                    softly beside a person asleep, without fearing that he will overhear us. His
                    eyelids are shut; and even though light should fall upon the eyeball, yet still
                    his powers of vision are not wakened to active exertion, unless the light be
                    strong enough to rouse him from sleep. He is insensible both to sweet and to
                    disagreeable smells. It is not easy to try whether his organs of taste retain
                    their activity, without awakening him; yet from analogy it may be presumed that
                    these too are inactive. With respect to the circumstances here enumerated, it is
                    indifferent whether a person be dreaming or buried in deep sleep.</p>
                <p>Yet there is one remarkable fact concerning dreaming, which may appear
                    contradictory of what has been here asserted. In dreams we are liable not only
                    to speak aloud in consequence of the suggestions of imagination, but even to get
                    up and walk about, and engage in little enterprises, without awaking. Now, as we
                    are in this instance so active, it seems that we cannot be then insensible of
                    the presence of surrounding objects. The sleep-walker is really sensible in a
                    certain degree of the presence of the objects <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193325566" xml:id="kp-eb0708-5566-0187"/>around him; but he does not
                    attend to them with all their circumstances, nor do they excite in him the same
                    sensations as if he were awake. He feels no terror on the brink of a precipice,
                    and in consequence of being free from fear, he is also without danger in such a
                    situation, unless suddenly awaked. This is one of the most inexplicable
                    phenomena of dreaming.</p>
                <p>There is also another fact not quite consonant with what has been above
                    mentioned. It is said that in sleep a person will continue to hear the noise of
                    a cataract in the neighbourhood, or regular strokes with a hammer, or any
                    similar sound sufficiently loud, and continued uninterruptedly from before the
                    time of his falling asleep. We know not whether he awakes on the sudden
                    cessation of the noise; but the fact is asserted on apparently sufficient
                    evidence, and it is curious. Even when awake, if very deeply intent on any piece
                    of study, or closely occupied in business, the sound of a clock striking in the
                    neighbourhood, or the beating of a drum, will escape us unnoticed; and it is
                    therefore the more surprising that we should thus continue sensible to sounds
                    when asleep.</p>
                <p>Not only do a person’s general character, habits of life, and state of health,
                    influence his dreams; but those concerns in which he has been most deeply
                    interested during the preceding day, and the views which have arisen most
                    frequently to his imagination, very often afford the subjects of his dreams.
                    When we look forward with anxious expectation towards any future event, we are
                    likely to dream either of the disappointment or the gratification of our wishes.
                    If we have been engaged throughout the day either in business or amusements
                    which we have found exceedingly agreeable, or in a way in which we have been
                    extremely unhappy, either our happiness or our misery is likely to be renewed in
                    our dreams.</p>
                <p>Though dreams have been regarded amongst almost all nations of the world, at some
                    periods of their history, as prophetic of future events, yet it does not appear
                    that this popular opinion has ever been established on any good grounds.
                    Christianity, indeed, teaches us to believe that the Supreme Being may, and
                    actually does, operate on our minds, and influence at times the determinations
                    of our will, without making us sensible of the restraint to which we are thus
                    subjected; and, in the same manner, no doubt, the suggestions which arise to us
                    in dreams may be produced. The imaginary transactions in which we are then
                    engaged may be such as are actually to occupy us in life; the strange and
                    seemingly incoherent appearances which are presented to the mind’s eye in our
                    dreams, may allude to some events which are to befall ourselves or others. It is
                    therefore by no means impossible, or inconsistent with the general analogy of
                    nature, that dreams should have a respect to futurity. We have no reason to
                    regard the dreams related in the Holy Scriptures as not inspired by Heaven, nor
                    to laugh at the idea of a prophetic dream as absurd or ridiculous. At the same
                    time, a mind which, during its waking hours, is filled with anxious thoughts and
                    presentiments of the future, may reproduce these forebodings in its dreams, when
                    the imagination acts over again the scenes of the past day, embellished and
                    diversified with its own peculiar colouring; and as, from the mere law of
                    probabilities, the actual result must sometimes correspond with the anticipative
                    vision, and the dream be realised by the event, the apparent prophetic
                    intimation is thus as much the consequence of natural causes and of the ordinary
                    workings of the mind, as any of the phenomena which it exhibits. To accident
                    alone is to be ascribed that correspondence which, among the uneducated or the
                    unreflecting portion of mankind, passes for divination by means of supernatural
                    agency; and though the cases where it occurs are necessarily few, com pared with
                    those in which the event falsifies the prognostications of the dreamer, yet
                    being calculated to make a much stronger impression on the mind, they are
                    remembered, whilst the others are forgotten; and hence the exception is, by a
                    natural transition, converted into the rule.</p>
                <p>Yet it would be too much to allow to dreams all that importance which has been
                    ascribed to them by the priesthood among heathens, or by the vulgar among
                    ourselves. We know how easily ignorance imposes on itself, and what arts
                    imposture adopts to impose upon others. We cannot trace any certain connection
                    between our dreams and those events to which the simplicity of the vulgar
                    pretends that they refer. And we cannot, therefore, if disposed to confine our
                    belief to certain or probable truths, join with the vulgar in believing them
                    really referrible to futurity.</p>
                <p>It appears that the brutes are also capable of dreaming. The dog is often
                    observed to start suddenly up in his sleep, in a manner which cannot be
                    accounted for in any other way than by supposing that he is roused by some
                    impulse received in a dream. The same thing is observable of others of the
                    inferior animals. That they should dream, is not an idea inconsistent with what
                    we know of their economy and manners in general. We may therefore consider it as
                    a pretty certain truth, that many, if not all, of the lower species are liable
                    to dream, as well as human beings.</p>
                <p>It appears, then, that in dreaming we are not conscious of being asleep; that to
                    a person dreaming, his dreams seem realities; that although it be uncertain
                    whether mankind are all liable to dream, yet it is well known that they are not
                    all equally liable to dream; that the nature of a person’s dreams depends in
                    some measure on his habits of action, and on the circumstances of his life; that
                    the state of the health, too, and the manner in which the vital functions are
                    carried on, have a powerful influence in determining the character of a person’s
                    dreams; that in sleep and in dreaming, the senses are either absolutely
                    inactive, or nearly so; that such concerns as we have been very deeply
                    interested in during the preceding day, are very likely to return upon onr minds
                    in dreams in the hours of rest; that dreams may be rendered prophetic of future
                    events; that therefore, wherever we have such evidence of their having been
                    prophetic as we would accept on any other occasion, we cannot reasonably reject
                    the fact on account of its absurdity; that, however, they do not appear to have
                    been actually such, in those instances in which the superstition of nations
                    ignorant of true religion has represented them as referring to futurity, nor in
                    those instances in which they are viewed in the same light by the vulgar among
                    ourselves; and, lastly, that dreaming is not a phenomenon peculiar to human
                    nature, but common to mankind with the brutes.</p>
                <p>We scarcely know of any other facts that have been fully ascertained concerning
                    dreaming. But we are by no means sufficiently acquainted with this important
                    phenomenon in the history of mind. We cannot tell by what laws of our
                    constitution we are thus liable to be so frequently engaged in imaginary
                    transactions, nor what are the particular means by which the delusion is
                    accomplished. The delusion is indeed remarkably strong. One will sometimes have
                    a book presented to him in a dream, and fancy that he reads; and actually enter
                    into the nature of the imaginary composition before him, and even remember,
                    after he awakes, what he knows that he only fancied himself reading. Can this be
                    delusion? If delusion, how or for what purposes is it produced? The mind, it
                    would appear, does not, in sleep, become inactive like the body, or at least is
                    not always inactive while we are asleep. When we do not dream, the mind must
                    either be inactive, or the connection between the mind and the body <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193325579" xml:id="kp-eb0708-5579-0188"/> must be
                    considered as in some manner suspended; and, when we dream, the mind, though it
                    probably acts in concert with the body, yet does not act in the same manner as
                    when we are awake. It seems to be clouded or bewildered, in consequence of being
                    deprived for a time of the service of the senses. Imagination becomes more
                    active and more capricious; and all the other powers, especially judgment and
                    memory, get disordered and irregular in their operation.</p>
                <p>Various theories have been proposed to explain what appears here most
                    inexplicable. Mr Baxter, in his treatise on the immateriality of the human soul,
                    endeavours to prove that dreams are produced by the agency of some spiritual
                    beings, who either amuse or employ themselves seriously in engaging mankind in
                    all those imaginary transactions with which they are employed in dreaming. This
                    theory, however, is far from being plausible. It leads us entirely beyond the
                    limits of our knowledge; it requires us to believe without evidence; it is
                    unsupported by any analogy; and it creates difficulties still more inexplicable
                    than those which it has been proposed to remove. Until it be made to appear that
                    our dreams cannot possibly be produced without the interference of spiritual
                    agents, possessing such influence over our minds as to deceive us with fancied
                    joys, and to involve us in imaginary afflictions, we cannot reasonably refer
                    them to such a cause. Besides, from the facts which have been stated as well
                    known concerning dreams, it appears that their nature depends both on the state
                    of the human body and on that of the mind. But were they owing to the agency of
                    other spiritual beings, how could they be influenced by the state of the body
                    with reference to health or sickness, fasting or repletion? They must be a
                    curious set of spiritual beings who depend in such a manner on the state of our
                    corporeal frame. Better not to allow them existence at all, than to place them
                    in such a dependence.</p>
                <p>Wolfius, and after him Formey, have supposed that dreams never arise in the mind,
                    except in consequence of some of the organs of sensation having been previously
                    excited. Either the ear or the eye, or the organs of touching, tasting, or
                    smelling, communicate information in a tacit and secret manner, and thus partly
                    rouse its faculties from the lethargy in which they are buried in sleep, and
                    engage them in a series of confused and imperfect exertions. But what passes in
                    dreams is so very different from all that we do when awake, that it is
                    impossible for the dreamer himself to distinguish whether his powers of
                    sensation perform any part on the occasion. It is not necessary that imagination
                    should be always excited by immediate sensation. Fancy, even when we are awake,
                    often wanders from the present scene. Absence of mind is incident to the
                    studious; the poet and the mathematician many times forget where they are. We
                    cannot discover from any thing that a person in dreaming displays to the
                    observation of others, that his organs of sensation take part in the imaginary
                    transactions in which he is employed. In those instances, indeed, in which
                    persons asleep are said to hear sounds, the sounds which they hear are said also
                    to influence in some manner the nature of their dreams. But such instances are
                    singular. Since then it appears that the person who dreams is himself incapable
                    of distinguishing, either during his dreams, or by recollection when awake,
                    whether any new impressions are communicated to him in that state by his organs
                    of sensation; that even by watching over him, and comparing our observations of
                    his circumstances and emotions in his dreams with what he recollects of them
                    after awaking, we cannot, except in one or two singular instances, ascertain
                    this fact; and that the mind is not wholly incapable of acting while the organs
                    of sensation are at rest, and on many occasions re fuses to listen to the
                    information which they convey; we may without hesitation conclude that the
                    theory of Wolfius and Formey has been too hastily and incautiously advanced.</p>
                <p>Other physiologists tell us that the mind when we dream is in a state of <hi
                    rend="italic">delirium.</hi> Sleep, they say, is attended with what is called a
                    collapse of the brain; during which either the whole or a part of the nerves of
                    which it consists are in a state in which they cannot carry on the usual
                    intercourse between the mind and the organs of sensation. When the whole of the
                    brain is in this state, we become entirely unconscious of existence, and the
                    mind sinks into inactivity; when only a part of the brain is collapsed, as they
                    term it, we are then neither asleep nor awake, butin a sort of delirium between
                    the two. This theory, like that last mentioned, supposes the mind incapable of
                    acting without the help of sensation; it supposes that we know the nature of a
                    state of which we cannot ascertain the phenomena; and it contradicts a
                    well-known fact, in representing dreams as confused images of things around us,
                    instead of fanciful combinations of things not existing together in nature or in
                    human life. For these reasons it must be held as wholly inadmissible.</p>
                <p>Of all the writers who have treated of this subject, however, Mr Dugald Stewart
                    is perhaps the only one who, by concentrating the lights of a sound philosophy
                    on the results of refined and accurate observation, has been enabled to classify
                    the phenomena of dreams, and to introduce the order of science into a department
                    of speculative inquiry where fancy had previously reigned paramount. “Dreams,”
                    says Mr Addison, “look like the relaxations and amusements of the soul when she
                    is disencumbered of her machine; her sports and recreations when she has laid
                    her charge asleep. The soul is clogged and retarded in her operations when she
                    acts in conjunction with a companion that is so heavy and unwieldy in its
                    motions; but in dreams she converses with numberless beings of her own creation,
                    and is transported into ten thousand scenes of her own raising. She is herself
                    the theatre, the actor, and the beholder.” This description, which is not more
                    beautiful than true, will serve to convey some idea of the difficulties of
                    disentangling mental operations necessarily so complex, and of keeping steadily
                    in view the threefold character or agency which the mind exhibits in dreaming;
                    and as the only approximation which has yet been made towards the accomplishment
                    of so interesting an object is contained in Mr Stewart’s section on the
                    application of the principles and laws of association to explain the phenomena
                    of dreaming <hi rend="italic">(Elements of the Philosophy of the Human
                    Mind,</hi> vol. i. p. 327, sixth edition, Lond. 1818, 8vo), we conceive that we
                    cannot do better than subjoin this exquisite specimen of philosophical acuteness
                    and discrimination, in the author’s own beautiful language.</p>
                <p>“With respect to the phenomena of dreaming,” says Mr Stewart, “three different
                    questions may be proposed. First, what is the state of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mind</hi> in sleep? or, in other words, what faculties then continue to
                    operate, and what faculties are then suspended? Secondly, how far do our dreams
                    appear to be influenced by our bodily sensations; and in what respects do they
                    vary, according to the different conditions of the body in health and in
                    sickness? Thirdly, what is the change which sleep produces on those parts of the
                    <hi rend="italic">body</hi> with which our mental operations are more
                    immediately connected; and how does this change operate, in diversifying, so
                    remarkably, the phenomena which our minds then exhibit, from those of which we
                    are conscious in our waking hours? Of these three questions, the first belongs
                    to the philosophy of the human mind; and it is to this question that the
                    following inquiry is almost entirely confined. The second is more
                    particularly<pb break="no" facs="nls:193325592" xml:id="kp-eb0708-5592-0189"/>
                    interesting to the medical inquirer, and does not properly fall under the plan
                    of this work. The third seems to me to relate to a subject which is placed
                    beyond the reach of the human faculties.</p>
                <p>“It will be granted, that, if we could ascertain the state of the mind in sleep,
                    so as to be able to resolve the various phenomena of dreaming into a smaller
                    number of general principles; and still more, if we could resolve them into one
                    general fact; we should be advanced a very important step in our inquiries upon
                    this subject; even although we should find it impossible to show in what manner
                    this change in the state of the mind results from the change which sleep
                    produces in the state of the body. Such a step would at least gratify, to a
                    certain extent, that disposition of our nature which prompts us to ascend from
                    particular facts to general laws, and which is the foundation of all our
                    philosophical researches; and, in the present instance, I am inclined to think
                    that it carries us as far as our imperfect faculties enable us to proceed.</p>
                <p>“In conducting this inquiry with respect to the state of the mind in sleep, it
                    seems reasonable to expect, that some light may be obtained from an examination
                    of the circumstances which accelerate or retard its approach; for when we are
                    disposed to rest, it is natural to imagine that the state of the mind approaches
                    to its state in sleep more nearly than when we feel ourselves alive and active,
                    and capable of applying all our various faculties to their proper purposes.</p>
                <p>“In general, it may be remarked, that the approach of sleep is accelerated by
                    every circumstance which diminishes or suspends the exercise of the mental
                    powers, and is retarded by every thing which has a contrary tendency. When we
                    wish for sleep, we naturally endeavour to withhold, as much as possible, all the
                    active exertions of the mind, by disengaging our attention from every
                    interesting subject of thought. When we are disposed to keep awake, we naturally
                    fix our attention on some subject which is calculated to afford employment to
                    our intellectual powers, or to rouse and exercise the active principles of our
                    nature.</p>
                <p>“It is well known that there is a particular class of sounds which compose us to
                    sleep. The hum of bees, the murmur of a fountain, the reading of an
                    uninteresting discourse, have this tendency in a remarkable degree. If we
                    examine this class of sounds, we shall find that it consists wholly of such as
                    are fitted to withdraw the attention of the mind from its own thoughts; and are,
                    at the same time, not sufficiently interesting to engage its attention to
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>“It is also matter of common observation, that children, and persons of little
                    reflexion, who are chiefly occupied about sensible objects, and whose mental
                    activity is in a great measure suspended as soon as their perceptive powers are
                    unemployed, find it extremely difficult to continue awake when they are deprived
                    of their usual engagements. The same thing has been remarked of savages, whose
                    time, like that of the lower animals, is almost completely divided between sleep
                    and their bodily exertions.</p>
                <p>“From a consideration of these facts, it seems reasonable to conclude, that in
                    sleep those operations of the mind are suspended which depend on our volition;
                    for if it be certain, that before we fall asleep, we must withhold, as much as
                    we are able, the exercise of all our different powers, it is scarcely to be
                    imagined that, as soon as sleep commences, these powers should again begin to be
                    exerted. The more probable conclusion is, that when we are desirous to procure
                    sleep, we bring both mind and body as nearly as we can into that state in which
                    they are to continue after sleep commences. The difference, therefore, between
                    the state of mind when we are inviting sleep, and when we are actually asleep,
                    is this, that in the former case, although its active exertions be suspended, we
                    can renew them if we please. In the other case, the will loses its influence
                    over all our powers both of mind and body, in consequence of some physical
                    alteration in the system, which we shall never probably be able to explain.</p>
                <p>“In order to illustrate this conclusion a little farther, it may be proper to
                    remark, that if the suspension of our voluntary operations in sleep be admitted
                    as a fact, there are only two suppositions which can be formed concerning its
                    cause. The one is, that the power of volition is suspended; the other, that the
                    will loses its influence over those faculties of the mind, and those members of
                    the body, which, during our waking hours, are subjected to its authority. If it
                    can be shown then that the former supposition is not agreeable to fact, the
                    truth of the latter seems to follow as a necessary consequence.</p>
                <p>“1. That the power of volition is not suspended during sleep, appears from the
                    efforts which we are conscious of making while in that situation. We dream, for
                    example, that we are in danger, and we attempt to call out for assistance. The
                    attempt indeed is in general unsuccessful, and the sounds which we emit are
                    feeble and indistinct; but this only confirms, or rather is a necessary
                    consequence of the supposition that, in sleep, the connexion between the will
                    and our voluntary operations is disturb-, ed or interrupted. The continuance of
                    the power of volition is demonstrated by the effort, however ineffectual.</p>
                <p>“In like manner, in the course of an alarming dream, we are sometimes conscious
                    of making an exertion to save ourselves, by flight, from an apprehended danger;
                    but in spite of all our efforts we continue in bed. In such cases we commonly
                    dream that we are attempting to escape, and are prevented by some external
                    obstacle; but the fact seems to be, that the body is at that time not subject to
                    the will. During the disturbed rest which we sometimes have when the body is
                    indisposed, the mind appears to retain some power over it; but as, even in these
                    cases, the motions which are made consist rather of a general agitation of the
                    whole system, than of the regular exertion of a particular member of it, with a
                    view to produce a certain effect, it is reasonable to conclude that, in
                    perfectly sound sleep, the mind, although it retains the power of volition,
                    retains no influence whatever over the bodily organs.</p>
                <p>“In that particular condition of the system which is known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">incubus, we are</hi> conscious of a total want of power over the
                    body; and I believe the common opinion is, that it is this want of power which
                    distinguishes the <hi rend="italic">incubus</hi> from all the other
                    modifications of sleep. But the more probable supposition seems to be, that
                    every species of sleep is accompanied with a suspension of the faculty of
                    voluntary motion; and that the <hi rend="italic">incubus</hi> has nothing
                    peculiar in it but this, that the uneasy sensations which are produced by the
                    accidental posture of the body, and which we find it impossible to remove by our
                    own efforts, render us distinctly conscious of our incapacity to move. One thing
                    is certain, that the instant of our awaking, and of our recovering the command
                    of our bodily organs, is one and the same.</p>
                <p>“2. The same conclusion is confirmed by a different view of the subject. It is
                    probable, as was already observed, that when we are anxious to procure sleep,
                    the state into which we naturally bring the mind approaches to its state after
                    sleep commences. Now it is manifest that the means which nature directs us to
                    employ on such occasions, is not to suspend the power of volition, but to
                    suspend the exertion of those powers whose exercise depends on volition. If it
                    were necessary that volition should be suspended before we fall asleep, it would
                    be impossible for <pb break="no" facs="nls:193325605"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-5605-0190"/>us by our own efforts to hasten the moment of
                    rest. The very supposition of such efforts is absurd, for it implies a continued
                    will to suspend the acts of the will.</p>
                <p>“According to the foregoing doctrine with respect to the state of the mind in
                    sleep, the effect which is produced on our mental operations is strikingly
                    analogous to that which is produced on our bodily powers. From the observations
                    which have been already made, it is manifest that in sleep the body is, in a
                    very inconsiderable degree, if at all, subject to our command. The vital and
                    involuntary motions, however, suffer no interruption, but go on as when we are
                    awake, in consequence of the operation of some cause unknown to us. In.like
                    manner, it would appear that those operations of the mind which depend on our
                    volition are suspended, while certain other operations are at least occasionally
                    carried on. This analogy naturally suggests the idea that <hi rend="italic"
                    >all</hi> our mental operations which arc independent of our will may continue
                    during sleep, and that the phenomena of dreaming may perhaps be produced by
                    these, diversified in their apparent effects, in consequence of the suspension
                    of our voluntary powers.</p>
                <p>“If the appearances which the mind exhibits during sleep are found to be
                    explicable on this general principle, it will possess all the evidence which the
                    nature of the subject admits of.</p>
                <p>“It was formerly shown that the train of thought in the mind does not depend <hi
                    rend="italic">immediately</hi> on our will, but is regulated by certain general
                    laws of association. At the same time it appeared, that among the various
                    subjects which thus spontaneously present themselves to our notice, we have the
                    power of singling out any one that we chuse to consider, and of making it a
                    particular object of attention; and that by doing so we not only can stop the
                    train that would otherwise have succeeded, but frequently can divert the current
                    of our thoughts into a new channel. It also appeared that we have a power (which
                    may be much improved by exercise) of recalling past occurrences to the memory by
                    a voluntary effort of recollection.</p>
                <p>“The <hi rend="italic">indirect</hi> influence which the mind thus possesses over
                    the train of its thoughts is so great, that during the tvhole time we are awake,
                    excepting in those cases in which we fall into what is called a reverie, and
                    suffer our thoughts to follow their natural course, the order of their
                    succession is always regulated more or less by the will. The will, indeed, in
                    regulating the train of thought, can operate only (as I already showed) by
                    availing itself of the established laws of association; but still it has the
                    power of rendering this train very different from what it would have been if
                    these laws had taken place without its interference.</p>
                <p>“From these principles, combined with the general fact which I have endeavoured
                    to establish with respect to the state of the mind in sleep, two obvious
                    consequences follow. First, that when we are in this situation, the succession
                    of our thoughts, in so far as it depends on the laws of association, may be
                    carried on by the operation of the same unknown causes by which it is produced
                    while we are awake; and, secondly, that the order of our thoughts in these two
                    states of the mind must be very different; inasmuch as in the one it depends
                    solely on the laws of association; and in the other, on these laws combined with
                    our own voluntary exertions.</p>
                <p>“In order to ascertain how far these conclusions are agreeable to truth, it is
                    necessary to compare them with the known phenomena of dreaming; for which
                    purpose 1 shall endeavour to show, first, that the succession of our thoughts in
                    sleep is regulated by the same general laws of association to which it is
                    subjected while we are awake; and, secondly, that the circumstances which
                    discriminate dreaming from our waking thoughts are such as must necessarily
                    arise from the suspension of the influence of the will.</p>
                <p>“I. That the succession of our thoughts in sleep is regulated by the same general
                    laws of association which influence the mind while we are awake, appears from
                    the following considerations.</p>
                <p>“1. Our dreams are frequently suggested to us by bodily sensations; and with
                    these it is well known, from what we experience while awake, that particular
                    ideas are frequently very strongly associated. I have been told by a friend,
                    that having occasion, in consequence of an indisposition, to apply a bottle of
                    hot water to his feet when he went to bed, he dreamed that he was making a
                    journey to the top of Mount Aetna, and that he found the heat of the ground
                    almost insupportable. Another person, having a blister applied to his head,
                    dreamed that he was scalped by a party of Indians. I believe every one who is in
                    the habit of dreaming will recollect instances, in his own case, of a similar
                    nature.</p>
                <p>“2. Our dreams are influenced by the prevailing temper of the mind, and vary in
                    their complexion according as our habitual disposition at the time inclines us
                    to cheerfulness or to melancholy. Not that this observation holds without
                    exception; but it holds so generally, as must convince us that the state of our
                    spirits has some effect on our dreams as well as on our waking thoughts. Indeed,
                    in the latter case, no less than in the former, this effect may be counteracted
                    or modified by various other circumstances.</p>
                <p>“After having made a narrow escape from any alarming danger, we are apt to awake
                    in the course of our sleep with startings, imagining that we are drowning, or on
                    the brink of a precipice. A severe misfortune, which has affected the mind
                    deeply, influences our dreams in a similar way, and suggests to us a variety of
                    adventures analogous in some measure to that event from which our distress
                    arises. Such, according to Virgil, were the dreams of the forsaken Dido.</p>
                <p>“3. Our dreams are influenced by our prevailing habits of association while
                    awake.</p>
                <p>“In a former part of this work I considered the extent of that power which the
                    mind may acquire over the train of its thoughts; and I observed that those
                    intellectual diversities among men, which we commonly refer to peculiarities of
                    genius, are at least in a great measure resolvable into differences in their
                    habits of association. One man possesses a rich and beautiful fancy, which is at
                    all times obedient to his will. Another possesses a quickness of recollection,
                    which enables him at a moment’s warning to bring together all the results of his
                    past experience, and of his past reflections, which can be of use for
                    illustrating any proposed subject. A third can without effort collect his
                    attention to the most abstract questions in philosophy; can perceive at a glance
                    the shortest and the most effectual process for arriving at the truth; and can
                    banish from his mind every extraneous idea which fancy or casual association may
                    suggest to distract his thoughts or to mislead his judgment. A fourth unites all
                    these powers in a capacity of perceiving truth with an almost intuitive
                    rapidity, and in an eloquence which enables him to command at pleasure tvhatever
                    his memory and fancy can supply to illustrate and to adorn it. The occasional
                    exercise which such men make of their powers may undoubtedly be said, in one
                    sense, to be unpremeditated or unstudied; but they all indicate previous <hi
                    rend="italic">habits</hi> of meditation or study, as unquestionably as the
                    dexterity of the expert accountant, or the rapid execution of the professional
                    musician.</p>
                <p>“From what has been said, it is evident that a train of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193325618" xml:id="kp-eb0708-5618-0191"/>thought which in one man
                    would require a painful effort of study, may in another be almost spontaneous;
                    nor is it to be doubted that the reveries of studious men, even when they allow,
                    as much as they can, their thoughts to follow their own course, are more or less
                    connected together by those principles of association which their favourite
                    pursuits tend more particularly to strengthen.</p>
                <p>“The influence of the same habits may be traced distinctly in sleep. There are
                    probably few mathematicians who have not dreamed of an interesting problem, and
                    who have not even fancied that they were prosecuting the investigation of it
                    with much success. They whose ambition leads them to the study of eloquence are
                    frequently conscious, during sleep, of a renewal of their daily occupations; and
                    sometimes feel themselves possessed of a fluency of speech which they never
                    experienced before. The poet in his dreams is transported into Elysium, and
                    leaves the vulgar and unsatisfactory enjoyments of humanity, to dwell in those
                    regions of enchantment and rapture which have been created by the divine
                    imaginations of Virgil and of Tasso.</p>
                <p>“As a farther proof that the succession of our thoughts in dreaming is influenced
                    by our prevailing habits of association, it may be remarked, that the scenes and
                    occurrences which most frequently present themselves to the mind while we are
                    asleep are the scenes and occurrences of childhood and early youth. The facility
                    of association is then much greater than in more advanced years; and although
                    during the day the memory of the events thus associated may be banished by the
                    objects and pursuits which press upon our senses, it retains a more permanent
                    hold of the mind than any of our subsequent acquisitions; and, like the
                    knowledge which we possess of our mother tongue, is, as it were, interwoven and
                    incorporated with all its most essential habits. Accordingly, in old men, whose
                    thoughts are in a great measure disengaged from the world, the transactions of
                    their middle age, which once seemed so important, are often obliterated; while
                    the mind dwells, as in a dream, on the sports and the companions of their
                    infancy.</p>
                <p>“I shall only observe farther, on this head, that in our dreams, as well as when
                    awake, we occasionally make use of words as an instrument of thought. Such
                    dreams, however, do not affect the mind with such emotions of pleasure and of
                    pain, as those in which the imagination is occupied with particular objects of
                    sense. The effect of philosophical studies, in habituating the mind to the
                    almost constant employment of this instrument, and, of consequence, its effect
                    in weakening the imagination, was formerly remarked. If I am not mistaken, the
                    influence of these circumstances may also be traced in the history of our
                    dreams, which in youth commonly involve in a much greater degree the exercise of
                    imagination, and affect the mind with much more powerful emotions, than when we
                    begin to employ our maturer faculties in more general and abstract
                    speculations.</p>
                <p>“II. From these different observations we are authorized to conclude, that the
                    same laws of association which regulate the train of our thoughts while we are
                    awake, continue to operate during sleep. I now proceed to consider how far the
                    circumstances which discriminate dreaming from our waking thoughts, correspond
                    with those which might be expected to result from the suspension of the
                    influence of the will.</p>
                <p>“1. If the influence of the will be suspended during sleep, all our voluntary
                    operations, such as recollection, reasoning, &amp;c. must also be suspended.</p>
                <p>“That this really is the case, the extravagance and inconsistency of our dreams
                    are sufficient proofs. We frequently confound together times and places the most
                    remote from each other; and, in the course of the same dream, conceive the same
                    person as existing in different parts of the world. Sometimes we imagine
                    ourselves conversing with a dead friend, without remembering the circumstance of
                    his death, although perhaps it happened but a few days before, and affected us
                    deeply. All this proves clearly that the subjects which then occupy our thoughts
                    are such as present themselves to the mind spontaneously, and that we have no
                    power of employing our reason in comparing together the different parts of our
                    dreams, or even of exerting an act of recollection, in order to ascertain how
                    far they are consistent and possible.</p>
                <p>“The processes of reasoning in which we sometimes fancy ourselves to be engaged
                    during sleep, furnish no exception to the foregoing observation; for although
                    every process, the first time we form it, implies volition, and, in particular,
                    implies a recollection of the premises till we arrive at the conclusion, yet
                    when a number of truthshave been often presented to us as necessarily connected
                    with each other, this series may afterwards pass through the mind according to
                    the laws of association, without any more activity on our part than in those
                    trains of thought which are the most loose and incoherent. Nor is this mere
                    theory. I may venture to appeal to the consciousness of every man accustomed to
                    dream, whether his reasonings during sleep do not seem to be carried on without
                    any exertion of his will, and with a degree of facility of which he was never
                    conscious while awake. Mr Addison, in one of his Spectators, has made this
                    observation; and his testimony, in the present instance, is of the greater
                    weight, that he had no particular theory on the subject to support. ‘ There is
                    not,’ says he, ‘ a more painful action of the mind than invention, yet in dreams
                    it works with that ease and activity that we are not sensible when the faculty
                    is employed. For instance, I believe every one, some time or other, dreams that
                    he is reading papers, books, or letters; in which case the invention prompts so
                    readily, that the mind is imposed on, and mistakes its own suggestions for the
                    composition of another.’ No. 4S7.</p>
                <p>“2. If the influence of the will during sleep be suspended, the mind will remain
                    as passive, while its thoughts change from one subject to another, as it does
                    during our waking hours, while different perceptible objects are presented to
                    our senses.</p>
                <p>“Of this passive state of the mind in our dreams it is unnecessary to multiply
                    proofs, as it has always been considered as one of the most extraordinary
                    circumstances with which they are accompanied. If our dreams as well as our
                    waking thoughts were subject to the will, is it not natural to conclude, that in
                    the one case, as well as in the other, we w ould endeavour to banish, as much as
                    we could, every idea which had a tendency to disturb us, and detain those only
                    which we found to be agreeable? So far, however, is this power over our thoughts
                    from being exercised, that we are frequently oppressed, in spite of all our
                    efforts to the contrary, with dreams which affect us with the most painful
                    emotions. And, indeed, it is matter of vulgar remark, that our dreams are, in
                    every case, involuntary on our part, and that they appear to be obtruded on us
                    by some external cause. This fact appeared so unaccountable to the late Mr
                    Baxter, that it gave rise to his very whimsical theory, in which he ascribes
                    dreams to the immediate influence of separate spirits on the mind.</p>
                <p>“3. If the influence of the will be suspended during sleep, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >conceptions</hi> which we then form of sensible objects will be attended with a
                    belief of their real existence, as much as the <hi rend="italic">perception</hi>
                    of the same objects is while we are awake.</p>
                <p>“In treating of the power of Conception, I formerly observed, that our belief of
                    the separate and independent <pb break="no" facs="nls:193325631"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-5631-0192"/>existence of the objects of our perceptions, is
                    the result of experience; which teaches us, that these perceptions do not depend
                    on our will. If I open my eyes, I cannot prevent myself from seeing the prospect
                    before me. The case is different with respect to our conceptions. While they
                    occupy the mind, to the exclusion of every thing else, I endeavoured to shew
                    that they are always accompanied with belief; but as we can banish them from the
                    mind, during our waking hours, at pleasure, and as the momentary belief which
                    they produce is continually checked by the surrounding objects of our
                    perceptions, we learn to consider them as fictions of our own creation, and,
                    excepting in some accidental cases, pay no regard to them in the conduct of
                    life. If the doctrine, however, formerly stated with respect to conception be
                    just, and if, at the same time, it be allowed that sleep suspends the influence
                    of the will over the train of our thoughts, we should naturally be led to
                    expect, that the same belief which accompanies perception while we are awake,
                    should accompany the conceptions which occur to us in our dreams. It is scarcely
                    necessary for me to remark, how strikingly this conclusion coincides with
                    acknowledged facts.</p>
                <p>“May it not be considered as some confirmation of the foregoing doctrine, that
                    when opium fails in producing complete sleep, it commonly produces <hi
                    rend="italic">one</hi> of the effects of sleep, by suspending the activity of
                    the mind, and throwing it into a reverie; and that while we are in this state,
                    our conceptions frequently affect us nearly in the same manner as if the objects
                    conceived were present to our senses?</p>
                <p>“Another circumstance with respect to our conceptions during sleep deserves our
                    notice. As the subjects which we then think upon occupy the mind exclusively,
                    and as the attention is not diverted by the objects of our external senses, our
                    conceptions must be proportionably lively and steady. Every person knows how
                    faint the conception is which we form of any thing with our eyes open, in
                    comparison of what we can form with our eyes shut; and that in proportion as we
                    can suspend the exercise of all our other senses, the liveliness of our
                    conception increases. To this cause is to be ascribed, in part, the effect which
                    the dread of spirits in the dark has on some persons who are fully convinced in
                    speculation that their apprehensions are groundless; and to this also is owing
                    the effect of any accidental perception in giving them a momentary relief from
                    their terrors. Hence the remedy which nature points out to us when we find
                    ourselves overpowered by imagination. If every thing around us be silent, we
                    endeavour to create a noise by speaking aloud or beating with our feet; that is,
                    we strive to divert the attention from the subjects of our imagination by
                    presenting an object to our powers of perception. The conclusion which I draw
                    from these observations is, that as there is no state of the body in which our
                    perceptive powers are so totally unemployed as in sleep, it is natural to think
                    that the objects which we conceive or imagine must then make an impression on
                    the mind beyond comparison greater than any thing of which we can have
                    experience while awake.</p>
                <p>“From these principles may be derived a simple, and, I think, a satisfactory
                    explanation of what some writers have represented as the most mysterious of all
                    the circumstances connected with dreaming; the inaccurate estimates we are apt
                    to form of time while we are thus employed—an inaccuracy which sometimes extends
                    so far as to give to a single instant the appearance of hours, or perhaps of
                    days. A sudden noise, for example, suggests a dream connected with that
                    perception; and the moment afterwards this noise has the effect of awaking us;
                    and yet during that momentary interval a long series of circumstances has passed
                    before the imagination. The story quoted by Mr Addison <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Spectator,</hi> No. 94) from the Turkish Tales, of the miracle wrought by a
                    Mahometan doctor to convince an infidel sultan, is in such cases nearly
                    verified.</p>
                <p>“The facts I allude to at present are generally explained by supposing that, in
                    our dreams, the rapidity of thought is greater than while we are awake; but
                    there is no necessity for having recourse to such a supposition. The rapidity of
                    thought is at all thpes such, that in the twinkling of an eye, a crowd of ideas
                    may pass before us to which it would require a long discourse to give utterance;
                    and transactions may be conceived which it would require days to realize. But in
                    sleep the conceptions of the mind are mistaken for realities; and therefore our
                    estimates of time will be formed, not according to our experience of the
                    rapidity of thought, but according to our experience of the time requisite for
                    realizing what we conceive. Something perfectly analogous to this may be
                    remarked in the perceptions we obtain by the sense of sight. When I look into a
                    show-box, where the deception is imperfect, I see only a set of paltry daubings
                    of a few inches diameter; but if the representation be executed with so much
                    skill as to convey to me the idea of a distant prospect, every object before me
                    swells in its dimensions, in proportion to the extent of space which I conceive
                    it to occupy; and what seemed before to be shut up within the limits of a small
                    wooden frame, is magnified, in my apprehension, to an immense landscape of
                    woods, rivers, and mountains.</p>
                <p>“The phenomena which we have hitherto explained take place when sleep seems to be
                    complete; that is, when the mind loses its influence over <hi rend="italic"
                    >all</hi> those powers whose exercise depends on its will. There are, however,
                    many cases in which sleep seems to be partial; that is, when the mind loses its
                    influence over <hi rend="italic">some</hi> powers, and retains it over others.
                    In the case of the <hi rend="italic">somnambuli,</hi> it retains its power over
                    the limbs, but it possesses no influence over its own thoughts, and scarcely any
                    over the body, excepting those particular members of it which are employed in
                    walking. In madness, the power of the will over the body remains undiminished,
                    while its influence in regulating the train of thought is in a great measure
                    suspended, either in consequence of a particular idea, which engrosses the
                    attention, to the exclusion of every thing else, and which we find it impossible
                    to banish by our efforts, or in consequence of our thoughts succeeding each
                    other with such rapidity that we are unable to stop the train. In both of these
                    kinds of madness, it is worthy of remark, that the conceptions or imaginations
                    of the mind becoming independent of our will, they are apt to be mistaken for
                    actual perceptions, and to affect us in the same manner.”</p>
                <p>Some very beautiful fables have been written both by ancients and moderns in the
                    form of dreams. The <hi rend="italic">Somnium Scipionis,</hi> for instance, is
                    perhaps one of the finest of Cicero’s compositions. He who shall carefully
                    peruse this piece, with Macrobius’s commentary thereupon, will undoubtedly
                    acquire a considerable knowledge of ancient philosophy. In the periodical
                    publications which early diffused so much elegant and useful knowledge
                    throughout Britain, the Tatlers, Spectators, Guardians, and the like, we find a
                    number of excellent dreams. Addison excelled in this line of writing; his Vision
                    of Mirza is a masterpiece of its kind. But the public are now less partial to
                    this species of composition than they formerly were: writings purely
                    imaginative, having ceased to be relished, are no longer produced.</p>
