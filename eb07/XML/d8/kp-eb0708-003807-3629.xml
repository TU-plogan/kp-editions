                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    public register, wherein were written the names of the consuls and other
                    magistrates, among the heathens; and of bishops, and defunct as well as
                    surviving brethren, among the Christians.</p>

                    in four or five leaves. An ingenious author imagines this name to have been
                    first given them in order to distinguish these leaves from the books which were
                    rolled, and hence called <hi rend="italic">volumina.</hi></p>
                <p>It is certain there were profane diptycha in the Greek empire, as well as sacred
                    ones in the Greek church. The former were the matricula or registers, wherein
                    the names of the magistrates were entered; in which sense diptycha is a term in
                    the Greek chancery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sacred</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Diptycha.</hi> The word
                    is plural; diptycha being a double catalogue, in one part of which were written
                    the names of the living, and in the other those of the dead, which were to be
                    rehearsed during the office. We meet <pb break="no" facs="nls:193323642"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-3642-0039"/> with something not unlike the sacred diptycha of
                    the Greeks in the canon of the mass according to the Latin , usage, where the
                    people are enjoined to pray once for the living and once for the dead, and where
                    several saints are invoked in different times. In such diptycha were entered the
                    names of bishops, who had governed their flock aright; and these were never
                    expunged, unless they were convicted of heresy or some other gross crime. In the
                    diptycha were likewise entered the names of such as had done any signal service
                    to the church, whether they were living or dead; and mention was made of them in
                    the celebration of the liturgy.</p>
                <p>Casaubon, in his observations on Athenaeus (lib. vi. cap. 14), supposes the
                    Christians to have borrowed the custom of writing names in a book, and
                    rehearsing them at mass, from the heathens, who entered the names of persons to
                    whom they wished to do any signal honour, in the verses of the Salii, as was
                    done in the case of Germanicus and ‘Verus, sons of the emperor Marcus Aurelius,
                    and a long time before, during the age of the republic; in that of Mamercus
                    Veturius and Lucia Volumnia, as we are told by Tacitus, Spartian, Ovid, Festus,
                    Plutarch, and others. But Rosweyd does not approve of this notion of Casaubon;
                    and the pretended St Dionysius, a very ancient author, asserts that this usage
                    was originally founded on Scripture (2 Tim. ii. 19; Psal. cxvi. 15). Rosweydadds
                    Ecclesiasticus (xliv. 1), and takes these to have been the passages the ancient
                    church had a view to, rather than the Sal inn verses.</p>
                <p>The profane diptycha were frequently sent as presents to princes and others, on
                    which occasions they were finely gilded and embellished; as appears from
                    Symmachus (lib. ii. ep. 81). Those presented were usually of ivory. The first
                    law, <hi rend="italic">De Expens.</hi><hi rend="italic">Ludor,</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">C. Theod.</hi> forbids all magistrates below the rank of consuls
                    to make presents of diptycha of ivory in the public ceremonies.</p>
