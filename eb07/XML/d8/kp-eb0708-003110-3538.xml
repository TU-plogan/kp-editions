                <p><label type="entry">DIMSDALE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi></label>, Baron,
                    greatly distinguished by his practice of inoculation for the small-pox, was the
                    son of a surgeon and apothecary at Theydon-Gernon, in Essex, and was born in the
                    year 1712. His family belonged to the society of Quakers; and his grandfather
                    accompanied William Penn to America, but soon afterwards returned and settled in
                    his native village. Thomas was brought up to his profession, first under his
                    father, and afterwards in St Thomas Hospital, London. He commenced his practice
                    at Hertford about 1734, and married the only daughter of Nathaniel Brassey, of
                    Roxford, near that town, an eminent banker in London, and representative of
                    Hertford in four successive parliaments. But this lady died in 1744, leaving no
                    children. To relieve his mind under the loss of his wife, he voluntarily offered
                    his assistance to the physicians and surgeons in the army under the Duke of
                    Cumberland, and continued with it until after the surrender of Carlisle to the
                    king’s forces, when he received the duke’s thanks, and returned to Hertford. In
                    1746 lie married Anne Iles, a relation of his first wife, and by her fortune,
                    and that which he had acquired by the death of the widow of Sir John Dimsdale of
                    Hertford, he retired from practice; but his family becoming numerous, and seven
                    of his ten children being living, he resumed it, and took the degree of doctor
                    of medicine in 1761. Having fully satisfied himself concerning the new method of
                    treating persons under inoculation for the small-pox, he published his treatise
                    on this subject in 1776, and it was soon circulated all over the Continent, and
                    translated into all the modem languages, not excepting the Russian. He <pb

                    saying that, “although the whole process may have some share in the success, it,
                    in my opinion, consists chiefly in the method of inoculating with recent fluid
                    matter, and the management of the patients at the time of eruption.” This proof
                    of his professional knowledge occasioned his being invited to inoculate the
                    Empress Catherine and her son in 1768, of which he gives a particular account in
                    his Tracts on Innoculation, 1781. His reward for this was an appointment of
                    actual counsellor of state and physician to her imperial majesty, with an
                    annuity of L.500; the rank of a baron of the Russian empire, to be borne by his
                    eldest lawful descendant in succession, and a black wing of the Russian eagle in
                    a gold shield in the middle of his arms, with the customary helmet, adorned with
                    the baron’s coronet, over the shield: he also received immediately L.10,000, and
                    L.2000 for travelling charges, besides miniature pictures of the empress and her
                    son, and the same title to his son, to whom the grand duke gave a gold
                    snuff-box, richly set with diamonds. The baron inoculated numbers of people at
                    Moscow; and, resisting the empress’s invitation to reside as her physician in
                    Russia, he and his son were admitted to a private audience of Frederick II. king
                    of Prussia, at Sans Souci, and thence returned to England. In 1779 he lost his
                    second wife, who left him seven children. But he afterwards married Elizabeth,
                    daughter of William Dimsdale of Bishops-Stortford, who survived him. He was
                    elected representative of the borough of Hertford in 1780; and declined all
                    practice, except for the relief of the poor. He went to Russia once more in
                    1781, in order to inoculate the late emperor and his brother Constantine, sons
                    of the grand duke; and as he passed through Brussels, the Emperor Joseph
                    received him in private, and wrote in his presence a letter, which he was to
                    convey to the Empress of Russia. In 1790, his son, Baron Nathaniel, was elected
                    member for the borough of Hertford, on his resignation and retirement to Bath
                    for several winters; but at last he fixed altogether at Hertford, and died, at
                    the age of eighty-nine, on the 30th December 1800, after an illness of about
                    three weeks. About seventeen years before his death he felt the sight of one eye
                    declining, having before lost that of the other, but recovered both by the
                    operation of the cataract, by Wenzel.</p>
