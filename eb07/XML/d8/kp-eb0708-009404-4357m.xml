                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    and theoretical optician of the highest celebrity, the discoverer of the laws of
                    the dispersion of light, and inventor of the achromatic telescope, descended
                    from a family of French refugees, was born in London on the 10th June 1706.</p>
                <p>His first destination was the manufactory which afforded employment to the
                    greater part of the French colony established in Spittaifields, and he passed
                    some of his earlier years in the mechanical labour of a silk-weaver. He was,
                    however, always attached to the mathematics and to natural philosophy, and he
                    even extended his studies to the outlines of anatomy and of scholastic divinity;
                    and in the pursuit of these objects he found himself obliged to acquire a
                    competent knowledge of the Latin and Greek languages, a task which was much
                    facilitated to him by the possession of a memory no less retentive than his
                    observation was accurate and his reasoning correct. He married early, and he
                    continued in his first occupation till he had established his eldest son, Peter
                    Dollond, who inherited his own tastes as an optical instrument maker; and the
                    success of the undertaking was such as to induce him, in 1752, to leave his own
                    business, and to enter into partnership with his son in Vine Court.</p>
                <p>These arrangements having taken place, it was not long before Mr Dollond
                    communicated to the Royal Society some of the results of the application of his
                    inventive powers to his new pursuits; and Mr Short, who then enjoyed the highest
                    reputation as an optician, paid him the compliment of bringing them forward to
                    the Society under the auspices of his name.</p>

                    glasses, as calculated for correcting, either wholly or in great measure, the
                    errors of refraction arising from the dispersion of the different colours, as
                    well as from the spherical form of the surfaces of the eye-glasses; appealing to
                    the superiority of the telescopes which he had thus constructed, to those which
                    had before been in use; but he reserves a more ample detail of the theory for a
                    future occasion, which, however, does not appear to have presented itself, the
                    improvement having been superseded by others incomparably more important.</p>

                    experiments of Newton are treated in Mr Dollond’s letter: “It is somewhat
                    strange,” he says, “that any body now-a-days should attempt to do that which so
                    long ago has been demonstrated impossible.” But although the investigation of
                    truth was perhaps in this instance retarded, yet its ultimate discovery was not
                    prevented by a just deference to a high authority. Euler was, however, certainly
                    right in considering the law which he had assumed as sufficiently compatible
                    with the results of Newton’s experiments: although he was much mistaken in bis

                    object-glass, with a scale for determining the distance of the images, by
                    measuring the linear displacement of the two portions of the glass, which
                    subtends the same angle from the focus of parallel rays, as the actual distance
                    of the images does from the object-glass. The apparatus is recommended as
                    particularly calculated to be applied to a reflecting telescope, and was
                    afterwards adapted by Mr Peter Dollond to the improved achromatic telescopes. Mr
                    Savery and Mr Bouguer had before used two separate lenses in a manner nearly
                    similar; bût the employment of a single glass divided affords a much more
                    convenient arrangement.</p>

                    accurate experiments, by which the author had undertaken to investigate the
                    foundations of the Newtonian theory of refraction; though he began them without
                    any hope of a success so brilliant as that which ultimately crowned his
                    labours.</p>
                <p>It was in the beginning of 1757 that Mr Dollond made the decisive experiment of
                    putting a common prism of glass into a prismatic vessel of water, and varying
                    the angle of the vessel till the mean refraction of the glass was compensated;
                    when he found that the colours were by no means destroyed, as they were supposed
                    to have been in a similar experiment related by Newton; for the remaining
                    dispersion was nearly as great as that of a prism of glass of half the
                    refracting angle. Mr Dollond then employed a thinner wedge of glass, and found
                    that the image was colourless when the refraction of the water was about one
                    fourth greater than that of the glass. He next attempted to make compound
                    object-glasses by inclosing water between two lenses; but in this arrangement he
                    found great inconvenience from the spherical aberration; so that he was obliged
                    to try the effects of different kinds of glass, and he fortunately discovered
                    that the refractions of flint and crown glass were extremely convenient for his
                    purpose, the image afforded by them being colourless when the angles were to
                    each other nearly as two to three; and hence he inferred that a convex lens of
                    crown glass and a convex one of flint would produce a colourless image when
                    their focal distances were in the Same proportion. The spherical aberration,
                    where the curvature was so considerable, still produced some inconvenience; but
                    having four surfaces capable of variation, he was enabled to make the
                    aberrations of the two lenses equal; and since they were in opposite directions,
                    they thus corrected each other. All these arrangements required great accuracy
                    of execution for their complete success; but, in the hands of the inventor, they
                    produced the most admirable instruments, and he was singularly fortunate in
                    obtaining a quantity of glass of more uniform density than has been since
                    manufactured on so large a scale. He afterwards made some small Galilean
                    telescopes with triple objectglasses, and Mr Peter Dollond applied this
                    construction to the longer telescopes with compound eye-pieces, the alteration
                    rendering the spherical aberration still more manageable.</p>
                <p>The merits of Mr Dollond’s inventions were promptly acknowledged on the part of
                    the Royal Society by the adjudication of the Copleyan medal for the year. In
                    1761, he was appointed optician to the king, and was elected a fellow of the
                    Royal Society; a distinction which is often obtained on easy terms by those
                    whose situation in life exempts them from the suspicion of seeking it for any
                    purpose degrading to science, but which is generally an object of considerable
                    ambition to persons of mechanical or commercial occupations.</p>
                <p>A considerable share of the credit due to Mr Dollond’s discoveries has been very
                    erroneously attributed by some late historians and biographers on the Continent
                    to Leonard Euler, a mathematician who most assuredly has little need of the
                    appropriation of the merits of others to establish his claim to immortality. But
                    in fact the only idea of Euler that could be said to have furnished any hint to
                    Mr Dollond, has been shown by the calculations of Dr Maskelyne, and by the
                    experiments of Dr Thomas Young and Dr Wollaston, to have been completely
                    erroneous; nor did Euler even admit the accuracy of Mr Dollond’s conclusions
                    after his discovery was made, without considerable hesitation and scepticism. Mr
                    Klingenstierna had simply expressed a doubt with respect to the result of
                    Newton’s experiments, though he by no means suspected the extent of the error.
                    Mr Peter Dollond has sufficiently vindicated his father’s claim to complete
                    originality, in a paper read to the Royal Society in the year 1789; he has also
                    suggested an explanation of the origin of Newton’s mistake, by stating that
                    there exists a kind of Venetian glass, of which the dispersive power little
                    exceeds that of water, whilst its specific gravity nearly approaches to 2∙58,
                    which is assigned by Newton to glass in general; and it certainly seems more
                    probable that some such circumstance as this was the cause of the error, than
                    that Newton should, as some have suspected, have mixed acetate of lead with the
                    water which he used, for an experiment which was so much more likely to be
                    satisfactory without it.</p>
                <p>Mr Dollond’s appearance was somewhat stern, and his language was impressive, but
                    his manners were cheerful and affable. He was in the habit of attending
                    regularly, along with his family, the service of the French Protestant church.
                    He constantly sought his chief amusement in objects connected with the study of
                    those sciences which he had so much contributed to improve. Perhaps, indeed, he
                    pursued them with an application somewhat too intense; for on the 30th of
                    November, as he was reading a new work of Clairaut on the theory of the moon,
                    which had occupied his whole attention for several hours, he had an attack of
                    apoplexy, which shortly became fatal. He left two sons and three daughters. His
                    sons succeeded to his business; and the younger dying a few years afterwards,
                    his place was filled by a nephew, who assumed the family name, and who still
                    conducts the establishment with undiminished respectability and success.
