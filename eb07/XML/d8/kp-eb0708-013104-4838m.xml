                <p><label type="entry">DOWN</label>, a county in the eastern part of the province of
                    Ulster, in Ireland, is bounded on the north by the county of Antrim and
                    Carrickfergus Bay, on the east by the Northern Channel and the Irish Şea, on the
                    south by the same sea, and on the west by the county of Armagh. It measures, in
                    its greatest length, from Cranfield Point in the south to Gray Point in the
                    north, fifty-one miles, and in breadth, from the junction of the Newry Canal
                    with the Bann near Portadoun, to Ballyhalbert Point in the Ardes, forty miles,
                    comprehending an area of 611,404 acres, or 955 square miles, of which 502,677
                    acres are, cultivable, 108,569 are mountain and bog, and 158 are covered with
                    water.</p>
                <p>This county was anciently inhabited by the tribes of the Vínderii and voluntii.
                    After the arrival of the English, who early formed a settlement here under the
                    guidance of the celebrated John de Courcey, the principal families were a branch
                    of the Oheils, distinguished by the name of Clatmeboy, the M‘Guinnesses, and the
                    M‘Artanè, of Irish descent, and the Whites and Savages, descendants of the
                    English settlers. Queen Elizabeth made it shire ground, but at what particular
                    period of her reign has not been precisely ascertained. It is now divided into
                    the eight baronies of Ardes, Castlereagh, Dufferin, Upper Iveagh, Lower Iveagh,
                    Kinalearty, Lecale, and Mourne, and the lordship of Newry. These are again
                    subdivided into fifty-seven parishes, and five parts of parishes, the remainders
                    of which are in some of the adjoining counties.</p>
                <p>According to the ecclesiastical arrangements of Ireland, the county comprises the
                    diocese of Down, the greater part of that of Dromore, and the lordship of Newry.
                    The former of these dioceses contains forty-nine parishes, consolidated into
                    thirty-four benefices, having thirty-one churches. The cathedral was fixed at
                    Downpatrick by James I., with a chapter consisting of a dean, four dignitaries,
                    and three prebendaries; but in consequence of its subsequent decayed state,
                    Charles II. erected the church of Lisburn into the cathedral of the united
                    dioceses of Down and Connor. The part of Dromore diocese included in this county
                    contains 21 parishes. Its cathedral is in the town of Dromore; also within the
                    same limits, and near it, is the bishop’s palace. The lordship of Newry is
                    exempt from episcopal jurisdiction, a privilege which it enjoys from having
                    appertained to a monastery before the reformation. The proprietor of the
                    lordship exercises episcopal jurisdiction in his peculiar court, granting
                    marriage licenses, probates of wills, &amp;c. under the ancient monastic
                    seal.</p>
                <p>As far as inequality of surface is essential to scenic beauty, this county has
                    strong claims to it, as it presents every variety of plain, hill, and mountain.
                    The plains are chiefly confined to the vicinity of the rivers; the hills occupy
                    by much the greater portion of the soil, insomuch that its appearance has been
                    quaintly compared to a dish of spinach set over with eggs cut in two; and the
                    mountains are piled together in one immense mass in the barony of Mourne in the
                    south. The summit of Slieve Donard, the highest, is 2809 feet above the level of
                    the sea. Slieve Croob and Slieve-na-boly, to the north of the principal group,
                    and in a great degree detached from it, are also of considerable elevation.</p>
                <p>The Mourne Mountains give rise to the four principal rivers, the Bann, the Lagan,
                    the Ballynahinch, and the Newry water. The first-named of these rivers flows
                    north-eastward by Banbridge and Portadoun into Lough Neagh. The Lagan, after
                    flowing northwards, takes an eastern direction, and passing by Lisburn and
                    Belfast, separates the counties of Down and Antrim. The Ballynahinch discharges
                    itself into the southern extremity of Strangford Lough. The Newry water is an
                    insignificant stream, except where it is affected by the influence of the tide,
                    and would be wholly undeserving of special notice, were it not that it has been
                    made the commencement of a communication by water with Lough Neagh. The Newry
                    navigation, the first canal completed in Ireland, commences at Fathom, two miles
                    and a halfbelow Newry, to which town it conveys vessels drawing nine or ten feet
                    water. From Newry to the Bann is a canal for twelve miles, navigable for boats
                    of from forty to sixty tons. Its summit-level is sixty-five feet above the sea,
                    and twenty-two above the surface of Lough Neagh. The navigation thence to the
                    lake is carried on in the river, a distance of nine miles, whence a
                    communication by water to Belfast is maintained by the Lagan navigation. The
                    chief trade on the Newry Canal is the import of bleaching materials, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193324851" xml:id="kp-eb0708-4851-0132"/> flax seed, iron,
                    timber, and foreign produce; the exports ' are grain, yarn, linen, cottons, and
                    coal in small quantities.</p>
                <p>Lakes, properly so called, are numerous, but insignificant in extent. Strangford
                    Lough, otherwise called Lough Cone, is a spacious gulf, extending ten miles
                    northwards into the land, and affording a secure roadstead to large vessels in
                    its interior. Strangers, however, are unwilling to have recourse to it, through
                    an apprehension that the rapid current of the tide, which rushes through the
                    narrow strait between Portaferry and Strangford at the rate of eight or ten
                    miles an hour, might drive them on some sunken rocks near its entrance. This
                    gulf is studded with numerous islands, some beautifully wooded, others affording
                    rich pasturage, but none inhabited. Bangor, Kil- 1ough, and Ardglass, have each
                    a harbour for fishing boats and small craft. An artificial harbour has been
                    constructed at Donaghadee for the accommodation of the packetboats to Scotland;
                    but the introduction of steam navigation has rendered it comparatively useless.
                    Near the coast of the Ardes, a long narrow peninsula between Strangford Lake and
                    the sea, are the Grecn Island, Bird Island, and Burr Island; and at the entrance
                    of Carrickfergus Bay is a group of three, called the Copeland Islands, upon one
                    of which stands a lighthouse. There is another lighthouse on a sunken reef,
                    called the South Rock, near the northern entrance of Strangford Lough.</p>
                <p>The predominating soil is a loam of little depth, but good in quality. In most
                    places it is intermixed with considerable quantities of stones of various sizes;
                    a circumstance easily accounted for, as quarries are to be found everywhere not
                    far from the surface. Clay is mostly confined to the eastern coast of the Ardes,
                    and to the northern parts of Castlereagh. Of sandy soil the quantity is small,
                    and chiefly on the sea coasts near Dundrum, where in some places its abundance
                    and shifting nature have prevented any attempt at improvement. Moor grounds are
                    mostly confined to the skirts of the mountains. Bogs, though frequent, are
                    scarcely sufficient to form a supply of fuel to the numerous and increasing
                    population. The husbanding and apportioning of them among the tenantry forms no
                    small part of an agent’s or land-steward’s duties. There are several quarries of
                    fine freestone. The best is that on Scrabo Hill, where a very close-grained and
                    clearcoloured stone is raised. The quarries of Kilwarlin afford flags of large
                    dimensions, varying in hue from a clear stone colour to a brownish red; the
                    former are superior in beauty and hardness. Slates are raised in several parts;
                    and though they cannot compete with the Welsh in lightness and colour, they are
                    superior in hardness and durability. Limestone is not very general. Large blocks
                    of a yellowish magnesian species are found near Hollywood, but this kind is not
                    used for manure, except where the white is not easily attainable. Near Comber,
                    on the shores of Strangford Lough, is a very hard and sparkling kind of reddish
                    granular limestone. But the greatest magazine of this most valuable mineral is
                    found in the vicinity of Moira. It is supposed to be a continuation of that mass
                    which is perceptible, with little interruption, from Magilligan, in Londonderry,
                    round the headlands of Antrim, to the range of mountains that he north of
                    Lisburn, whence turning westward, it is lost in the acclivities that border the
                    Lagan between Moira and Magheralin. Flere the quarries lie very near the
                    surface. They consist of horizontal strata intermixed with flints, in some cases
                    stratified, in others in detached pieces of various form and size. It is not
                    unusual to see three of these large flints, like rollers, each a yard long and
                    twelve inches in diamcter, standing perpendicularly over one another, and held
                    together by a narrow neck of limestone, funnel-shaped, as if they had been
                    poured in a liquid state into a cavity formed to receive them. Various kinds of
                    shells and other marine exuviae are found in this stone. Granite occurs in many
                    places in detached masses, but the great body of it is confined to the southern
                    and western regions, chiefly in the barony of Mourne. Yet though it is here the
                    prevailing mineral, it does not wholly exclude the schist or slate, which is
                    often seen in contact with it, raising itself from out of the middle of a
                    surrounding mass of the former stone, which is itself in turn imbedded, or, as
                    it were, set in the schist.</p>
                <p>The mineral springs found here are of two qualities, sulphurooehalybeate and
                    purely chalybeate. The most celebrated of the former kind is at the foot of
                    Slieve Croob Mountain, about two miles from Ballynahinch. In appearance, taste,
                    and effects, it strongly resembles the waters of Aix-la-Chapelle. It is used
                    both externally and internally, and has been found peculiarly effective in
                    scorbutic affections. The town is much frequented in summer by invalids to enjoy
                    its benefits. The chalybeate springs are numerous, and widely scattered through
                    the county. The richest is that of Granshaw, in the Ardes. An alum spring has
                    been discovered near Clough.</p>
                <p>According to an account of the number of houses taken in 1751, the population, at
                    an average of 5^ths to a house, amounted to 110,800, and, by a similar account,
                    taken in 1791, to 220,519, thus doubling in forty years. Beaufort estimates it
                    in the following year at 201,500. Dubourdieu, in 1802, states it to be 226,632.
                    According to the parliamentary returns in 1812, 1821, and 1831, it increased
                    progressively to 287,290, 325,410, and 352,571, having more than trebled itself
                    in a period of eighty years.</p>
                <p>The state of education, as collected from the parliamentary returns in 1821 and
                    1824-26, is as follows :—</p>

                <p>Of the total number contained in the latter of these returns, 4347 were
                    Protestants of the established church, 6120 were Roman Catholics, and 11,615
                    dissenters; the religious persuasion of the remaining 411 was not ascertained.
                    The number of schools was 550; of which ninety-four, containing 6667 pupils,
                    were educated by grants of public money; sixteen, containing 972 pupils, by the
                    voluntary contributions of societies and individuals; the remaining 440,
                    containing 15,595 pupils, were pay schools. The diocesan grammar school of Down
                    is now formed into a joint district school for Down and Dromore.</p>
                <p>The presbyterian form of worship predominates, especially in the towns and low

                    great extent.</p>
                <p>During the existence of the Irish parliament this county returned fourteen

                    Downpatrick, Bangor, Killyleagh, Hillsborough, Newry, and Newtownarder. Since

                <p>The land is very unequally portioned out among the inhabitants. There are many
                    landed proprietors, mostly resident, each of whom holds large tracts in his own
                    hands. Under these is a numerous tenantry of every grade, from those who deem
                    themselves entitled to rank on an equal footing in society with the proprietors
                    of the soil, to the holders of a few acres, who depend on their manual labour
                    for the support of their families. The connection of all ranks hence arising has
                    had a great effect upon the state of society. The great bulk of the population
                    is orderly and industrious; their dwellings are better constructed and furnished
                    than those of a similar class in most other parts of Ireland. The small farmers
                    form a respectable body, honest, yet quickwitted and clever in their dealings,
                    as might be expected from the density of the population, the constant
                    intercourse, and the frequent traffic carried on in fairs and market. They are
                    anxious to secure and to enjoy such of the comforts of life as are attainable by
                    a vigorous exertion of industry and intellect. The processes of agriculture,
                    owing in a great degree to the example set by the resident gentry, are as
                    skilfully carried on as in any part of the united kingdom. The fields are well
                    laid out and fenced, the crops laid down in a judicious succession, the progress
                    of their growth carefully attended to, and the harvest well saved and secured.
                    The most improved implements of husbandry are generally known, and their value
                    is duly appreciated. The crops commonly cultivated are wheat, rye, bear, barley,
                    oats, peas, flax, and potatoes. Barley is extensively grown, particularly in the
                    light soil of Lecale. Green crops are also in general use. Much attention is
                    paid to the culture of grass, particularly on the borders of the larger rivers,
                    where extensive tracts of fine meadow land are annually enriched, by the
                    overflowing of the banks, with deposits of the finer particles of mould washed
                    down from the higher grounds. Lime and marl are in general use as manure. Horned
                    cattle arc principally reared for dairies, and therefore the same attention to
                    figure and flesh is not paid as in some other agricultural districts. The
                    resident gentry are, however, laudably emulous in the improvement of their
                    respective stocks. The breed of horses is also an object of much attention. In
                    the reign of James II. a public body was incorporated under the name of the
                    Royal Corporation of Ilorsebrecders of Down, under whose auspices races are held
                    annually at Downpatrick and at the Maze near Hillsborough. Some of the best
                    racers in Ireland have been bred in this county. The native breed of sheep is
                    confined to the mountains. They are a small hardy race, mostly horned, but in
                    some instances not so. Though born in the mountains, they are removed during the
                    first winter after birth to the more genial atmosphere of the lower country, and
                    brought back on the return of spring. Mauy of this breed are well made and
                    finely woolled. It is also much prized for the delicacy of its mutton. The
                    various other kinds of sheep have been much improved by judicious crosses from
                    the best British breeds. Hogs are reared in great numbers, chiefly for the
                    Belfast market, where the large exportation occasions a constant and brisk
                    demand for them. Hams of very superior quality are prepared from them in that
                    town. Rabbits form a part of farm stock in the sandy southern tracts. Bces are
                    found to thrive well, and hives have been constructed for the purpose of saving
                    the honey without destroying the swarm.</p>
                <p>Manufactures arc carried on largely in the neighbourhood of Belfast and Newry.
                    Several of the smaller towns also support some branches on a smaller scale. The
                    linen manufacture still continues to be much attended to, but by no means so
                    extensively as formerly; it is more and more superseded by the cotton every
                    year. The finer fabrics of linen were the object of particular attention.' The
                    woollen manufacture is confined to a coarse cloth wrought solely for home
                    consumption. Kelp is made in large quantities along the shores.</p>
                <p>The fisheries are by no means so extensive or flourishing as the great scope of
                    sea-coast might lead to suppose. Belfast market is chiefly supplied from
                    Carrickfergus, yet fish of every description abounds. Shoals of herrings
                    frequently go up Strangford Lough, but they are not so much esteemed as those
                    caught in the open sea. Smelts are taken in large quantities at the entrance of
                    the same lough. The fishing for sand-eels at Newcastle is deemed to be of
                    importance sufficient to require a code of regulations, adopted and enforced by
                    the people themselves, to prevent the injuries and losses resulting from
                    indiscriminate fishing. Shell-fish abound along the rocky shores, particularly
                    in the neighbourhood of the Copeland Islands. Oysters are dredged at Ringhaddy,
                    Carlingford, and Bangor. Mussels in inexhaustible numbers cover the shallow
                    banks that stretch out before Holy wood. They are chiefly consumed by the
                    families in the immediate neighbourhood.</p>
                <p>Several remains of antiquity, supposed to be coeval with the rudest ages of
                    society, are to be found in this county. At Slidderyford, near Dundrum, is a
                    group of pillar stones, consisting of ten or twelve, forming a circle. They are
                    from eight to ten feet in height. A remarkable cairn stands on the summit of
                    Slieve Croob. It is nearly eighty yards in circumference at the bottom and fifty
                    at the top, forming a platform, on which several cairns of various heights and
                    dimensions are erected. Another cairn near the village of Anadorn was found to
                    cover a cave containing ashes and a number of human bones. Several cromlechs or
                    stone altars have been discovered at various times. The most remarkable is in
                    the Giant’s Ring, on the summit of a hill between Lisburn and Belfast. The altar
                    is formed of an unwrought stone seven feet long by six and a half broad, resting
                    in an inclined position on several rude pillars from two to three feet high. It
                    stands nearly in the centre of an enclosure about one third of a mile in
                    circumference, formed of a rampart of earth about twenty feet high, sloping in
                    on each side, and broad enough at the top for two persons to ride abreast upon
                    it. Near Downpatrick is a rath or mount of earth three quarters of a mile in
                    circumference. Its exterior consists of three artificial ramparts, the largest
                    of which is thirty feet broad. The number of monastic ruins is also
                    considerable. The most ancient and celebrated is the Abbey of Downpatrick, where
                    the three favourite saints of the Irish, St Patrick, St Golumb, and St Bridget,
                    are said to have been buried. Near the abbey was a round tower, which was thrown
                    down some years ago, when the abbey, now converted into the cathedral church,
                    was rebuilding. Beneath the foundation of the tower a wall was found to proceed,
                    crossing it, and extending to the main building of the abbey. Struel Wells, to
                    the east of Downpatrick, merit notice from their connection with former
                    religious observances. They are four in number, each covered by a stone vault,
                    and having the water conveyed from the others by subterraneous aqueducts. Great
                    numbers assemble here at midsummer’s eve, and on the Friday before Lammas, to
                    perform religious ceremonies, chiefly consisting of penances, and to obtain
                    recovery from their bodily complaints. The ruins of many castles, particularly
                    upon the coast, are still visible. Amongst the most remarkable is Greencastle,
                    built on an islct in the barony of Mourne, and intended to maintain a
                    communication between the English settlers in this county and those in the
                    county of Louth. This castle was considered of such importance that no person
                    but one of English birth was permitted to be constable of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193324877" xml:id="kp-eb0708-4877-0134"/>it. Dundrum Castle, erected
                    on a rock near a small harbour in a bay of the same name, still preserves
                    considerable vestiges of its former grandeur. At Ardglass are the remains of
                    considerable fortifications.</p>
                <p>Downpatrick, the county town, is situated at the extremity of the southern branch
                    of Strangford Lough. It is said to owe its name to St Patrick, the founder of
                    the abbey here, in which he was interred. The town, which consists of four
                    streets meeting in the bottom of a valley formed by hills of some elevation,
                    comprehends a surface of 1486 acres, and contains a population of 4780,
                    according to the latest return. Vessels coming to the town are obliged to
                    discharge their cargoes at the Quoill Quay, about a mile distant. The public
                    buildings are, the cathedral, the courthouse and assembly rooms, the jail, the
                    barracks, the parish church, the Catholic chapel, some dissenting meetinghouses,
                    the county infirmary, and the fever hospital. Near the court-house is an asylum
                    for clergymen’s widows, and an hospital for the decayed tenants of the Southwell
                    estate. Two miles from the town is the race course, under the superintendence of
                    the corporation of horsebreeders. The town is an ancient manor, governed by a
                    seneschal. Previously to the reform act it was the most open borough in Ireland,
                    as all persons who payed scot and lot, or boiled a pot in the town, were
                    electors. Newry, situated in the southwestern extremity, and extending into the
                    adjoining county of Armagh, is of much greater size and of more commercial
                    importance than Downpatrick. It covers 2500 acres, contains 13,370 inhabitants,
                    and ranks as the twelfth of the principal towns of Ireland as to population.
                    Situated at the extremity of Carlingford Bay, and connected by its canal with
                    Lough Neagh and the Tyrone collieries, it enjoys peculiar advantages. Even in
                    the earlier periods of British domination it maintained a high position, from
                    being at the extremity of the pale, and serving as the key to the then unsubdued
                    and generally hostile province of Ulster. In 1641 the town was taken and cruelly
                    treated. In 1689 it was again stormed and reduced to ashes by the Duke of
                    Berwick, to secure his retreat from Duke Schomberg. The public buildings are, a
                    court-house, jail, exchange, assembly rooms, custom-house, theatre, and several
                    places of worship. The environs of this town are of great beauty. The prospect
                    towards the Bay of Carlingford is magnificent, and the villages of Narrow-water
                    and Rosstown on its northern coast are objects of much interest to numerous
                    visitors. The lordship, of which mention has been already made, is the property
                    of the Needham family.</p>
