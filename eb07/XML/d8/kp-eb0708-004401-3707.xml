                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> preparation of ardent spirits constitutes a
                    manufactory which is carried on in this country to a considerable extent, and
                    deserves a particular investigation, as connected with one of the most curious
                    and intricate departments of chemistry. We shall treat the subject as briefly as
                    is compatible with perspicuity and utility.</p>
                <p>It seems established by the experiments of chemists, that no other substance can
                    be converted into ardent spirits, by fermentation, than sugar. Different species
                    of sugar have been recognized by chemists. They are distinguished from each
                    other by their sweetening power, and by the figure of their crystals. As far as
                    the process of distillation is concerned, it seems only necessary to refer to
                    three of these species; namely, <hi rend="italic">common sugar, sugar of
                    grapes,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">szigar of starch</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >manna.</hi></p>
                <p>Common sugar is usually extracted from the sugar cane, but it exists likewise in
                    beet, and in various other vegetable substances. Its colour is white, and it
                    crystallizes in rhomboidal prisms. When it is dissolved in a sufficient quantity
                    of water, and mixed with yeast, it ferments, and the liquid thus fermented
                    yields, when distilled, an ardent spirit. It is from the refuse of common sugar
                    that the ardent spirit well known by the name of <hi rend="italic">rum</hi> is'
                    obtained in the West Indies.</p>
                <p>Sugar of grapes is the substance to which that fruit is indebted for its sweet
                    taste. It may be extracted from the juice of grapes, by nearly the same process
                    as is followed by the manufacturers of common sugar. It is white, not so sweet
                    as common sugar, and not so soluble in water. It usually crystallizes in
                    spheres. These, when viewed with a glass, are found to consist of a congeries of
                    small acicular crystals diverging from a centre. It is to the presence of this
                    sugar that the juice of grapes owes its fermentability. The ardent spirits
                    obtained by distilling <hi rend="italic">wine</hi> are usually distinguished by
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">brandy.</hi> They are manufactured in great
                    abundance in France and Spain, and other wine countries.</p>
                <p>When starch is boiled with a large quantity of water and a little sulphuric acid
                    for a considerable time, it is converted into a sugar, which possesses exactly
                    the properties of sugar of grapes. From the experiments of M. Theodore de
                    Saussure, it seems to follow that this sugar is nothing more than a combination
                    of starch with water. During the process of malting, the starch which
                    constitutes so great a portion of barley is converted into this sugar. If barley
                    meal be mashed with water of the temperature 150°, and the mixture be well
                    agitated for an hour or two, the barley starch gradually undergoes a process
                    somewhat similar to mashing; for it becomes soluble in the water, and that
                    liquid acquires a sweet taste. It is from this sugar that the ardent spirits
                    known in this country by the names of <hi rend="italic">Geneva, Wìiishy,
                    Gin,</hi> are obtained.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manna</hi> is a saccharine substance, which exudes
                    spontaneously from the <hi rend="italic">Fraxinus</hi> ora?«·, and several other
                    species of ash. The fermented juice of the onion, melon, and carrot, likewise
                    contains manna. Manna has a sweet taste like sugar. It is more soluble both in
                    water and alcohol; it crystallizes very readily on cooling, in needles. But its
                    most remarkable property is, that when dissolved in water, and mixed with yeast,
                    it cannot be made to ferment like common or grape sugar. Hence it is incapable
                    of yielding an ardent spirit. To the distiller, therefore, it is totally
                    useless.</p>
                <p>Milk likewise contains a peculiar species of saccharine matter, distinguished by
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">sugar of milk.</hi> In consequence of the presence
                    of this substance, milk is capable of being fermented into an intoxicating
                    liquor, which, ót’ course, if distilled, would yield an ardent spirit. This
                    liquor is made by the Tartars, from the milk of mares, and is known by the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">koumiss.</hi> It is made likewise in Shetland.</p>
                <p>The liquid which exudes from the cocoa-nut tree also contains a saccharine
                    matter, but of what species has not been ascertained. In consequence of the
                    presence of this saccharine matter, it runs readily into fermentation, and when
                    the fermented liquor is distilled, it yields an ardent spirit, well known in
                    India by the name of <hi rend="italic">arrack.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus the name of the ardent spirits differs according to the material employed in
                    its manufacture. Every species of ardent spirit is distinguished by a peculiar
                    flavour. The opinion entertained at present is, that the nature of the .
                    substance which produces intoxication is the same in all these ardent spirits,
                    and is the substance to which chemists have given the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >alcohol</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and that the flavour is owing to the
                    presence of an essential oil, derived from the ingredient employed in the
                    manufacture. Thus the sugar cane yields the oil that gives the peculiar flavour
                    to rum; grapes contain the oil that gives the peculiar flavour to brandy, and so
                    on. We do not know that this opinion, though sufficiently probable in itself,
                    has ever been established by decisive experiments; that the oils to which these
                    spirits owe their flavour have ever been obtained in a separate state; or that
                    all of these spirits have been made to yield alcohol destitute of flavour. But
                    the opinion is so very likely to be true, that we will be forgiven for adopting
                    it, especially as we are not aware of any counter evidence that can be brought
                    forward.</p>
                <p>The processes of the distiller being essentially the same, whatever the substance
                    be from which he procures his <hi rend="italic">ardent spirits,</hi> we shall
                    satisfy ourselves with a minute account of the processes followed by the
                    distillers in Scotland in manufacturing whisky. We shall introduce, likewise, a
                    few observations on the processes followed in manufacturing ardent spirits in
                    other countries, such as Hollands and Rum; and we shall terminate the article by
                    giving the present state of our knowledge of the theory of fermentation.</p>
                <p> CHAP. I. — OF THE MANUFACTURE OF WHISKY.</p>
                <p>The kind of grain employed in this country for manufacturing whisky is <hi
                    rend="italic">barley.</hi> The processes are easier, and the spirits produced
                    have a more agreeable flavour, when the barley is <hi rend="italic">malted.</hi>
                    But, in consequence of the duty upon malt, a portion of unmalted grain has been
                    introduced into the distilleries. This portion has been gradually increased, and
                    amounts very commonly to four fifths, and in some cases, it is said, to nine
                    tenths, of the whole mixture of raw grain and malt. It may be laid down as a
                    general rule, that the labour bestowed, and the time requisite for brewing,
                    increases in proportion to the quantity of raw grain employed.</p>
                <p>The processes of the distiller may be reckoned four: namely, the mashing, the
                    cooling, the fermenting, and the distilling. We shall take each of these
                    processes in the order in which we have named them.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Mashing.</hi></p>
                <p>The barley is previously ground to a fine meal, and the malt bruised by passing
                    it between rollers. When the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193323720"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-3720-0045"/>proportion of malt is very small, it is customary
                    to add a quantity of the <hi rend="italic">seeds</hi> of oats (the husk of oats
                    separated during the grinding), to facilitate the separation of the water from
                    the grains, after the process of mashing is over; for barley-meal parts with
                    water with much greater difficulty than malt. When the proportion of raw grain
                    to malt is as 2 to 1, or even as 3 to 1, this addition of oat seeds maybe
                    dispensed with. But it is probably essential when the proportions amount to 5 to
                    1, or, still more, When to 9 to 1.</p>
                <p>The quantity of grain and malt employed at one time must be entirely regulated by
                    the size of the distillery. But, that we may be able to give a precise notion of
                    the proportion of the different substances employed, we shall suppose the
                    quantity taken at once to be 60 bushels, and that it consists of a mixture of
                    two parts raw grain and one part malt, or,</p>
                <p>40 bushels barley,</p>
                <p>20 bushels malt.</p>
                <p>The mash-tun is a large circular or square vessel, which now-a-days is usually
                    constructed of cast iron. It was formerly of wood; but a wooden mash-tun was
                    found to last for so short a time, that iron has been substituted in several
                    distilleries with which we arc acquainted, and probably the substitution will
                    soon become general. Into the mash-tun a quantity of water is let down of the
                    temperature 150° Fahrenheit. The bulk of this water varies according to the
                    fancy of the distiller; but from 700 to 800 wine gallons may be reckoned a good
                    proportion for sixty bushels of grain. The mixture of mcal and bruised malt is
                    then put into the mash-tun, and very carefully mixed with the water by a number
                    of men, who wield each a wooden instrument adapted for the purpose. All the dry
                    clots of mcal are broken, and every portion of it wetted with the water. This
                    agitation of the meal in the water is what is technically called <hi
                    rend="italic">mashing.</hi> It is continued for at least an hour and a half,
                    sometimes much longer; and the length of time must increase with the proportion
                    of raw grain present, when compared with the malt; so that sometimes we have
                    seen it continued for three or even four hours, <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> As
                    the liquor in the mash-tun would lose a great deal of its heat during this
                    length of time, about 500 wine gallons of water are added at intervals, at a
                    temperature varying from 190° to 205°, according to the fancy of the brewer.
                    After the mashing is concluded, the whole mixture is allowed to remain at rest
                    for about two hours, and this interval is technically called the <hi
                    rend="italic">infusion.</hi> During this interval the grains sink to the bottom,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">ιcort,</hi> still muddy, but quite liquid, remains at
                    the surface.</p>
                <p>If we have the curiosity to taste the wort every half hour from the commencement
                    of the mashing to the end of the process, we shall find that at first it has
                    little taste, but that it becomes swccter and sweeter, till at last it acquires
                    very nearly the luscious swcet taste of malt wort. This indicates clearly that
                    the starch of the barley meal is gradually converted, during the mashing, into
                    starch sugar. In what way this change is produced we have at present no
                    experiments to determine; but if Theodore de Saussurc’s theory of the formation
                    of starch sugar be accurate, we may conclude that the change is produced simply
                    by the combination of a portion of water with the starch. The conversion,
                    however, in the mash-tun, is never complete. A considerable portion of the
                    starch still remains unaltered. The consequence is, that if we endeavour to make
                    wort from raw grain, as strong as pos sible, to contain, for example, 200 lbs.
                    of saccharine matter per barrel, we find ourselves unable to effect our object,
                    because, long before it has reached 200 lbs. per barrel, the wort has lost its
                    fluidity, and has assumed the form of a jelly. Our mode of trying this
                    experiment was, to take the strongest raw grain wort which we could procure, and
                    to concentrate it by boiling, till it became as strong as possible. We were
                    never able, by this method, to obtain a wort much stronger than 150 lbs. per
                    barrel. But malt wort may be easily boiled down to the strength of 200 lbs. per
                    barrel, without losing its fluidity.</p>
                <p>Probably the change of the starch into sugar continues during the process of
                    fermentation. Hence, we conceive, the reason why distillers find it advantageous
                    to put into the fermenting tuns all the solid starchy matter which had
                    precipitated from the wort while in the coolers. Hence, also, the reason why the
                    fermentation is conceived to go on best when it comes on gradually at first, and
                    not with too much violence.</p>
                <p>After the mashing and infusion is finished, the wort is drawn off from the
                    grains. This is not done, as is the practice with the brewers, by opening a cock
                    at the bottom of the mash-tun. It will not in this way pass through barley mcal.
                    But it is drawn off from the top of the mash-tun, after the grains have
                    subsided, by means of a tube pierced full of holes, which rises at one of the
                    corners of the mash-tun as high as the surface of that vessel.</p>
                <p>The quantity of wort that runs off in this way does not exceed one third of the
                    water which had been mashed with the meal. If 1200 gallons of hot water, for
                    example, have been employed in all, the wort drawn off after the mashing will
                    scarcely exceed 400 gallons. If the process were carried no farther, almost two
                    thirds of the wort would be lost. To prevent this, about 500 gallons of water,
                    of the temperature 190°, are let upon the grains. The whole is well mixed
                    together for about twenty minutes, and then allowed to <hi rend="italic"
                    >infuse,</hi> or to remain at rest, for an hour and a half. It is then drawn off
                    in the same way as the first wort. In general, the amount of the second wort is
                    greater than of the first, because the grains having been previously deprived of
                    a great proportion of their starch, now part with their water more freely than
                    before.</p>
                <p>To carry off everything soluble from the grains as completely as possible, after
                    the second worts have been drawn off, about 800 gallons of boiling hot water are
                    let on the grains. The mashing or stirring is continued for twenty minutes, and
                    the infusion for half an hour or forty minutes. This third wort is then drawn
                    off. Being much weaker than the two preceding worts, some distillers are in the
                    habit of reserving it, and employing it for mixing with the meal and malt in the
                    succeeding brewing. Others boil it down to the requisite strength, and then mix
                    it with the first and second worts in the fermenting vessel. It is impossible to
                    lay down any rule respecting this part of the process, because, unfortunately,
                    the distiller is not left at liberty to follow his own judgment. The legislature
                    has interfered, and obliged him to produce a determinate quantity of spirits of
                    a given strength from 100 gallons of the fermented wort. Till within these few
                    years it was necessary in Scotland to produce from 100 gallons of fermented

                    of the specific gravity 0∙90917. This law, we believe, still exists in England;
                    but in Scotland the quantity of spirits from 100 gallons of fermented wort has
                    been reduced to 14 gallons.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    spirits to thirteen gallons from the hundred gallons of wash, and the strength
                    of the wort must not exceed 7θ lbs. of saccharine matter per barrel. The excise
                    regulations bind down the distiller to a particular mode of operating. All such
                    restrictions are very injurious to the improvement of the process. How far they
                    may have been provoked by the attempts of the manufacturer to evade the excise
                    duties, we pretend not to say.</p></note> The Scotch distiller<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193323733" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3733-0046"/> at present is under the
                    necessity of producing this quantity of spirits from 100 gallons of fermented
                    wort, or, at any rate, of paying the duty for that quantity, whether he produce
                    it or not. This law, of course, regulates the strength of his wort. For, in
                    order to produce that quantity, it is necessary that the wort should contain a
                    certain proportion of saccharine matter. Accordingly, the wort must be at least
                    of the strength 55⅛ lbs. per barrel when it is let down into the fermenting tun,
                    and the law prohibits it from being stronger than 75 lbs. per barrel. If we
                    suppose the whole saccharine matter contained in the wort to be decomposed
                    during the fermentation, 100 wine gallons would produce 14 gallons of spirits of
                    the specific gravity 0∙90917, provided the original strength of the wort was 55^
                    lbs. per barrel. But this is a supposition which is never realized in practice.
                    From a number of experiments, conducted with considerable care, we consider
                    ourselves warranted in concluding, that, even when the fermentation is conducted
                    with the greatest success, the quantity of saccharine matter which will remain
                    undecomposed in a barrel of wort of the original strength of 55⅜ lbs. per
                    barrel, cannot be less than 15 lbs. Hence a distiller can scarcely be expected
                    to produce 14 gallons of spirits of the specific gravity 0∙90917 from 100
                    gallons of wort, unless the original strength of his wort was at least 70-∣ lbs.
                    per barrel. In. general, indeed, a still greater strength than this will be
                    requisite. Now, to produce wort of the strength 70∣ lbs. per barrel from raw
                    grain, without boiling, is by no means an easy task. Formerly, when the product
                    necessary was 19 gallons of spirits from the 100 of wort, the distillers were
                    accustomed to give their wort the requisite strength by the process which they
                    termed <hi rend="italic">lobbing.</hi> This consisted in making up a very strong
                    infusion of saccharine matter from malt, raw grain, &amp;c. and adding it to the
                    wort till it acquired the requisite strength. This substance was likewise called
                    <hi rend="italic">bub</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and every distiller had his
                    own method of preparing it. Probably sugar, treacle, or other similar prohibited
                    articles, often found their way into it. It was on this supposition that the
                    addition of it to wort was entirely prohibited in the late act of parliament
                    regarding the Scotch distilleries. And it was to prevent the secreting of the
                    surplus spirits which might be produced above the 14 per cent, that the strength
                    of the worts was limited to the maximum 75 lbs. per barrel.</p>
                <p>When the quantities of grain, malt, and water, above indicated, are employed, the
                    first worts drawn off will be about the strength of 73 lbs. per barrel, and the
                    second worts of the strength 50 lbs. per barrel; and the two, when mixed
                    together, would constitute a wort of the strength of about 62 lbs. per barrel.
                    Of course, the worts actually made by the Scotch distillers must exceed the
                    strength of those which we have employed by way of illustration, by about eight
                    lbs. per barrel. But we have reason to believe that 62 lbs. per barrel would be
                    a better strength than that pitched upon by those who contrived the act of
                    parliament by which the Scotch distilleries are regulated. Wort of such strength
                    should yield about 12 per cent, of spirits of the strength one to ten over
                    proof, or of the specific gravity 0∙90917. The original strength of the wort
                    from which Dutch Hollands is made is considerably less than this, and we believe
                    that nobody will deny that the Dutch spirit is, in general, much preferable to
                    the whisky manufactured in the lowlands of Scotland.</p>
                <p>The whisky made by smugglers in Scotland is universally preferred by the
                    inhabitants, and is purchased at a higher price, under the name of Highland
                    whisky. This is partly owing to its being made entirely from malt; but the chief
                    reason is, that, from the unfavourable circumstances under which they operate,
                    their wort is necessarily much weaker than the wort of the legal distillers·
                    Probably it is not much stronger at an average than the wort of the Dutch
                    Hollands. It has been generally conceived that the superiority of the illicitly
                    distilled, or Highland whisky as it is called, is owing to the mode of
                    distillation. The smugglers distil in a much slower way than the legal
                    distillers. But nothing can be more absurd than this opinion. The flavour of the
                    spirits depends entirely upon the previous steps of the process. The slowness or
                    rapidity of the distillation can make no difference whatever in the flavour,
                    provided it be properly performed. Accordingly, we have seen spirits distilled
                    by the very rapid mode of distillation that formerly was practised in Scotland,
                    possessed of all the flavour of the best Highland whisky.</p>
                <p>Great pains have been taken to put an end to the practice of illicit distillation
                    in Scotland; and, by greatly diminishing the duty, this object, of late years,
                    has been nearly attained. The smugglers formerly set the whole force of
                    government at defiance, and carried on their processes in spite of all the
                    attempts that were made to stop them. Many of them, indeed, were brought to
                    absolute ruin, and few of them, we believe, were ever able to realize much
                    money, or to rise to independence. But still a new race of smugglers rose up
                    after another to carry on their illicit trade, to the great detriment of the
                    revenue, and to an equal deterioration of the morals of the common people.
                    Government do not seem to have been aware of the principal reason of the
                    continuance of this evil. They bound down the legal distillers in such a manner
                    by injurious restrictions, that it was not in their power to produce a spirit
                    equal in flavour to that manufactured by the smugglers, who lie under none of
                    those restrictions which bind down the ingenuity of the legal trader. This
                    superiority induces a corresponding desire in the inhabitants of Scotland to
                    possess themselves of smuggled whisky, even at a higher price than that for
                    which they can purchase the same article from the licensed distillers. The
                    smugglers, in consequence, are winked at, or rather encouraged, by a very
                    considerable proportion of the inhabitants of the country. While this feeling
                    existed it was impossible to put an end to smuggling in Scotland. But government
                    of late has removed the restrictions by which the Scotch distillers were bound,
                    so far as to allow them to distil from malt at nearly the same rate as they
                    formerly did from raw grain. The consequence has been, that the high reputation
                    of smuggled whisky has gradually sunk, and smuggling has been nearly
                    discontinued.</p>
                <p>The only reason that was alleged for continuing the restrictions under which the
                    distillers were placed, was the allegation that they were necessary in order to
                    ensure the payment of the duty upon the spirits actually distilled. But we
                    conceive that this duty might be levied with as much accuracy, though all the
                    restrictions on the strength of the wort were removed. From a number of
                    experiments conducted upon a large scale, we conclude that the fermentation,
                    however successful, is capable of decomposing only four fifths of the whole
                    saccharine matter contained in the wort. Farther, we find, that for every pound
                    of saccharine matter decomposed by the fermentation, there is formed half a
                    pound of alcohol of the specific gravity 0∙825. Now every gallon of spirits of
                    the specific gravity 0∙90917, or one to ten over proof, contains 4 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 lbs. of alcohol of the specific gravity 0∙825. To
                    form a gallon of spirits, then, of the specific gravity 0∙90917, there is
                    required the decomposition of 9∙2 lbs. of saccharine matter. But as only four
                    fifths of the saccharine matter present are decomposed, we must increase 9∙2 by
                    a fifth, which will raise it to 11⅛ lbs. The rule, therefore, for levying the
                    duty on the distillers would be this. Ascertain, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193323746" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3746-0047"/>by the saccharometer, the
                    strength of the wort, or the number of pounds avoirdupois of saccharine matter
                    which it contains, and for every 11∣ of these pounds charge the duty upon one
                    gallon of spirits. This would be no hardship upon the distiller. If he is unable
                    to produce a gallon of spirits from 11⅜lbs. of saccharine matter, he is not
                    sufficiently acquainted with his business, and the necessity of paying the duty
                    would stimulate his ingenuity to acquire the requisite information. He would
                    soon discover two facts which would probably regulate his conduct; namely, that
                    the flavour, and consequently the value, of his spirits, increases as he
                    diminishes the strength of his wort, and that the produce of spirits from the
                    same quantity of grain increases also as he diminishes the strength of his
                    wort.</p>
                <p>It would be difficult, according to the method at present followed by the
                    distillers, for the excisemen to determine the strength of the worts with the
                    requisite degree of accuracy; but it would be easy, we conceive, to order
                    matters so, that this information might be gained without in the least injuring
                    the process of fermentation to which these worts are to be subjected.</p>
                <p>Some distillers, not satisfied with three mashes, which they think insufficient
                    to exhaust the grains of all the matter that may be useful in the formation of
                    spirits, add a fourth quantity of boiling water, after the worts of the third
                    mash are drawn off, and mash a fourth time. The worts of this fourth mash are
                    always kept, to be employed instead of pure water during next day’s brewing.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Cooling.</hi></p>
                <p>Wort from raw grain has a much greater tendency to run into acidity than wort
                    from malt. On that account the distillers endeavour to bring it down to the
                    temperature requisite to begin fermentation as speedily as possible. As soon as
                    the first worts have begun to run into the un-derback, they are made to pass
                    into the coolers. The nature and disposition of the coolers vary so much,
                    according to the size of the distillery, that a general description will by no
                    means apply to them all. When the manufactory is of a moderate size, the coolers
                    are a shallow wooden vessel, covering the floor of an apartment or suit of
                    apartments, placed usually in the upper part of the distillery, and open as much
                    as possible to the influence of the external air. Here the hot worts are pumped
                    up, and left at a depth of one, two, or three inches, till they have acquired
                    the requisite temperature.</p>
                <p>When the distillery is on a large scale, it is usual to accelerate the cooling of
                    the worts by agitation. Of late years a new contrivance has been fallen on,
                    which answers much better than the old method, by bringing the worts almost
                    instantly to the particular temperature which the distiller wishes them to
                    acquire. This method is to pass the hot worts through a certain length of tin
                    pipe, which is immersed in a running stream of water. By properly regulating the
                    length of the pipe, the worts may be cooled down either to the temperature of
                    the surrounding water, or to any other intermediate temperature required. As the
                    worts in this case are cooled in close vessels, no evaporation goes on during
                    the process. Hence their strength will not increase during the process, and the
                    quantity will be precisely the same as in the underback, making allowance for
                    the change of temperature. This probably would be a disadvantage to the
                    distillers, while the present law obliges them to brew worts of a given
                    strength. But if this restriction were removed, it would be rather an
                    advantageous circumstance, because it would enable them to regulate the strength
                    of their worts at pleasure, by the quantity of water employed during the mashing
                    and infusion. To the excise officer it would also be a convenient circumstance,
                    because it would afford an additional security for determining the strength with
                    accuracy. He would have it in his power to try the strength of the worts while
                    hot in the underback, and when newly let down into the fermenting tuns, before
                    the yeast was added. This second trial ought to give nearly the same result as
                    the first. We say nearly, because, when the worts are hot, it is not so easy to
                    determine their strength with accuracy, as when they are cold.</p>
                <p>During the cooling of the wort from raw grain, there is always a considerable
                    deposit of flocky matter, which we conceive consists chiefly, if not entirely,
                    of starch. This flocky matter is swept along with the wort into the fermenting
                    tun. It is the opinion of distillers that it contributes materially to the
                    formation of spirits during the fermentation. We have little doubt that the
                    opinion is well founded. Probably during the fermentation it is converted first
                    into saccharine matter, and then afterwards decomposed into alcohol and carbonic
                    acid.</p>
                <p>The temperature to which the wort is cooled before it is let down into the
                    fermenting tuns differs a good deal in different distilleries, and even in the
                    same distillery at different seasons of the year. Winter is the usual season for
                    the distilleries, and it is the season which is considered as most advantageous
                    for conducting the fermentation with success; for it is easy to raise the
                    temperature of the fermenting room to the degree which is considered as best
                    adapted for the precess. But when the weather is hotter than that degree, it is
                    a much more difficult matter to keep the fermenting room sufficiently cool. In
                    winter the distillers usually let down the first worts at about 70°; the second
                    worts are cooled down to 60° or 65°. We do not perceive any good reason for this
                    distinction, though we have frequently seen it practised.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The Fermentation.</hi></p>
                <p>This is by far the most important part of the whole process. It is by the skill
                    and success with which it is conducted that distillers excel each other. Upon it
                    the profit and loss of the manufactory chiefly turn. Much pains have been
                    bestowed in investigating it; but it is of so capricious a nature as
                    occasionally to thwart the most skilful and experienced brewers. We shall
                    describe the method of proceeding in this process usually followed by the Scotch
                    distillers. In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Brewing</hi> we stated the facts
                    at present known respecting the saccharine matter of the wort and yeast of beer
                    which is employed as a ferment. To that article, therefore, we refer those who
                    wish for information on these subjects.</p>
                <p>The yeast employed by the Scottish distillers is chiefly brought from the London
                    porter breweries. Small quantities may be occasionally obtained from breweries
                    in their neighbourhood; but never, we believe, a sufficient quantity to answer
                    their purposes. The best yeast is that which is thrown oft’ the top of the
                    porter during its fermentation. But what is sold by the porter brewers consists
                    chiefly of the slimy matter which remains at the bottom of the vessels when the
                    clear porter is drawn off'. Fresh yeast is better than stale; but the distillers
                    being unable to procure a sufficient quantity of fresh yeast for their purposes,
                    are under the necessity of using both fresh and stale.</p>
                <p>As the quantity of yeast employed depends upon its quality, it is therefore
                    impossible to lay down any very precise rules upon the subject. For the quantity
                    of wort which we have supposed in the preceding part of this article, a Scotch
                    distiller would probably employ about twenty-seven gallons of good yeast, and
                    about thirty-six gallons if he considered the yeast of inferior quality. Only a
                    portion of this yeast is mixed at first with the wort. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193323759" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3759-0048"/>remainder is generally added
                    on the second, third, and fourth day. Most commonly, indeed, the whole is added
                    on the third day; but it is customary to make a farther addition at a later
                    period, if the brewer is of opinion that the fermentation is not proceeding so
                    well as it ought to do. We have seen yeast added on the sixth day of the
                    fermentation.</p>
                <p>The first portion of yeast mixed with the wort is always if possible fresh yeast,
                    and it is a great object with the distiller to have it of as good a quality as
                    possible. For our wort, the quantity of ycast first used may amount to nine
                    gallons. On the second day nine gallons more may be added, and on the third day
                    nine or eighteen gallons, according to its quality. Some distillers add nine
                    gallons the first day, and twenty-seven the third. Some add nine gallons every
                    day for four days. In short, there is considerable difference, and probably a
                    good deal of caprice, in the practice followed in the various manufactories. At
                    least we have never been able to obtain a satisfactory reason from any brewer
                    why he followed one practice rather than another. In hot weather we should
                    prefer the addition of nine gallons of yeast every day for four days. But in
                    cold weather it would probably answer better to add the whole yeast at twice;
                    and perhaps the third day is the most proper for making the great addition.</p>
                <p>The fermentation lasts nine, ten, eleven, or twelve days, according to
                    circumstances. Sometimes, though seldom, we have seen it last thirteen days.
                    During the first five days the fermenting tuns are left open on the top, or only
                    slightly covered; but pn the sixth day they are shut up as closely as possible,
                    so as to render the escape of the carbonic acid rather difficult. Two reasons
                    have been alleged for this proceeding. 1. The carbonic acid gas is conceived to
                    carry with it a portion of the alcohol, and by binding down the top it is
                    supposed that the loss by this drain will be diminished. We do not lay much
                    stress on this reason. The fermentation is almost at an and before the tuns are
                    shut down. Of course, almost the whole of the alcohol abstracted by the carbonic
                    acid has been already removed. 2. The presence of carbonic acid is conceived to
                    promote the fermentation. Hence it is supposed that, by preventing that gas from
                    escaping with facility, the attenuation will be greater than it otherwise would
                    be. Perhaps there may be some foundation for this opinion. There is no doubt
                    that carbonic acid gas may be substituted for yeast as a ferment, and that the
                    fermentation of the wort, under such circumstances, will go on pretty well. We
                    have seen the experiment tried by mixing yeast with wort in a close barrel, from
                    which there proceeded a tin pipe that passed through another barrel filled with
                    wort, and opened at the bottom of it. The gas was absorbed by the wort in this
                    second barrel, and the wort was fermented by it. But the fermentation, as might
                    have been expected, was not so complete as if it had been produced by the usual
                    addition of yeast. The distillers do not collect any yeast from their fermenting
                    vats, but beat it all into the liquid, being of opinion that any such collection
                    would render the fermentation less complete, and, of course, diminish the
                    proportion of spirits obtained.</p>
                <p>The wort most commonly increases in temperature from 20° to 25° of the
                    thermometer. Supposing it let down into the fermenting tun at 57°, its
                    temperature, when at the highest, may amount to from 78° to 82°. It usually
                    acquires the highest temperature on the fourth day of the fermentation,
                    frequently upon the fifth day; sometimes upon the sixth, the third, or the
                    seventh day; and we have seen it as late as the eighth, or even the eleventh
                    day, before its temperature became a maximum.</p>
                <p>The following table exhibits the number of cases on which the highest temperature
                    took place in these respee tive days in seventy-six brewings, conducted upon a
                    pretty large scale:</p>

                <p>This diversity, no doubt, depends upon the goodness of the yeast employed; and,
                    as we have no good criterion by which to determine the exact value of yeast as a
                    ferment, it is impossible to be able to foretell the exact result in any
                    particular case. Indeed we consider the uncertainty of the value of ycast as the
                    great difficulty which the distiller has to encounter. Any person who could
                    discover a method of estimating the exact value of any particular yeast as a
                    ferment would greatly improve this difficult manufactory. We do not believe that
                    such a discovery is impossible. Perhaps the specific gravity of the yeast, or
                    the quantity of solid matter which is left behind when a given weight of the
                    yeast is evaporated to dryness, might furnish very material information. We are
                    rather surprised that no distiller has thought of subjecting yeast to a series
                    of experiments, with a view to ascertain its real value as a ferment. The new
                    information which he would acquire would more tlían compensate for the trouble,
                    and would probably give him the means of improving his manufactory, or at least
                    of forming some notion of the value of the yeast which he purchases.</p>
                <p>As the fermentation proceeds, the specific gravity of the wort diminishes, owing
                    to the decomposition of the saccharine matter, and its conversion into alcohol
                    and carbonic acid. This diminution of specific gravity is called <hi
                    rend="italic">attenuation</hi> by distillers, and is employed by them as the
                    measure of the success of the fermentation. They can easily foretell the
                    quantity of spirits which their <hi rend="italic">τvash</hi> (the name by which
                    their fermented wort is distinguished) will yield, if they know the attenuation
                    which has taken place during the fermentation. This diminution of specific
                    gravity is produced by two causes. 1.The destruction of the saccharine matter
                    previously dissolved in the liquid, and which occasioned its specific gravity to
                    be greater than that of water. If the whole of this saccharine matter were
                    decomposed, it is obvious that the change of specific gravity from this cause
                    would be exactly such as would sink the wash to the specific gravity of water.
                    2. The second cause of the diminished specific gravity of the fermented wort is
                    the formation of a quantity of alcohol, which, being lighter than water,
                    occasions, by its evolution, a corresponding diminution of the specific gravity
                    of the liquid. The specific gravity of the purest alcohol which it has been
                    hitherto possible to obtain, is 0∙793 at the temperature of 60°. When mixed with
                    water it enters into a chemical combination with that liquid. Hence the specific
                    gravity is greater than the mean of that of the water and alcohol, though
                    considerably less than that of water. It is obvious, if we were to add alcohol
                    to the unfermented wort, we would diminish its specific gravity. We might even,
                    by this means, render it as light, or even lighter, than water, though none of
                    the saccharine matter were destroyed. It is obviously impossible, therefore, to
                    determine how much saccharine matter has been decomposed by the fermentation
                    from the attenuation alone. Suppose the original specific gravity of the wort to
                    have been 1'060; and suppose that, after the fermentation, its specific gravity
                    is reduced to 1∙002. The first of these specific gravities indicates 55∙8 lbs.
                    of saccharine matter per barrel; the second 1∙6 lbs. per barrel. It does not
                    follow, as the distillers suppose, that 54∙2 lbs. of saccharine mat-</p>

                    A considerable portion of the saccharine matter still remains undecomposed, but
                    the alcohol which has been formed counteracts the specific gravity of this
                    saccharine matter, and prevents its presence from being correctly indicated by
                    the saccharometer. But if we measure out a quantity of such wash, put it into a
                    retort or still, and distil off about a third of it; if we then take the
                    residual wash which remains in the retort or still, and add pure water to it
                    till its original bulk be restored, the saccharometer being applied to it will
                    indicate the quantity of saccharine matter which it still contains; and this
                    quantity being subtracted from the original quantity of saccharine matter
                    contained in the wort before the fermentation commenced, the remainder will be
                    the saccharine matter decomposed by the process.</p>
                <p>Alcohol is a substance which has a tendency to stop fermentation, and it stops
                    that process completely when added to fermenting wort in sufficient quantity. It
                    must be obvious from this, that very strong worts are injurious to the profits
                    of the distiller; because the stronger the wort the greater will be the
                    proportion of alcohol evolved, and, of course, the fermentation will ultimately
                    be impeded or stopped altogether, before the whole saccharine matter is
                    decomposed. Accordingly, the <hi rend="italic">spent wash</hi> will always be
                    found to contain a considerable proportion of saccharine matter, and it might be
                    fermented again, and made to yield no inconsiderable quantity of spirit. The
                    writer of this article made nine trials with malt worts, which were designedly
                    made weak. They were fermented as thoroughly us possible, and the following
                    table indicates the specific gravities to which they were reduced. The original
                    specific gravity probably did not much exceed 1∙045.</p>
                <p>Upon examining the state of the wash after the fermentation was at an cud, we
                    found that 4'34 parts of the sac <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> charine matter had
                    been decomposed, and that one part remained unaltered. So that in these nine
                    experiments, which were as favourable as possible to the fermentation, on
                    account of the weakness of the worts, not much less than one fifth of the whole
                    saccharine matter remained unaltered. Surely then we may lay it down as a fact,
                    that, in all cases of fermentation in a Scotch distillery, at least one fifth of
                    the whole saccharine matter is prevented from being decomposed by the
                    antifermenting power of the alcohol evolved. The consideration of this
                    circumstance renders it of more importance to allow the distiller to make his
                    wort weak; for the weaker the original wort, the less will the quantity be of
                    the saccharine matter which is prevented from being decomposed by the presence
                    of the alcohol evolved.</p>
                <p>When the heat has acquired its maximum, we may reckon, at an average, that nine
                    tenths of the whole attenuation has been completed. No judgment can be formed of
                    the ultimate attenuation, by the rapidity or slowness with which the heat
                    reaches its maximum. We have seen the attenuation equally good when the maximum
                    temperature happened on the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth day.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to lay down any specific rule with respect to the length that
                    attenuation ought to be carried. The obiect of the distiller is to render his
                    wash, if possible at least, as light as water. This object they frequently
                    accomplish. But it sometimes happens that the fermentation stops when the
                    specific gravity has sunk to 1 ’ 013 or 1∙008, and no addition of yeast will
                    make it sink lower. Bad yeast is the most probable reason of this ill success.
                    If the wash be allowed to remain in the fermenting tuns after the fermentation
                    is at an end, its specific gravity will be found gradually to increase a little,
                    and it will not yield so great a proportion of spirits. This is owing to the
                    formation of vinegar in the wash, which takes place at the expense of the
                    alcohol; and if the vinegar-forming process were allowed to go on long enough,
                    the alcohol would disappear altogether.</p>
                <p>Distillers always ferment their worts in tuns of a large size. This is attended
                    with the advantage, that the artificial heat evolved by the fermentation is not
                    so speedily dissipated as it would be if the process were conducted in small
                    vessels. Some distillers fill the tuns only partly', leaving a portion of the
                    upper part empty, that it may contain the froth formed when the wort is in full
                    fermentation. Others fill the tuns almost to the top, and cover down the mouth
                    with a lid, from which a tube passes to an open vessel placed above the tun.
                    When the liquid swells by the fermentation, it passes up the tube into the open
                    vessel, and runs down again when the fermenting process subsides. No regular set
                    of experiments, that we know of, has been made to determine which of these two
                    methods is the best. ·</p>
                <p>We have already observed that every 9∙2 lbs. of saccharine matter really
                    decomposed by the fermenting process yield a gallon of spirits one to ten over
                    hydrometer proof, or of the specific gravity 0∙90917 (at the temperature of
                    60°). But as the distillers are not in possession of a good method of
                    determining how much saccharine matter has been decomposed, the easiest rule
                    will be to allow 1I∣lbs. of saccharine matter, estimated before the fermentation
                    begins, to yield a gallon of spirits at 0∙90917 specific gravity. If the
                    original worts be very weak, perhaps we might take 11 lbs. of saccharine matter
                    as producing that quantity' of spirits; but while the present law respecting the
                    strength of the worts continues, 1l⅛ lbs. will be found, upon an average, to
                    come very' near the truth.</p>
                <p>It does not seem to be possible to ferment wort from a mixture of raw grain and
                    malt as completely as is required for the purposes of the distiller, without its
                    becoming sour. There seems no reason to doubt that the acid formed is the
                    acetic. Some are of opinion that the presence of this acid contributes to
                    improve the flavour of the spirits. But the quantity of acetic acid usually
                    present in wash is so small, that we do not see any reason for supposing that it
                    can produce any sensible effect. It is important, therefore, that the acidity
                    should be as small as possible, because the acid is formed at the expense of the
                    alcohol in the wash. Hence the wash ought to be distilled as soon as the
                    fermentation has come to a conclusion.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The Distilling.</hi></p>
                <p>The stills commonly used in other countries are of large dimension, and very
                    deep, so that a great deal of time is necessary to finish one process. Once in
                    the week, for example, is no uncommon period. The same kind of still was used in
                    Scotland till about the year 1787, when the duty began to be levied on the
                    distillers by a license paid at the commencement of the season upon every still
                    according to its capacity. This was done to prevent that propensity to smuggling
                    by which the generality of Scotch distillers were supposed to be actuated. The
                    quantity of spirits which a still of given dimensions could produce in a year
                    was calculated, and the license was laid on according to it. This saved the
                    excise-officers all farther trouble, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193323785"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-3785-0050"/>after gauging the stills and collecting the
                    license-duty, excepting an occasional visit to be certain that no new still of
                    larger dimensions was substituted for the old one. But about the year 1788
                    Messrs John and William Sligo, at that time rectifiers in Leith, made an
                    important alteration in the shape of the still, at the suggestion of an
                    Englishman, which greatly increased the rapidity of distillation. They
                    diminished their height, and increased the diameter of their bottom. The
                    consequence of this alteration was, that they were able to distil off the
                    contents of the still in a few hours, instead of once a week, as had formerly
                    been the practice. Thus they were enabled to produce a great quantity of spirits
                    from a very small still, and, of course, paid in reality a much smaller duty
                    than their brother manufacturers. This lucrative improvement they possessed
                    exclusively for about a year; but a secret of such importance could not be long
                    confined to a single house. It became gradually' known to other distillers, and
                    was soon imitated by all. The license-duty was increased year after year; but
                    the ingenuity of the distillers enabled them to outstrip the acts of parliament;
                    till, at last, a committee of the House of Commons was appointed to investigate
                    the subject in 1799. A very bulky report was published by this committee, which
                    contains a vast collection of curious facts respecting the. mode of distillation
                    at that time practised in Scotland. The license, in consequence of this report,
                    was laid on the distiller, on the supposition that he could discharge his still
                    every eight minutes, during the whole season that the manufactory was in
                    activity. Since that time the time of discharging the still was considerably
                    shortened. But the saving in point of time was attended with such an enormous
                    waste of fuel, that it is rather doubtful whether it was attended with much
                    additional profit to the distiller. In the year 1815, which was the last year of
                    the license-duty, a still capable of holding 80 gallons could be completely
                    distilled off, emptied, and ready for a new operation in 3∣ minutes, or even, it
                    is said, in some cases in 3 minutes; and a still of 40 gallons in 2∣ minutes. At
                    that time a change took place in the excise laws; the license-duty was
                    abolished, and the whole duty was levied, as in England, on the wash and the
                    spirits produced. There was, of course, no longer any necessity for continuing
                    the rapid mode of distillation; and, as it was attended with a very considerable
                    waste of fuel, and was in other respects much more expensive than the slow
                    process, it has been, of course, discontinued. We conceive, however, that it
                    will be worth while to give a short description of the still and furnace which
                    the Scotch distillers employed during the existence of the license-duty. It
                    would be a great pity indeed to allow the results of such a series of important
                    experiments to be forgotten.</p>
                <p>The stills were made of copper. Those capable of holding 44 gallons were about 44
                    inches in diameter at the bottom, and about 5 inches deep. Those capable of
                    holding 80 gallons were 54 inches in diameter, and about 8 inches deep. The
                    bottom was perfectly flat, and about three eighths of an inch thick. Within it
                    there were a number of iron chains, which were turned round by machinery, and
                    rubbing against the bottom prevented the thick matter, which the wash always
                    contains, from adhering to the bottom of the still and catching fire. This would
                    have almost immediately occasioned the destruction of the still; and the
                    scorched starchy matter would have communicated a disagreeable flavour to the
                    spirits, which could not have been got rid of afterwards. There was likewise a
                    circular plate in the inside of the still, towards its top. The use of it was to
                    break the bubbles that rise during rapid distillation; and, of course, lessen
                    the risk of the still boiling over, or <hi rend="italic">running foul</hi> as
                    the distillers term it; and, consequently, the distiller was enabled to put a
                    greater charge of wash into the still than it would have been in his power to do
                    if the plate had been omitted.</p>
                <p>These stills were supported by resting an inch and a half on the brick work all
                    round the bulge. The furnace was quite level, and was placed at the distance of
                    15 inches below the bottom of the still. The inner end of the grating bars was
                    placed 15 inches within a line falling vertically from the part of support of
                    the bulge of the still. The bars were in two lengths, the inner length was 21
                    inches, the outer 30 inches, supported by a cross bar between them four inches
                    square. In front of the bars was a dumb plate 10 inches broad. The bottom of the
                    ashpit was three feet below the grating bars, and on a level with the floor of
                    the distillery. The bars were two inches thick, three inches deep, and three
                    fourths of an inch apart. The brick work extended 21 inches beyond the
                    dumb-plate, and was four feet wide and four inches higher outside than at the
                    bulge of the still. The furnace doors were 30 inches wide. The bottom of the
                    furnace beyond the grating bars was lined with fire-brick nine inches deep, and
                    passed level backward into the chimney.</p>
                <p>The chimney was 60 feet high, four feet square within from top to bottom, and
                    consisted of a double wall. The inner wall of fire-bricks was nine inches thick.
                    The outer wall was placed at three inches distance on all sides from the inner
                    wall, and the space was left open at the top. The outer wall was 18 inches thick
                    at bottom, diminishing regularly on the outside till reduced to nine inches at
                    top. The two walls were tied together, at certain distances, by long
                    fire-bricks. This separation of the two walls was found to prevent the rapid
                    destruction of the chimney from the intensity of the fire, which always happened
                    when the two walls were in contact.</p>
                <p>Such was the construction of the furnace and the shape of the stills during the
                    time that rapid distillation was practised in Scotland, when both had been
                    brought to the greatest degree of perfection which the distillers were capable
                    of giving them. The writer of this article has not had an opportunity of seeing
                    the shape of the stills used by the Scotch distillers since the license-duty was
                    abolished. But it is probable that the old shape will not have been entirely
                    restored; but that the present stills, though much larger in size, imitate the
                    late stills in the great diameter of their bottom, and their comparative
                    shortness when compared with the stills employed by the English distillers.</p>
                <p>The top of the still ends in a kind of tube, which is bent downwards, and
                    connected with a tin tube, which makes a number of revolutions in a large vessel
                    filled with cold water, and therefore called the worm. This large vessel is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">refrigeratory,</hi> and care is taken to keep the
                    water in it always cool by means of a stream of water which is constantly
                    flowing into it. The wash being put into the still, and the top being fixed
                    down, heat is applied to the vessel till it is made to boil. The spirits being
                    more volatile than the water, pass over first in the state of steam, and are
                    condensed into a liquid as they pass through the worm. The first portions that
                    come over are very strong; but the strength diminishes as the process proceeds.
                    The distiller continues the distillation till the liquid which flows front the
                    worm is as heavy as water, or at least so nearly so that the quantity of spirits
                    remaining is not considered as a compensation for continuing the process any
                    longer. The strength of the liquid proceeding from the worm is ascertained by a
                    small hydrometer, with which it is tried every now and then; and whenever a
                    certain mark on the instrument comes to coincide with the surface of the liquid,
                    a cock at the bottom of the still is opened, and what remains in the still is
                    let off. This liquor is called the <hi rend="italic">spent wash.</hi> It is a
                    muddy brown liquid, still containing a quantity of undecomposed saccharine<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193323798" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3798-0051"/> matter. It is
                    therefore used as food for cattle. These animals are fond of it, and soon fatten
                    upon it.</p>
                <p>To prevent the still from boiling over, which is apt to happen towards the
                    commencement of the distillation, it is usual to throw a piece of soap into the
                    vessel along with the wash. This substance is partly decomposed, and the oily
                    matter which it contains spreading on the surface, forms a thin coat, which
                    breaks the large bubbles when they reach it, and thus prevents the wash from
                    swelling beyond the requisite bulk. Butter would answer equally well with soap,
                    and would he less apt to give a disagreeable flavour to the spirits; but its
                    high price prevents the possibility of using it for that purpose. We have some
                    suspicion that hogs’ lard would answer. If it were found to do so, it would be
                    cheaper than soap, and less apt to give a bad flavour to the spirits. The
                    supposition, however, that soap communicates a disagreeable flavour to spirits,
                    though very generally entertained, is, we believe, a mistake. We have certainly
                    met with spirits distinctly tainted with soap, and having in consequence a
                    highly nauseous taste. But this was at a time when the rapid mode of distilling
                    was only on its progress to perfection, and was owing, we believe, to little
                    bits of the soap having been accidentally forced into the worm, and afterwards
                    dissolved by the spirits.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to lay down any rule with respect to the strength of the weak
                    spirit obtained by this first distillation, and which is called <hi
                    rend="italic">low wines</hi> in Scotland. That strength must depend partly upon
                    the original strength of the wort, partly on the attenuation which has taken
                    place during the fermentation, but chiefly upon the attention of the distiller
                    to distil off the whole of the spirituous portion of the wash. In a great number
                    of cases in which we have had the curiosity to determine the strength of the low
                    wincs in distilleries, we have found the specific gravity at 60°, differing but
                    little from 0'978; frequently a little weaker, and very rarely a little
                    stronger. Low wines of this strength contain the fifth part of their weight of
                    alcohol of the specific gravity 0 ’ 825; the remaining four fifths are
                    water.</p>
                <p>The low vyines are put into the still and subjected to a second distillation,
                    which in Scotland is called <hi rend="italic">doubling.</hi> The first portion
                    which comes over is a milky liquid, known by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >foreshot.</hi> Its taste is disagreeable, and on that account it is received by
                    itself, and returned back into the low wines to be subjected to another
                    distillation. The properties∙of the foreshot are owing to an oil with which it
                    is loaded. When the spirits begin to run transparent from the end of the worm,
                    they are allowed to run into a receiver prepared for them. Whenever their
                    specific gravity, determined by the hydrometer, has reached a certain point,
                    they are no longer allowed to flow into the receiver containing the spirits, but
                    into a place by themselves, and the distillation is continued till the liquid
                    coming over has approached very nearly to the specific gravity of water. This
                    third portion is called <hi rend="italic">faints.</hi> It is mixed with the low
                    wines and distilled again. Thus the distillation of the low wines is continued
                    till the whole of their alcoholic part is brought to that degree of strength
                    which fits them for the market. The strength at which the duty is levied on
                    -them is one to ten above hydrometer proof, which corresponds with the specific
                    gravity 0 ’ 90917. They are prohibited from sending out of their manufactory
                    spirits of greater strength than this, or of a strength under one in six below
                    proof, or of the specific gravity 0'9385. Between these two intervals the
                    specific gravity of their spirits may be considered as vibrating; for it is not
                    to be expected that they should be able always to produce spirits of exactly the
                    same specific gravity. We have found the spirits, as obtained by doubling, of a
                    specific gravity as low as 0∙908, and as high as 0∙925. No doubt they might be
                    obtained much stronger or much weaker than these two extremes, if there were any
                    object in view to induce the distiller to alter his usual practice.</p>
                <p>Such is the mode followed in Scotland in order to obtain whisky. The distillers
                    are at pains to purchase the best English barley which they can procure. They
                    are certainly in the right to select English barley for malting; for English
                    barley, when malted, yields more spirits than in the state of raw grain. But for
                    that portion of grain which they use in the distilleries without malting, it
                    would be their interest to employ the best big which they can procure; for good
                    big, while in the state of raw grain, yields rather more spirits than an equal
                    quantity of the best English barley; and as it can be purchased at a cheaper
                    rate than barley, it could obviously be employed with economy as a substitute
                    for that grain. Big is greatly deteriorated by malting it; of course it would be
                    improper to employ it in distilleries in that way; but the distillers might
                    employ it in the state of raw grain with great advantage.</p>
                <p> CIIAP. II. — OF THE MODE OF MANUFACTURING OTHER KINDS OF SPIRITS.</p>
                <p>In this chapter we shall merely make a few very short observations on the
                    processes followed by the distillers in other countries.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Dutch Geneva.</hi></p>
                <p>The Dutch have long been famous for the manufacture of an excellent kind of
                    spirits, known in Scotland by the name of <hi rend="italic">Gin,</hi> in England
                    by the name of <hi rend="italic">Hollands,</hi> and sometimes by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Geneva.</hi> W <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> e have been told
                    that the manufacture of it originated in the city of Geneva, and that this was
                    the origin of the name Geneva, still applied to it in commerce; but we have no
                    means of determining how far this statement may be depended on. We have not seen
                    in print any accurate account of the mode of making Geneva practised by the
                    Dutch; but the following account may, we believe, be relied on. We are indebted
                    for it to a friend, who about forty years ago went over to Holland on purpose to
                    make himself acquainted with the process. His object was to establish a similar
                    manufactory in Scotland. But the severe laws by which the Scotch distillers were
                    soon after bound put it out of his power to execute his plan.</p>
                <p>112 lbs. of barley malt, and 228 lbs. of rye-meal, are mashed together with 460
                    gallons of water of the temperature 162°. After the infusion has stood a
                    sufficient time, cold water is added till the strength of the wort is reduced to
                    45 lbs. per barrel. The whole is then put into a fermenting back, at the
                    temperature of 80°. ∙ The vessel is capable of holding about 500 gallons. Half a
                    gallon of yeast is added. The temperature rises to 90°, and the fermentation is
                    over in forty-eight hours. The attenuation is such that the strength of the wash
                    is not reduced lower than 12 or 15 lbs. per barrel. The wash is put into the
                    still with the, grains and all. The low wines, as usual, are distilled again,
                    and the spirits of the second distillation are rectified; so that the Hollands
                    pass thrice through the still. A few juniper berries and some hops are used to
                    communicate a peculiar flavour to the spirits.</p>
                <p>, Now, 45 lbs. per barrel constitute a wort so weak that it will not yield above
                    seven and a half per cent, of spirits of the usual strength; so that the produce
                    which the Dutch obtain from their wort cannot amount to much more than half what
                    the Scotch distillers are obliged to produce from theirs.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, from the preceding account, that the fermentation<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193323811" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3811-0052"/> is very imperfectly
                    accomplished in the Dutch process. The small quantity of yeast employed, and the
                    short time that the wort is allowed to ferment, necessarily imply imperfection
                    in the fermentation. And this is obviously the case, for the original strength
                    of 45 lbs. per barrel is only reduced to 15 lbs. per barrel. We have often seen
                    the attenuation of the porter-in the London breweries not much less complete.
                    What advantage is gained by putting the grains into the still along with the
                    wash we have not the means of determining. Such a practice can only be followed
                    in distilleries upon a very small scale. W*e do not see how it could be
                    practised in the Scotch distilleries. Indeed, we have no doubt whatever, that
                    when the mashing is repeated a sufficient number of times, and the grains
                    sufficiently washed with hot water, every thing likely to contribute to the
                    formation of spirits will be carried off.</p>
                <p>Every person acquainted with the flavour of Hollands and Ļowland whisky, must
                    admit that the former is greatly superior to the latter. Indeed the flavour of
                    Hollands is equal to that of malt whisky. This is owing in part to the small
                    proportion of raw grain used by the Dutch distillers. 112 lbs. of barley malt
                    may be reckoned at three bushels. We do not know the average weight of a bushel
                    of rye; but if we suppose it to be 50 lbs. 228 lbs. will amount to about 4∙∣
                    bushels; so that, in the Dutch distilleries, the malt bears to the raw grain the
                    proportion of two to three. We suspect that another reason of the superiority of
                    the Dutch spirit over the Scotch, is the small quantity of ycast employed by the
                    manufacturers of Hollands. The vast quantity of porter yeast used by the Scotch
                    distillers, often in a state almost approaching to putrefaction, cannot but have
                    an injurious effect upon the flavour of their spirits, and has undoubtedly
                    contributed to the superior reputation of Highland over Lowland whisky; for the
                    Highland distillers (especially the smugglers) have not the means of procuring
                    yeast from London. Of course their wash is less perfectly fermented, but the
                    flavour of their spirits is much more agreeable. We think, indeed, that the
                    flavour communicated by the yeast to Scotch Lowland whisky may be distinctly
                    perceived, and on that account are disposed to suspect that the flavour of the
                    spirits always suffers in proportion as the fermentation is brought nearer a
                    state of perfection. Any person who should find out a method of fermenting wort
                    without the necessity of employing such quantities of porter yeast as the
                    distillers use, would undoubtedly prodigiously improve the flavour of the
                    spirits manufactured by the Scotch distillers. If government were to make such
                    an alteration in the laws as would enable the distiller to employ a greater
                    proportion of malt without any material increase of expense, the object might be
                    considered as accomplished. In the present state of the manufactures of Great
                    Britain, it would be impossible to confer a greater favour on the country than a
                    thorough revisal of the excise laws, under the auspices of a set of individuals
                    at once intimately acquainted with the most improved state of chemical science,
                    and with the most liberal principles of political economy. Every thing that
                    improves the quality and diminishes the price of our manufactures is of more
                    value to the country than our legislators seem to be aware of.</p>
                <p>We do not think that Hollands could be manufactured in Great Britain with any
                    probability of success. The experiment was tried at Maidstone, in Kent, by a Mr
                    Bishop, who had interest enough with Mr Pitt to get a special clause introduced
                    into an act of parliament permitting him to manufacture Hollands according to
                    the Dutch method; but the manufactory was never successful. The Maidstone
                    Hollands never acquired much reputation. The distillery languished for some
                    years, and then terminated in a bankruptcy. Some attempts have been lately made
                    to revive the Maidstone establishment; but we may venture to predict that they
                    will not be successful.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Plum.</hi></p>
                <p>This is the name given to a spirit manufactured in the West India islands, from
                    the molasses, &amp;c. which remain after the sugar is separated in small
                    crystals from the boiled juice of the sugar cane. We do not know any thing about
                    the origin of the word <hi rend="italic">rum,</hi> or the time at which the
                    manufacture of this spirit commenced; not, probably, till after the West Indies
                    were colonized by Europeans. At present it is chiefly in the islands belonging
                    to Great Britain that this spirit is made. The process, as we obtained it from a
                    Dominica planter, who had for many years been in the habit of making this
                    spirit, is as follows:</p>
                <p>Twelve parts of sweets are dissolved in 100 parts of water, and fermented as
                    completely as possible by means of yeast, which is chiefly obtained in the
                    distillery itself by means of the fermentation of the rum wort, which gradually
                    generates it. Fourteen gallons of spirits, one to ten over proof, are obtained
                    from 100 gallons of wash. If this statement be correct, the produce of spirit
                    from molasses exceeds considerably what can be obtained in this country from
                    barley. A solution of 12 parts of sugar in 100 of water would make a wort
                    containing about 44 lbs. of saccharine matter per barrel; from 10Ó gallons of
                    which, in this country, we would not obtain more than 8 gallons of spirits of
                    the above strength; but we suspect some mistake on the part of our informer, as
                    he communicated the process to us in this country several years after he had
                    given over the actual superintendence of his rum distillery.</p>
                <p>The peculiar flavour which distinguishes rum, and makes it so agreeable to the
                    taste, is undoubtedly owing to a peculiar oil contained in the sugar-cane; for
                    when spirits are made in this country from sugar, they are entirely destitute of
                    the peculiar flavour of rum, and resemble, in their properties, the common
                    spirit made in this country from barley. The colour of rum is derived from the
                    oak casks in which it comes to this country from the islands in which it is
                    made.</p>

                <p>In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Brewing</hi> we have given a short sketch of
                    the facts hitherto ascertained respecting the nature of the change which
                    saccharine matter undergoes when fermented; and we have very little to add to
                    the facts stated in that article. We shall merely enter a little more minutely
                    into the detail of facts than we thought necessary under the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Brewing.</hi></p>
                <p>Common sugar has been analysed by Gay-Lussac and Thenard, by Berzelius, and by Dr
                    Prout. The method followed by each differed a little from that of the others,
                    and the results, though they do not quite tally, certainly approach considerably
                    to each other. The following table exhibits the composition of 100 parts of
                    sugar, according to each of these chemists:</p>

                    over oxide of lead, the oxide was at first dissolved; but, after a certain
                    interval of time, a light white powder makes its appearance. This powdcr is a

                    the weight of an atom of sugar is 10. But we have no evidence whatever for
                    adopting one atom of sugar in this compound rather than two. And as one atom

                <p>From the phenomena of fermentation, as described under the present article, and

                    fermentation the sugar is decomposed and converted into alcohol and carbonic
                    acid. Alcohol, according to the analysis of Theodore de Saussure, is composed of
                    three atoms hydrogen, two atoms carbon, and one atom oxygen. Carbonic acid is
                    composed of two atoms oxygen and one atom carbon. Hence the weight of an
                    integrant particle of alcohol is 2∙875. For</p>
