                <p><label type="entry">DISCORD</label>, in general, signifies disagreement or
                    opposition between different persons or things.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Discord,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Music,</hi> is every
                    sound which, joined with another, forms an assemblage disagreeable to the ear;
                    or rather, every interval whose extremes do not coalesce. Now, as there are no
                    other concords or consonances, excepting those which form amongst themselves,
                    and with their fundamental sound, perfect chords, it follows that every interval
                    must be a real dissonance or discord; even the third and sixth were reckoned
                    such among the ancients, who excluded them from the number of consonant
                    chords.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">dissonaìice,</hi> which is synonymous with discord, is
                    compounded of two words, namely, the inseparable preposition r‰ and the verb <hi
                    rend="italic">sonare</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> which, both in a literal and
                    metaphorical sense, signifies <hi rend="italic">disagreement</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">disunion.</hi> In reality, that which renders dissonances grating,
                    is, that the sounds which form them, so far from uniting in the ear, seem to
                    repel ea^h other, and are heard each by itself as two distinct sounds, though
                    produced at the same time.</p>
                <p>This repulsion or violent oscillation of sounds is heard more or less, as the
                    vibrations which produce it are more or less frequently coincident. When two
                    vocal strings are gradually tuned till they approach a consonant interval, the
                    pulsations become slower as the chord grows more just, till at last they are
                    scarcely heard, if heard at all; and hence it appears certain, that the pleasure
                    produced in us by harmony results from the more or less exact and frequent
                    coincidence or vibration; though the reason why this coincidence should afford
                    pleasure, more than any other modification or combination of sounds, appears to
                    us inscrutable. The agreeable effects of dissonance in harmony are no objection
                    to this theory; since it is allowed that the sensations excited by discord are
                    not in themselves immediately and necessarily pleasing, but only please by
                    auricular deception. The ear is surprised with the shock it receives, without
                    being able to imagine how it should have happened; and in proportion as it is
                    harsh and grating, we feel the pleasure of returning harmony enhanced, and the
                    disappointment of being artfully and insensibly extricated more agreeable.</p>
                <p>The name of <hi rend="italic">dissonance</hi> is given sometimes to the interval,
                    and sometimes also to each of the two sounds which form it. But though two
                    sounds equally form a dissonance between themselves, this term is most
                    frequently applied to that sound in particular which is most extraneous to the
                    chord.</p>
                <p>The number of possible dissonances is indefinite; but as in music we exclude all
                    intervals which are not found in the system received, the number of dissonances
                    is reduced to a very few; besides, in practice we can only select from those few
                    such as are agreeable to the species, and the mode in which we compose; and,from
                    this last number we must exclude such as cannot be used consistently with the
                    rules prescribed. But what, it may be asked, are these rules? Have they any
                    foundation in nature, or are they merely arbitrary? This is what Rousseau, whom
                    in this article we have followed or abandoned as his observations appeared
                    useful or frivolous, purposes to investigate as its principal object.</p>
                <p>But where does his scrutiny terminate? Not in the abolition of the rules
                    prescribed. These have still subsisted, and will continue to subsist, while the
                    frame of man, and the nature of music, remain what they are. If, then, the rules
                    be permanent and universal, the principle upon which they are founded may be
                    latent or ambiguous; but the rules themselves can never be purely arbitrary. How
                    else could it happen that Rameau, D’Alembert, and Rousseau should admit the
                    force and effect of these rules, whilst each of these masters exerted his whole
                    genius to give a different account of their cause and origin? Rousseau himself,
                    as we have seen in a former article, inculcates the necessity of dissonances for
                    the completion of harmony. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Chord.) Now,</hi> if this
                    be true, the easiest methods of introducing and dismissing these discords must
                    be the most eligible, and of consequence the rules for using them must be
                    established. It is not then upon the subsistence or demolition of any particular
                    theory that they depend. Were we to attend to the particular objections which
                    may be uιged against any system whatever, where is the theory which will be
                    found proof against the efforts of scepticism? After all, the objections of
                    Rousseau to Rameau’s theory, as applied by D’Alembert to the origin of
                    consonances, appear to be much more frivolous than the analogies from which he
                    pretends that this origin was deduced. It appears from D’Alembert’s exposition
                    of this theory, that, if not for all, it affords a solution for the most
                    material and essential phenomena in harmony, which is sufficient for its
                    establishment, until another can be found which will give a rational and
                    consistent account of the whole; a discovery which has not yet been made. But
                    whilst we acknowledge the futility of Rousseau’s objections against D’Alembert’s
                    explication of dissonances, we must at the same time admire the ingenuity with
                    which he has deduced them from principles purely mechanical, without departing
                    from the system of Rameau. This mechanical explication will be found in his
                    Musical Dictionary, under the article <hi rend="italic">Dissonance.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Discord,</hi> the goddess of, in Pagan theology. She is
                    represented by Aristides with fiery eyes, a pale countenance, livid lips, and
                    wearing a dagger in her bosom. It was she who at the marriage of Peleus and
                    Thetis threw in the golden apple, on which was written “To the fairest,” and
                    which occasioned a contention between the goddesses Juno, Minerva, and Venus,
                    each pretending a title to the apple. She was likewise called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ate</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Eris.</hi></p>
