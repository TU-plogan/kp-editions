                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    a most ancient record, made in the time of William the Conqueror, and containing
                    a survey of all the lands of England. It consists of two volumes, namely, a
                    greater and a less. The first is a large folio, written on 382 double pages of
                    vellum, in a small but plain character, each page having a double column. Some
                    of the capital letters and principal passages are touched with red ink, and some
                    have strokes of red ink run across them, as if scratched out. This volume
                    contains the description of thirty-one counties. The other volume is in quarto,
                    written upon 450 double pages of vellum, but in a single column, and in a large
                    but very fair character. It contains the counties of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk,
                    part of the county of Rutland, included in that of Northampton, and part of
                    Lancashire, in the counties of York and Chester.</p>
                <p>This work, according to the red book in the exchequer, was begun by order of
                    William the Conqueror, with the advice of his parliament, in the year 1080, and
                    completed in the year 1086. The reason given for taking this survey, as assigned
                    by several ancient records and historians, was, that every man should be
                    satisfied with his own right, and not usurp with impunity what belonged to
                    another. But besides this, it is stated by others, that all those who possessed
                    landed estates now became vassals to the king, and paid him so much money by way
                    of fee or homage, in proportion to the lands they held; a circumstance which
                    appears very probable, as there was at that time extant a general survey of the
                    whole kingdom, made by order of King Alfred.</p>
                <p>For the execution of this survey recorded in Domesday-book, commissioners were
                    sent into every county and shire, and juries summoned in each hundred, out of
                    all orders of freemen, from barons down to the lowest farmers. These
                    commissioners were to» be informed by the inhabitants, upon oath, of the name of
                    each manor and that of its owner, also by whom it was held in the time of Edward
                    the Confessor; the number of hides; the quantity of wood, of pasture, and of
                    meadow land; how many ploughs tvere in the demesne, and how many in the tenanted
                    part of it; how many mills, and how many fish-ponds or fisheries belonged,to it;
                    the value of the whole in the time of King Edward, as well as when granted by
                    King William, and at the time of this survey; and also whether it was capable of
                    improvement or of being advanced in value. They were likewise directed to return
                    the tenants of every degree, the quantity of lands then and formerly held by
                    each of them, what was the number of villeins or slaves, and also the number and
                    kinds of their cattle and live stock. These inquisitions being first methodized
                    in the county, were afterwards sent up to the king’s exchequer.</p>
                <p>This survey, at the time when it was made, gave great offence to the people, and
                    occasioned a suspicion that it was intended for some new impost. But
                    notwithstanding all the precaution taken by the Conqueror to have the survey
                    faithfully and impartially executed, it appears that a false return was given in
                    by some of the commissioners, probably, as is alleged, from a pious motive. This
                    was particularly the case with the abbey of Croyland in Lincolnshire, the
                    possessions of which were greatly underrated, both with regard to quantity and
                    value. Perhaps more of these pious frauds were discovered, as it is said Ralph
                    Flambard, minister to William Rufus, proposed <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193324435" xml:id="kp-eb0708-4435-0100"/>making a fresh and more
                    rigorous inquisition; but this was never carried into operation.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the proof of its falsehood in some instances, which must throw a
                    suspicion on all others, the authority of Domesday-book was never permitted to
                    be called in question; and when it has been necessary to distinguish whether
                    lands were held in ancient demesne or in any other manner, recourse was al
                    ways-had to Domesday-book, and to it only, in order to determine the doubt. From
                    this definitive authority, from which, as from the sentence pronounced at
                    domesday, or the day of judgment, there could be no appeal, the name of the book
                    is said to have been derived. But Stowe assigns another reason for this
                    appellation, namely, that Domesday-book is a corruption of “<hi rend="italic"
                    >domus</hi><hi rend="italic">Dei</hi> book ;” a title given it because
                    heretofore it was deposited in the king’s treasury, in a place of the church of
                    Westminster or Winchester called <hi rend="italic">domus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Dei.</hi> From the great care formerly taken to preserve this survey, we may
                    learn the estimation in which it was held. In the dialogue de Sacrariis it is
                    said, <hi rend="italic">Liber ille</hi> (meaning Domesday-book) <hi
                    rend="italic">sigilli regis</hi><hi rend="italic">comes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >est individuus</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">thesauro.</hi>
                    Until latterly it has been kept under three different locks and keys; one in
                    custody of the treasurer, and the others in that of the two chamberlains of the
                    exchequer. It is now deposited in the chapter-house at Westminster, where it may
                    be consulted, on paying to the proper officers a fee of six-and-eightpence for a
                    search, and fourpence per line for the matter transcribed from it.</p>
                <p>Besides the two volumes above mentioned, there is also a third made by order of
                    the same king, and which differs from the others in form rather than in matter.
                    There is likewise a fourth, which is kept in the exchequer, and which, though a
                    very large volume, is only an abridgment of the others. In the remembrancer’s
                    office in the exchequer there is kept a fifth book, also called Domesday, which
                    is the same with the fourth book already mentioned. King Alfred had a roll which
                    he called Domesday; and the Domesday-book made by William the Conqueror referred
                    to the time of Edward the Confessor, as that of King Alfred did to the time of
                    Ethelred. As the fourth book of Domesday had many pictures and gilt letters in
                    the beginning, relating to the time of King Edward the Confessor, this led some
                    into an opinion altogether erroneous, namely, that Domesday-book was composed in
                    the reign of King Edward.</p>
