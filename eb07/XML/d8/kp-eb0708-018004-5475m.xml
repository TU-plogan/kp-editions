                <p><label type="entry">DRAWING</label>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Drawing</hi> is the art of representing forms upon a flat
                    surface, by means of any sort of instruments, such as pencils, chalks, and the
                    like. It is also a word used to denote the forms or contours of the figures in
                    compositions, or in sculpture generally. Thus we say that the drawing in a
                    picture, or the drawing of a statue, or any other figure, is of a high or an
                    inferior kind, good or bad.</p>
                <p>This art is well known to be of the most remote antiquity, and it has been in use
                    amongst the most barbarous and most civilized nations for a variety of purposes.
                    The hieroglyphic figures, whether carved or painted, upon the ancient Egyptian
                    obelisksand temples, the ornaments of the same description upon their buildings
                    and sarcophagi, together with the like productions amongst the Mexicans, prove
                    the ancient origin of the art. Some of the purest and best of the Egyptian
                    sculptures, and particularly the figures of the harpers, described and
                    illustrated by Bruce the traveller, exhibit a knowledge and correctness of taste
                    in the art far surpassing what is usually admitted, and show that the Greek
                    school in this, as well as in their other acquirements, was greatly indebted to
                    the Egyptians for pointing out the road to that excellence of form and dignity
                    of character and expression which their matchless works possess.</p>
                <p>Although examples of drawings by the Greeks have not come down to us, their
                    magnificent statues assure us that their proficiency in the art must have been
                    of the highest order; and certain expressions of Pliny, in describing their
                    pictures, evidently indicate that the Greeks must have attained to the utmost
                    excellence in drawing, at the period of their glory as a nation. It is not our
                    intention to load this article with ancient historical information respecting
                    the fine arts, otherwise many curious anecdotes might be introduced; but we
                    cannot pass over the mention of Alexander’s emotion on seeing a picture of
                    Palamedes when betrayed by his friends, which forcibly reminded the hero of his
                    own treatment of Aristonicus; nor can we refrain from noticing the picture of
                    Agamemnon and Iphigenia by Timanthes, so highly extolled by Cicero Quintilian,
                    Valerius Maximus, and Pliny, as satisfactory proofs of the excellence of the
                    ancients in drawing and painting, as well as in their scupltures and
                    architecture. From the emotions which the higher excellencies of the pictures by
                    the Greek artists produced in these gifted men, a fair inference may be drawn as
                    to the perfection to which the art must have attained at the period of Grecian
                    glory; and consequently drawing, even in the confined sense of the word, must
                    have also been in a corresponding state of advancement. Their principal schools
                    were at Sicyon, Rhodes, Athens, and Corinth; and when Greece was subdued by the
                    Romans, the conquerors, alive to the benefits to be derived from the sciences
                    and arts, encouraged the cultivation of them in their own capital, to which the
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193325488" xml:id="kp-eb0708-5488-0181"/> Greek artists
                    resorted, and laid the foundation of the Roman school.</p>
                <p>From the conquests of Alaric and Attila in the fifth century, the arts lay
                    prostrate and neglected, until their revival about the year 1450 at Florence,
                    where DominicoGhirlandaio, the master of Michel Angelo, practised painting with
                    considerable reputation, -which his pictures show he well merited.</p>
                <p>We have now arrived at the golden age of the arts amongst the moderns, for Michel
                    Angelo must be admitted to have been the first to discover and practise them
                    with the classical discernment and skill which ultimately led him to the highest
                    eminence amongst his contemporaries as a painter, a sculptor, an architect, and
                    engineer, and deservedly placed his reputation on a level with the greatest
                    names of antiquity. Till his time painters were considered as mere mechanics or
                    labourers, and their employment was almost entirely confined to making
                    representations of saints, and other figures used by the superstitious of the
                    age. It was at this period, and surrounded by the wretched examples of such
                    artists as Ci-niabue, Giotto, and others, that Michel Angelo, upon examining the
                    torso of the Belvidere, instantly abandoned the barbarous taste and style of his
                    master, and bounded into that sublime path which has been the admiration of all.
                    “The poetry of the art,” says Sir Joshua Reynolds, “he possessed in the most
                    eminent degree; and the same daring spirit which first urged him to explore the
                    unknown regions of the imagination, impelled him forward in his career beyond
                    those limits which his followers, destitute of the same incentives, had not
                    strength to pass. He was the bright luminary from whom painting has borrowed a
                    new lustre, under whose hands it assumed a new appearance, and became another
                    and superior art.”</p>
                <p>Raffaelle Santio, the pupil of Pietro Perugino, was born on Good Friday in the
                    year 1483, and died on Good Friday in the year 1520, so that he only lived
                    thirty-seven years. He must be admitted to have surpassed all the moderns in
                    drawing and painting, though his design does not possess those sublime
                    conceptions to be found in the works of his rival Michel Angelo. Generally
                    speaking, the choice of his subjects is simple and pleasing, for he cared not to
                    grapple with those severe attitudes and expressions to be found in the works of
                    his gifted contemporary; but his compositions are invariably correct and
                    harmonious, and his drawing careful, elegant, and pure. It is to his school that
                    we would recommend the student to look for those examples which will be of the
                    greatest practical benefit to hint in drawing; a circumstance which ought to be
                    his first and principal aim.</p>
                <p>It is not the proper place here to enter into the history of painting in Italy
                    after its revival by the two great masters whose names and characteristic
                    excellencies we have just mentioned. This we reserve for the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Painting</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">;</hi> and we now proceed to
                    explain the practical details of the management and manipulation of drawing in
                    its various styles.</p>
                <p>Drawing, as we have already stated, is that part of the art which represents the
                    forms of objects upon a flat surface, and maybe divided into outlining and
                    shading; and as the chief attributes of almost all objects are embraced in the
                    correctness of their forms, the student of art should labour with the utmost
                    pains and assiduity in order to acquire severe accuracy in his outline, without
                    which the most dexterous shading and finishing will be worse than thrown
                    away.</p>
                <p>In whatever department the genius of the student may lead him to practise, habits
                    of correctness will be most successfully cultivated by drawing the human figure,
                    the knowledge of which is the basis of all true excellence. The study ought to
                    be begun by copying the most simple parts, such as we have exhibited in Plates
                    CXC., CXCI., CXCII., CXCIII.; and the greatest anxiety to attain accuracy in the
                    gentle undulations of form ought to be evinced. We would recommend that
                    perspective should be studied at the earliest stage of the pupil’s practice. By
                    means of a knowledge of its rules, which are simple, much time will be spared to
                    the student, and excellence more speedily acquired than when directed only by
                    his eye in the practice of drawing, whatever the object may be-</p>
                <p>Although it matters little what the instrument may be which isuscdin the practice
                    of drawing,yet,uponthewhole, we would recommend black and white chalks as the
                    most to be preferred. They are easily procured, and convenient for use. They are
                    usually fixed in an instrument of brass or steel, as represented below, the
                    white chalk being placed at the one end, and the black at the other.</p>
                <p>The paper should be slightly tinged with colour, so that the white chalk which is
                    put upon the lights may tell properly. Crayon paper is the best. The outline
                    being carefully made, first with charcoal as slightly as possible, and then
                    corrected and smoothed with the black chalk, the shading may be executed as the
                    taste of the student inclines. It may either be done with careful hatchings at
                    particular angles, or in one solid smooth mass, or by a combination of both,
                    which is probably the most advisable mode of practice. Too much attention to
                    elaborate hatchings may divert the attention of the student from the more
                    essential excellencies of the outline, and proper balance of light and shade;
                    and a too careless manner in using his materials may lead to equal
                    disadvantages, for in art, as in every thing else, carelessness in the beginning
                    can never lead to excellence in the end. Much time in laying in the shadows may
                    be spared by using an instrument called a stump, made of a piece of shamois
                    leather rolled up in a cylindrical form, in a tight manner, tied round with
                    thread, and shaped to a blunt point, as represented below.</p>
                <p>A little chalk-powder may be dusted upon the shadow if extensive, and rubbed in
                    with the instrument above described, and afterwards the part finished up with
                    the chalk. The white chalk should not be used until the drawing is completed
                    with the black, otherwise it is apt to get injured by admixture, which in no
                    instance should be the case, for there ought always to be a space between the
                    two chalks occupied by the tint of the paper.</p>
                <p>The black chalk will be found to work very well upon white as well as coloured
                    paper; but the process is more tedious, in consequence of all the middle or
                    light tints having to be attended to and executed, which, in the case of the
                    other paper, the tint produces. Errors in outline or shading may be rectified by
                    rubbing out the defect with a piece of bread squeezed into a convenient shape
                    between the finger and thumb.</p>
                <p>After the student has acquired some degree of proficiency in using the chalk, and
                    imitating any drawing or print which may be given him, he should next begin to
                    copy from real substances, or what is technically termed drawing from “the
                    round.”</p>
                <p>Here a wide field is opened up to him in the study of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193325501" xml:id="kp-eb0708-5501-0182"/>the antique statues; and
                    while striving to attain accuracy in copying these noble reliques of art, he
                    should consider deeply their high character and expression. It is not to be
                    expected that a very extensive set of examples of the antique, or a discussion
                    and detail of their merits, can be given here; all that we can do is to lead the
                    student to the proper source whence he may draw supplies; and with this view we
                    would recommend him to peruse and contemplate the statues of the Apollo
                    Belvidere, the Venus de’ Medici, the Gladiator Borghese, the Torso of the
                    Belvidere, and the matchless group of the Laocoon, at the time he is copying
                    them in the way of practice. See Plates CXCIV., CXCV., CXCVI., CXCVII.,
                    CXCVHI.</p>
                <p>We have hitherto only considered the drawing of the human figure, and that in
                    black and white chalks. Another very good way of producing a spirited effect is,
                    by a union of both these with red chalk, a method much practised by the cſld
                    masters in their academy figures, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The following are the measures of the human body, as taken by Fresnoy from the
                    ancient statues. The ancients have commonly allowed eight heads to their
                    figures, though some of them have allowed but seven. The figure is ordinarily
                    divided into ten faces; that is to say, from the crown of the head to the sole
                    of the foot, in the following manner:</p>
                <p>From the crown of the head to the forehead is the third part of a face.</p>
                <p>The face begins at the root of the lowest hairs which are upon the forehead, and
                    ends at the bottom of the chin.</p>
                <p>The face is divided into three proportionable parts, the first contains the
                    forehead, the second the nose, and the third the mouth and the chin; from the
                    chin to the pit betwixt the collar-bones is two lengths of a nose.</p>
                <p>From the pit betwixt the collar-bones to the bottom of the breast one face.</p>
                <p>From the bottom of the breast to the navel one face.</p>
                <p>From the navel to the genitories one face.</p>
                <p>From the genitories to the upper part of the knee two faces.</p>
                <p>The knee contains half a face.</p>
                <p>From the lower part of the knee to the ankle two faces. From the ankle to the
                    sole of the foot half a face.</p>
                <p>A man, when his arms are stretched out, is from the longest finger of his right
                    hand to the longest finger of ’ his left, as broad as he is long.</p>
                <p>From one side of the breast to the other, two faces.</p>
                <p>The bone of the arm, called humerus, is the length of two faces from the shoulder
                    to the elbow.</p>
                <p>From the end of the elbow to the root of the little finger, the bone called
                    cubitus, with part of the hand, contains two faces.</p>
                <p>From the box of the shoulder-blade to the pit betwixt the collar-bones, one
                    face.</p>
                <p>If you would be satisfied in the measure of breadth from the extremity of one
                    finger to the other, so that this breadth should be equal to· the length of the
                    body, you must observe that the boxes of the elbows with the humerus, and of the
                    humerus with the shoulder-blade, bear the proportion of half a face when the
                    arms arc stretched out.</p>
                <p>The sole of the foot is the sixth part of the figure.</p>
                <p>The hand is the length of a face.</p>
                <p>The thumb contains a nose.</p>
                <p>The inside of the arm, where the muscle disappears which makes the breast (called
                    the pectoral muscle), to the middle of the arm, four noses.</p>
                <p>From the middle of the arm to the beginning of the head five noses.</p>
                <p>The longest toe is a nose long.</p>
                <p>The utmost parts of the teats and the pit betwixt the collar-bones of a woman
                    make an equilateral triangle.</p>
                <p>For the breadth of the limbs no precise measures can be given, because the
                    measures themselves are changeable, according to the quality of the persons, and
                    according to the movement of the muscles.</p>
                <p>The best example of the measures of an ancient statue are by Audran, an author
                    whom Sir Joshua Reynolds recommends as being the most useful; and on this
                    department of our subject we now add the following table of the measurements and
                    comparisons of the three celebrated statues of the Apollo, the Venus, and the
                    Hercules, as published by Volpato and Morghen at Rome, in a work called <hi

                    Disegno.</hi> To preserve uniformity in the measurements, the head of each
                    figure is divided into twelve parts, and each part into six minutes.</p>

                </table>
                <p>In the foregoing table, we by no means have set down the ancient formula as an
                    infallible guide, since the changes which the human form undergoes from infancy
                    to old age preclude the possibility of limiting its measurements to definite
                    proportions, and much depends upon the order or rank of the figure to be
                    represented. Thus the Apollo Belvidere and the Venus dc’ Medici have more than
                    ten faces in their length; and in other respects these figures, which by their
                    authors were intended to represent divinities, are considerably different in
                    their proportions from others of the antique statues. It is enough if something
                    approximating to accuracy of measurement be kept in view when the student is
                    engaged in making his drawing; and this he should do without the use of
                    compasses or any other mathematical means, which ultimately cramp his powers of
                    imitation, and retard his progress towards perfection.</p>
                <p>Light and shade are the means by which the actual appearance of substance in the
                    object represented is conveyed, and they should be studied with every attention,
                    from the objects themselves which are assumed as the models for imitation. No
                    rules can be laid dow n so good as the study of nature herself, and no language
                    can explain the beauties of her varied appearances of lights, shadow's, or
                    reflections.</p>
                <p>It is by means of light and shade also that the figures in a picture or
                    composition are made to keep their proper places: thus the principal figure is
                    generally illuminated with the strongest and broadest light, and the others kept
                    subordinate. It is with considerable diffidence, however, that we state this as
                    the practice most to be approved of: every artist, and indeed every school, has
                    a peculiar mode of management in this, and <hi rend="italic">we</hi> are aware
                    that a different practice has often produced excellent results.</p>
                <p>The general rule with regard to the relative proportions of light, shadow, and
                    middle tint in a well-ordered effect is, that there should be rather more shadow
                    than light, and more middle tint than either of the former, provided the subject
                    does not require a different arrangement. In the infinite variety of forms of
                    composition of the various schools, rules for the attainment of excellence can
                    hardly be laid down with safety; and we must on this account refer the student
                    to the contemplation of the works of the most esteemed masters, for examples to
                    direct him in the practice of the chiar’ oscuro of his pictures.</p>
                <p>The study of anatomy is of the utmost importance towards a correct knowledge of
                    the human figure, and is most beneficial in leading the way to an accurate
                    representation of its various parts and attitudes. Without it no proper estimate
                    can be formed of the movements of the joints of the limbs, nor of the swellings
                    and undulations of the muscles, which, when in action, are constantly varying,
                    and must be seized at the moment. It was by the careful study of this branch of
                    science that Michel Angelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and other eminent artists,
                    attained to such excellence in representing the forms when engaged in action,
                    and displayed that accuracy of outline and show of energy which appear in the
                    various members of their figures.</p>
                <p>The most necessary preparation for all drawings executed with Indian ink, sepia,
                    bistre, or the like, is an accurate outline, which should be made with a
                    black-lead pencil, or pen and ink if the work is only meant to be finished in a
                    sketchy manner. Care must be taken in both to regulate the strength of the touch
                    or line by the nearness or distance of the object represented. The shades should
                    be laid in a good deal lighter at first than they are intended to be when the
                    drawing is finished, and the hard edges of the touches softened with a water
                    brush. The greater the attention paid to the subject as a whole in this stage,
                    and the broader and less minute the washes are laid on, the better; for it is
                    only as the drawing advances towards completion that the minutiae should be
                    attended to. In Plate CCI. we have given an example of the method of proceeding
                    with a drawing washed in with one colour only. Fig. 1 exhibits the outline; fig.
                    2 the first broad wash; fig. 3 the second working; and fig. 4 the finished
                    drawing. Each shading should be allowed to dry thoroughly before the succeeding
                    wash is laid on; and there are many modes, we had almost said tricks, by which
                    certain excellent effects are produced, which are only to be acquired by
                    practice. Thus the use of a sharp pointed penknife will be found most
                    serviceable in taking out irregularly-formed lights in the foreground; and much
                    advantage will be found in w iping out lights and middle tints with a towel or
                    handkerchief during the progress of the work; but regarding these no rules can
                    be laid down. The artist must usc bis own discretion; though too much of such
                    practice is not to be recommended.</p>
                <p>The study of landscape ought to be commenced by imitating the most simple forms,
                    as in the following figures.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193325527" xml:id="kp-eb0708-5527-0184"/>
                <p>These or similar figures may be copied two or three times over before attempting
                    such a work as we have given in Plate CCI. Plate CC. exhibits two examples of
                    the style of sketching-landscape by Claude; and we strongly recommend Turner’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Liher Studiorum</hi> to the careful perusal of the young
                    artist in this department. The studies of the human figure by Raffaellc,
                    Parmegiano, and others, or their imitations by Rodgers, are the best.</p>
                <p>There is no branch of the art in which such a variety of means may be adopted for
                    attaining the same end, namely, the imitation of nature, as in water-colour
                    drawing; consequently we shall not attempt to lay down particular rules for the
                    guidance of the student. Practice, as we have already stated, is the only means
                    of arriving at the wished-for perfection; we shall therefore limit our notice to
                    a few of the details most in use among painters in water colours.</p>
                <p>The substances used in painting in water colours are to be had in all the shops
                    in prepared cakes, which are rubbed down upon a stone pallet or plate with a
                    little water. The paper upon which the drawing is to be made may be either
                    smooth or rough; and if greasy on the surface, so that the colours do not adhere
                    pleasantly, it may be sponged over, or the colours may be mixed with a little
                    ox-gall, either in its-native or prepared state. One drop of gall in the former
                    condition, or the size of a large pin head in the latter, will be enough to
                    saturate a tea-cupful of water for the purpose of mixing with or softening off
                    the colours.</p>
                <p>The paintschiefly used are ultra-marine blue, indigo, Antwerp and cobalt blues,
                    gamboge, ochre, Indian, and crome yellows, Indian red, vermilion, lake, carmine,
                    burnt ochre, and brown pink reds; and although these may be denominated the
                    primaries out of which all other modifications of tints can be made up, yet we
                    may add to them a number of browns which will be found to be serviceable, such
                    as terra di sienna, both raw and burn t,Vandyke brown, umber, sepia, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The paper ought to be stretched upon a drawing board or frame, which is effected
                    by soaking it in water, or by sponging it over on both sides, then removing the
                    superabundant water with a piece of blotting paper or towel, and afterwards
                    folding back the edge for about an inch all round, and applying the paste to the
                    folded portion, and also to that part of the drawing board which the paper is to
                    adhere to. The part so pasted should be pressed strongly, or the finger may be
                    dipped into the paste and rubbed upon the pasted edge, and then the paper
                    sponged all over, that the pasted edge maybe permitted to dry more quickly than
                    the centre part. Care must be taken not to let any of the paste touch the middle
                    of the paper, which would destroy the drawing when cut from the board.</p>
                <p>Whatever may be the subject, it will be advisable to begin with light colour, and
                    gradually work up both effect of light and shadow, and strength of tint, in a
                    broad manner, without much attention to minutiae, as already described in Indian
                    ink drawing. The earlier water-colour painters were in the practice of working
                    with a gray or neuter tint at the commencement of their drawings; and as this
                    method is very simple, it will be the best for beginners, though in the end
                    there will not be produced that richness of effect, and freshness, depth, and
                    warmth of colour, which is the result of the contrary practice of the best
                    masters of the present day; we mean the laying on of the colours almost at once,
                    without any under preparation of neuter tint. In landscape painting, the paper
                    where the sky is represented ought to be well soaked with water from a sponge,
                    and afterwards dried moderately with a towel or piece of bibulous paper, to make
                    the tints lie on <pb break="no" facs="nls:193325540"

                    into each other while the surface is damp, and this should be done with large
                    brushes. After the sky and distance are laid in, the middle and foregrounds
                    should be added, and the details worked out as the taste or ability of the
                    artist may lead him, for it is impossible to prescribe rules where no two
                    artists follow the same practice.</p>
                <p>The appearance of air may be given to the distance by washes of ultramarine or
                    other semi-transparent colours; and the spaces where sharp distinct lights are
                    situated may be scraped out with a pen-knife, or the touches may be laid in with
                    clean water, and after being allowed to remain upon the paper for a minute or
                    less, they may be rubbed out with a piece of stale bread. Another mode of
                    leaving out the lights is to touch the places with pipe-clay, used in a liquid
                    state, with a camel’s hair pencil, and after wards the colour may be freely laid
                    over them; the parts where the clay is laid have then only to be rubbed with
                    bread or Indian rubber, to remove the tint, and expose the clean paper. Should
                    any error, either in outline or effect of chiar’ oscuro, have been committed,
                    the whole space can be removed with a sponge and water, without much injury to
                    the paper; indeed many of the best artists of the present day rub out and lay in
                    their colours almost alternately, by which means a very great variety of surface
                    and tint is obtained which could not be effected by any other practice.</p>
                <p>We have thus endeavoured to give what we hope will be found a satisfactory
                    account of practical drawing, whether in chalk or water colour; and it now
                    remains for us to recommend, for the student’s careful perusal, Leonardo da
                    Vinci <hi rend="italic">on Painting·,</hi> the works of Sir Joshua Reynolds;
                    Burnet <hi rend="italic">on Light and Shadow in Painting, on Colour in Painting,
                    on Composition in Painting</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the works of the old
                    masters, whether their drawings or etchings; and, above all, the study of
                    nature. Every one who has long been in the habit of copying from drawings alone,
                    of whatever description, must have felt considerable diffidence in attempting to
                    draw from real objects or from nature. This arises from the fear of being unable
                    properly to reduce and hold in their relative place, on a sheet of paper, the
                    objects which present themselves to the eye. To remove this obstacle, we would
                    recommend that too much should not be attempted at the first, but the most
                    simple subjects chosen, and these represented in a careful manner; the outline
                    on the light side of the objects to be done in a delicate manner, and that on
                    the shadow side in a bold style, and the shading to be also conducted upon
                    similar principles. The most careful attention to representing the various forms
                    should be practised in the outline, for on the accuracy of it depends the
                    balance or fitness of the whole design or picture. By thus habituating the eye
                    to a correct delineation of the parts, it has little difficulty in coming at the
                    power of representing the general effect and appearance of the whole; and thus a
                    picture, whether consisting of figures, rocks, trees, or marine objects, is
                    managed with comparative ease; while, on the other hand, when a design has been
                    commenced without due attention to the outline and balance of the objects, a
                    loose and disjointed performance is produced.</p>
                <p>Many other difficulties present themselves at first to the anxious student, and
                    not the most unimportant is the feeling which seizes him upon the contemplation
                    of works of excellence when seen in a finished form; but let him not despond,
                    for much pains have been used, and great and palpable errors committed, even by
                    the most accomplished masters, in the details of their works, which, the more
                    accurate they are, the greater has been the,difficulty encountered. As an
                    illustration of this, we have thought it proper to direct attention to the
                    variety of lines used to represent the objects of Plate CXCIX∙, taken from a
                    sketch by Raffaelle. The subject is the study for a portion of the picture of
                    the School of Athens, and contains much valuable information to the learner
                    respecting the progress of this great master in the management of his
                    compositions, of one of the most important of which this is the first rough
                    sketch.</p>
