                <p><label type="entry">DURHAM, <hi rend="smallcaps">Bishopric of</hi></label>, one
                    of the counties of England. Before the arrival of the Romans it was included in
                    the British principality of the Brigantes, and after their arrival made part of
                    the province of <hi rend="italic">Maxima Coesariensis.</hi> During the heptarchy
                    it formed part of the kingdom of Northumberland, the fifth established, which
                    began in 547, and ended in 827, having been governed by thirty-one kings. It was
                    not mentioned by Alfred in his division of counties, being at that time
                    considered as a part of Yorkshire. At present it is included in the northern
                    circuit, in the province of York, and is a diocese and principality under the
                    government of its own bishop, being a county palatine, the second in rank, and
                    the richest in England, lt is bounded on the north by Northumberland, on the
                    south by Yorkshire, on the east by the North Sea, and on the west by Cumberland.
                    It extends, according to the view of Mr Rickman, over 1061 square miles, and
                    contains one city of the same name, nine market-towns, and 223 villages. It is
                    divided into four wards. Until the passing of the reform act, it returned two
                    members to the House of Commons for the county, and two for the city. The county
                    has been formed, by that law, into two divisions, for the purpose of
                    parliamentary elections; each of which returns two members. The northern
                    division comprehends the wards of Chester and Easington, and the polling places
                    are Durham, Sunderland, Lancheton, Wickham, Chester-le-Street, and South
                    Shields. The southern division comprehends the wards of Darlington and Stockton,
                    and thepoling placcsare these two towns, and Bishop Auckland, Stanhope,
                    Middleton-in-Teesdale, Barnard Castle, and Sedgefield. The following places
                    within the county have by the same law obtained the privilege of electing two
                    members each, viz. Gateshead, South Shields, Sunderland, and Tynemouth.</p>
                <p>This is the only county palatine remaining in England, and it is called <hi
                    rend="italic">palatine,</hi><hi rend="italic">a palatio,</hi> because the owners
                    thereof had, in this county, the authority to use the royal prerogative, as
                    fully as the king had in his palace. The palatine privileges were granted to
                    this county probably on account of its bordering upon the inimical kingdom of
                    Scotland, in order that the inhabitants, having justice administered at home,
                    might not be obliged to go out of their county, and leave it open to an enemy’s
                    incursions; and that the owners, being encouraged by so large an authority,
                    might be the more watchful in its defence. There is a court of chancery in this
                    county, and the bishop is at the head of the administration of justice.</p>
                <p>The western angle of the county of Durham is hilly and mountainous, with black,
                    naked, and barren regions, crossed by a ridge of high hills, from whose sides
                    issue numerous streams flowing to the sea. There are some beautiful and fertile
                    valleys in the eastern and central parts, pleasantly varied with hill and dale,
                    and alternately appropriated to corn and pasture. The waste lands occupy nearly
                    120,000 acres of the western part of the county; but in the southern districts
                    many hundred acres have been inclosed and cultivated within the last forty
                    years. The common fields are now but few; for the land belonging to the
                    townships has been inclosed for above a century. There is a great portion of wet
                    ground still remaining, although draining is carried on to a great extent.</p>
                <p>Near the river Tees, and in some spots bordering on the other rivers, the soil is
                    loam or a rich clay. At a farther distance from these rivers the soil is of an
                    inferior quality, and marshy, with patches of gravel interspersed. The hills
                    between the sea and an imaginary line from Barnard Castle on the Tees to
                    Alansford on the Derwent, are covered with a dry4oam, the fertility of which
                    varies with its depth. From this line westward the summits as well as the sides
                    of the hills are moorish wastes.</p>
                <p>The woodlands of Durham are not of very considerable extent, trees being chiefly
                    confined to the parks and seats of the nobility and gentry, but many plantations
                    have been made of late years. The banks of the rivers and brooks, however,
                    particularly in the vicinity of Durham, are fringed with wood of long growth and
                    much value. The public roads are in general good, but those belonging to private
                    districts and townships want improving.</p>
                <p>The port of Stockton-upon-Tees is well situated for commerce. Hartlepool,
                    situated on a promontory, nearly encompassed by the German Ocean, which on the
                    south . side of the town forms a capacious bay, is advantageously placed for the
                    reception of vessels, and landing of troops from the Continent; and South
                    Shields sends out many ships.</p>
                <p>The mineralogical substances found in Durham are numerous and valuable. The coal
                    mines are some of the most extensive and productive in the kingdom, and the
                    quantity of this important article is so great as to exceed all calculation. At
                    Sunderland the coal trade furnishes employment for 520 vessels, independently of
                    the <hi rend="italic">heels</hi> which convey the coal from the staiths to the
                    ships, which are 492 in number. This coal is chiefly conveyed to the metropolis,
                    though great quantities are sent to the different ports of the Baltic, and in
                    time of peace to France and Holland. The whole quantity annually exported from
                    Sunderland alone amounts to about 315,000 Newcastle chaldrons, each chaldron
                    being equal to 53 cwt. The number of persons dependent on this trade is very
                    great, and some years ago, when the consumption was by no means so great as it
                    is at present, amounted to upwards of 26,000 on the river Wear only. The seams
                    or strata now worked are five in number, extending horizontally for many miles,
                    and are from twenty to one hundred fathoms <pb break="no" facs="nls:193326905"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-6905-0290"/>beneath the surface; while each stratum is from
                    three to eight feet thick. Below these are several other seams of coal; and many
                    parts of the county, besides those where the pits are now open, abound with this
                    substance.</p>
                <p>The principal lead mines of Durham are situated in Teesdale and Weardale; those
                    of the former place have not been very productive, but the produce of the latter
                    is of considerable value. The general method of working them is similar to that
                    pursued in other mining counties. The ore of Weardale is melted by the
                    blast-hearth, but in Teesdale air-furnaces have been introduced with much
                    success.</p>
                <p>Ironstone is found in the neighbourhood of Swalwell and Winlaton, where are the
                    first iron-works in England.</p>
                <p>Some excellent quarries of slate for buildings have been opened in different
                    parts of the county. A beautiful black spotted limestone is dug up near
                    Walsingham, and made into hearths, chimney-pieces, and other ornaments. This
                    neighbourhood abounds also with fine millstones. The Newcastle grindstones are
                    procured at Gateshead Fell; and firestone of high estimation, for building
                    ovens, furnaces, and the like, is obtained in various parts of Durham, and
                    exported in immense quantities.</p>
                <p>Several extensive works for manufacturing salt from sea-water have long been
                    established in the neighbourhood of South Shields; but owing to the discovery of
                    a very singular salt spring at Birtley in this county, that process is not so
                    much attended to now. This water rises at the depth of seventy fathoms, in an
                    engine pit constructed for drawing water out of coal mines. It has for many
                    years produced 20,000 gallons per day, four times more strongly impregnated with
                    salt than any sea-water. In consequence of the discovery of this spring, about
                    twenty-five years ago, a large and extensive manufactory of salt has been
                    established near the spot, the quality of which is excellent. At Butterby, near
                    Durham, is another salt spring, which issues from a rock in the river Wear, but
                    is only visible when the water is low; it contains more of the sulphate of
                    magnesia, or Epsom salt, than the spring at Birtley. Within a few yards of the
                    Water-gate, on the south side of the town of Hartlepool, is a chalybeate spring,
                    covered every tide by the sea. It is impregnated slightly with sulphur, which
                    evaporates very quickly, leaving a sediment with salt of tartar; a gallon will
                    yield 120 grains of sediment, two parts of which are nitrous, and the rest
                    limestone.</p>
                <p>Improvements in agriculture have been pursued with considerable spirit and
                    success, in the environs of Darlington, chiefly through the patronage of a
                    society of respectable gentlemen, who hold their meetings in the town, and
                    bestow premiums upon merit. The usual rotation of crops in this county is, after
                    summer fallow, wheat, oats, beans, or peas. On some spots of gravelly soil,
                    turnips and barley are grown in almost perpetual succession, a crop of clover
                    being sometimes interposed. The produce of wheat on good land is from twenty to
                    thirty bushels per acre, the produce of barley is from thirty to forty, of oats
                    from twenty to forty. The manures are chiefly lime and the produce of the
                    fold-yard; and though abundance, of sea-weed might be collected on the coast,
                    the farmers make but little use of it. The farms are of a middling size, few of
                    them exceeding 200 acres. The largest portion of each farm is appropriated to
                    tillage, but towards the western extremity of the county the whole is applied to
                    pasture. The leases seldom exceed six years, and are too frequently rendered of
                    little value by injudicious restrictions. The leases held of the see of Durham
                    are generally for life, or for twenty one years, renewable every seven years on
                    payment of a fine. The farm-houses are well situated and commodious, and
                    improvements in farming and farming machinery become more and more common.</p>
                <p>The cattle at Durham are, at present, in great repute; as, for form, weight,
                    produce of milk, and quickness of fattening, there are none better. The sheep
                    also, particularly the Tees Water breed, stand high in estimation. It is the
                    largest breed in the island; the legs being longer, finer boned, and supporting
                    a thicker and more firm and heavy carcass, than the Lincolnshire. They are also
                    much wider on the backs and sides, and afford a fatter and finer grained mutton.
                    The weight per quarter, in two-years’ old wethers, is from twenty-five to
                    thirty-five pounds, and in particular instances fifty-five pounds or more. The
                    wool is shorter and lighter than some other English breeds. The Weardale sheep
                    are small, but the meat is finely flavoured. When fat, the quarters seldom weigh
                    more than fourteen or eighteen pounds each.</p>
                <p>Durham, taking its dimensions into consideration, is inferior to no county in
                    Great Britain for its numerous manufactures. It has cast-metal founderies, iron
                    manufactories, potteries, glass-houses, copperas works, coal-tar and salt-works,
                    quarries of marble, &amp;c.; besides linen and woollen manufactories.</p>
                <p>At the distance of about three miles from Darlington, at Oxenhall, are cavities
                    in the earth, denominated Hell Kettles, to the origin of which are attached many
                    fabulous conjectures. The diameter of the largest is not less than 114 feet, and
                    that of the least seventy-five. About five miles from Hartlepool is one of the
                    most singular and romantic clusters of rocks in the north of England, called
                    Black Halls, formed by the force and constant action of the waves, which have
                    separated enormous masses from the coast, washing some entirely away, but
                    leaving others standing, like the vast towers of a cathedral; in some places the
                    rock is perforated so as to resemble a fine pointed archway.</p>
                <p>Near the north wall of the church-yard at Ryton is a large barrow, about twenty
                    feet in perpendicular height, now planted with trees. It does not appear to have
                    been opened; but a similar one, near Bradley Hall, in the same parish, inspected
                    about thirty-five years ago, was found to contain a square cavity, formed by
                    stones placed edgewise, in which a human body had been interred. Between one and
                    two miles north of Brancepeth is Brandon Hill, a lofty eminence, on the summit
                    of which is a remarkable tumulus, of an oblong form, 120 paces in circumference
                    at the base, and about twenty-four feet in perpendicular height. It does not
                    appear to have been opened. One mile north of Eggleston is an ancient structure,
                    called the Standing Stones. This originally consisted of a cairn in the centre,
                    surrounded by a trench, and that again encompassed by a circular arrangement of
                    rough stones, many of which have been removed and broken, to repair the roads.
                    Near a brook, at a small distance, is a large barrow, crossed from east to west
                    by a row of stones.</p>
                <p>On Fullwell Hill, a gigantic skeleton and two Roman coins were discovered about
                    fifty-five years ago, together with a small urn of unbaked clay. Several copper
                    coins have been found at the village of Whitburn. Some coins of the Emperor
                    Hadrian were found while widening the road near Gateshead, which is supposed to
                    have been a Roman station.</p>
                <p>South Shields was the <hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">finem</hi> of
                    Richard of Cirencester’s itinerary, as appears from the Roman altars, coins,
                    arql other relics found there. Evchester, a small irregular village, is supposed
                    to be the <hi rend="italic">Vindomara</hi> of Antoninus; many Roman
                    inscriptions, and an urn of uncommon form, nearly a yard high and seven inches
                    wide, with a small cup in the centre, having been found there. Chester-le-Strect
                    has been supposed to be the <hi rend="italic">Condercwn</hi> of the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193326918" xml:id="kp-eb0708-6918-0291"/> Romans, situated
                    on the. military way leading to Newcastle. Glanibanta, near the village of
                    Lanchester, is another Roman station, which has survived the ravages of
                    cultivation in an extraordinary degree, and is one of the most perfect in the
                    kingdom. It occupies a fine eminence, and is of an oblong figure, being 174
                    paces from north to south, and 160 from east to west, within the vallum. In some
                    parts the wall still remains perfect; the outside is perpendicular, twelve feet
                    in height, and built of ashler work in regular courses, each stone being about
                    nine inches thick and twelve long. The site of the Praetorium is clearly
                    distinguishable. Binchester, the seat and manor of the Wren family, is the site
                    of the Roman station called <hi rend="italic">Vinovium</hi> by Antoninus. Its
                    figure and extent seem nearly similar to those of the station just mentioned;
                    but the walls have been destroyed, and the area inclosed and cultivated. A
                    military way, it is supposed, issued from it, leading towards Chester-le-Street.
                    Innumerable fragments have been discovered here.</p>
                <p>The most ancient part of Durham Castle is the keep, now a mere shell; the
                    magnificent hall is fast going to decay. Hilton Castle, an ancient baronial
                    residence of the Hyltons, is situated in a pleasant vale on the north side of
                    the Wear, about three miles from Wearmouth: its present form is that of an
                    oblong square; the interior consists of five stories; the rooms are small, and
                    exhibit every symptom of neglect and decay. Ravensworth Castle, the seat of Sir
                    Thomas Henry, occupies part of the site of an ancient castle, which seems to
                    have formed a quadrangle, having a square tower at each angle, connected by a
                    curtain wall. Two of the towers are built up in the offices, the others are
                    partly in ruins. Lumley Castle, about a mile to the east of Chester-le-Street,
                    is one of the seats of the Earl of Scarborough. It forms a quadrangle, with an
                    area in the centre; at each angle are projecting turrets of an octangular form;
                    it is a grand model of the taste of its age. Brancepeth Castle, an irregular but
                    stately pile, was erected about Stephen’s reign, by the family of Bulmers. The
                    original building has had many modern improvements added to it by the present
                    proprietor. The castle of Bishop Auckland stands on the north angle of the town,
                    and, together with its courts and offices, covers about five acres of ground.
                    Raby Castle, the magnificent seat of the Earl of Darlington, owes its splendour
                    to the Earl of Westmoreland, who enlarged a more ancient castle which stood here
                    prior to the year 1379. The present mansion of Streatham Castle was erected on
                    the foundation of the old castle at the beginning of the last century, and
                    several of the apartments are retained in it. Barnard Castle is situated on the
                    southern acclivity of an eminence, rising with a steep ascent from the river
                    Tees; its ruins cover an extensive plot of groŉnd.</p>
                <p>Kepier Hospital, near Durham, was founded in 1112; but the only part of the
                    monastic buildings now standing is the gateway, a strong and not unhandsome
                    piece of masonry with pointed arches. The ruins of a monastery for gray friars
                    may be seen at Hartlepool. Several remains of monastic buildings occur near the
                    church at Monk Wearmouth. The monastery of Jarrow may still be traced in its
                    ruins on the summit of an elevated ridge near the church. On the east side of
                    the main street of Gateshead are the ruins of St Edmond’s Monastery, which
                    appears, from Bede, to have been established before the year 653. Finchall
                    Priory was beautifully situated in a vale on the banks of the Wear; the ruins
                    cover an extensive plot of ground, but are so much dilapidated that the original
                    appropriation of their respective parts can be traced only <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> with great difficulty. The remains of a chapel at
                    Bear Park are most perfect, and display some neat ornamental architecture. There
                    is at Walsingham the ruins of a considerable building, inclosed with a deep
                    moat, supposed by some to have been a part of a monastery.</p>
                <p>The ecclesiastical buildings now remaining, and most worthy of notice, are, the
                    Cathedral of Durham, begun in 1093, in the Saxon and Norman style; Sedgefield
                    Church, in the Saxon style; Bishop Wearmouth Church, supposed to have been
                    founded very soon after the restitution made by Athelstan; and the parish church
                    of Brancepeth, an ancient structure of the conventual form, but apparently of
                    different ages.</p>
                <p>The county of Durham contains a great number of noblemen and gentlemen’s seats.
                    The following are some of the principal: Streatham Castle, the seat of the Earl
                    of Strathmore; Shincliff-Hall, that of R. Scott, Esq.; Croxdale-Hall, that of W.
                    Salvin, Esq.; Raby Castle, that of the Duke of Cleveland; Lumley Castle, that of
                    the Earl of Scarborough; Castle Eden, that of R. Burdon, Esq.; Harwickc, that of
                    Μ. Russell, Esq.; Windleston, that of Sir John Eden, Bart.; Grange-Hall, that of
                    G. Allan, Esq.; Winyard, that of the Marquis of Londonderry; Seaham, that of Sir
                    R. Milbanke, Bart.; Ravensworth Castle, that of Sir S. II. Liddeł, Bart.; Axwell
                    Park, that of Sir T. Clavering, Bart.; Gibside, that of the Earl of Strathmore;
                    Lambton Hall, that of Lord Durham; and Bradley Hall, that of the Bowes
                    family.</p>
                <p>The following titles are furnished from this county: Earl of Darlington to the
                    Duke of Cleveland; Earl of Stanhope; Viscount Lumley <hi rend="superscript">
                    7</hi> to the Earl of Scarborough; Baron Auckland to the Eden family; and Baron
                    Durham to the family of Lambton.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of this county, by accounts of doubtful accuracy <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, amounted in the year 1700 to 95,500, and in 1750 to
                    135,000. By the four decennial returns they are stated as follows: In 1801 they
                    amounted to 160,561, in 1811 to 177,625, in 1821 to 207,673, and in 1831 to
                    253,700. The annual value of the real property appears by the assessment of 1815
                    to have been L.791,359.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Durham,</hi> a city, the capital of the county of that name,
                    260 miles from London. It is situated on the river Wear, which nearly surrounds
                    it, and contributes to the fine situation; the castle and cathedral standing on
                    an eminence, communicate no inconsiderable share of beauty. Besides the
                    cathedral, there are six parish churches. The see is the most richly endowed of
                    any in England, and the prebendaries are of great value. In the vicinity of the
                    city are many interesting remains of antiquity. The corporation consists of a
                    mayor, twelve aldermen, and twenty-four common council men, who nominate the
                    freemen, by whom two members are returned to parliament. The market, held on
                    Saturdays, is well attended. There is very little of trade, and there are no
                    manufactures. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 7530, in 1811 to 6763, in 1821
                    to 9822, and in 1831 to 10,125.</p>
