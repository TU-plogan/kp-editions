                    celebrated English admiral, was the son of Edmund Drake, a sailor, and was born
                    near Tavistock, in Devonshire, in the year 1545. He was brought up at the
                    expense and under the care of Sir John Hawkins, who was his kinsman, and, at the
                    age of eighteen, was the purser of a ship trading to Biscay. At twenty he made a
                    voyage to Guinea, and at twenty-two he was made captain of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Judith.</hi> In that capacity he was in the harbour of San Juan de Ulloa, in
                    the Gulf of Mexico where he behaved most gallantly in the actions under Sir John
                    Hawkins, and returned with him to England, having acquired great reputation,
                    though not worth a groat. Upon this he projected an attack against the Spaniards
                    in the West Indies; a project which he no sooner published than he found
                    volunteers enow ready to accompany him. In 1570 he undertook an expedition with
                    two ships, and the next year with only one, in which he returned safe, if not
                    with such advantages as he had expected. In 1572 he made another expedition, in
                    which he did the Spaniards some mischief, and gained considerable booty. In
                    these expeditions he was much assisted by a nation of Indians, who were then
                    engaged in a sort of chronic warfare with the Spaniards. The prince of these
                    people was named Pedro, to whom Drake presented a fine cutlass from his side,
                    which he saw the Indian greatly admired. Pedro, in return, gave him four large
                    wedges of gold; which Drake threw into the common stock, saying that he thought
                    it but just that such as on his credit bore the charge of so uncertain a voyage,
                    should share the utmost advantage which that voyage produced. Then having
                    embarked his men with all the wealth he had obtained, which was very
                    considerable, he bore away for England, where he arrived in August 1573.</p>
                <p>His success in this expedition, joined to his honourable behaviour towards his
                    owners, gained him high reputation, and the use which he made of his riches a
                    still higher. Haviŋg fitted out three frigates at his own expense, he sailed
                    with them to Ireland; and there, under Walter earl of Essex, the father of the
                    famous but unfortunate earl, he served as a volunteer, and performed many
                    glorious actions. After the death of his patron, he returned to England, where
                    Sir Christopher Hatton introduced him to her majesty Queen Elizabeth, and
                    procured him countenance and protection at court. By this means he acquired the
                    means of undertaking that grand expedition which has rendered his name immortal.
                    The first proposal he made was to undertake a voyage into the South Seas through
                    the Straits of Magelhaens; an achievement which no Englishman had hitherto ever
                    attempted. This project having been well received at court, the queen furnished
                    him with means; and his own fame quickly drew together a sufficient force. The
                    fleet with which he sailed on this enterprise consisted only of five vessels,
                    small when compared with the size of modern ships, and having on board no more
                    than a hundred and sixty-four able men. Having sailed on the 13th of December
                    1577, he on the 25th fell in with the coast of Barbary, and on the 29th with
                    Cape Verde. On the 18th of March he passed the equinoctial, made the coast of
                    Brazil on the 5th of April, and entered the river Plata, where he parted company
                    with two of his ships; but having met them again, and taken out their
                    provisions, he turned them adrift. On the 29th of May he entered the port of St
                    Julian’s, where he continued two months for the sake of laying in a stock of
                    provisions. On the 20th of August he entered the Straits of Magelhaens, and on
                    the 25th of September passed them, having then only his own ship. On the 25th of
                    November he arrived at Macao, which he had appointed as the place of rendezvous
                    in the event of his ships being separated; but Captain Winter, his vice-admiral,
                    having repassed the straits, had returned to England. He thence continued his
                    voyage along the coast of Chili and Peru, taking all opportunities of seizing
                    Spanish ships, and attacking them on shore, till his men were satiated with
                    plunder; and then, coasting America to the height of forty-eight degrees, he
                    endeavoured to find a passage that way back into the Atlantic, but could not,
                    because none exists. However, he landed, and called the country <hi
                    rend="italic">New Albion,</hi> taking possession of it in the name and for the
                    use of Queen Elizabeth; and having careened his ship, he set sail from thence on
                    the 29th September 1579, for the Moluccas. He is supposed to have chosen this
                    passage round, partly to avoid being attacked by the Spaniards at a
                    disadvantage, and partly because, from the lateness of the season, dangerous
                    storms and hurricanes were apprehended. On the 13th of October he fell in with
                    certain islands inhabited by the most barbarous people he had met with in all
                    his voyage. On the 4th of November he got sight of the Moluccas; and, arriving
                    at Ternate, was extremely well received by the king of that place, who appears
                    from the most authentic relations of this voyage to have been a wise and politic
                    prince. On the 10th of December he made the Celebes, where his ship
                    unfortunately struck upon a rock on the 9th of January following; but, beyond
                    all expectation, they got her off, and continued their course. On the 16th of
                    March he arrived at Java, whence he intended to have directed his course to
                    Malacca; but he found himself obliged to alter his purpose, and to think of
                    returning home. On the 25th of March 1580, he put this design in execution; and
                    on the 15th of June he doubled the Cape of Good Hope, having then on board only
                    fifty-seven men and three casks of water. On the 12th of July he passed the
                    line, reached the coast of Guinea on the 16th, and there watered. On the 11th of
                    September he made the island of Terceira, and on the 3d of November he entered
                    the harbour of Plymouth. This voyage round the world was performed in two years
                    and about ten months. Shortly after his arrival, the queen having gone to
                    Deptford, went on board his ship, and there, after dinner, conferred upon him
                    the honour of knighthood, at the same time declaring her entire approbation of
                    all that he had done. She likewise gave directions for the preservation of his
                    ship, that it might remain a monument of his own and his country’s glory. In the
                    year 1585, he sailed with a fleet to the West Indies, and took the cities of St
                    Jago, St Domingo, Carthagena, and St Augustine. In 1587 he went to Lisbon with a
                    fleet of thirty sail; and having received intelligence of a great fleet being
                    assembled in the bay of Cadiz, and destined to form part of the armada, he with
                    great courage entered the port, and there burnt upwards of 10,000 tons of
                    shipping; a feat which he afterwards merrily called “burning the king of Spain’s
                    beard.” In 1588, when the Spanish armada was approaching our shores, Sir Francis
                    Drake was appointed vice-admiral under Charles Lord Howard of Effingham,
                    high-admiral of England; and here fortune favoured him as remarkably as ever;
                    for he made prize of a very large galleon, commanded by Don Pedro de Valdez, who
                    was reputed the projector of the invasion. This affair deserves to be
                    particularly stated. On the 22d of July, Sir Francis observing a great Spanish
                    ship floating at a distance from both fleets, sent his pinnace to summon the
                    commander to yield. Valdez replied, with much Spanish solemnity, that they were
                    four hundred and fifty strong, that he himself was Don Pedro, and stood much
                    upoh his honour; and thereupon propounded several conditions, upon which he was
                    willing to yield. But the vice-admiral replied, that he had no leisure to
                    parley; that if the Don thought fit instantly to yield, he might; if not, he
                    should soon find that Drake <pb break="no" facs="nls:193324994"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-4994-0143"/>was no coward. Pedro, hearing the name of Drake,
                    immediately yielded, and with forty-six of his attendants came on board the
                    admiral’s ship. This Don Pedro remained about two years Sir Francis Drake’s
                    prisoner in England; and when he was released, paid for his own and his
                    captain’s liberty a ransom of L.3500. Drake’s soldiers were well recompensed
                    with the plunder of this ship, for they found in it 55,000 ducats of gold, which
                    were divided amongst them.</p>
                <p>A little before this formidable Spanish armament put to sea, the ambassador of
                    his Catholic majesty had the confidence to propose to Queen Elizabeth, in Latin
                    verse, the terms upon which she might hope for peace. The lines embodying this
                    singular diplomatic communication are as follow:</p>
                <p>Te veto ne pergas bello defendere Belgas;</p>
                <p>Quae Dracus cripuit nunc restituantur oportet: Quas pater evertit jubeo to
                    condere cellas: lleligio Papae fac restituatur ad unguem.</p>
                <p>To these the queen made this extempore response:</p>
                <p>Ad Graecas, bone rex, fiant mandata kalendas.</p>
                <p>In the year 1559, Sir Francis Drake commanded the fleet sent to restore Dom
                    Antonio, king of Portugal, the land forces being under the orders of Sir John
                    Norris; but they had hardly put to sea when the commanders differed, and thus
                    the attempt proved abortive. But as the war with Spain continued, a more
                    formidable expedition was fitted out, under Sir John Hawkins and Sir Francis
                    Drake, against their settlements in the W <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> est
                    Indies, than had hitherto been undertaken during the whole course of it. Here,
                    however, the commanders again disagreed about the plan; and the result in like
                    manner disappointed public expectation. Before these two last expeditions, all
                    difficulties had given way to the skill and fortune of Sir Francis Drake; and
                    this probably was the reason why he did not bear these disappointments so well
                    as he might otherwise have done. A strong sense of them is supposed to have
                    thrown him into a melancholy, which occasioned a bloody flux, of which he died
                    on board his own ship, near the town of Nombre de Dios, in the West Indies, on
                    the 2Sth of January 1595-96. His death was lamented by the whole nation, and
                    particularly by his countrymen, who had great reason to love him from the
                    correctness of his private life, as well as to esteem him on account of his
                    public character. He was elected burgess for the town of Bossiny, otherwise
                    called Tintagal, in the county of Cornwall, in the twenty-seventh parliament of
                    Queen Elizabeth; and for Plymouth, in Devonshire, in the thirty-fifth of the
                    same reign. Ibis town was under very particular obligations to him; for, in the
                    year 1587, he undertook to bring into it water, from want of which it had till
                    then been grievously distressed; and he performed this undertaking by conducting
                    thither a stream from springs at eight miles distance, but by a course of
                    upwards of twenty miles.</p>
