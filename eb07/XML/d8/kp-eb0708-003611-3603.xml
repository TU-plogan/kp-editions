                <p><label type="entry">DIPLOMATICS</label>, the science of diplomas, or of ancient
                    literary monuments, public documents, and the like. It does not, however, nor
                    can it, absolutely extend its researches to antiquity, but is chiefly confined
                    to the middle age and the first centuries of modern times. For although the
                    ancients were accustomed to reduce their contracts <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193323616" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3616-0037"/>and treaties into writing,
                    yet they engraved them on tablets of brass, copper, stone, or wood; and all that
                    in the first ages were not traced on brass or marble has perished by the length
                    of time and the number of destructive events.</p>
                <p>1. The word <hi rend="italic">diploma</hi> signifies properly a letter or epistle
                    which is folded in the middle, and which consequently is not open. But in more
                    modern times the title has been given to all ancient epistles, letters, literary
                    monuments, and public documents, and to all those pieces of writing which the
                    ancients called <hi rend="italic">Syngrapha, Chirographa, Codicilli,</hi> and
                    the like. In the middle ages, and in the diplomas themselves, these writings are
                    called <hi rend="italic">Litterae, Proe-cepta,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Placita,</hi><hi rend="italic">Chartae indiculoe,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sigilla,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bullae</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> as also
                    <hi rend="italic">Panchartae, Pantochartae, Tractoriae,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Descriptiones,</hi> and so forth. The originals of these pieces are named <hi
                    rend="italic">Examplaria</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Autographa,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Chartae autlienticae,</hi><hi rend="italic">Originalia,</hi>
                    &amp;c. and the copies, <hi rend="italic">Apographa, Copiae, Particulae,</hi>
                    and so on. The collections which have been made of them are called <hi
                    rend="italic">Chartaria</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chartulia.</hi> The place
                    where these papers and documents were kept the ancients named <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scrinia, Tabularium,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Aerarium,</hi> words which were
                    derived from the tablets of brass, and, according to the Greek idiom, <hi
                    rend="italic">Archcium</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Archivum.</hi></p>
                <p>2. In order to understand the nature of these ancient papers, diplomas, and
                    manuscripts, and to distinguish the authentic from the counterfeit, it is
                    necessary to know that the paper of the ancients came from Egypt, and was formed
                    of thin leaves or membranes taken from the branches of a tree named <hi
                    rend="italic">Papyrus Biblum,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Aegyptiacum,</hi> and
                    which were pasted one over the other with the slime of the Nile, and pressed and
                    polished with a pumice stone. This paper was very scarce, and it was of various
                    qualities, forms, and prices, which they distinguished by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">charta</hi><hi rend="italic">hieratica,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >luria, augusta,</hi><hi rend="italic">amphitheatrica, saitica,
                    taìiirica,</hi><hi rend="italic">emporetica.</hi> They cut this paper into
                    square leaves, which they pasted one to the other in order to make rolls of
                    them, whence an entire book was called <hi rend="italic">volumen,</hi> from <hi
                    rend="italic">volvere,</hi> to roll, and the leaves of which it consisted <hi
                    rend="italic">paginae.</hi> Sometimes, also, they pasted the leaves all together
                    by one of their extremities, as is now practised in binding; by this method they
                    formed the back of a book, and these the learned called <hi rend="italic"
                    >codices.</hi> They rolled the volume round a stick, which they named <hi
                    rend="italic">umbilicus,</hi> and the two ends which protruded beyond the paper
                    were called <hi rend="italic">cornua.</hi> The title, written on parchment in
                    purple characters, was joined to the last sheet, and served it as a cover. They
                    made use of all sorts of strings or ribands, and even sometimes of locks, to
                    close the book; and sometimes also it was put into a case. But there is not now
                    to be found, in any library or cabinet whatsoever, any one of these volumes. We
                    have been assured, however, by a traveller, that he had seen several of them in
                    the ruins of Herculaneum, but so damaged, and the paper so stiff and brittle, by
                    length of time, that it was impossib⅛Γ to unrol them, and, consequently, to make
                    use of any of them; for on the first touch they fell into tatters.</p>
                <p>3. We are ignorant of the precise time when our modern paper was invented, and
                    when people began to make use of pens in writing instead of the stalks of reeds.
                    The ink which the ancients used was not made of vitriol and galls, like the
                    modern, but of soot. Sometimes also they wrote with red ink made of vermilion,
                    or in letters of gold on purple or violet parchment. It is not difficult for
                    those who apply themselves to this study, to distinguish the parchment of the
                    ancients from that of the moderns, as well as the ink; but that which best
                    distinguishes the original from the counterfeit is the writing or character
                    itself, which is so different in different centuries, that we may tell with
                    certainty, within about forty or fifty years, when any diploma was written.
                    There are two works which furnish the clearest lights on this matter, and which
                    may serve as sure guides in the judgments we may have occasion to form as to
                    what are called <hi rend="italic">ancient diplomas.</hi> The one is the
                    celebrated treatise on Diplomatics, by Mabillon, and the other the first volume
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Chronico Got-vicense.</hi> We there find specimens of
                    all the characters, the flourishes, and different methods of writing, of every
                    age. For these matters, therefore, we must refer our readers to the works just
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>4. All the diplomas are written in Latin, and consequently the letters and
                    characters have a resemblance to each other; but there are certain strokes of
                    the pen which distinguish not only the ages, but also the different nations, as
                    the writings of the Lombards, French, Saxons, and so on. The letters in the
                    diplomas also are usually longer and less decided than those of manuscripts.
                    There has also been introduced a kind of court hand, of a very disproportionate
                    length, and the letters of which are called <hi rend="italic">exiles litterae
                    crispae, ac protractiores.</hi> The first line of the diploma, the signature of
                    the sovereign, that of the chancellor, notary, &amp;c. are usually written in
                    this character.</p>
                <p>5. The signature of a diploma consists either of the sign of the cross, or of a
                    monogram or cipher, composed of the letters of the names of those who subscribed
                    it. The initial letters of the name, and sometimes also the titles, were placed
                    about this cross. By degrees the custom changed, and they invented other marks,
                    as, for example, the sign of Charlemagne, which was thus written:</p>
                <p>R</p>
                <p>K_A_S</p>
                <p>L</p>
                <p>They sometimes also added the dates and epoch of the signature, the feasts of the
                    church, the days of the calendar, and other like matters. The successive
                    corruption of the Latin language; the style and orthography of each age, as well
                    as their different titles and forms; the abbreviations, accentuation, and
                    punctuation, and the various methods of writing the diphthongs; all these
                    matters united form so many characters and marks by which the authenticity of a
                    diploma may be known.</p>
                <p>6. The seal annexed to a diploma was anciently of white wax, and was artfully
                    imprinted on the parchment itself. It was afterwards pendant from the paper, and
                    inclosed in a box or case, which was called <hi rend="italic">bulla.</hi> There
                    are also some which have been stamped on metal, and even on pure gold. When a
                    diploma bears all the characters which are requisite to the time and place where
                    it is supposed to be written, its authenticity is not to be doubted; but at the
                    same time we cannot examine these too scrupulously, seeing that the monks and
                    priests of former ages were very adroit in making counterfeits, the more so as
                    they enjoyed the confidence of princes and statesmen, and were even sometimes in
                    possession of their rings or seals.</p>
                <p>7. With regard to manuscripts which were written before the invention of
                    printing, it is necessary to know their nature, their essential qualities, and
                    matter; to be able to read them freely, and without error; to judge of their
                    antiquity by those characters which we have just mentioned with reference to the
                    diplomas; and to render them of use in the sciences. As there are scarcely any
                    of the ancient codes now remaining written on the Egyptian paper, or on wood,
                    ivory, &amp;c. we have only to consider those which are written on parchment or
                    vellum <hi rend="italic">(membraneos'),</hi> and such as are written on our
                    paper <hi rend="italic">(chartaccos).</hi> The former of these are in most
                    esteem. With regard <pb break="no" facs="nls:193323629"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-3629-0038"/>to the character, these codices are written either
                    in square and capital letters, or in half square or round and small letters.
                    Those of the first kind are the most ancient. There are no intervals between the
                    words, no letters different from the others at the beginning of any word, no
                    points, nor any other distinction. The codices which are written in half square
                    letters resemble those we have in Gothic characters, as well for the age as the
                    form of the letters. Such as are written in round letters are not so ancient as
                    the former, and do not go higher than the ninth or tenth century. These have
                    spaces between the words, and some punctuation; but they are not so well written
                    as the preceding, and are frequently disfigured with comments. The codices are
                    divided, according to the country, into Lombard, Italian, Gaelic, Franco-Gaelic,
                    Saxon, Anglo-Saxon, and so forth.</p>
                <p>8. In the ancient Greek books they frequently terminated the periods of a
                    discourse, instead of all other divisions, by lines, and these divisions were
                    called, in Latin, <hi rend="italic">versus,</hi><hi rend="italic">a
                    vertendo;</hi> for which reason these lines arc still more properly named <hi
                    rend="italic">versus</hi> than <hi rend="italic">lineoe.</hi> At the end of a
                    work the number of verses of which it consisted was put down, in order that the
                    copies might be more easily collated; and it is in this sense that we are to
                    understand Tribonius, when he says that the Pandects contain 150,000 <hi
                    rend="italic">paene</hi><hi rend="italic">versuum.</hi> These codices were
                    likewise <hi rend="italic">vel probae vel</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >deterioris</hi><hi rend="italic">notae,</hi> more or less perfect, not only
                    with regard to the calligraphy or beauty of the character, but also with
                    reference to the correctness of the text.</p>
                <p>9. It is likewise necessary to observe, in ancient codices, the abbreviations as
                    they have been used in different centuries. Thus, for example, A. C. D.
                    signifies Aulus Caius Decimus; Ap. Cn. Appius Cneius; Aug. Imp. Augustus
                    Imperator. The characters which are called <hi rend="italic">notae</hi> are such
                    as are not to be found in the alphabet; but which, notwithstanding, signify
                    certain words. Lastly, the learned divide all the ancient codices into <hi
                    rend="italic">codives minus</hi><hi rend="italic">raros, rariores,
                    editos,</hi><hi rend="italic">et anecdotos.</hi> The critical art is here
                    indispensably necessary; its researches, moreover, have no bounds, and the more
                    as the use of it augments qvery day, by the discoveries which are made in
                    languages, and by the increase of erudition. The curious reader will find much
                    learned and valuable information on all these matters in the work entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Nouveau Traite</hi><hi rend="italic">de Diplomatique, par
                    deux</hi><hi rend="italic">Religieux de la Congrégation</hi><hi rend="italic">de
