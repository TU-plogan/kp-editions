                    Dunkcld, was the third son of Archibald earl of Angus, and of Elizabeth the
                    daughter of Robert Lord Boyd, who for some time filled the office of high
                    chamberlain. He appears to have been born in 1474, or the ensuing year. With the
                    place of his birth or education wc are not acquainted, but we may suppose his
                    course of study to have been suitable to his profession. Having entered into
                    holy orders, he was collated to the rectory of Hawick;<note anchored="true"

                    of the human mind are awakened by external objects, his early residence amid the
                    fine pastoral scenery of Teviot-dale may have had a strong tendency to cherish
                    in his imagination the seeds of genuine poetry. In the year 1509, we find him
                    described as provost of the collegiate church of Sti Giles in Edinburgh.<note

                    was no longer willingly acknowledged as regent; the pre-eminence of her husband
                    rendered him odious in the eyes of the more powerful subjects; and the house of

                    decline this splendid offer, and the queen afterwards attempted to elevate
                    Douglas to the primacy. Confiding in the royal nomination, and in the influence
                    of his own family, he took possession of the archiépiscopal palace; but his

                    France. Hepburn having prevailed upon the canons to elect him to the see, laid
                    siege to the castle, and after meeting with some resistance,· expelled the

                    moderation, resolved to abandon the pursuit of this high object of
                    ecclesiastical ambition; but the other competitors seem to have been alike
                    insensible to motives of private virtue and of public decorum. Foreman being
                    afraid to publish the papal bulls, prevailed upon Lord Hume, by bestowing on his
                    brother the priory of Coldingham, to undertake the support of his cause; and
                    this border chieftain enabled him to appear at Edinburgh, attended by ten
                    thousand men in arms. Having performed the necessary ceremony, they hastened to
                    St Andrews in order to complete their pious task, but they found the prior
                    sufficiently prepared for their reception: Jn the castle and in the cathedral he
                    had placed so considerable a garrison, that Foreman was unwilling to hazard an
                    attack, and deemed it more prudent to adjust their claims by an amicable
                    négociation; it was finally stipulated that he should be put in quiet possession
                    of the primacy, that Hepburn should' receive a yearly pension from the bishopric
                    of Moray, and should retain such rents as he had already levied from the
                    archbishopric of St Andrews.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>From this negociation Douglas derived no advantage; and, to complete the measure
                    of his disappointments, the abbacy of Aberbrothock, which· he had regarded as
                    secure, was transferred to James Beaton, archbishop of Glasgow, and chancellor
                    of the kingdom. The death of George Brown, bishop of Duukeld, which occurred in
                    the month of January 1515, presented him with new prospects, and exposed him to
                    new mortifications. The queen nominated him to the vacant see, and, as is
                    supposed, by the intervention of her brother the king of England, obtained a
                    papal bull in his favour. But, in the mean time, the earl of Athole had induced
                    the chapter to postulate his brother Andrew Stewart, prebendary of Craig, who
                    had not yet taken subdeacon’s orders.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It may not be unnecessary to remark, that in the popish

                    elected a bishop, unless he has at least taken subdeacon’s orders. Although he
                    cannot be elected, he may however be postulated by the chapter; and if this
                    postulation is admitted by the pope, he is then considered as elected and
                    iconfirmed. “Postulatio est ejus, qui eligi non potest, in praelatum concors

                    viii.) There are other canonical impediments, which we need not enumerate; for
                    Stewart’s disqualification is particularly specified by Myln.</p></note> The
                    enemies of the queen did not neglect this opportunity of disgracing an
                    individual so nearly allied to her husband í Douglas was cited before the
                    competent judgeś, and was accused of having violated the laws, by procuring
                    bulls from Rome. Such practices had indeed been prohibited by several statutes,
                    but these had vefy seldom been enforced. Of this offence he was however
                    convicted; and being committed to the charge of his former rival Hepburn, he was
                    successively confined in the castles of Edinburgh, St Andrews, and Dunbar, and
                    again in that of Edinburgh. Before the period of his trial, the queen’s party
                    had almost entirely lost its influence: the duke of Albany, who was the grandson
                    of James the Second, and the cousin of the late king, arrived from France on the
                    10th of May, and within the space of about two months was declared regent of the
                    kingdom. A compromise at length took place between the two parties: Douglas
                    obtained his liberty after an imprisonment of more than twelve months; and his
                    claim to the bishopric was secured by Beaton’s mediation with the new regent. He
                    was consecrated at Glasgow by the same prelate, who defrayed the expenses
                    attending this ceremony; and having paid a visit to the metropolitan city of St
                    Andrews, he proceeded to Dunkeld, where the clergy and laity testified the
                    utmost joy at the arrival of sô noble, learned, and pious a bishop. The bulls
                    having with the usual solemnities been read at the high altar, he retired to the
                    residence of the dean, George Hepbúrn, by whom hé was suitably entertained. The
                    episcopal palace was still occupied by the retainers of Stewart; and the bishop
                    finding next day that they had likewise seized the tower oΓ the cathedral, was
                    obliged to perform divine service at the deanery. In the afternoon he held a
                    consultation with the nobility, gentry, and clergy, by whom he was attended; but
                    their deliberations were speedily interrupted by the intelligence that Stewart
                    had taken up arms, and was advancing to support his adherents; and at the same
                    time they were alarmed by the commencement of a fire from the palace and the
                    cathedral. Lord Ogilvy, with the eldest son of the earl of Crawford, and many
                    other friends, including a considerable number of ecclesiastics, with' the dean
                    among the rest, immediately began to prepare for action; and messengers having
                    been dispatched to the neighbouring districts, his party was next day
                    strengthened by the arrival Of a formidable reinforcement of armed men. Stewart,
                    who did not find himself strong enough to hazard an attack, retired ińto the
                    woods. His retaipers, who garrisoned the palace and the cathedral, were now
                    summoned to surrender, under the pain of excommunication; and on their refusing
                    to obey this summons, the bishop’s servants, led by a valiant prebendary, and by
                    James Carmichael, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193324773?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-4773-0126"/> took possession of the cathedral. Intimidated by
                    this event, those who occupied the palace requested that a truce might be
                    granted, and the sentence of excommunication delayed for a few hours; but when
                    the stipulated time had elapsed, they still refused to surrender. The
                    interference of the regent at length enabled Douglas to take possession of his
                    palace without the effusion of blood; a circumstance, as one of his biographers
                    has remarked, which <hi rend="superscript"> ζi</hi> was certainly very
                    acceptable to the good bishop; who in all the actions of his life discovered a
                    gentle and merciful disposition, regulating the warlike and heroic spirit of his
                    family by the excellent laws of the Christian religion.”<note anchored="true"

                    After these events, Stewart hastened to the court, accompanied by his brother
                    the earl; and Douglas having likewise made his appearance, their respective
                    claims were taken into consideration by the regent and council. It was finally
                    agreed that Stewart should relinquish his pretensions to the see of Dunkeld, but
                    should retain such rents as he had already levied, and should be confirmed in
                    the possession of the two benefices of Alyth and Cargill, under the condition of
                    paying the bishop a certain annual contribution in grain.<note anchored="true"

                    bulls from Rome, yet the regent did not scruple to apply to the pope for a
                    ratification of this agreement: in a letter dated on the 28th of September 1516,
                    he entreated his holiness that all informalities might be removed, and the

                <p>Having at length been installed in his cathedral, he was speedily called from the
                    discharge of his episcopal functions. During the ensuing year, an ambassador
                    arrived from France, with a proposition for the renewal of the ancient league
                    between the two kingdoms; and it was thought expedient that the duke of Albany
                    should himself repair to Paris, accompanied by Bishop Douglas, and by Patrick
                    Panter, chancellor of Dunkeld, and secretary of state. The négociation having
                    been brought to a satisfactory conclusion, the bishop was employed to convey the

                    not merely prevented him from accumulating riches, but had even encumbered him

                    name of Douglas, has a romantic beauty of which it is difficult to convey an
                    adequate idea.</p>
                <p>When the duke of Albany was preparing to quit the kingdom, he delegated his
                    authority to the archbishops of St Andrews and Glasgow, and the earls of Arran,
                    Angus, Argyle, and Huntley: but the predominating power of Angus excited the
                    apprehensions or the jealousy of his colleagues; and they resolved to unite
                    their strength with the view of circumscribing the influence of so formidable a
                    rival. On the 29th of April 1520, Arran with many others of the
                    nobility.assembled at Edinburgh in the house of Archbishop Beaton: they formed
                    the resolution of instantly seizing the person of Angus, whose power, they
                    pretended, was so exorbitant that, while he continued at liberty, his
                    fellow-subjects could enjoy no security. Aware of their hostile intentions, he
                    requested his uncle the bishop of Dunkeld to mitigate their resentment, and
                    persuade them to adopt a more lawful method of redress. He accordingly addressed
                    himself to the archbishop, whom he found in the church belonging to the
                    monastery of the black friars, and entreated him to act the part of a
                    peacemaker: the crafty and turbulent prelate protested that he was at once
                    ignorant of their designs, and unable to prevent them from being carried into
                    execution; and to confirm this averment, he made a solemn appeal to his
                    conscience, but having too forcibly applied his hand to his breast, he
                    discovered to his indignant companion, that his sacred habit concealed a coat of
                    mail. “My Lord,” exclaimed the bishop, “I perceive your conscience is not good,
                    for I hear it <hi rend="italic">clattering”</hi> that is, telling tales. He next
                    accosted Sir Patrick Hamilton, requesting him to interpose with his brother the
                    earl of Arran: this gentleman was inclined to peaceable measures, when the
                    earl’s natural son Sir James, a man of a ferocious disposition, rudely upbraided
                    him with cowardice. This charge he repelled with indignation; and having drawn
                    his sword, he rushed furiously into the street, where the earl of Angus had
                    stationed a numerous body of his retainers: perceiving him advance before the

                    Hamilton’s life; but in the heat of battle it is difficult to spare those who
                    are eager to destroy, and he was speedily slain, together with the eldest son of
                    the earl of Eglintoun. The encounter, which was long and fierce, was at length
                    decided by the interference of some of the citizens, who were favourably
                    disposed to the queen, and therefore espoused the cause of her husband.
                    Seventy-two of his antagonists perished in the battle. During this scene of
                    disgraceful violence, the bishop of Dunkeld had retired to his chamber, and
                    spent the anxious interval in a manner suitable to the profession; but when the
                    contest was decided, he hastened to prevent the wanton effusion of blood. The
                    archbishop, who appears to have been personally engaged, had taken refuge behind
                    the altar of Black-friars church, and the rocket was already torn from his
                    shoulders, when the interposition of Douglas saved his life.<note

                    inactive in Scotland. His mission to the English king furnished a sufficient
                    pretext for accusing him of treason: on the 21st of February 1522 he was
                    declared a traitor, and the revenues of his see were placed in a state of

                    from affording him any pecuniary assistance, or maintaining with him any

                    the canons of his cathedral, represents him as eminently skilled in divinity and
                    the canon law. He was perhaps the most learned of the early Scotish pocts. Among
                    the ancient poets, his favourites were apparently Virgil and Ovid; among the
                    Christian fathers, his favourite was St Augustin, whom he denominates the chief
                    of clerks. Of the Latin language his knowledge was certainly extensive; and as
                    he states that Lord Sinclair had requested him to translate Homer, wc may
                    venture to infer that he was not unacquainted with Greek. It is highly probable
                    that he had completed his education on the continent, and had thus given his
                    studies a more elegant and classical direction. Nor were his talents less
                    conspicuous than his learning. In all his writings he evinces an excursive
                    fancy, with much of the fervour of genius. His allegorical sketches are efforts
                    of no common ingenuity; but what chiefly renders his works interesting is the
                    frequent occurrence of those picturesque and characteristic touches, which can
                    only be produced by a man capable of accurate observation and original thinking.
                    He exhibits perpetual vestiges of a prolific and even exuberant imagination, and
                    his very faults are those of superabundance rather than deficiency. In his
                    descriptions, which are often admirable, he occasionally distracts the attention
                    by a multiplicity of objects, nor is he sufficiently careful to represent each
                    new circumstance in a definite and appropriate manner. His style is copious and
                    impetuous, but it cannot be commended for its purity. In his translation of
                    Virgil he professes to be scrupulous in rejecting Anglicisms, and indeed his
                    diction is often remote from that of the English poets: but he has imported many
                    exotic terms from another quarter; his familiarity with the Latin language
                    betrays itself in almost every page of his writings. His verses, though less
                    smooth and elegant than those of Dunbar, arc not unskilfully constructed.</p>

                    fancy and a ready command of striking imagery. Still however it is to be
                    considered as a Gothic structure, and as exhibiting many of the peculiarities
                    which belong to that order: ancient and modern usages, classical and Christian
                    subjects, are almost constantly blended together; and a nymph of Calliope’s

                    a work which furnishes a striking example of the misapplication of fine poetical
                    talents. From the occurrence of several incorrect passages, it has been supposed
                    to be one of Douglas’s earliest performances. Incorrect passages wc may expect
                    to find in all the vernacular poetry of that age; and the versification appears
                    to us superior to that of the Palice of Honour. As he has not enumerated it
                    among his early works, we may perhaps venture to conclude that it was written
                    after his translation of Virgil. The heart, being the fountain of vital motion,
                    is here personified as man himself, and is conducted through a great variety of
                    adventures.</p>
                <p>But the most remarkable of Douglas’s works is perhaps his translation of the
                    AEneid.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The xiii. bukes

                    fortunately specified the origin and progress of this undertaking: he there
                    informs us that it was begun at the request of his cousin Lord Sinclair, whom he
                    represents as a zealous collector <hi rend="italic">of</hi> books, and protector
                    of science and literature; and that it was the labour of only sixteen months,
                    being completed on the 22d day of July 1513, about twelve years after he had
                    composed the Palice of Honour. This task must apparently be understood to
                    comprehend, not merely a version of Virgil’s twelve books, but likewise of the
                    supplementary book qf Mapheus Vcgius, together with the original poems which he
                    has interspersed in the volume. Whether we consider the state of British
                    literature at that period, or the rapidity with which he executed so extensive a
                    work, it is impossible to withhold from this version a large share of our
                    approbation. In either of the sister languages, few translations <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> classical authors had hitherto been attempted. Even in
                    England, it has been remarked, no metrical version of a classic had yet
                    appeared; except of Boethius, who scarcely merits that appellation.<note

                    published a kind of prose romance, which he professes to have translated from
                    the French; and the English reader was taught to consider this motley
                    composition as a version of the AEneid. Douglas bestows severe castigation on
                    Caxton for his perversion of the classical story; and affirms that his work no
                    more resembles Virgil than the devil resembles St Austin. He has however fallen
                    into one error which he exposes in his precursor; proper names are so completely
                    disfigured in his translation, that they cannot be recognized without some
                    degree of difficulty. In various instances<pb break="no"

                <p>Douglas’s translation of Virgil is certainly executed with no mean ability; it is
                    the effort of a bold and energetic writer, whose knowledge of the original

                    qualified him for the performance of so arduous a task. It is indeed to bc
                    regretted that he did not devote a much longer period to this undertaking: he
                    might thus have been enabled to render his versification more terse and
                    finished; but the work, in its present state, is a singular monument of his
                    genius and industry. One of his principal objects was to write in plain and
                    intelligible language, so that his favourite poet might be readily understood by
                    his countrymen; and by keeping this object constantly in view, he has frequently
                    attained to less elevation of style than might have been expected. His
                    translation possesses one merit which he probably did not contemplate: as a
                    version of a well-known classic, it presents an ample fund of philological
                    information; and Ruddiman’s excellent glossary has long recommended it to all
                    those who have paid any particular attention to the etymology of the Scotish
                    language. The felicity of this translation has been very warmly commended by
                    another Scotish prelate, Dr Lesley, the celebrated bishop of Ross; who, in
                    enumerating its various excellencies, has stated that it always renders one
                    verse by another. But this regularity of correspondence, for which it has
                    likewise been praised by Dempster, must not be too literally understood; and it
                    may be proper to recollect that the verses of the two poets, although they might
                    be equal in number, could not be equal in length, as a hexameter line may
                    consist of seventeen, and cannot consist of fewer than thirteen syllables.</p>
                <p>The bishop of Dunkelďs version of the AEneid seems to have suggested a similar
                    plan to the earl of Surrey, who translated the second and fourth books into
                    English. In this translation he has exhibited the earliest specimen of blank
                    verse that occurs in the history of English poetry. Dr Nott has remarked that
                    “we meet with so many expressions which Surrey has evidently borrowed, with so
                    many lines adopted with hardly any other alteration than that which the
                    difference of the dialect, and the measure made necessary, and so many taken
                    without any alteration at alR that all doubt ceases. It becomes a matter of
                    certainty that Surrey must have read and studied the Scottish translation before
                    he began his own.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Century, p. cciv.</p></note> This assertion he has verified by a long series of
                    parallel passages, which it is impossible to read without acquiescing in his
                    opinion.</p>
                <p>The several books of Douglas’s translation are introduced by prologues, which, in
                    the opinion of Warton, are often highly poetical, and shew that his proper walk
                    was original poetry. They have likewise received warm commendation from Hume of
                    Godscroft, who was himsclf a scholar and a poet. <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">In</hi> his prologues before every book,” he remarks, “where he
                    hath his liberty, he sheweth a natural and ample vein of poesy, so pure,
                    pleasant, and judicious, that I believe there is none that hath written before
                    or since, but cometh short of him. And, in my opinion, there is not such a piece
                    to be found as his prologue to the eighth book, beginning <hi rend="italic">Of
                    drevilling and dreams,</hi> &amp;c. at least in our language.”</p>
                <p>These are the only works of Bishop Douglas with which wc are now acquainted. On
                    concluding his translation of Virgil, he avowed a resolution to devote his
                    future days to the service of the commonwealth and the glory of God. The
                    earliest of his poetical performances appears to have been a translation of Ovid
                    <hi rend="italic">JDe Pemedio</hi><hi rend="italic">Amoris</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but of this translation no copy is known to be extant.</p>

                    whieh Sage supposes to be the short commentary noticed in the concluding address

                <p>This comment, as the same biographer conjectures, may have been merely a brief
                    explanation <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the classical mythology. If wc may rely on
                    the authority of Bale and Dempster, he likewise composed comedies; but both
                    these writers are apt to multiply books as well as authors. Another biographer
                    is inclined to suppose that he may have written the Flowers of the Forest, a
                    song which displays no small portion of pathetic simplicity. “It may be
                    conjectured,” says Mr Scott, “that he was the author of that celebrated elegaic
                    song, which describes the devastation occasioned by the battle of Flowdon, in
                    that part of the country with which he had long been well acquainted.”<note

                    opinions on such subjects were very far. from being infallible. According to a
                    more authentic account, the tune and two detached verses of this song arc
