                <p><label type="entry">DIALOGUE</label>, in literature and in common life, a
                    conversation between two or more persons, and either written or oral.</p>
                <p>As the end of speech is conversation, no kind of writing can be more natural than
                    dialogue, which represents this. Accordingly we find it was introduced at a very
                    early period; for there are several instances of it in the Mosaic history. The
                    ancient Greek writers, especially the philosophers, also fell very much into
                    dialogue, as the most convenient and agreeable method of communicating their
                    sentiments and instructions to mankind. And indeed it seems to be attended with
                    very considerable advantages, if well and judiciously managed; for it is capable
                    of rendering the driest subjects entertaining and pleasant, by its variety, and
                    by the different characters of the speakers. Besides, things may be canvassed
                    more minutely, and many lesser matters, which serve to clear up a subject, may
                    be introduced with better grace, by means of questions and answers, objections
                    and replies, than can be con-venientlydone in a continued discourse. There is
                    likewise a further advantage in this way of writing, that the author is at
                    liberty to choose his speakers; and therefore, as Cicero has well observed, that
                    when we imagine that we have persons of an established reputation for wisdom and
                    knowledge talking together, this circumstance necessarily addsaweight and
                    authority to the discourse, and more closely engages the attention. The
                    subject-matter of dialogue is very extensive; for whatever is a proper argument
                    of discourse, public or private, serious or jocose—whatever is fit for wise and
                    ingenious men to talk upon, either for improvement or diversion—is suitable for
                    a dialogue.</p>
                <p>From this general account of the nature of dialogue, it is easy to perceive what
                    kind of style best suits it. Its affinity with epistles shows there ought to be
                    no great difference between them in this respect. Indeed, some have been of
                    opinion that it ought rather to sink below the style of an epistle, because
                    dialogues should in all respects represent the freedom of conversation, whereas
                    epistles ought sometimes to be composed with care and accuracy, especially when
                    written to superiors. But there seems to be little weight in this argument,
                    since the design of an epistle is to say the same things, and in the same
                    manner, as the writer judges would be most fit and proper for him to speak if
                    present; and in a dialogue the design is similar with respect to the several
                    persons concerned in it. Upon the whole, therefore, a plain, easy, and simple
                    style, suited to the nature of the subject, and the particular characters of the
                    persons concerned, seems to be alike suitable to both.</p>
                <p>But as greater skill is required in writing dialogues than letters, we shall give
                    a more particular account of the priqcipal things necessary to be regarded in
                    their composition, and illustrate them chiefly from Cicero’s excellent dialogues
                    concerning an orator. A dialogue then consists of two parts; an <hi
                    rend="italic">introduction,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">the body of the
                    discourse.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">introduction</hi> acquaints us with the place, time,
                    persons, and occasion of the conversation. Thus Cicero places the scene of his
                    dialogues at the country seat of Crassus; a very proper retreat, both for such a
                    debate and the parties engaged in it. And as they were persons of the first
                    rank, employed in the greatest affairs of the state, and as the discourse
                    occupied them for two days, he represents it to have happened at the time of a
                    festival, when no business was done at Rome, and an opportunity was thus
                    afforded them of being absent.</p>
                <p>And because the greatest regard should be had in the choice of the persons, who
                    ought to be such as are well acquainted with the subject upon which they
                    discourse, in these dialogues of Cicero the two principal disputants are Crassus
                    and Antony, the greatest orators of that age, and therefore the most proper
                    persons to dispute respecting the qualifications essential for their art. One
                    would think it scarcely necessary to observe that the corfference should be held
                    by persons who lived at the time, and thus were capable of conversing together.
                    But yet some good writers have run into the impropriety of feigning dialogues
                    between persons who had lived at distant times. Plato adopted this method, in
                    which he has been followed by Macrobius. But others, who have been willing to
                    bring persons to discourse together who lived in different ages, without such
                    inconsistency, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193323161" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3161-0002"
                    />have written dialogues of the dead. Lucian has made himself most remarkable in
                    this way. As to the number of persons in a dialogue, they may be more or fewer;
                    so many as can conveniently carry on a conversation without disorder or
                    confusion, or they may be only two. Some of Cicero’s dialogues have but two,
                    others three or more, and those concerning an orator seven. But it is convenient
                    in some respects that they should all be persons of different characters and
                    abilities; a circumstance which contributes both to the variety and beauty of
                    the discourse, like the different attitudes of figures in a picture. Thus, in
                    Cicero’s dialogues last mentioned, Crassus excelled in art, Antony principally
                    by the force of his genius, Catullus by the purity of his style, Scevola by his
                    skill in the law, Caesar by wit and humour; and Sulpitius and Cotta, though
                    young men, were both excellent orators, yet they differed in their manner. But
                    there should be always one principal person, having the main part of the
                    conversation; like the hero in an epic poem or a tragedy, who excels the rest in
                    action, or the principal figure in a picture, which is always made the most
                    conspicuous. In Plato’s dialogues this is Socrates, and Crassus in those of
                    Cicero above mentioned.</p>
                <p>It is usual likewise, in the introductions, to acquaint us with the occasion of
                    the discourse. Indeed this is not always mentioned; as in Cicero’s dialogue
                    concerning the parts of oratory, where the son begins immediately with desiring
                    his father to instruct him in the art. But it is generally taken notice of, and
                    most commonly represented as accidental; the reason of which may be, that such
                    discourses appear most natural, and may likewise afford some kind of apology for
                    the writer in managing his different characters, since the greatest men may be
                    supposed not always to speak with the utmost exactness in an accidental
                    conversation. Thus Cicero, in his dialogues concerning an orator, makes Crassus
                    occasionally fall upon the subject of oratory, in order to divert the company
                    from the melancholy thoughts of what they had been discoursing of before, with
                    relation to the public disorders, and the dangers which threatened their common
                    country. But the introduction ought not to be too long and tedious. Mr Addison
                    complains of this fault in some authors who employ dialogue. “For though,” as he
                    says, “some of the finest treatises of the most polite Latin and Greek writers
                    are in dialogue, as many very valuable pieces of French, Italian, and English,
                    appear in the same dress; yet in some of them there is so much time taken up in
                    ceremony, that, before they enter on their subject, the dialogue is half
                    over.”</p>
                <p>We come now to the <hi rend="italic">body</hi> of the discourse, in which some
                    things relating to the persons, and others to the subject, are proper to be
                    remarked.</p>
                <p>And as to the <hi rend="italic">persons,</hi> the principal thing to be attended
                    to is to keep up a justness and consistency of character throughout the whole.
                    And the distinct characters ought to be so perfectly observed, that even from
                    the very words it may be always known who is the speaker. This renders dialogue
                    more difficult than single description, by reason of the number and variety of
                    characters which are to be drawn at the same time, and each of them managed with
                    the greatest propriety. The principal speaker should appear to be a person of
                    great sense and wisdom, and best acquainted with the subject. No question ought
                    to be asked him, nor objection started, but what he should fairly answer; and
                    all that is said by the rest should principally tend to promote his discourse,
                    and carry it through in the most artful and agreeable manner. When the argument
                    is attended with difficulties, one other person or more, of equal reputation, or
                    nearly so, but of different sentiments, should be introduced to oppose him, and
                    maintain the contrary side of the question. This affords an opportunity for a
                    thorough examination of the point on both sides, and for answering all
                    objections. But if the combatants are not pretty equally matched, and masters of
                    the subject, they will treat it but superficially. Through the whole debate,
                    however, there ought not to be the least wrangling, peevishness, or obstinacy;
                    nothing indeed but the appearance of good humour and good breeding, together
                    with a readiness to submit to conviction and the force of truth, according as
                    the evidence shall appear to be on one side or the other. In Cicero, these two
                    characters are Crassus and Antony; and from them Mr Addison seemă to have taken
                    his Philander and Cynthio in his <hi rend="italic">Dialogues upon the Usefulness
                    of Ancient Medals,</hi> which are formed pretty much upon Cicero’s plan. When
                    younger persons are introduced, or such as are not equally acquainted with the
                    subject, they should rather be inquisitive than disputative; and the questions
                    they ask should be neither too long nor too frequent, in order that they may not
                    too much interrupt the debate, nor appear over talkative before wiser and more
                    experienced persons. Sulpitius and Cotta sustain this character in Cicero, and
                    Eugenius in Mr Addison. It is very convenient, however, that there should be one
                    person of a witty and jocose humour, to enliven the discourse at proper seasons,
                    and render it the more entertaining, especially when the dialogue is drawn out
                    to any considerable length. Caesar performs this part in Cicero; and in Mr
                    Addison, Cynthio, a person of a similar turn, opposes Philander in a humorous
                    way. Mr Addison’s subject admitted of this; but the seriousness and gravity of
                    Cicero’s argument required a different speaker for the jocose part. Many persans
                    ought not to speak immediately after one another; though Scaliger and others
                    think a fourth person may sometimes be permitted to speak in the same scene
                    without confusion. However, if this is not commonly allowed upon the stage,
                    where the actors are present, and maybe distinguished by their voice and habit;
                    much less should it be so in a dialogue, where we have only their names to
                    distinguish them.</p>
                <p>With regard to the <hi rend="italic">subject,</hi> all the arguments should
                    appear probable at least, and nothing should be advanced which may seem weak or
                    trivial. There ought also to be an union in dialogue, in order that the
                    discourse may not ramble, but keep up to the main design. Indeed, short and
                    pleasant digressions are sometimes allowable, for the ease and entertainment of
                    the reader; but every thing should be so managed that he may still be able to
                    carry on the thread of the discourse in his mind, and keep the main argument in
                    view, till the whole be finished. The writers of dialogue have not confined
                    their discourses to any certain space of time, but either concluded them with
                    the day, or broken off' when their speakers have been tired, and resumed them
                    again the next day. Thus Cicero allows two days for his three dialogues
                    concerning an orator; but Mr Addison extends his to three days, allowing a day
                    for each. But the same method has not always been observed in composing
                    dialogues; for sometimes the writer, by way of narrative, relates a discourse
                    which passed between other persons. Such are the dialogues of Cicero and Mr
                    Addison last mentioned, and many others both of the ancients and moderns. But at
                    other times the speakers are introduced in person as talking to each other.
                    This, as Cicero observes, prevents the frequent repetition of those words, “he
                    said,” and “he replied ;” and by placing the hearer, as it were, in the
                    conversation, gives him a more lively representation of the discourse, and thus
                    makes it the more affecting. In this manner, therefore, Cicero wrote his <hi
                    rend="italic">Dialogue of Old Age,</hi> in which Cato, who was then advanced in
                    years, recounts the satisfaction of life which may be enjoyed in old age; and,
                    in fact, he tells his friend <pb break="no" facs="nls:193323174"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-3174-0003"/>Atticus he was himself so affected with that
                    discourse, that when he reviewed it, he sometimes fancied they were not his own
                    words, but Cato’s. There are some other dialogues of Cicero written in the same
                    way; and both Plato and Lucian generally chose this method.</p>
