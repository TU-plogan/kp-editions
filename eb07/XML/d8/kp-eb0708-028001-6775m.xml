                <p><label type="entry">DUNDEE</label>, a seaport town in Forfarshire, situated on
                    the north bank of the river Tay, about twelve miles from its mouth. It is
                    forty-two miles from Edinburgh, twenty-two miles from Perth, and eighteen
                    south-west from Arbroath, being in latitude 56. 2. 23. north, and longitude 3.
                    2. 55. west. The history of Scotland narrates many sackings and burnings of this
                    town. The last of these was by General Monek; and such was its wealth at that
                    time, that every soldier in Monck’s army is said to have received L.60 sterling
                    as his share of the plunder. Dundee was erected into a royal burgh by William
                    the Lion in 1165. The town is governed by a provost, four bailies, a dean of
                    guild, and thirteen councillors, and sends a member to parliament. In 1831 the
                    government, at the solicitation of the inhabitants, granted them a resident
                    sheriff-substitute. The market-place, or High Street, is a spacious square, 360
                    feet long by 100 broad, from which diverge the Nethergate, Seagate, Overgate,
                    and Murrangate, the principal streets, which run from east to west, parallel to
                    the river. These streets, till within the last forty years, formed the chief
                    part of the town; and the access from it to the harbour being through narrow
                    lanes, it had a very hampered and crowded appearance. This defect has been
                    remedied by the opening up of several spacious streets <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193326788" xml:id="kp-eb0708-6788-0281"/>leading from north to south,
                    with houses built in a modern style. Castle Street leads from the south-east end
                    of the High Street to the new docks on the south, and contains, among other neat
                    buildings, an episcopal chapel and a theatre. At the south-east corner is an
                    elegant building in the Grecian style, erected for an exchange and reading-room.
                    On the south side of the market-place or square stands the town-hall, surmounted
                    by a steeple, and having piazzas below; it was built in 1743. Opposite to this
                    building is a spacious new street, named Reform Street; at the north end of
                    which, and fronting the town-hall, an elegant edifice has lately been erected,
                    in the Grecian style of architecture, for an academy and public schools. At the
                    east end of the High Street, and rather obstructing the entrance to the
                    Murrangate, stands the trades’ hall, a plain edifice, with pilasters of the
                    Ionic order, the principal apartment of which is used as a reading-room, and it
                    contains, besides, apartments for each of the nine incorporated trades. A little
                    to the west of the High Street is the Nethergate, a spacious and well-built
                    street, in which are the remains of an old cathedral, containing four places of
                    worship, one of which, the most entire, is built in the finest Gothic style, the
                    groining of the arches being much admired. This structure is said to have been
                    originally built by David earl of Huntingdon as far back as the year 1185. On
                    the west end of these churches stands a magnificent Gothic tower 156 feet high.
                    There are several other churches and chapels connected with the establishment,
                    besides two episcopal chapels, and various other places of worship for
                    dissenters, who form no inconsiderable part of the population. Among the public
                    institutions may he mentioned a lunatic asylum, an infirmary, a dispensary for
                    out-patients, and an orphan institution; a chamber of commerce, the society of
                    writers, incorporated by royal charter, and a mechanics’ institution. Dundee has
                    four joint-stock banking establishments, viz. the Dundee Bank, the Union Bank,
                    the New Bank, and the Commercial Bank. Besides these, there are agencies for the
                    British Linen Company, the National Bank of Scotland, and the Bank of Scotland.
                    There is a native establishment for fire insurance, and one for sea insurance.
                    There are two weekly newspapers published in the place. The trade of Dundee has
                    long been extensive, and it has rapidly increased of late years. Its
                    manufactures are chiefly brown and bleached linens for the home and foreign
                    market, great quantities of which are exported directly to North and South
                    America. It also carries on a great trade to the Baltic, and has a number of
                    vessels employed in the whale fishery. In the London trade, besides a number of
                    sailing smacks, there are two splendid steam-vessels, having each two engines of
                    125 horse power. A railway was opened some years ago between Dundee and
                    New-tyle, a village in Strathmore, about ten miles distant, which lays open the
                    traffic of that extensive agricultural district. This undertaking has been
                    attended with considerable expense, from the nature of the ground. It crosses
                    the Law of Dundee, a high hill, by means of an inclined plane and tunnel, and
                    the Siedlaw range of hills by an inclined plane at Balbeuchly. Two locomotive
                    engines of ten horse power each are employed on it. The difficulties encountered
                    in crossing the mountainous ridges being overcome, it is about to be extended to
                    Coupar Angus, Glammis, Forfar, &amp;c. Among the undertakings either in progress
                    or in prospect may be mentioned a new jail and bridewell, a newcustom-hoιιse,
                    and an establishment for supplying water to the town. The tonnage of the port in
                    1832 amounted to 32,868 tons, which employed about 3500 seamen. Its imports in
                    flax and hemp in 1832 amounted to 21,967 tons. There are in the town and
                    neighbourhood about fifty spinning-mills, all worked by steam; and the steam
                    power employed in the different establishments exceeds 1400 horse power. There
                    are several extensive iron founderies, and establishments for the manufacture of
                    steam-engines and machinery. The grandest and most important feature, however,
                    of Dundee is its harbour, upon which, nearly L.200,000 has been expended. It
                    consists of magnificent wet docks and a number of spacious quays, graving dock,
                    &amp;c. spreading along the margin of the Tay, and terminated on the west by the
                    Craig Pier, which is exclusively appropriated to the use of the ferry, on which
                    two twin steam-boats are employed, of a construction which admits of horses and
                    carriages being transported across the river, which is here two miles broad,
                    without unloosing the horses from the vehicles to which they are attached. The
                    increase of the trade of Dundee within the last eighteen years has been in a
                    greater ratio than that of any other place in the empire, if we except Liverpool
                    and Glasgow, as will be seen from the following statement: In 1815 it had 157
                    vessels, registering 15,275 tons; in 1832 it had 274 vessels, registering 32,867
                    tons. In 1815 sixty-six vessels entered inwards with cargoes from foreign ports,
                    registering 10,620; in 1832 there were 307 vessels, registering 46,539 tons,
                    being an increase of 241 vessels, and four times the amount of tonnage. In 1815
                    three vessels cleared outwards with cargoes for foreign ports, registering 679
                    tons; in 1832, fifty-six vessels cleared outwards for foreign ports, registering
                    11,159 tons, being an increase of fifty-three vessels, and more than sixteen
                    times the amount of tonnage. The population of Dundee in 1821 was 30,575, and by
                    the census of 1831 it was 45,355, exclusive of the seamen belonging to the port.
                    It is now understood to exceed 50,000. This town has become the principal seat
                    of the linen trade of Great Britain, and the great emporium of flax and
                    hemp.</p>
