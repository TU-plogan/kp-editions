                <p><label type="entry">DILLENIUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">John James</hi></label>, a
                    distinguished botanist of the eighteenth century, who may be called the father
                    of cryptogamie botany, was born at Darmstadt in 1687. He was educated as a
                    physician in the university of Giessen; but his attention was very early
                    diverted from ' medical studies to the observation and discrimination of plants;
                    nor does he appear to have ever followed any branch of the practice of physic.
                    In botany he was strictly a practical observer, having addicted himself but
                    little to the principles of classification, and not at all to the physiology of
                    vegetables. Some branches of zoology occasionally engaged him, which an
                    assiduous collector of plants, in their native situations, can hardly escape, so
                    closely are these studies, especially that of insects and the lower tribes of
                    animated beings, connected with botany. Dillenius, whilst at Giessen, wrote
                    several papers for the <hi rend="italic">Ephemerides Natures</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Curiosorum,</hi> on American plants naturalized in Europe, on
                    coffee, on opium obtained from poppies in Germany, with some minute critical
                    remarks on <hi rend="italic">Spergula pentandra,</hi> as well as on various
                    cryptogamous plants. He published also a paper on leeches, and two species of
                    <hi rend="italic">papilio.</hi> He printed at Giessen in 1719 his <hi
                    rend="italic">Catalogus Plantarum sponte</hi><hi rend="italic">circa
                    Gissam</hi><hi rend="italic">nascentium,</hi> a valuable little octavo volume,
                    with figures drawn and engraved by his own hand, of the parts of fructification,
                    particularly designed to illustrate the generic characters of plants, previously
                    not well arranged or understood. In this work he established many new genera,
                    which have for the most part kept their ground. His great merit as a general
                    botanist consisted in a constant attention to the only sound principle of
                    scientific botany, the discrimination of <hi rend="italic">genera</hi> by the
                    parts of the flower and fruit. This principle, first proposed by the great
                    Conrad Gesncr, Dillenius applied to practice, with a severer judgment and closer
                    attention than perhaps any other person, from Gesner to Linnaeus. The little
                    book in question is arranged most inconveniently according to the times of the
                    plants’ flowering. Its preface, however, enters into the subject of
                    classification, a subject to which young botanists are generally prone, but of
                    which they as generally, after having embroiled it, take their leave, in
                    proportion as they acquire more practical knowledge. Dillenius so far displayed
                    his judgment, that he rather showed the faults of the systems of Tournefort,
                    Knaut, and Rivinus, than offered any thing of his own. This led him into some
                    controversies, from which he soon disengaged himself, and never subsequently
                    took up the question at all.</p>
                <p>The great William Sherard, while returning in 1718 from Smyrna through Germany,
                    met with Dillenius, whose scientific merit could not have escaped so eminent a
                    botanist. He brought him to England in 1721, and excited him to publish, in
                    1724, that valuable enlarged edition of Ray’s <hi rend="italic">Synopsis</hi> of
                    British plants, which has ever since been in general use, and which the editor
                    enriched with engravings of his own. In this publication, compared with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Catalogus</hi> of the plants of Giessen above mentioned, we cannot
                    but perceive the difference between an author working upon his own original
                    materials, and the commentator or illustrator of the labours of another. Though
                    Dillenius made numerous and correct additions to Ray’s work, in the cryptogamie
                    tribes at least, he rather confused than improved the other parts of the book,
                    especially with regard to synonyms, in which department he was never supremely
                    accurate.</p>
                <p>In 1732 Dillenius published his magnificent <hi rend="italic">Hortus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">El-thamensis,</hi> in two volumes folio, containing 324 plates,
                    engraved on pewter, with his own hand. Their merit consists in their very great
                    precision and fidelity. The descriptions, and historical as well as botanical
                    remarks, render this a classical book in botany. Its style is good, and the
                    whole performance is worthy of the author, and of his eminent patron, whose
                    brother, Dr James Sherard, was the owner of the garden at Eltham, which
                    furnished the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193323538" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3538-0031"
                    />rich materials of this publication. Before this book appeared, its author was
                    established at Oxford, in the new professorship founded there by the will of
                    William Sherard, who died in August 1728, and who left L.3000 for the purpose,
                    besides his own library, manuscripts, and ample herbarium. Dillenius took the
                    degree of M. D. in this university in 1735, though he had previously obtained
                    the same rank at Giessen; and he now devoted himself to the completion of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Pinax,</hi> or universal collection of synonyms, which was
                    Sherard’s chief object in this foundation. The work was never finished; for
                    indeed neither Dillenius nor any one else could even at that time be competent
                    to it: still less, as botanists and botanical works multiplied excessively, was
                    this undertaking practicable. The publications of Linnaeus soon rendered it
                    unnecessary. That illustrious foreigner in 1736 visited Dillenius, who was
                    desirous of fixing him here as his coadjutor; but to this scheme there were
                    several impediments. Nevertheless these distinguished men continued ever after
                    in correspondence, certainly to the advantage of their common study, except in
                    one but too important instance. We allude to the theory of the fructification of
                    mosses, in which Linnaeus implicitly adopted the faulty opinion of the Oxford
                    professor, contrary to his own better observation and judgment, taking the
                    capsule for the anther. This leads us to mention the immortal work on which the
                    fame of Dillenius rests, and which, in its way, will never be excelled, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Historia Muscorum,</hi> published in 1741, in one quarto volume,
                    with eighty-five plates, drawn and engraved by the author. In this performance,
                    laborious investigation, acute discrimination, supreme accuracy, and profound
                    learning, are displayed beyond all example or comparison. Following inquirers,
                    like the celebrated Hedwig, may, with better helps, have examined the same
                    objects more deeply; but none has taken so complete a view of the subject, nor
                    made so very few mistakes. No botanical book perhaps is so perfect in synonyms.
                    Whether the labour of this undertaking was too much for the health of its
                    author, or whether his sedentary mode of life was, on the whole, injurious, we
                    have no particular information; but he began, soon after the publication of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Historia Muscorum,</hi> to complain of ill health and
                    advancing age. He was of a short stature and corpulent habit, and died of an
                    apoplexy on the 2d April 1747, in his sixtieth year. A picture of this
                    distinguished botanist is preserved in the picture-gallery at Oxford, from which
                    a print has been published in Sim’s and Konig’s <hi rend="italic">Annals of
                    Botany,</hi> vol. ii. Dillenius is said to have been amiable and respectable in
                    his private character. He never married. His books, collection of mosses
                    referring to his great work, with many drawings, especially of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fungi,</hi> were bought by his successor Dr Humphrey Sibthorp, and added to the
                    Sherardian Museum, where they still remain. (x. χ.)</p>
