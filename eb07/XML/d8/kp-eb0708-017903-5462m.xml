                    celebrated French surgeon, born at Paris in 1685, was the son of a surgeon of
                    the same name, who, while serving with the army, had been distinguished for
                    practical dexterity in the treatment of gunshot wounds. Young Le Dran entered on
                    the surgical career under the auspices and direction of his father, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193325475" xml:id="kp-eb0708-5475-0180"/> and early
                    attained to eminence in his profession. He became surgeon-major and demonstrator
                    of anatomy at La Charité, member of the royal academy of surgery, consulting
                    surgeon of the camps and armies of the king, and associate of the Royal Society
                    of London. Apart from his professional pursuits, almost no particulars of his
                    life have been preserved. He died at Paris on the 17th October 1770, at the
                    advanced age of eighty-five. Le Dran was the author of a variety of works on
                    surgery, of which we shall here subjoin a very brief account. 1. <hi

                    >differentes manières de tirer la Pierre hors de la Vessie,</hi> Paris, 1730,
                    1740, 8vo, with plates; translated into German, Berlin, 1737, 8vo, and into
                    English, London, 1738, 8vo. Le Dran, in this work, condemns the small, and shows
                    himself a partizan of the large apparatus; recommending, however, that the
                    incision should be made a little lower than Collot had been accustomed to make
                    it, and that it should be of an extent sufficient to prevent the dilaceration of
                    the bladder. He approves of the high apparatus only in the case where the
                    bladder is sound and the calculus.very voluminous. In order to obviate the too
                    frequent lesion of the rectum in using the probe described by Albinus for the
                    lateral operation of Rau, Le Dran invented a new sound, which enabled him to
                    avoid such a casualty, and contributed materially to his success. 2. <hi

                    1738, 8vo, and into English, 1739, 8vo. This collection is rich in facts well
                    chosen, and reported with candour and precision. The author does not dissemble
                    his faults, and speaks of his success without ostentation. 3. <hi rend="italic"

                    and 1742, 8vo; London, 1749, 8vo, with additions by Cheselden. This work, in
                    which the author ascribes an imaginary influence to the animal spirits, is
                    nevertheless valuable, as containing an accurate description of a great number
                    of operations, and many practical facts alike curious and interesting. If a new
                    method is spoken of, he never fails to indicate the author of the disŵvery. 4.

                    Ambroise Paré, the author has here added the fruits of his own experience; and
                    he has contributed to check in some cases the use, then too exclusive, of the
                    seton. He has also advocated the method of large incisions, and justly
                    proscribed the application of sindons or pledgets of linen soaked with brandy,
                    in the first dressing of gunshot wounds. 5. <hi rend="italic">Suite</hi><hi

                    dissolving lead by means of mercury, and evinces great credulity in attributing
                    to mercury certain imaginary qualities. Besides the works above enumerated, a
                    great number of interesting observations by Le Dran may be found in the <hi
