                    marriage.</p><p>Divorce was allowed of in great latitude both amongst the Pagans and Jews. In
                    Rome, barrenness, age, disease, madness, and banishment, were the ordinary
                    causes of divorce. Under the consulship of Μ. Attilius and P. Valerius, Spurius
                    Carvilius was the first who put away his wife because she was barren; though
                    Plutarch, in his Roman Questions, maintains that Domitian was the first who
                    permitted divorce. Justinian afterwards added impotence, a vow of chastity, and
                    the profession of a monastic life, as valid reasons of divorce.</p><p>The Roman lawyers distinguish between <hi rend="italic">repudium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">divortium</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the former being the
                    breaking of a contract or espousal, and the latter separation after matrimony.
                    Romulus enacted a severe law, which forbade a wife to leave her husband, but
                    gave the husband the liberty of turning away his wife, either upon her poisoning
                    her children, counterfeiting his private keys, or committing the crime of
                    adultery; if the husband, however, put her away on any other occasion, he
                    ordered one moiety of his estate to be settled on the wife, and the other to be
                    given to the goddess Ceres, besides an atonement to the gods of the earth. In
                    later times, however, the women as well as the men might sue a divorce. The
                    common way of divorcing was by sending a bill to the woman, containing the
                    reasons of separation, and the tender of all her goods which she brought with
                    her, and this was called <hi rend="italic">repudium mittere</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> or else it was performed in her presence, and before seven
                    witnesses, accompanied with the formalities of tearing the writings, refunding
                    the dowry, taking away the keys, and turning the woman out of doors.</p><p>The Grecian laws concerning divorce were different. The Cretans allowed divorce
                    to any man who was afraid of having too many children. The Spartans seldom
                    divorced their wives, and it was extremely scandalous for a woman to depart from
                    her husband. The Athenians allowed divorce on very trivial grounds. It proceeded
                    by a bill, containing the reason of the divorce, and approved, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193324071" xml:id="kp-eb0708-4071-0072"/>if the party
                    appealed, by the chief magistrate; and women also were allowed to leave their
                    husbands on just occasions. Persons divorcing their wives were obliged to return
                    their portions, otherwise the Athenian laws obliged them to pay nine oboli a
                    month for alimony. The terms expressing the separation of men and women from
                    each other were different; the men were said <hi rend="italic">am</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">πiμnttv</hi> or <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> t</hi><hi rend="italic">ιrο</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">υnv, to dismiss their
                    wives;</hi> but wives, <hi rend="italic">a&lt;κοKu&lt;jrnv, to leave their
                    husbands.</hi> “The law of Moses,” observes Archdeacon Paley, “for reasons of
                    local expediency, permitted the Jewish husband to put away his wife; but whether
                    for every cause, or for what cause, appears to have been controverted amongst
                    the interpreters of those times. Christ, the precepts of whose religion were
                    calculated for more general use and observation, revokes this permission, as
                    given to the Jews ‘ for their hardness of heart,’ and promulgates a law which
                    was thenceforward to confine divorces to the single cause of adultery in the
                    wůfe: ‘ Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and
                    shall marry another, committeth adultery; and whoso marrieth her which is put
                    away, doth commit adultery.’</p><p>“Inferior causes may justify the separation of husband and wife, although they
                    will not authorize such a dissolution of the marriage contract as w ʹ ould leave
                    either at liberty to marry again; for it is that liberty in which the danger and
                    mischief of divorces generally consist. The law of this country, in conformity
                    to our Saviour’s injunction, confines the dissolution of the marriage contract
                    to the single case of adultery in the wife; and a divorce even in that case can
                    only be brought about by the operation of an act of parliament, founded upon a
                    previous sentence in the spiritual court, and a verdict against the adulterer at
                    common law; which proceedings taken together compose as complete an
                    investigation of the complaint as a cause can receive. It has lately been
                    proposed to the legislature to annex a clause to these acts, restraining the
                    offending party from marrying with the companion of her crime, who by the course
                    of proceeding is always known and convicted; for there is reason to fear that
                    adulterous connections arc often formed with the prospect of bringing them to
                    this conclusion; at least, when the seducer has once captivated the affection of
                    a married woman, he may avail himself of this tempting argument to subdue her
                    scruples and complete his victory; and the legislature, as the business is
                    managed at present, assists by its interposition the criminal design of the
                    offenders, and confers a privilege where it ought to inflict a punishment. The
                    proposal deserved an experiment; but something more penal, it is apprehended,
                    will be found necessary to check the progress of this alarming depravity.
                    Whether a law might not be framed, directing <hi rend="italic">the fortune of
                    the adultress to descend as in case of</hi><hi rend="italic">lier</hi><hi rend="italic">natural death</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> reserving, however, a
                    certain proportion of the produce of it, by way of annuity, for her subsistence
                    (such annuity in no case to exceed a certain sum); and also so far suspending
                    the estate in the hands of the heir as to preserve the inheritance to any
                    children she might bear to a second marriage, in case there was none to succeed
                    in the place of their mother by the first; whether such a law would not render
                    female virtue in higher life less vincible, as well as the seducers of that
                    virtue less urgent in their suit, I would recommend to the deliberation of those
                    who are willing to attempt the reformation of this important but most
                    incorrigible class of the community. A passion for splendour, for expensive
                    amusements and distinctions, is commonly found in that description of women who
                    w ould become the subject of such a law, not less inordinate than their other
                    appetites. A severity of the kind proposed applies immediately to that passion;
                    and there is no room for any complaint of injustice, since the provisions above
                    stated, with others which might be contrived, confine the punishment, so far as
                    it is possible, to the person of the offender; suffering the estate to remain to
                    the heir, or within the family of the ancestor from whom it came, or to attend
                    the appointments of his will.</p><p>“Sentences of the ecclesiastical courts, which release the parties <hi rend="italic">a vinculo matrimonii,</hi> by reason of impuberty, frigidity,
                    consanguinity within the prohibited degrees, prior marriage, or want of the
                    requisite consent of parents or guardians, are not dissolutions of the marriage
                    contract, but judicial declarations that there never was any marriage; such
                    impediment subsisting at the time as rendered the celebration of the marriage
                    rite a mere nullity. And the rite itself contains an exception of these
                    impediments. The man and woman to be married are charged <hi rend="superscript">
                    t</hi> if they know' any impediment why they may not be lawfully joined
                    together, to confess it ;’ and assured, ‘ that so many as are coupled together,
                    otherwise than God’s word doth allow, are not joined together by God, neither is
                    their matrimony lawful ;’ all which is intended by way of solemn notice to the
                    parties, that the vow they are about to make will bind their consciences and
                    authorize their cohabitation only upon the supposition that no legal impediment
                    exist.”</p><p>By the law of Scotland, a divorce may be obtained on the ground either of
                    adultery or of wilful desertion; but neither of these grounds dissolves the
                    marriage <hi rend="italic">ipso jure;</hi> and if a process of divorce be not
                    instituted, the marriage subsists, notwithstanding the adultery or desertion.
                    Until recently the action of divorce proceeded before the commissaries of
                    Edinburgh; and in every such action, whether founded on adultery or desertion,
                    the pursuer must make oath that the action is not collusive. The legal effect of
                    divorce on the ground of desertion is, that the offending party loses the
                    “tocher,” as it is called, and the <hi rend="italic">donationes</hi><hi rend="italic">propter</hi><hi rend="italic">nuptias</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that is, the offending husband is bound to restore the dowry, and to pay
                    or make good to the wife all her provisions, legal or conventional; and the
                    offending wife forfeits her dowry, and all that would have come to her had the
                    marriage been dissolved by the predecease of her husband. It is now held that
                    recrimination is not a good defence against divorce for adultery; yet, as the
                    mutual guilt may affect the patrimonial interests of the parties, it may be
                    stated in a counter-action. But <hi rend="italic">lenocinium,</hi> or the
                    husband’s participation in the profits of his wife’s prostitution, nay even the
                    husband’s connivance in her guilt, is a good defence to the wife against an
                    action of divorce on the ground of adultery. The statute 1600, c. 20, declares
                    marriages contracted between the adulterer and the person with whom he or she
                    may be found, by the sentence of divorce, to have committed the crime, to be
                    null and unlawful, and the issue of such marriages to be incapable of succeeding
                    to their parents; but the act, nevertheless, has not the effect of bastardizing
                    such issue. The right to institute a divorce is personal to the husband or wife;
                    but if, after the action has been raised, either party die before the decree of
                    divorce becomes final, it has been argued that the natural dissolution of the
                    marriage by death supersedes and definitively closes all proceeding commenced
                    for dissolving it on any other ground. The natural dissolution, it has been
                    contended, is the first effectual one, and that which is to regulate all
                    questions as to the patrimonial rights or the <hi rend="italic">status</hi> of
                    the survivor. But the question how far litiscontestation in such a case renders
                    it transmissible to representatives, has .not yet, we believe, been decided.</p><p>By the law of England there are two kinds of divorce, the one total and the other
                    partial; the one <hi rend="italic">a vinculo matrimonii,</hi> the other merely
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">mensa</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">tow.</hi> The total <pb break="no" facs="nls:193324084" xml:id="kp-eb0708-4084-0073"/>divorce must be
                    for some of the canonical causes of impediment, and these existing <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the marriage, not supervenient or arising afterwards;
                    for in cases of total divorce the marriage is declared null, as having been
                    absolutely unlawful <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">initio.</hi>
                    Divorce <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">mensa et toro</hi> is when
                    the marriage is just and lawful <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">initio,</hi> but, for some supervenient cause, as in the case of adultery in
                    either of the parties, it becomes impossible for them to live together. But in
                    England adultery is only a cause of separation from bed and board; because,
                    according to the law of that country, if divorces were allowed to depend upon a
                    matter within the power of either of the parties, they might become extremely
                    frequent, and the stability of society might in consequence be shaken. However,
                    divorces <hi rend="italic">a vinculo matrimonii</hi> have latterly been
                    frequently granted by act of parliament; though, in order to prevent such from
                    being obtained by fraud and collusion, the two houses not only examine witnesses
                    in order to be convinced of the adultery of the wife, but they also require that
                    the husband shall have obtained a sentence of divorce in the spiritual courts,
                    and a verdict with damages in a court of law against some one who has had
                    criminal intercourse with the wife. But this is not a standing order of the
                    House of Lords; it is merely adopted as a rule of caution, and, in particular
                    circumstances, it may therefore be dispensed with.</p><p>In connection with this subject a most important question has arisen, and can
                    scarcely be said to be yet determined, namely, whether an English marriage can
                    be dissolved by a Scottish court, when the parties have come within its
                    jurisdiction. This question has been decided in the negative by the English, and
                    in the affirmative by the Scottish judges. The ground taken by the English
                    courts was, that an English marriage was by its nature indissoluble, and that as
                    the <hi rend="italic">lex loci contractus</hi> regulates other contracts, so it
                    ought to regulate this. But in the Scottish courts it was contended, with much
                    apparent force, that, in such a question as this, the <hi rend="italic">lex
                    loci</hi> must prevail over the <hi rend="italic">lex loci contractus,</hi> and
                    that the principle of <hi rend="italic">comitas</hi> between the two countries,
                    as well as public policy, requires that this doctrine should be recognised and
                    admitted. The question, however, being one of great difficulty and nicety, we
                    abstain from giving any opinion in this place concerning it.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
