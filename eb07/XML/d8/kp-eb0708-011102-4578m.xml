                <p><label type="entry">DONEGAL</label>, the most north-western county in the
                    province of Ulster, in Ireland, is bounded on the north and west by the Atlantic
                    Ocean, on the east by the counties of Londonderry and Tyrone, and on the south
                    by those of Fermanagh and Leitrim, and by the ocean. It contains 1,165,107
                    acres, or 1820 square miles, of which not more than 520,736 acres are arable,
                    the remainder, amounting to 644,371 acres, being mountain and bog. In shape it
                    somewhat resembles a rhomboidal quadrangle, indented on its maritime sides by
                    numerous deep bays and inlets; its longer diameter, measured in a north-eastern
                    direction from Tellen Head to Malin Head, being eighty-five miles; its shorter,
                    extending in a south-eastern line, from Bloody Farland Point to the town of
                    Lifford, forty-two miles.</p>
                <p>According to Ptolemy, the Erdini and Venicnii were its ancient inhabitants.
                    During the earlier period of its history, subsequently to the time of Henry IL,
                    it was more generally known by the name of Tyrconnell, and comprised the country
                    of the O’Doherties, and that of two branches of the M‘Swineys, besides whom the
                    O’Gallaghers, O’Clerys, O’Donells, O’Boyles, and M <hi rend="superscript">
                    t’</hi> Canmeys, were leading families or septs. It is now divided into the six
                    baronies of Bannagh, Boylagh, Innishowen, Kilmacrenan, Raphoe, and Tyrhugh,
                    which are subdivided into fifty-nine parishes, besides four parts of parishes,
                    the remainders of which extend into the adjoining counties. In the commencement
                    of the reign of James I. the number of parishes was eighty-nine.</p>
                <p>The county comprises the whole of the episcopal see of Raphoe, and a small part
                    of that of Derry. The cathedral, which is built in Raphoe, a town otherwise of
                    little notoriety, serves also for the parish church. Four clergymen’s widows are
                    lodged and maintained in the town upon a foundation of a bishop of the name of
                    Foster, who also founded a free school here, and erected a building for a
                    library, the books of which are a bequest from Dr Hall of Trinity College,
                    Dublin. The diocese contains thirty-seven parishes, in which there are
                    thirty-three churches. The total of the glebc land throughout the diocese is
                    estimated at 11,370 acres of ground of every quality, giving an average of 307
                    acres to each parish. The bishop’s income, according to a return made to
                    parliament in 1831, is L.5379. 14s. ld. The barony of Innishowen, and the
                    adjoining district, in the vicinity of the city of Londonderry, arc in Derry
                    diocese.</p>
                <p>The face of the country in the south and east is comparatively level; all the
                    western and northern regions are mountainous, interspersed, however, with
                    valleys and occasional expanses of good land. The most fertile and improved part
                    is the barony of Raphoc, containing the towns of Raphoe, Lifford, and
                    Stranorlar, and embracing a tract about twenty miles long by twelve broad. The
                    soil is good for potatoes, oats, barley, and flax; but wheat, though it thrives
                    in some parts, particularly along the course of the Finn river, is not much
                    cultivated. The southern extremity of the county, in which the town of
                    Ballyshannon stands, can also boast of some rich soil. The mountainous district,
                    which spreads over more than one half of the county, after sloping from Belleek,
                    on the borders of Fermanagh, in the south, to Barnesmore Hills northwards, turns
                    westwards along the sea coast, by Killibegs, to the great promontory of Tellen
                    Head; thence it spreads northwards over the waste expanse of the Rosses, and
                    round by the north coast to Lough Swilly, and by Londonderry through Innishowen
                    barony to Malin Head and Greencastle, where it is interrupted by Lough Foyle,
                    but shows itself again in the northern parts of the counties of Londonderry and
                    Antrim. The highest of these mountains is that of Arragh, which rises 2220 feet
                    above the level of the sea, and is remarkable, not only for its superior
                    elevation, but for one of the whin-dikes that are to be met with in Ireland only
                    near the northern coasts; the dike rising forty feet perpendicularly, like a
                    partition wall. Muckish Mountain, in Kilmacrenan barony, and Slieve Snaght, in
                    Innishowen, are also of considerable height.</p>
                <p>The soil is in general light, with a gravelly subsoil; though in some parts, as
                    in the neighbourhood of Ballyshannon and Donegal, in the south, it is deep and
                    rich, chiefly resting on a bed of limestone. The mountainous districts, though
                    presenting little to excite the speculations of the agriculturist, possess much
                    to attract the attention of the admirer of nature and the investigations of the
                    scientific inquirer. The rugged precipitous declivities, intersected by winding
                    bays and lakes imbedded in the valleys, exhibit an ever-changing variety of
                    picturesque and magnificent scenery. The geological aspect of these regions
                    affords indications of internal wealth which give fimple grounds for regret that
                    they have been so seldom made the subject of scientific research. The minerals
                    as yet discovered are lead and iron. Mines of the latter of these metals were
                    formerly wrought in the parish of Temple-carne, until relinquished in
                    consequence of the failure of timber for fuel. Manganese, yellow pyrites, and
                    clay for potteries and brick-making, are also found. Siliceous sand, raised in
                    Muckish Mountain, was conveyed in large quantities to Belfast for the
                    manufacture of glass. Indications of coal have been observed near Lough Swilly,
                    and at Inver on the southern coast.</p>
                <p>The rivers, with the exception of the Foyle, which forms the boundary between
                    this county and Tyrone and Londonderry, though numerous, are of very inferior
                    size. The branches of the Foyle which rise in Donegal are the Derg, the Finn,
                    and the Swilly, all of which originate in the central part of the county. The
                    river itself, augmented by their contributions, and by those of several other
                    branches from Tyrone and Londonderry, proceeds in a northern direction, and
                    discharges itself into the southern extremity of Lough Foyle, at the city of
                    Londonderry. It is navigable for vessels of large burden to this place, where
                    their farther progress is prevented by a bridge; and thence by lighters of fifty
                    tons as far as Lifford. Boats of fourteen tons can proceed up the Finn River as
                    far as Castlefinn. The Erne flows from Lough Erne through the southern extremity
                    of the countyjnto Ballyshannon Bay. Its navigation is prevented by a fall of
                    twelve feet in the neighbourhood of Ballyshannon, and by another of thirty feet
                    at Belleek, on the confines of Fermanagh. The Guibarra, the Awen Ea, and the
                    Eask, arc the only other rivers of any note.</p>
                <p>Lakes are numerous but small. Lough Derg, situate in Tyrhugh barony, between the
                    counties of Tyrone and Fermanagh, is the most celebrated, yet not so much on
                    account of its size, which is insignificant, or its scenic beauties, of which it
                    possesses little, as from an island in it, named St Patrick’s Purgatory, which
                    is one of the most <pb break="no" facs="nls:193324591"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-4591-0112"/>celebrated places of resort for pilgrims and
                    devotees in Ireland. The extent of the island is less than an acre. The cave
                    styled the Purgatory is formed of freestone; it is sixteen feet in length, two
                    and a quarter in breadth, and so low that a man cannot stand upright in it.
                    Several attempts made by the Roman Catholic hierarchy and by the government to
                    prevent the performance of the ceremonies annually practised here have failed;
                    it still continues to be a favourite place of worship. Loughs Eask, Ea, Gar-tan,
                    Fearn, Finn, and Veagh, are worthy of note only as being the sources of some of
                    the rivers which irrigate the country.</p>
                <p>The bays and smaller inlets of the sea are numerous. Ballyshannon harbour, the
                    most southern of them, is small, and has a bar at its mouth, as has Donegal and
                    Inver harbours farther west. Killibegs harbour is well sheltered, and capable of
                    receiving large vessels. On the western coast are Bruckles or M‘Swiney’s Bay,
                    and Tellen harbour, suitable for small vessels; and on the north is Sheep Haven,
                    within which is Dunfanaghy Bay, where the largest ships may lie in safety, as
                    they may also in Mulroy Bay, farther east. Still farther eastwards is Lough
                    Swilly, a capacious basin, plunging deep into the land, of easy access, and fit
                    for vessels of any burden. Lough Foyle, the boundary between Donegal and
                    Londonderry, may be more properly considered to belong to the latter county.</p>
                <p>The islands of Arran constitute a small archipelago on the western coast, near
                    the district called the Rosses. The herring fishery was carried on here with
                    great spirit about fifty years ago, but is now nearly extinct, in consequence of
                    the fish deserting the coast. A town called Rutland was built on 1nnismacdurn,
                    one of these islands, for cdring and exporting the fish. Tory Island lies off
                    the northern coast, about eight miles from shore. The inhabitants have little
                    intercourse with the rest of the county; they maintain themselves chiefly by
                    fishing and making kelp. An engagement between an English and French squadron
                    took place near this island in 1798. On Ennistrahul Island, off Malin Head,
                    there is a lighthouse. Inch Island, in the southern extremity of Lough Swilly,
                    is of considerable size.</p>
                <p>The following table affords a correct view of the names, extent, and population
                    of the islands along the coast of Donegal, as far as their points have been
                    ascertained, commencing with the most southern.</p>

                    religious persuasion had not been stated. The total number of schools was 399;
                    of these, 258, containing 7764 pupils, were wholly <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193324604" xml:id="kp-eb0708-4604-0113"/>maintained by the fees of the
                    pupils; eighty-eight schools, containing 4738 pupils, were supported by the
                    voluntary contributions of societies or individuals; and but fifty-three
                    schools, containing 3007 pupils, received grants of public money through the
                    agency of a public board. A grammar school was founded in the town of Raphoe by
                    James I., and endowed with a large grant of lands, which it still continues to
                    enjoy under the regulations of commissioners appointed by the crown. Major
                    Robinson, the son of a clergyman in Donegal town, bequeathed a large property
                    for the maintenance of a school in every parish in the diocese of Raphoe, from
                    which every teacher was to receive an annual salary of L.15.</p>
                <p>The manners and habits of the people differ much, according to the local
                    circumstances of the district they inhabit. The lowland and fertile districts
                    are chiefly peopled by an industrious and comfortable yeomanry, composed of
                    small farmers and artizans whose modes of life differ little from those in
                    similar circumstances in the adjoining counties. In the mountainous and less
                    cultivated tracts the want of a free intercourse, and the consequent tardy
                    spread of manufacturing and agricultural improvement, have occasioned a
                    corresponding tardiness in refinement of manners. Yet, so far as the state of
                    crime may lead to a conclusion on this point, the population, though backward in
                    the knowledge of the useful arts, are stained with few of the vices which
                    indicate a demoralized state of society. Out of the total number of committals
                    in 1830, amounting to 781, there were but 406 convictions; but three of these
                    were capital, for horse stealing, and were commuted to transportation for life,
                    and four were for transportation for seven years. Of the remainder, ninety were
                    for illicit distillation, and thirty-seven for riotous assemblages, arising in
                    many cases from the previously named offence. The nature of the country
                    peculiarly favours the operations of the unlicensed distiller; but late
                    statutes, mitigating the demoralizing severity of the revenue code, have already
                    in some degree checked the practice. The houses, particularly in the mountainous
                    parts, are poor. Little attention is paid to cleanliness. The pigs and other
                    cattle, if any, are housed in them along with the family. The fuel is everywhere
                    turf; the food potatoes and oaten bread, with milk and butter occasionally, and
                    fish if near the sea. The men arc clothed in home-made frieze, the women chiefly
                    in cheap cottons. The Irish language still maintains its ground in the retired
                    parts, though its use is every year diminishing. Adepts in the language consider
                    the dialect spoken in this county as the purest known.</p>
                <p>The modes of agriculture present little peculiar to the county. The spadc still
                    supplies the place of the plough in those parts where the rocky nature of the
                    soil prevents the profitable application of the latter implement. In the
                    southern parts a narrow spade with a long handle, and a resting place for the
                    foot only on one side, is in common use. It is called a loy, and is peculiarly
                    adapted to stiff clayey soils. Potatoes are planted with an implement called a
                    steveen or kibbin, formed of a stake about four feet long, shod with iron, and
                    having near the point a cross rest for the foot to act on when forcing it into
                    the ridge; and the seed is dropt into the hole thus made. The cattle which are
                    grazed on the coarse mountain pastures are subject to a kind of rheumatic
                    affection called the cruppan. The animal becomes crippled, and, in the more
                    aggravated stages of the disorder, is totally deprived of the usc of its limbs;
                    the hair on the back starts up, and atrophy succeeds, which terminates in death.
                    The means of cure found most successful is the removal of the diseased animal to
                    soil of another quality. If, however, it should remain for a year on the soil
                    which cures this disorder, it is liable to be attacked by another, called the
                    galar, which causes a discharge of blood, followed by death unless prevented by
                    a transfer to the pastures which had produced the former complaint. Horses are
                    not subject to this latter malady. Feeding on cabbage and sea-rack has been
                    suggested as a means for preventing the ravages of the cruppan. On the shores of
                    Innisfree, one of the islands of North Arran, a species of grass, called by the
                    inhabitants sweet-grass, springs up twelve feet under tide-mark of spring tides.
                    It grows to the length of two or three yards, and is about the breadth of a
                    compressed wheaten straw. At the lowest ebb of the spring tide the cattle run
                    instinctively from the mountains to feed on this herb, as the greatest luxury,
                    and persevere in so doing regularly at the particular period when the recess of
                    the water leaves the plant exposed. In the mountain farms the fences are very
                    bad, being formed of low turf ditches. In many cases the use of fences is
                    disregarded, as a person is either sent to herd the cattle, or they are confined
                    by tethers, <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> The care generally taken to house
                    cattle, in order to prevent the attacks of the cruppan, and to collect manure,
                    rénders the want of fences less injurious.</p>
                <p>The manures in the neighbourhood of the sea are chiefly sea-weed, shelly sand,
                    and house dung. Although the tract from Ballyshannon to Killibegs abounds with
                    limestone and marl, the use of these as manures is not so great as their value,
                    and the facilities of procuring them, would lead those unacquainted with the
                    habits of the people to expect. Irrigation is general, and much encouraged by
                    the landlords. Farming societies have been formed, and premiums offered, in
                    order to excite a spirit of emulation in introducing improved modes of
                    agriculture.</p>
                <p>The herring fishery was carried on about fifty years ago to a great extent, and
                    with considerable success, in the district of the Rosses, on the western coast.
                    In the years 1784k85 the winter fishing produced L.40,000, and supplied cargoes
                    for 300 vessels each year. Such was the success, that a fishing town, named
                    Rutland, with suitable stores and curing houses, was built on the island of
                    Innismacdurn; but the fishery shortly after declined, and has never regained its
                    former character. The decay has been attributed to the summer fishing of what
                    are called sprats, but thought to be the young herrings, which are thus carried
                    off in myriads in a less profitable shape, and the full-grown fish deterred from
                    the coast. Still, however, the fishery is carried on, though on a very reduced
                    and fluctuating scale. The white fishery has latterly been more profitable. The
                    following table will show the progress of both kinds, and the state of the
                    fishing vessels during the period that the fisheries of Ireland were under the
                    superintendence of a board empowered to make grants and loans of public money
                    for their improvement.</p>

                <p>The fishery board also granted money in aid of building fishing piers at Green
                    Castle in Lough Foyle, and Doagh-beg in Lough Swilly. In the project for the
                    plantation of Ulster, drawn up in the early part of the reign of James I.,
                    twenty-five places in this county are named as being approved stations for the
                    salmon, herring, and ling fishery. The principal salmon fishery at present is at
                    Ballyshannon. Whale and sun-fish have been taken near the coast.</p>
                <p>Manufactures never extend much beyond what the immediate demand of the population
                    calls for. They are chiefly confined to linens and coarse woollens called
                    friezes, of which latter a light blue is the favourite colour.</p>
                <p>Numerous ruins of ancient castles along the coast prove that much attention was
                    formerly paid to the defence of the country from invasion, or, what was more to
                    be dreaded, piratical depredations. The principal are, Kilbarron Castle, near
                    Ballyshannon; Donegal Castle, built by O’Donell; Burt and Inch Castles, both
                    built in Lough Swilly, by Sir Cahir O’Dogherty, to whom is also attributed the
                    erection of Green Castle on Lough Foyle. Near the Castle of Doe, or M‘Swiney’s
                    Castle, at Horn Head, is a natural perforation in the roof of a cave, wrought by
                    the workings of the ocean into the overhanging cliff. It is called M‘Swiney’s
                    Gun. When the wind blows due north, and the tide is at half flood, the gun is
                    seen to spout up jets of sea water to a great height, attended with explosions
                    which are said to be heard in favourable weather at more than twenty miles
                    distance. Culmore Fort, on the coast of Lough Swilly, is still maintained as a
                    military station, at least so far as to afford a respectable income to some
                    military person who performs the nominal duties of governor there.</p>
                <p>Traces of religious houses, some however existing only in traditionary or
                    documental records, are also numerous. Ashroe Abbey, on the Erne river, near
                    Ballyshannon, was of great extent. The ruins of that of Donegal also afford
                    proofs of its ancient grandeur. But its memory will be held in greater
                    veneration by the lovers of antiquity for another reason. In it was written the
                    celebrated collection of ancient Irish annals, still known by the name of the
                    Annals of the Four Masters, compiled in the year 1632, by Michael O'Clery and
                    his learned coadjutors, fellow brothers in that house, by the instigation and at
                    the expense of Fergal O’Gara, lord of Moy O'Gara and Cool-avin, in the county of
                    Sligo. The original of this curious and highly valuable manuscript is now lodged
                    in the library of the Royal Irish Academy.</p>
                <p>The towns in this county are few and insignificant. Lifford, the county town, is
                    situated near its south-eastern extremity, on the river Foyle, and communicates
                    by a bridge with Strabane, on the eastern bank of the same river, insomuch that
                    it might almost be considered rather as a suburb of this more populous town,
                    than as the metropolis of a county. Its population in 1821 amounted only to 976
                    souls. It can boast of no public buildings but those which owe their existence
                    to the rank for which its position is so ill adapted, as attendance at the
                    assizes here must be extremely inconvenient to residents in most of the other
                    towns, which are chiefly near the sea-coast, at the other extremities. The
                    buildings are a court-house, a prison, and an infirmary.</p>
                <p>The reason given for fixing on a situation for the county town so inconvenient to
                    the resident inhabitants, was, that the judges and barristers were saved the
                    trouble cf travelling far into a county in which the roads at that time were few
                    and ill constructed, and the accommodation in the inns very inferior. The other
                    towns of any consequence, with their population in 1821, are as follows:</p>

                <p>Ballyshannon, situate at the embouchure of the Erne, which is here crossed by a
                    bridge of nine arches, is worthy of notice for its trade, the chief articles of
                    which are corn and salmon; for the remains of antiquity in its immediate
                    vicinity; and for the picturesque scenery with which it is surrounded, and which
                    is much heightened by the salmon leap across the river.</p>
