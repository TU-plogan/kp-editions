                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    of which it is the capital. It is situated between the rivers Nalon and Nora, on
                    a hill of granite, and enjoys a serene atmosphere, although generally rather
                    rainy. Its fields are fertile, and yield abundance of fruits and horticultural
                    vegetables; and near it there are good meadows, where cattle are depastured, and
                    hay made for the winter consumption of stock. The city contains a population of
                    6000 inhabitants, amongst whom there are some of the most distinguished families
                    of the province, who unfortunately prefer a residence in cities to living on
                    their own estates. It is not a place of trade, but rather the resort of lawyers
                    and clergy. It has a very magnificent cathedral in the Gothic style, with a
                    remarkable lofty tower, an university, a well-endowed hospital, and a beautiful
                    public walk. It is supplied with water by a fine aqueduct, which conveys it from
                    two fountains in the neighbouring hills. Long. 5. 56. 22. W. Lat. 43. 21. 55.

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Oviedo,</hi><hi rend="italic">John Gonsales,</hi> in
                    Spanish, Gonçalo Herman-dez de Oviedo y Valdez, a celebrated historian, was born
                    at Madrid about the year 1478, and educated amongst the pages of Ferdinand and
                    Isabella. Oviedo had attained the age of fifteen when Christopher Columbus
                    returned from his first voyage; and being seized with a strong desire to learn
                    the details relating to the great discovery of the illustrious<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194565720" xml:id="kp-eb0716-5720-0681"/> navigator, he soon made
                    himself acquainted with all that had passed in this wonderful expedition. Having
                    embraced the profession of arms, he distinguished himself in the war of Naples,
                    where he rendered important service to Spain; and it was in recompense of his
                    talents and bravery that Ferdinand appointed him director of the gold and silver
                    mines in the island of Haïti, which Columbus named first <hi rend="italic"
                    >Espanola·,</hi> and then <hi rend="italic">San-Domingo.</hi> Oviedo proceeded
                    to his destination in 1513; and employed in working the mines, which were poor
                    compared with those afterwards discovered in the continent of America, the
                    natives of the island, a good and gentle race, naturally indolent, and by no
                    means robust, with constitutions already enfeebled by the ravages of syphilis, a
                    disease previously unknown in the old world. This unfortunate people, who had
                    received the companions of Columbus with so much cordiality, Oviedo treated
                    worse than beasts of burden; compelling them to labour without intermission, and
                    exercising the greatest cruelties to enforce submission to his commands on the
                    part of a race which had previously lived in idleness, subsisting on the
                    abundant natural productions of the climate, and on fish, which they caught
                    without difficulty, as an amusement rather than an occupation. The abominable
                    tyranny to which the natives were thus subjected soon caused a considerable
                    diminution of their number; and Oviedo, in order to justify himself for the
                    oppression and cruelty which he exercised, had the bad faith to allege, in his
                    writings, that the Haitians were dissolute, unprincipled, and in every respect
                    deserving of extermination. Nor was this all. Not content with calumniating the
                    people he had so cruelly treated, he added the ridiculous falsehood, that
                    amongst them syphilis was the result of debauchery; whereas, according to the
                    testimony of all impartial historians, it had been ascertained by Columbus that
                    the Haitian people were comparatively indifferent to sexual pleasure, a
                    circumstance by no means common in a burning climate, and which can only be
                    explained by the weak physical organization of these islanders, or by a
                    deficiency of vital power. A residence of nearly twelve years in Haïti enabled
                    Oviedo to study the natural history <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the island in all
                    its parts, to observe syphilis in all its types, and to ascertain the remedies
                    which the natives employed in their treatment of the disease. The principal of
                    these was the gaiae, which is still classed amongst die number of the
                    antisyphilitics. On his return to Spain in 1525, Oviedo published a journal of
                    his researches under the title of <hi rend="italic">Summario</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de la</hi><hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    dedicated to Charles V. At a later period, however, the author recast this
                    production, to which he added numerous facts connected with the natural history
                    of Haiti, and, in 1535, he published the first twenty books of his great work
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">La</hi><hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">General</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">Natural de
                    las Indias</hi><hi rend="italic">Occidentales;</hi> but the entire work, which
                    is divided into fifty books, did not appear till 1783, when it came out under
                    the auspices of the Marquis of Truxillo. Oviedo affirms, in his narrative, that
                    the syphilis is an endemic malady in the island of Haïti, and that having been
                    contracted there by the Spaniards belonging to the expedition of Columbus, it
                    was by them communicated to the Neapolitans belonging to the expedition of
                    Gonealvo de Cordova; and, in point of fact, the syphilis appeared at Naples
                    immediately after the return of the squadron of Gonçalvo. Several writers, who
                    pretend that syphilis existed in Europe anterior to the discovery of the new
                    world, have attempted to prove this hy-ιothetical assertion from the writings of
                    Oviedo himself; ĭut these, so far from countenancing any sueb notion,
                    con-ainineontestible proof of the error into which those persons ιave fallen who
                    ascribe the origin of this fearful scourge to he old continent. Some authors
                    assure us that Oviedo, having been infected by syphilis during his sojourn at
                    Naples about the year 1513, came to the conclusion that if had been imported
                    from Haïti; and conceiving that there must exist in that island a remedy for the
                    disease, solicited the employment which led him thither, and in fact discovered
                    that the wood of gaiac was the infallible antidote employed by the natives, and
                    by which also he effected his own cure. It is added that, on his return to
                    Spain, Oviedo commenced physician for syphilitic maladies, in the treatment of
                    which he made use of the wood of gaïac, with a success which considerably
                    augmented the fortune he had acquired in working the mines of Haiti, at the
                    expense of the lives of a great number of the natives. <hi rend="smallcaps"
