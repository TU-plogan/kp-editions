                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    >Proselyte,</hi> a famous rabbi of the first century, and author of the Chaldaic
                    Targum on the Pentateuch. He flourished in the time of Jesus Christ, according
                    to the Jewish writers, who all agree that he was, at least in some part of his
                    life, contemporary with Jonathan Ben Uzziel, author of the second Targum upon
                    the prophets. Prideaux thinks that he was the elder of the two, for several
                    reasons, the chief of which is the purity of the style of his Targum, in which
                    it comes nearest to that part of Daniel and Ezra which is in the Chaldaic, and
                    being the truest standard of that language, is consequently the most ancient,
                    since that language, as well as others, was in a constant fluctuation, and in
                    every age continued deviating from the original. Nor does there appear to be any
                    reason why Jonathan Ben Uzziel, when he undertook his Targum, should pass over
                    the law, and begin with the prophets, except it be that he found Onkelos had
                    done this work before him, and with a success which he could not exceed.</p>
                <p>Azarias, the author of a book entitled <hi rend="italic">Meor Enairn,</hi> or the
                    “light of the eyes,” tells us, that Onkelos was a proselyte in the time of
                    Hillel and Samnai, and lived to see Jonathan Ben Uzziel, one of the prime
                    scholars of Hille). These three doctors flourished twelve years before Christ,
                    according to the chronology of Gauz, who adds, that 0n- kelos was contemporary
                    with Gamaliel the elder, St Paul’s master, who was the grandson of Hillel.
                    However, he same Gauz, by his calculation, places Onkelos a hundred years after
                    Christ, and, in order to adjust his opinion with that of Azarias, extends the
                    life of Onkelos to a great length. The Talmudists tell us that he assisted at
                    the funeral of Gamaliel, and was at a prodigious expense to render it
                    magnificent. Prideaux observes, that the Targum of Onkelos is rather a version
                    than a paraphrase, since it renders the Hebrew text word for word, and for the
                    most part accurately <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> and exactly, and is by far
                    the best of the kind; wherefore it has always been held amongst <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194561298" xml:id="kp-eb0716-1298-0341"/>the Jews in much greater
                    esteem than the other Targums; and being set to the same musical notes with the
                    Hebrew text, is thereby capable of being read in the same tone with it in their
                    public assemblies. From the excellency and accuracy of the Targum of Onkelos,
                    Prideaux also concludes that he must have been a native Jew, since, without
                    having been bred up from his birth in the Jewish religion and learning, long
                    exercised in all the rites and doctrines of both, and being also thoroughly
                    skilled in both the Hebrew and Chaldaic languages, as far as a native Jew could
                    be, he could scarcely have been thoroughly adequate to the work which he
                    executed. The same author also thinks, that the representing him as a proselyte
                    may have proceeded from the error of supposing him to have been the same with
                    Akilas or Aquila of Pontus, author of the Greek Targum or version of the
                    prophets and Hagiographia, and who was indeed a Jewish proselyte.</p>
