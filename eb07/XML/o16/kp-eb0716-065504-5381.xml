                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">OSNABRUCK, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Osnaburg</hi></label>, a
                    province of the kingdom of Hanover. It has been formed out of the ancient
                    sequestered bishopric of that name, which by the treaty of Westphalia had been
                    fixed to be held in sovereignty alternately by a Catholic and a Protestant
                    prince; and in consequence it came under the government of the late Duke of
                    York, second son of George III. To the bishopric has been added by cession the
                    Prussian bailiwick of Beckenburg, the lower county of Lingen, and the circles of
                    Meppen and Emsbuhren. It is bounded on the north by East Friesland, on the
                    north-east by Oldenburg and Diepholz, on the south-east and south-west by the
                    Prussian province <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Westphalia, and on the west by
                    Bentheim. It extends over 1288 square miles, contains twenty towns and cities,
                    382 villages, with 249,470 inhabitants, of whom two thirds are Catholics, and
                    the other third Protestants, chiefly of the Lutheran confession. It is generally
                    a level and sandy district, excepting on the southern part, where there are two
                    ranges of hills. Near these the soil is tolerably fertile; but on the other
                    parts, except near the rivers, it is very poor and unproductive. The heaths are
                    extensive, and a large portion of the province is covered with woods. The corn
                    produced, even with the aid of extensive cultivation of potatoes, is not
                    sufficient for the consumption. Flax is grown largely, and the spinning of it
                    was the chief employment of the country people of both sexes during their long
                    winters; but that occupation has been much diminished by the introduction of
                    spinning by machinery in the countries which used to obtain their yarn from this
                    province. Numerous bodies of the agricultural labourers repair to Holland to
                    work, and some after harvest return home to live upon their earnings; but many
                    of them remain to perform the lowest kinds of labour in Amsterdam, Rotterdam,
                    and other cities, and many also enlist into the Dutch army. The province is
                    formed into four divisions or circles, viz. Osnabruck, Lingen, Meppen, and
                    Emsbuhren.</p>
                <p>Osnabruck as it is called by the Germans, or Osnaburg as it is spelt by us, is
                    the capital of the province. It is situated on the river Hase, is imperfectly
                    fortified, and consists chiefly of one very long and not ill-built street,
                    divided into the old and the new town. It is the see of a Catholic bishop, who
                    has a palace and a cathedral; and there is a fine old council-house, in which
                    the treaty of Westphalia was negotiated. It has two Catholic monasteries, a
                    Lutheran gymnasium, two Lutheran churches, and one, besides the cathedral, for
                    the Catholics. It contains about 1400 houses, and 10,500 inhabitants, who depend
                    chiefly on the decaying linen trade, and on internal commerce. Long. 7. 33. 40.
