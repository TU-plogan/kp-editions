                    and 84. 42. longitude west from Greenwich. On the north it is bounded by
                    Michigan and Lake Erie; on the east by Pennsylvania and the river Ohio; on the
                    south by the Ohio River, which separates it from Virginia and Kentucky; and on
                    the west by Indiana. Ohio may extend about 220 miles from north to south, and as
                    much from east to west; but as Lake Erie projects considerably into the northern
                    borders, and the Ohio cuts off much of its southern quarter, the area of the
                    state cannot be computed at more than 200 miles square. Ohio occupies about one
                    third of the plane which declines from Pennsylvania to the Mississippi, and may
                    be considered generally as a surface of table-land, sloping in one direction
                    towards the Ohio, and in the other towards Lake Erie. The state is divided by
                    nature into four grand divisions, which are named after the principal waters on
                    which they are situated. These are the Miami country, the Scioto country, the
                    Muskingum country, and the Lake country. The interior and northern parts of Ohio
                    are generally level, but the northern belt has large tracts of wet and marshy
                    soil. They are however placed in such positions as render them easily drained;
                    and when they are cleared of the forests which cover them, they will form not
                    the least valuable parts of the state. In its primitive condition, Ohio was,
                    with the exception of some central prairies, overspread with a dense forest, to
                    which the great fertility of the soil gave a stupendous development; indeed the
                    size, majesty, and variety of the trees of the Ohio basin has been a theme of
                    just admiration. There are still extensive tracts of land heavily timbered, and
                    which are as level as prairies. The forest-trees are the same as those of
                    Kentucky and Indiana, excepting that the peccan tree, which is common on the
                    waters of the Wabash, is seldom found here. The forests are deep, and some of
                    them are in the richest soils, where, however, the trees are less remarkable for
                    their size than for their straightness. On the head waters of the two Miamis,
                    the Muskingum, and the Scioto, there are rich and extensive prairies, some of
                    which are low and marshy, and others are elevated and dry, the latter being by
                    no means so fertile as the former. Immediately on the borders of the Ohio, there
                    are numerous tracts of intervale or meadow-land of exuberant fertility. In the
                    interior parts, bordering on both sides of the Scioto, and on the two Miamis,
                    are the most extensive tracts of rich and level land. About one quarter of the
                    eastern and south-eastern divisions of Ohio is hilly, in some places too broken,
                    and precipitous to admit of cultivation; but in no parts are the hills very
                    large or high, and nine tenths of the surface of the state are susceptible of
                    cultivation, “On its whole wide surface,” says Mr Flint, “there is scarcely any
                    land so hilly, sterile, or marshy, as, with moderate labour, may not be subdued,
                    drained, or cultivated. The whole region seems to have invited a hardy and
                    numerous body of freeholders to select themselves moderate and nearly
                    equal-sized farms, and to intersperse them over its surface. In respect to the
                    smallness of the farms, the number, equality, and compactness of the population,
                    not confined, as farther west, to the water-courses, but diffused over the whole
                    state, it compares very accurately with New England.”</p>
                <p>The principal river of Ohio is the noble and beautiful stream to which it owes
                    its name; but this will demand a separate notice. T he next largest and most
                    interesting river in this state is the Great Miami, which rises between 40 and
                    41 degrees of north latitude, and interlocks with the Massissineway of the
                    Wabash, and the St Mary’s and Au Glaize, branches of the 2∙1aumee and Scioto. It
                    has a south-westerly course of above fifty miles, flowing in a strong but
                    generally smooth and unbroken current, through a valley of uncommon width and
                    fertility, receiving several tributaries in its course. The Little Miami rises
                    in the southwest corner of Madison county, and, after traversing several
                    counties, joins the Ohio seven miles above Cincinnati. It is of little
                    importance as a navigable stream; but it is valuable in a manufacturing point of
                    view, there being upwards of sixty mills upon it. It has a number of branches;
                    and about one hundred miles from its mouth it forms singular rapids, the stream
                    being compressed to ten yards in width, and falling two hundred feet within no
                    great distance. The country between the Great and Little Miami is in general
                    finely watered, healthy, pleasant, and fertile, and may be characterised as the
                    garden of the state. The Scioto is a considerable river of Ohio, and has the
                    whole of its course in the state, being little short of two hundred miles, one
                    hundred and thirty of which are navigable. It rises in a morass north of Logan
                    county, in the southern division of the state, and has generally a
                    south-easterly course. The banks of the Scioto now rank amongst the most
                    fertile, eligible, and pleasant parts of the state. Between this river and the
                    Muskingum is situated the great Hockhocking and its waters. It has a deep and
                    still but narrow channel, and is navigable for boats forty miles above its
                    mouth, having also a number of mills erected on it. The Muskingum rises near the
                    sources of the Cuyahoga of Lake Erie, in the southern part of Connecticut
                    Reserve. Its course is remarkably sinuous, but its general direction is to the
                    southward. It has a long course, traversing a number of counties, is boatable in
                    good stages of the water one hundred miles by the course of the river, and
                    enters the Ohio at Marietta by a mouth two hundred and fifty yards wide. The
                    Mahoning is also a large stream, which, with those already described, may be
                    considered as belonging to the southern division of the state. In the north
                    there is the Maumee, which rises in the north-eastern angle of the state of
                    Indiana, and flows in a north-eastern direction, across the north-western
                    borders of the state of Ohio, into the western extremity of Lake Erie. This
                    important river has a course of one hundred miles, and is a broad, deep,
                    navigable stream. It has a valuable fishery, and its banks in the season of
                    vegetation are remarkable for the luxuriance of their verdure. The St Joseph,
                    the St Mary’s, and the Great and Little Au Glaize, are considerable tributary
                    streams of the Maumee. The Sandusky rises in the western limits of Richland
                    county, and runs in a general northwest direction ninety miles to the lake. It
                    is more rapid than the other lake streams, but yet affords good navigation.
                    Cuyahoga rises in the central parts of Geauga county, and falls into the lake at
                    Cleveland, after a course of sixty miles, for the greater part of which distance
                    it is boatable. Chagrin, Grand, Ashtabula, and Concaught, are considerable
                    streams, which rise near the lake, run in a northerly direction, and discharge
                    their waters into it.</p>
                <p>Ohio possesses an extensive and rich coal region in its eastern and north-eastern
                    divisions, on the Muskingum, the Hockhocking, and the Scioto. The mineral is not
                    only in great abundance, but of the best quality; and in the same region vast
                    quantities of iron ore are found. Limestone, marble, and freestone abound; they
                    are easily accessible, and are admirably adapted to building and public works.
                    The useful earths and fossils are also in abundance. Specimens of gypsum are
                    procured from Sandusky Bay. Salt springs are common, and some of them contain as
                    much saline matter as the waters of the ocean. Nearly half a million bushels of
                    salt are annually manufactured in the state. Those springs the waters of which
                    are drank for medicinal purposes are most of them more or less impregnated with
                    muriate of soda. The Yellow Springs, the most celebrated watering-place after
                    Harrodsburgh Springs in the western country, are situated near the falls of the
                    Miami, sixty-three miles from Cincinnati. The antiquities which belong to this
                    state are somewhat similar to those described in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">New York</hi>; mounds of earth, in which have been found
                    domestic utensils, pottery, vases, and trinkets.</p>

                <p>Instruments of warfare have likewise been dug up, amongst which Mr Flint mentions
                    a curious sword and an iron horseshoe of a diminutive size.</p>
                <p>Except along the deep vales of the Ohio, and those of the other streams near
                    their influx into that great recipient, the climate is as uniform as the
                    surface, and considerably more severe in the winter season than in corresponding
                    latitudes on the Atlantic. But the other seasons are warmer, and the nature and
                    luxuriance of the vegetation indicates a temperature of greater mildness in
                    general. The summers are warm, and pretty regular, although to a certain extent
                    subject to tornadoes. The central parts of the state are in the same latitude
                    with Philadelphia. The mean temperature of the year at this city was found to be
                    53°; but during the same year that of Ohio was two degrees higher. As we recede
                    from the Ohio, the temperature diminishes in a greater ratio than the latitude
                    would indicate; but in general throughout the state there is a striking
                    correspondence between the two. Whilst the summers are warm, the winters are
                    very severe, and the river Ohio has occasionally been crossed at Cincinnati for
                    nine consecutive weeks. At other times this season of the year is mild; but
                    during the winter months the transitions from heat to cold and the reverse are
                    frequent and violent. In that part of the state which slopes to the south, the
                    snow seldom falls deep or lies long; but in Connecticut Reserve, and in the
                    points which slope towards the lakes, they have deep and durable snows. Autumn
                    is almost uniformly temperate, dry, and beautiful; and spring is also a pleasant
                    season. The winds of Ohio, whether high or low, generally blow from the west and
                    south-west at all times. In some parts, near marshes and stagnant waters, fevers
                    and agues frequently prevail; but the climate in general is decidedly
                    healthy.</p>
                <p>The soil and the climate of Ohio together are admirably adapted to the most
                    valuable vegetable productions which grow in such a latitude. The soil is very
                    productive, without, however, being so remarkable in this respect as some parts
                    of Illinois and Missouri. After the severity of winter abates, which is early in
                    February, vegetation begins to put forth its powers; and as the heat of spring
                    and summer takes effect upon the soil, it advances with astonishing rapidity.
                    Ohio, generally, has a soil admirably adapted to wheat. Indian corn is the
                    staple grain, and it is nowhere raised more easily, or in greater abundance. On
                    rich alluvial soils 110 bushels have been produced from an acre; but fifty may
                    be considered as about the average crop. Rye, barley, oats, spelts, buckwheat,
                    and all other grains, are raised in great abundance and perfection. Melons,
                    squashes, pumpkins, the pulses, garden vegetables both bulbous and others, as
                    potatoes, onions, beets, carrots, parsnips, asparagus of the best description,
                    and various culinary products of the soil, attain the highest development. From
                    its stiff, clayey nature, the soil retains moisture well, and is better fitted
                    for gardens than the soils farther west. Fruits of all kinds are raised in the
                    greatest profusion; and apples in particular are very plentiful. Pears, plums,
                    peaches, cherries, strawberries, grapes, and what not, are cultivated to such an
                    extent as amply to supply the markets. “In a few years,” says Mr Flint, “this
                    state will take place of any in the Union, in the abundance and excellence of
                    its fruits of all kinds. From the fulness and richness of the clusters of
                    cultivated grapes, it is clear that this ought to be a country of vineyards. The
                    Germans have already made a few establishments of the kind with entire success.
                    Apricos, nectarines, and quinces succeed; and this state is the appropriate
                    empire of Pomona. Recently, tobacco has been added to the articles cultivated.
                    ...Hemp is an article of cultivation in some parts of the state. Agricultural
                    improvement, however, proceeds with slow pace. The people generally are not at
                    all given to experiment, and continue to farm in the old and beaten
                    routine....Besides trees, shrubs, and vines, this state produces a great
                    abundance of indigenous productions that are useful in medicine. We may mention
                    <hi rend="italic">actea</hi><hi rend="italic">racemosa,</hi> squaw root,
                    Virginia snake root, Indian turnip, ginseng, which is dug in considerable
                    quantities as an article of commerce, Colombo, labelia, valerian, blood root or
                    sanguinaria, canadensis, and various other herbaceous medicinal plants.”</p>
                <p>This state, being more populous than any other in the west, and possessing in
                    many respects manufacturing capabilities, has taken precedence of all the rest
                    in manufactures. Cotton yarn, cloth, and woollen goods, are already manufactured
                    to a considerable extent, as are also flour and spirits; and family manufactures
                    are likewise industriously prosecuted. The principal domestic articles of trade
                    are horses, cattle, swine, whisky, flour, and tobacco. Those articles which are
                    exported from the northern and some interior counties are frequently sent to
                    Montreal and New York markets, by way of Lake Erie. From the southern parts of
                    the state they are transported down the Ohio and Mississippi to New Orleans.
                    Foreign goods are received from the same place by the steam-boats, and from
                    Philadelphia and Baltimore across the Alleghany Mountains. “The surplus produce
                    of the state of Ohio,” says Mr Pitkin, in his Statistical View of the Commerce
                    of the United States, “it is believed, may be calculated at about ten millions.
                    The exports of Cincinnati alone, in 1833, were valued at five millions of
                    dollars. This amount does not probably exceed the truth, when it is considered
                    that the number of hogs slaughtered in that city in 1833 was 123,859, which
                    would make as many, and probably more, barrels of pork, and, in the same year,
                    21,880 barrels of pork came to that city by the Miami Canal, making about
                    150,000 barrels in the whole, and which, at nine dollars per barrel, would be
                    1,359,000 dollars; and that in 1834, the number slaughtered was 150,000. And we
                    cannot but here remark, that the whole quantity of pork exported from the United
                    States in 1833 was only 105,870 barrels, leaving in favour of Cincinnati 45,000
                    barrels.” It is of course taken for granted, that of the 150,000 barrels of pork
                    said to be made at this city, all above the 45,000 entered as having been
                    exported was reserved for home consumption. Mr Pitkin continues, “the exports of
                    Cleveland on Lake Erie, in the same year, was 1,794,000 dollars coastwise, and
                    250,000 to foreign places, and from Huron 274,840 dollars; and from the country
                    of Muskingum, on the river of that name, and from the flourishing village of
                    Zanesville, with her numerous flourishing mills, as ascertained by those well
                    acquainted with the facts, was 500,000 dollars. The value of the exports from
                    these places alone make about seven millions and three quarters; and when it is
                    considered that the quantity of tobacco raised in Ohio in 1833 was 10,000
                    hogsheads, only 3000 of which is included in the above exports from Muskingum,
                    and when to these are added the exports from the Sciota valley, and from many
                    other places on the Ohio River, and on the lake, we apprehend that the surplus
                    produce of Ohio cannot be less than ten millions of dollars.”</p>

                <p>Although the first permanent settlement was made in Ohio not more than fifty
                    years ago, and although it was admitted into the Union as a state as recently as
                    1802, yet it has now become one of the most considerable states in the union,
                    has entered largely into the system of internal improvement, and has constructed
                    one of the longest canals in the world. The state canals are under the direction
                    of a board of canal commissioners; and the Ohio and Miami Canals, which,
                    together with their branches, are more than four hundred miles in extent, have
                    been constructed at the expense of the state. For an account of the canals of
                    Ohio, see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Navigation, Inland.</hi></p>
                <p>Railroads have likewise been constructed on the same extensive scale, and numbers
                    of them are in course of being laid. Mad River and Lake Erie Railroad, extending
                    from Dayton to the city of Sandusky, is to be 153 miles in length. The
                    Pennsylvania and Ohio Railroad is designed to commence at Pittsburgh, and
                    terminate at Massillon on the Ohio Canal, the length being 180 miles. There are
                    some others of smaller size; and some idea may be formed of the extent to which
                    these works are carried, from the fact that no less than twenty-eight companies
                    were incorporated in the year 1836. In connection with trade and internal
                    improvement may be mentioned the banks of Ohio. In the year 1835 there were
                    thirty-one banks in this state; and the condition of twenty-nine of these, from
                    which returns were received, was, that they had of specie 1,906,715, and of
                    capital 6,390,741; and that their circulation was 5,654,048. The legal interest
                    in Ohio is six per cent.; but there is no law against usury, so that in some
                    parts it is seldom less, and often more, than ten per cent.</p>
                <p>A laudable zeal has been shown to diffuse education throughout this state. In the
                    year 1825 the New England system of tuition was introduced into Ohio, and by
                    various emendatory enactments it has now acquired a degree of form and
                    consistency. By an act of the state the trustees of every incorporated township
                    are required to divide it into a suitable number of school districts, the
                    prudential concerns of which are managed by three school directors, a clerk, and
                    a treasurer. The funds for maintaining this vast system arise from various
                    sources besides the easy tax of one mill upon a dollar, constituting a large and
                    growing revenue. By this act it is provided that the youth of every class,
                    without distinction, shall be instructed in reading, writing, and arithmetic, as
                    well as in other necessary branches of education. There are no less than nine
                    colleges or universities, viz. the university of Ohio, at Athens, with five
                    instructors, seventy-two alumni, twenty-six ministers, forty-five students, and
                    about a thousand volumes in the college library, and as many in that of the
                    students; the Miami university, at Oxford, with eight instructors, eighty
                    alumni, seventeen ministers, one hundred and twenty-six students, and 1200 and
                    2500 volumes respectively in the college and students’ libraries; the Franklin
                    university, at New Athens; the Western Reserve university, at Hud-^ son; the
                    Kenyon university, at Gambier; the Granville university, at Granville; the
                    Marietta university, at Marietta; the Oberlin institution, at New Illyria; and
                    the Willoughby university, at Chagrin; all of which are smaller than the first
                    two, but have from fifty to one hundred students. There are five theological
                    seminaries, a presbyterian college at Cincinnati, and another at Hudson, a
                    Protestant episcopal college at Gambier, a Lutheran theological school at
                    Columbus, and a Baptist institution of the same kind at Granville. There are two
                    medical schools; one at Cincinnati, having six professors, and another at
                    Northing, with four professors. There is a law college at Cincinnati, which has
                    three professors. Amongst institutions of a public character may be mentioned an
                    asylum for the deaf and dumb, which has been established at Columbus. Literature
                    is making considerable progress in Ohio. In 1810 there were only fourteen
                    newspapers in the state, and in 1834 their number amounted to 140. There are,
                    besides, several other periodicals of a literary and scientific nature.</p>
                <p>Almost every religious denomination is found in this state, but the Presbyterians
                    and Methodists predominate. In 1831, which is the latest complete return that we
                    have obtained, the numbers were, of Presbyterians, 22,150 communicants, having
                    346 churches; of Baptists, 8801 communicants, having 240 churches; of
                    Methodists, 36,064 members; of Lutherans, 8706 communicants; of Associate
                    Presbyterians, sixty-five congregations; of German Reformed, eighty-two
                    congregations. The Episcopalians had also sixteen ministers, and the New
                    Jerusalem church four societies; and there were, besides, a number of Friends
                    and Roman Catholics, and some Universalists, Unitarians, and Shakers. “It is
                    affirmed by a gentleman,” says Mr Flint, “well known for his researches into the
                    antiquities of this state, that there is a greater number of professors of
                    religion, in proportion to the whole number of the people, than in any state in
                    the Union. There are a vast number of religious societies; but there is not a
                    great number that have regularly established pastors. The custom of itinerating
                    preaching, as a supply, is very prevalent. The people are generally a quiet,
                    orderly, peaceable, moral, and industrious race. Suicide, excesses, murders in
                    affray, and instances of deliberate and atrocious cruelty, are rare; and the
                    general moral character of the people is highly respectable.”</p>
                <p>From the census of 1830 we learn that there were at that time in Ohio the remains
                    of Indian tribes, amounting to 2350 persons. They then owned 390,846 acres of
                    land, besides 16,200 acres which were secured to individuals belonging to the
                    several tribes. These lands are secured by treaty to the Wyandotes, Shawnees,
                    Senecas, Delawares, and Otta was; the other remnants of tribes being classed
                    with these. Some of them have sold their shares; but to those which still hold
                    them, considerable annuities are paid by the national government. The number of
                    individuals belonging to these tribes is gradually diminishing, and they must
                    soon entirely disappear in the tide of white population which is fast

                <p>The increase of population in the state of Ohio has been rapid almost beyond
                    example. In the year 1790 it was only about 3000; in 1800, 45,365; in 1810,
                    230,760; in 1820, 581,434; and in 1830, 937,679.</p>
                <p>For an account of Cincinnati, the principal city of Ohio, see the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cincinnati.</hi> Columbus, the political metropolis, is
                    situated near the centre of the state, upon the east bank of the Scioto River.
                    The beautiful slope on which it stands, just below the confluence of the
                    Whetstone River with the Scioto, was a compact forest in 1812. It is now cleared
                    and well cultivated, and the city contains some excellent public buildings,
                    including a penitentiary, an asylum for the deaf and dumb, and above three
                    thousand inhabitants. Steubenville, the seat of justice for Jefferson county, is
                    situated on the western bank of the Ohio, near the Pennsylvania boundary. It was
                    laid out with great regularity in 1798, and is situated in the centre of a rich
                    and populous country. It has the usual number of public buildings found in towns
                    of the same size, and it possesses cotton, woollen, and other manufactures.
                    Chillicothe is finely situated upon a level alluvial plain on the west bank of
                    the Scioto, forty-five miles in a right line from its entrance into the Ohio. It
                    was laid out with great regularity in 1796, and contains some handsome
                    buildings. It possesses several cotton factories, and a number of flour and
                    other mills. Marietta, the oldest town in the state, is situated on the Ohio, a
                    little above the mouth of the Muskingum River. Ships were formerly built here,
                    but this business has been discontinued, and the town, although very
                    advantageously placed, has not prospered like many others in the state less
                    favourably situated. Sixty miles north of Marietta, on the Muskingum, is the
                    town of Zanesville, principally distinguished for its manufactures of iron. Here
                    there are likewise a number of flour and other mills, driven by the waters of
                    the Muskingum; and two or three glasshouses. Cleveland, situated upon the
                    southern shore of Lake Erie, at the mouth of Cuyahoga River, is destined, from
                    its position, to become an important town. It is one of the principal points for
                    embarkation on the lake, and during the last American war was a provision dépôt,
                    and a place where many boats and other lake craft were built. Cleveland is
                    intermediate between Buffalo and Cincinnati, and is the dépôt of that vast
                    quantity of merchandise which is destined for the east and west. One of the most
                    important places on Lake Erie is Sandusky, situated on the southern shore of a
                    bay of the same name. Although it is comparatively a young settlement, it has a
                    great number of stores, and is one of the chief points of landing and
                    embarkation between the Mississippi Valley and New York, Buffalo, and Detroit.
                    The other ports or harbours on Lake Erie are Put-in Bay, Maumee Bay, Fair Port,
                    and Ashtabula Creek. The relative importance of these, as well as the other
                    towns belonging to Ohio, will be seen from our tabular view of the counties and
                    county towns.</p>
                <p>The first permanent settlement in the state of Ohio was made at Marietta, on the
                    7th of April 1788, by forty-seven persons from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and
                    Connecticut. In the year following a settlement was made at Columbia, six miles
                    above Cincinnati, by a company principally from Pennsylvania. In September 1799,
                    the first territorial legislature assembled at Cincinnati, under the ordinance
                    of congress of the 13th July 1786, for the government of the territory of the
                    United States north-west of the river Ohio. On the 30th of April 1802, congress
                    passed an act authorizing the calling of a convention to form a state
                    constitution for that part of the North-west Territory which now constitutes the
                    state of Ohio. On the 1st of November following the convention met at
                    Chillicothe, and formed the present constitution, by which Ohio was admitted
                    into the union. The following is an outline of the constitution of Ohio. The
                    legislative power is vested in a senate and house of representatives, which
                    together are styled the General Assembly of the State of Ohio. The
                    representatives are elected annually on the second Tuesday in October; and they
                    are apportioned amongst the counties according to the number of white male
                    inhabitants above twenty-one years of age. Their numbers cannot be less than
                    thirty-six, nor more than seventy-two. The senators are chosen biennially, and
                    are apportioned according to the number of white male inhabitants of twenty-one
                    years of age. Their number cannot be less than one third, nor more than one half
                    of the number of representatives. The executive power is vested in a governor,
                    who is elected by the people for two years, on the second Tuesday in October;
                    and his term of service commences on the first Monday in December. The general
                    assembly meets annually at Columbus, on the first Monday in December. The right
                    of suffrage is granted to all white male inhabitants above the age of twenty-one
                    years, who have resided in the state one year next preceding the election, and
                    who have paid or are charged with a state or county tax. The judicial power is
                    vested in a supreme court, in courts of common pleas for each county, and such
                    other courts as the legislature may from time to time establish.</p>

                    rend="smallcaps">Ohio,</hi> a great river of the valley of the Mississippi, in
                    North America, formed by the confluence of the /ïlleghany and Monongahela Rivers
                    at Pittsburgh, in the western part of Pennsylvania. The highest sources of the
                    Alleghany are in Potter county, Pennsylvania, twelve miles to the eastward of
                    Condersport, where they interlock with the head waters of theGenessee River, and
                    the eastern and western branches of the Susquehannah. During its course through
                    Pennsylvania, which is exceedingly irregular, it is joined by several streams,
                    the most considerable of which arc, Toby’s Creek, extending one hundred miles
                    into the interior of Pennsylvania, and the Kiskiminitas, formed by the junction
                    of the Conemaugh and Loyalhanna, which rise near the Alleghany Mountains, one
                    hundred miles distant. This branch of the Ohio, although its volume is not
                    apparently wider than the other, is by far the most important tributary. It has
                    a swift, sweeping, and rapid current, and often a rocky bottom, whence huge
                    blocks rise to the surface of the water. In the spring time, when it is full,
                    flat and keel boats descend it rapidly, without any danger. It has been
                    navigated by steam-boats, but has been found one of the most difficult currents
                    to stem ever attempted by these vessels. Monongahela River, the other fork of
                    the Ohio, rises in Virginia, about seventy miles north-west of Morgantown. It
                    traverses a rich and well-settled country, celebrated for its whisky, flour, and
                    iron manufactures. The banks are often bold and high bluffs, and in some places
                    the country is hilly. In good stages of the water, it is boatable by large boats
                    for about one hundred miles from its mouth. During its course it receives the
                    waters of a number of tributary streams, the most important of which is the
                    Youghiogeny River, or, as it is commonly called, the Yough, which rises near the
                    upper waters of the Potomac, the rivers being only separated by a spur of the
                    mountains. From the western declivity of these mountains, both this and the main
                    river receive a great accession of mountain streams. The united current, which
                    has now become broad and majestic, flows in a north-west course to Pittsburgh,
                    and where it unites with the Alleghany it is more than four hundred yards in
                    breadth. At the confluence of the two great branches, the Ohio is somewhat more
                    than six hundred yards wide, and it immediately assumes that broad, placid, and
                    beautiful aspect which it maintains to its junction with the Mississippi, in
                    latitude 37. 0. north, and longitude 88. 52. west. Its length from Pittsburgh to
                    its mouth is about nine hundred miles, including the windings of the river; but
                    the direct distance is only six hundred and fourteen miles. Its breadth varies
                    exceedingly, being in some parts fourteen hundred yards, whilst in others it is
                    only four hundred yards across. At Cincinnati it is about eight hundred yards
                    wide, and this is nearly its average breadth. For thirty miles below Pittsburgh
                    its course is north-west. It then turns slowly to the west-south-west, and
                    pursues that general direction for some five hundred miles. It flows south-west
                    for above one hundred and fifty miles, then westward above two hundred and fifty
                    miles, and finally south-west about one hundred and seventy miles through that
                    low and swampy country in which it joins the “Father of waters.” Between
                    Pittsburgh and its mouth it is diversified with about one hundred considerable
                    islands, besides a great number of tow-heads and sand-bars, which in low stages
                    of the water greatly impede navigation. Some of these islands are of exquisite
                    beauty, and afford most lovely situations for retired farms. The passages
                    between them and the sand-bars at their head are amongst the difficulties of the
                    navigation of the river. Notwithstanding these obstacles, however, it is well
                    adapted for boat navigation, the i current being remarkably smooth and gentle,
                    excepting at Louisville in Kentucky, where it is broken by falls, the water
                    running for several miles with great rapidity, although not so much so as to be
                    insurmountable by boats. A canal round these falls, a work of great magnitude
                    and utility, has been completed. The annual range of the Ohio, from low to high
                    water, is about fifty feet; the extreme range is ten feet more. When lowest it
                    may be forded at several places above Louisville. It is generally lowest in
                    August, September, and October, and highest in December,· March, May, and June.
                    Throughout the year it is subject to sudden and very considerable elevations and
                    depressions. Near Pittsburgh it is frequently frozen over for several weeks
                    during the winter, and this has sometimes been the case four hundred miles lower
                    down. Generally, the navigation upward is suspended by floating ice for eight or
                    ten weeks in winter. When the river is at its mean height, its current is about
                    three miles an hour; when higher and rising it is more, and when very low it
                    does not exceed two miles an hour. Above two hundred steam-boats ply on the
                    Ohio, a great part of which are employed in the commerce of the states bordering
                    on the river; but they also connect with it the commerce of the states on the
                    Mississippi. The produce of the contiguous states is readily transported to this
                    channel by the numerous navigable rivers which it receives, and is thence
                    conveyed to New Orleans, the grand commercial emporium of the valley of the
                    Mississippi. The Ohio and all its tributaries cannot, it is believed, have less
                    than five thousand miles of boatable waters; and, taking all circumstances into
                    account, few rivers in the world can vie with it, either in utility or beauty.
                    From its very commencement it affords most delightful prospects. Rivers of a
                    romantic and beautiful character flow into it almost at equal distances, like
                    lateral canals. Its valleys are of extraordinary depth and fertility; generally
                    high and dry, and for the most part healthy; whilst the configuration of the
                    country <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> on the banks has much grandeur, softness,
                    and variety. Of the rivers and creeks which join the Ohio, the number is very
                    great. The following are all navigable, in moderate or high stages of the water,
                    by steam-boats, for considerable distances, viz. the Muskingum, Great Kenhawa,
                    Big Sandy, Scioto, Great Miami, Kentucky, Green, Wabash, Cumberland, and
                    Tennessee. The last is by far the largest and most important tributary of the
                    Ohio, watering considerable portions of Alabama, Tennessee, and Kentucky. Of
                    creeks and smaller rivers there arc probably nearly two hundred which enter the
                    Ohio; but a list of them would only be a dry catalogue of uncouth names. <hi
