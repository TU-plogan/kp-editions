                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">OLDENBURG</label>, a sovereign duchy in the north-east of
                    Germany, but consisting also of two other portions separated from it, though
                    both of them are of small extent. One of these smaller divisions in the north is
                    called the principality of Lubeck, consisting of a small territory surrounded by
                    the Danish territory of Holstein, and some small spots on the banks of the
                    1rave, and near Schwartau, adjoining to the territory of the republic of Lubeck.
                    The other of these small divisions is on the western side of the Rhine; it is
                    called the principality of Birkenfeld, and is whol!y surrounded by the Prussian
                    province of the Lower Fhme. The whole of these three divisions extend over 2 21
                    square miles, and comprehend nine cities, ten mar ket-towns, and 776 villages
                    and hamlets, with 233,400 inhabitants, of whom 161,420 adhere to the Lutheran
                    church, 68,000 are Catholics, and the remainder, excepting 900 Jews, are
                    Calvinists. The population of the principality of Lubeck is 19,070, that of
                    Birkenfeld is 21,180, and the remainder is found in Oldenburg proper. The
                    revenues of the state amount to about L. 130,000 annually, arising partly from
                    tolls on the Weser, and partly from taxes on foreign goods, but chiefly from
                    domains. The state has no debt. The army consists of 1650 men; but the state is
                    bound to contribute to the force of the German confederacy a contingent of 2177
                    men. The principal river is the Weser, into which the smaller streams flow, and
                    it is the ordinary channel of marine commerce. The soil is in general poor and
                    sandy, but near to the rivers there are some rich marshes, obtained by draining
                    and embankments, which fatten cattle, and afford the productions of the dairy.
                    The cultivation is badly conducted in the large division. There are a great
                    number of small proprietors, who cultivate their own fields, and thereby procure
                    a bare subsistence. The climate is raw, cold, and exceedingly variable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Oldenburg,</hi> a city, the capital of the duchy of the same
                    name in the north-east of Germany. It is situated on the river Hunte, which is
                    navigable to the Weser, and is surrounded with walls planted with lime trees,
                    being well built and clean, but in an antique style. The duke has a large and
                    old, but not an elegant palace, on the grand parade, adjoining to the city. The
                    city contains two churches, two hospitals, and 660 houses, with 5420
                    inhabitants, who subsist chiefly from the expenditure of the court, of the
                    tribunals, and of the civil officers of the government. It has little trade
                    excepting at its two great fairs. Long. 8. 6.1. E. Lat. 53. 8. 33. N.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Oldenburg,</hi><hi rend="italic">Henry,</hi> was born in the
                    duehy of Bremen, in Lower Saxony. During the long parliament, he was appointed
                    consul for his countrymen, at London, after the usurpation of Cromwell; but
                    being discharged of that employment, he was appointed tutor to the Lord Henry
                    O’Bryan, an Irish nobleman, whom he attended to the university of Oxford, where
                    lie was admitted to study in the Bodleian Library in the beginning of the year
                    1656. He was afterwards tutor to William Lord Cavendish, and was acquainted with
                    Milton the poet. During his residence at Oxford he became acquainted with the
                    members of that body, which there gave birth to the Royal Society, upon the
                    foundation of which he was elected a fellow; and when the society had found it
                    necessary to have two secretaries, he was chosen as assistant secretary to Dr
                    Wilkins. He applied himself with extraordinary diligence to the business of his
                    office, and in the year 1664 began the publication of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions,</hi> which he continued to publish to No. xxxvi.
                    25th June 1677. After this the publication was discontinued till the January
                    following, when it was again resumed by his successor in the office of
                    secretary, Mr Nehemiah Grew, who carried it on till the end of February 1678. Mr
                    Oldenburg died at his house at Charlcton, near Greenwich, in Kent, in August
                    1678.</p>
