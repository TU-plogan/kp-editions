                <p><label type="entry">ORANGE <hi rend="smallcaps">River</hi></label>, a large river
                    of Southern Africa, which derives its origin from the waters of the Snowy
                    Mountains, in the district of Graaf-Reynet, nearly at the north-eastern
                    extremity of the colony of the Cape of Good Hope. It is formed chiefly by two
                    rivers, the Ky Gariep or Yellow River, and the Nu Gariep or Black River, which
                    unite their waters in latitude 29. 4., upwards of five hundred miles due east
                    from their mouth. The latter branch, flowingfrom the south-east, is called,
                    higher up, the Cradock River, and receives the Sea-Cow River and some other
                    streams from the Sneuwbergen. The Muddy or Alexander River, flowing also from
                    the south-east, falls into the Yellow River above its confluence with the Nu
                    Gariep. The former river, the Ky Gariep, comes from the north-east, and is
                    formed by the union of the Vaal River with the Hart stream or Malalareen. After
                    the junction of these two streams, the Orange River flows at first in a
                    north-westerly course, but afterwards bends to almost due west, which bearing it
                    maintains until it falls into the Atlantic in latitude 28. 30. north. In the
                    eastern part of its course it forms the limit between the territory of the
                    Hottentots and that of the Boshuanas; the country on the south presenting an
                    entirely different character of animal and vegetable life from that on the
                    north. In its westerly course this river winds its way through a desert of a
                    clayey or swampy character; the sandstone rocks rising in perpendicular walls,
                    which are often prolonged to a vast extent. The country retains the same aspect
                    for a considerable space on both sides of the river; and the heat is here very
                    great and oppressive. The course of the Orange River, including its windings,
                    must considerably exceed one thousand miles.</p>

                    rend="italic">Natural History,</hi> a name given by Count Marsigli to a very
                    remarkable species of marine substance, which he denominates a plant. It is
                    tough and firm in its structure, and in many things resembles the common fucus;
                    but instead of growing in the branched form which the generality of these
                    substances assume, it is round and hollow, and in every respect resembles the
                    shape of an orange. It has, by way of root, some exceedingly fine filaments,
                    which fasten themselves to the rocks, or to shells, stones, or any thing else
                    that comes in the way. F rom these there grows no pedicle; but the body of the
                    orange, as it is called, is fastened by them to the rock, or other solid
                    substance. The orange itself is usually about three or four inches in diameter;
                    and whilst in the sea it is full of water, which it retains even when taken up.
                    In this state it frequently weighs a pound and a half; but when the water is let
                    out, and it is dried, it becomes a mere membrane, weighing scarcely any thing.
                    It is best preserved by stuffing it with cotton as soon as the water is let out
                    of it, and then hanging it up to dry. Its surface is irregular and rough, and
                    its colour is a dusky green on the outside, and a clearer but somewhat bluish
                    green within; and its thickness is about an eighth part of an inch. When viewed
                    by the microscope, it is observed to be all over covered with small glandules,
                    or rather composed of them; for they stand so thick one by another, as to leave
                    no space between, and seem to constitute the whole substance; so that it appears
                    very like the rough shagreen skin used to cover toys. These are indeed so many
                    hollow ducts, through which the sea-water finds a passage into the globe formed
                    by this skin, and by this means it is kept always full and distended. On cutting
                    it with a pair of scissors, the water immediately runs out, and the skins
                    collapse; but there is something extremely remarkable in this, for the whole
                    substance, near the wounded place, is in motion, and seems as if alive, and
                    sensible of the wound. The glandules are found full of water, resembling small
                    transparent bottles; and what goes to the structure of the plant besides these,
                    is an assemblage of a vast number of filaments, all of which are likewise
                    hollow, being filled with a clear and transparent fluid.</p>
