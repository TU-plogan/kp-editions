                    strait of about twelve miles in breadth, and are situated between the parallels
                    58. 44. and 59. 24. north latitude, and between 2. 24. and 3. 20. west longitude
                    from the meridian of Greenwich. In number they amount to sixty-seven, of which
                    twenty-seven are inhabited; and the others, known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">holms,</hi> are employed as grazing grounds for sheep and cattle,
                    and for the manufacture of kelp. The islands are divided into two groups,
                    called, in reference to Pomona, the principal island, the North and South Isles.
                    The following are the names of the inhabited islands in the southern division,
                    with their population according to the census taken in 1831:</p>

                <p>Pomona, or the Mainland, has a population of 15,787, and thus the whole number of
                    inhabitants roiounts to 28,847.</p>
                <p>Orkney has been computed to contain 150,000 square acres, and, of these, 100,000
                    are said to be waste, or covered by water. But the very irregular form of the
                    islands, penetrated by arms of the sea in all directions, renders these
                    estimates, in absence of any accurate survey, nothing more than approximations.
                    The general appearance of the islands is bleak, and upon the whole
                    uninteresting. The total want of wood, and the immense tracts of waste,
                    uncultivated land, present a very forbidding aspect.</p>
                <p>The climate is exceedingly moist, and, though the cold is not very intense, the
                    variable weather renders the winter disagreeable in the extreme. For several
                    months there is a succession of rain, sleet, and storms. Spring is late, damp,
                    and cold; but an Orkney summer, though short, has many and peculiar charms. The
                    length of the day, the duration of twilight, the rapid vegetation, and, above
                    all, the stillness of the sleeping ocean on a calm evening, compensate in no
                    small degree for the dreariness of the other seasons.</p>
                <p>Orkney is divided into twenty parishes, composing three presbyteries and one
                    synod. Together with Zetland, these islands constitute one sheriffdom or
                    stewartry, under the jurisdiction of a sheriff-depute and two substitutes, whose
                    courts are held at Kirkwall in Orkney, and Lerwick in Zetland. Till the passing
                    of the reform bill, Orkney alone had the privilege of sending a member to
                    parliament; the landholders of Zetland, owing to the want of a separate
                    valuation of their estates, having no vote in the election. Of the land-tax
                    payable for the county, two thirds are levied from Orkney, and one third from
                    the other division of the stewartry.</p>
                <p>We shall now proceed to notice the principal islands, pointing out the most
                    remarkable objects in them. The most southerly is South Ronaldshay, containing
                    twenty-four square miles, and a population of 2265 persons, chiefly employed in
                    agriculture, and the lobster, cod, and herring fisheries. There are
                    two'commodious and secure harbours in this island, Widewall Bay on the west, and
                    St Margaret’s Hope on the north. The antiquities of the island are several
                    Picts’ houses, three or four monumental stones of large size, and the How of
                    Hoxa, an ancient stronghold. To the north-west of South Ronaldshay lies Hoy, an
                    island of twice the extent, but containing only 1388 inhabitants, the greater
                    part of it being high land covered with heath. This is in many respects the most
                    interesting of all the islands. The Wart Hill, the highest mountain in Orkney,
                    its towering precipices washed by the fury of the Western Ocean, the huge
                    isolated rock called “the Old Man of Hoy,” the meadows of the Kaim, the
                    beautiful vale o. Berrydale, through which flows a stream whose banks are
                    fringed with birches, creeping juniper, and willows, and the dwarfie stone,
                    present to the spectator objects which will amply repay a lengthened visit.
                    Forming part of the island of Hoy, but constituting a different parish, is Waas,
                    or Walls, distinguished chiefly for its excellent harbour, Long Hope, which is
                    now protected by a small battery and a couple of martello towers. Burray,
                    situated to the north of South Ronaldshay, and separated from it by a channel of
                    a mile in breadth, has an area of only three square miles, but produces grain,
                    green crops, and good pasture, and has, moreover, a valuable rabbit warren.
                    Farther north is the largest island of the group, Pomona, or Mainland, extending
                    to thirty miles in length, and containing upwards of two hundred square miles.
                    The towns of Kirkwall and Stromness are in this island (see articles <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Kirkwall</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Stromness).</hi> Pomona
                    is divided into thirteen parishes, which are supplied by eleven clergymen. Of
                    these divisions, if we except St Ola, or Kirkwall, Stennis has the greatest
                    claims on the attention of the traveller or the antiquary. Here are the Stones
                    of Stennis, two collections of what at one time must have been upright pillars,
                    forming a circle and a semicircle. Many of these stones are now overthrown; but
                    the circle, when complete, seems to have been formed of thirty-five blocks; its
                    diameter is three hundred feet, and the stones of which it is composed vary from
                    ten to sixteen feet in height, and from two and a half to five feet in breadth.
                    There have been many conjectures as to the purpose of these erections, and it is
                    by no means certain even by whom they were raised. One opinion is that they are
                    of Druidicaí, and another that they are of Scandinavian origin. A very probable
                    conjecture is, that the circle was dedicated to the sun, and the semicircle to
                    the moon, the frequent objects of Scandinavian worship. Of these stones the most
                    interesting was one which stood near to, but did not form part of, the circle;
                    it was perforated by a small hole, through which the heads of children were
                    passed in order to secure them against palsy in after-life, and through which
                    also lovers’ hands were joined, in token that the vows then made should be
                    faithfully kept. The contracts or agreements here made were peculiarly binding,
                    and the promise of Odin was regarded by an Orkneyman as of too solemn a nature
                    to be trifled with. The malice or stupidity of a stranger, who rented a
                    neighbouring farm, induced him, in 1814, to overthrow and break to pieces this
                    curious relic of ancient times. In front of the circle there is a large
                    horizontal stone, conjectured to have been used for sacrificial purposes; and it
                    has been thought that it was on this altar that Einar, jarl of Orkney, son of
                    Ronald, about the year 893, or, according to other accounts, 930, stretched
                    Halfdan, the son of Harold the fair-haired, king of Norway, and, tearing out his
                    lungs, presented the reeking gift to his god. In the adjoining parish of
                    Sandwick, the gran*</p>

                <p>deur of the rocks must attract the attention of the visitor; and one huge
                    archway, formed by the restless fury of the waves, called the Hollow Row, or the
                    Hole of Row, is particularly deserving of attention. Robert Steuart, earl of
                    Orkney, had a palace in Birsaý, the next parish on the north-west, the ruins of
                    which still remain. Brand, who visited the county in 1700, says, “the palace is
                    two stories high, the upper hath been prettily decored, the ceiling being all
                    painted, and that for the most part with schems holding forth Scripture
                    histories, as Noah’s flood, Christ’s riding to Jerusalem, &amp;c. and the
                    Scripture is set down beside the figure. It was inhabited within these twenty
                    years, but is now fast decaying.” The writer of this article saw it in 1820. All
                    the decorations, the roof, and a great part of the walls, were then gone; and
                    the clergyman of the parish informed him that the palace was regarded as a
                    common quarry, whence every intending builder drew materials for the erection of
                    his house. It was over the gateway of this building that the inscription was
                    placed which is said to have been adduced as evidence of the treasonable designs
                    of the family on the trial of Patrick, Earl Robert’s son: “Dominus Robertus
                    Stuartus, filius Jacobi quinti, <hi rend="italic">rex</hi> Scotorum, hoc opus
                    instruxi.” The two islands of Shapinshay and Rousay, each containing from ten to
                    twelve square miles, he to the north of the Mainland. In the former lead ore has
                    been found, but not in quantities sufficient to remunerate the miner; and the
                    latter presents to the antiquary for his investigation, tumuli, Picts’ houses,
                    standing stones, and a number of ancient graves. To the east of Rousay is the
                    beautiful island of Egilshay, the favourite summer residence of the ancient
                    jarls, and, at a later period, of the bishops of Orkney. It was here that St
                    Magnus, the tutelar saint of the islands, was basely murdered by his cousin
                    Hacon, in 1110. Beyond these, to the north-east, he Stronsay, where there is an
                    extensive fishing station; and Eday, an island that can boast of a burgh of
                    barony. Still farther north lie Sanday on the east, and Westray on the west. The
                    former, because of its superior productiveness, has been called the granary of
                    Orkney; and it produces, or rather did produce, fully one fifth of the kelp
                    manufactured in all the islands. It is a flat, low-lying island; and, till the
                    erection of a lighthouse in the year 1806, proved fatal to many a vessel.
                    Westray is, with the exception of Sanday, the largest of the north isles. In it
                    are the remains of a strong castle, of which Ben, who wrote in 1529, thus
                    speaks: “Est excellentissima arx sive castellum, sed nondum tamen adhuc
                    completa.” A great many graves, generally formed of five flat stones, four
                    standing on their edges, and resting on the fifth, have been lately uncovered,
                    in consequence of sand blowing. In them have been found the remains of human
                    bones, and of various weapons, offensive and defensive. In all probability they
                    are the graves of natives and strangers, who had fallen in some of the many
                    battles of which tradition preserves the remembrance. Separated from Westray by
                    a frith of a mile in breadth, is the small island of Papa Westray, with its
                    beautiful fresh-water loch, in the middle of which is a small island, whereon
                    stood the chapel of St Tredwall. The most northerly of the islands is North
                    Ronaldshay, containing an area of from four to six square miles, with a
                    population of 522. It was on a reef near this island that the Suetia of
                    Gottenburg, an Indiaman, valued at half a million sterling, was wrecked in 1740;
                    and here, too, four years afterwards, another Indiaman, the Crown Prince of
                    Denmark, with thirty chests of treasure on board, was cast away. About the year
                    1790, a lighthouse, seventy feet in height, was erected on the north-east point
                    of the island; but this light being often mistaken for that in Sanday, misled
                    mariners, and it is now discontinued, the latter being regarded as
                    sufficient.</p>
                <p>The geology of these islands offers little to attract our attention. The Orkneys
                    are said to consist of an assemblage of secondary strata, disposed round a high
                    central nucleus of primitive rocks; but Professor Traill remarks, that “the
                    mineral history of Orkney is singularly monotonous and uninteresting; the whole
                    islands, with slight exception, consisting of horizontal or slightly inclined
                    strata of sandstone, flag, and a species of slaty clay, occasionally intermixed
                    with thick beds of red and gray sandstone, and, in a few places, containing beds
                    of limestone, with some traces of marine remains.”</p>
                <p>The Orkney Flora is known to consist of 545 species, to which it is probable that
                    a careful examination will make some additions. The <hi rend="italic">chara
                    aspera,</hi> discovered by the Rev. Charles Clouston, minister of Sandwick, is
                    the only Orkney plant new to the British Flora.</p>
                <p>The zoology of Orkney, according to the <hi rend="italic">Fauna Orca· densis</hi>
                    of Low, is as follows: Quadrupeds, eleven genera; birds, thirty-four genera;
                    reptiles, two genera; and fishes, twenty-three genera. To these a few additions,
                    we believe, have been made.</p>
                <p>The history of the islandswill not detain us long. They seem to have been
                    originally peopled by a Scandinavian tribe; but little certain is known till the
                    year 870, when the Norwegian chiefs, who had fled from home because of the
                    victories of Harold the Fair-haired, arrived thĕre. Harold pursued them six
                    years afterwards, defeated them, and appointed Ronald count of Moere jarl or
                    earl of Orkney. He was succeeded, after an interval and some changes, by his son
                    Einar; whilst another son of his, Rollo, wrested Normandy from Charles the
                    Simple, king of France, and, becoming duke of that province, was the
                    greatgreat-great-grandfather of William the Conqueror. The descendants of Ronald
                    ruled as jarls for upwards of four hundred years, when the male line terminated
                    in the person of Magnus, the fifth earl of that name. He died about 1320 or
                    1330, leaving one daughter, Matilda, who became the wife of Malise, earl of
                    Stratherne, and had issue Isa-bell, who married Sir William St Clair, baron of
                    Rosslyn; and the son of this marriage, Sir Henry, was the first of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Scottish</hi> Earls of Orkney. His title was admitted by Hacon
                    VI., king of Norway, in 1379. By a treaty entered into before this period,
                    between the courts of Scotland and Norway, the latter ceded to the former Man
                    and the Western Islands, for the payment of a certain yearly sum called the
                    “Annual of Norway.” This tribute, not having been regularly rendered, soon
                    amounted to a large sum; but, after much negotiation on the subject, it was
                    arranged that the arrears of the <hi rend="italic">annual</hi> should be held as
                    discharged, that James III. should marry Margaret of Norway, that her dowry
                    should be 60,000 florins, and that Orkney should be impignorated to Scotland for
                    five sixths of that sum, the islands to be redeemed on the payment of the money.
                    This treaty was entered into in 1468. The marriage-portion was never paid, and
                    it has given rise to much controversy, whether the claim of Norway to these
                    islands has been ever formally relinquished; a question into which we shall not
                    enter, as it has been for centuries practically resolved. The earldom remained
                    in the family of St Clair till 1471, when it and the title merged in, or rather
                    was united to, the crown of Scotland, never again to be alienated, except in
                    favour of a lawful son of the king. For almost a century the crown-lands were
                    leased to various tenants, till at length, in May 1564, Queen Mary granted a
                    charter to Lord Robert Stuart, her father’s son by Dame Euphemia Elphinstone,
                    constituting him Earl of Orkney. Afterwards, by her marriage-contract with
                    Bothwell, dated May 1567, Mary bound herself to create him Duke of Orkney, and
                    to put him in possession of the islands. He appears never to have been infeft,
                    or, at all events, a month after the marriage, he fled, and the dukedom<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194563898" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3898-0541"/> was at an end.
                    Earl Robert had no concern with Orkney from 1567 to 1581, but in the latter year
                    he had another grant of the earldom made to him. This was revoked by King James
                    upon his attaining his majority in 1587. Again, a farther grant was executed in
                    favour of him and his heirs in 1591, which in 1592 was confirmed by parliament.
                    Earl Robert died in that year, and the earldom was once more resumed by the
                    crown; and once more, in March 1600, Patrick, the son of Robert by the Lady Jean
                    Kennedy, got a grant of it in his favour; and in May of the same year he got a
                    grant of the bishopric. Earl Patrick’s crimes brought him to the scaffold in
                    1615; and after his death ‘the Orkneys were again unalienably annexed to the
                    crown, and again they were alienated in 1643. This deed was declared null and
                    void in 1669; and once more, in 1707, they were mortgaged to the Morton family,
                    burdened with an annual payment of L.500 to the crown. In 1742, this mortgage
                    was declared irredeemable, and Lord Morton in 1766 sold his rights for L.60,000,
                    to Sir Laurence Dundas, in whose family they still remain. From a calculation
                    made by Sheriff in his agricultural survey, printed in 1814, it would appear
                    that Lord Dundas draws annually from his vassals in the earldom L.2187. Ils.
                    9j∣d., payable partly in money and partly in produce. In addition to this he has
                    a large private property in the county.</p>
                <p>Of the trade and manufactures of Orkney, it is not easy to give any thing like an
                    accurate estimate; but the following may be looked upon as generally
                    correct.</p>

                <p>The exports consist chiefly of grain, fish, cattle and sheep, butter, hides,
                    rabbit-skins, and eggs. In 1833, it is said, 100,000 dozens of eggs were
                    exported, which, at 6d. a dozen, brought L.2500. The imports are of a most
                    miscellaneous description, and we have seen no probable estimate of their
                    value.</p>
                <p>Till lately, the principal manufacture in the islands was that of kelp, which at
                    one time brought L.12, L.16, and even L.20 a ton; but now the prices obtained
                    barely suffice to cover the expenses of making and carrying it to market. The
                    greatest quantity ever made in one year was in 1826, when 3500 tons were
                    manufactured, which, on an average, sold at L.7 a ton. The expense of cutting,
                    drying, and burning the sea-weed, amounts to about L.3 or L.3. 3s. a ton of
                    kelp, and it costs about L.l more to bring it to market; and, for some years,
                    the price has scarcely exceeded L.4. 10s. or L.5.</p>
                <p>In 1833 there were forty vessels of about thirty tons each engaged in the
                    cod-fishery, and they caught and cured 560 tons of fish, valued at L.13 per ton.
                    During the same year, the produce of the lobster-fishery, in which there were
                    engaged 216 boats and 432 men, amounted to L.1800. The principal fishery,
                    however, is the herringfishery. In 1820 there were exported from Orkney 17,989
                    barrels of herrings, which, at 10s. a barrel, would amount to about L.8000; and
                    in 1833 the number had amounted to 34,000 barrels, valued at L.17,000. The
                    principal stations for this fishery are Huip in Stronsay, and St Margaret’s Hope
                    in South Ronaldshay.</p>
                <p>The chief manufacture in Orkney at present is that of straw-plaiting. Twenty
                    years ago, from six to seven thou sand females were employed in this branch of
                    trade; and they are calculated to have drawn in wages L.20,000 annually. Since
                    that time the plaiting of common straw has been almost entirely discontinued,
                    and that of the unsplit straw of rye or wheat has been introduced. In 1833 there
                    were plaited 489,560 yards of Orkney straw, and 240,900 yards of foreign straw.
                    The former is thought tougher than the latter, but the colour is not so
                    pleasing. A bonnet that will cost L.4 contains about 140 yards of the finest
                    plait.</p>
                <p>In Kirkwall there are two licensed distilleries, and there is one in Stromness.
                    In 1833 there were distilled 13,947 gallons of whisky, yielding to the revenue
                    L.2324. 10s. of duty. It has been calculated, that during the year to which
                    these estimates chiefly refer (viz. 1833), upwards of L.60,000 was received in
                    Orkney, principally from fisheries, farm produce, and manufactures.</p>
                <p>When Dr Barry wrote his history of Orkney, more than thirty years ago, he pointed
                    out many defects in the system of Orkney farming. Some of these still remain,
                    but many of them have disappeared; and, as old prejudices wear away, and
                    landlords see that it is for their own no less than for their tenants’ advantage
                    to grant leases of some duration, and when both parties arc convinced that a
                    proper rotation of crops should be insisted on, and when fencing and draining
                    have been carried to a greater extent than has yet been done, we may hope to
                    witness a still more marked improvement. The grain almost exclusively raised in
                    Orkney is barley, or rather bear or big <hi rend="italic">(hor∙</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">deum tetrastechon),</hi> and
                    gray oats <hi rend="italic">(avena strigosa).</hi> We have seen wheat tried, but
                    the result of the experiment was not encouraging.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, we would remark, that the inhabitants of these islands are in
                    general not overmuch inclined to labour when at home, but that when abroad they
                    can be made to exert themselves. They are somewhat superstitious, but are
                    nevertheless well informed on many subjects; whilst the upper classes, as a
                    body, are not inferior to their equals in station in any part of Scotland. All
                    classes are universally acknowledged to be kind, courteous, and most attentive
                    to strangers.</p>
