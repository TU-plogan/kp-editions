                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">ORMUZ</label>, a barren island in the Persian Gulf, on which
                    was formerly built a city, forming a vast emporium of Indian trade, and
                    celebrated for its wealth and its extended commerce all over Asia. This island
                    is about twelve miles in circumference, and resembles, when viewed from the sea,
                    a mass of rocks and shells thrown up by some violent convulsion from the bottom
                    of the ocean. Not more than 500 inhabitants are contained within the walls of
                    the fort and a wretched suburb. A range of hills intersects the island from east
                    to west, from the suburb to these heights is about a mile and a half, and the
                    ground continues level about two miles along the northern shore. This whole
                    space is one mass of ruins; and it is only where the reservoirs of water have
                    been made that the buildings are in any thing like a perfect state. According to
                    the account of Kinneir, these appear to have been made in the shape of a hollow
                    cylinder, covered by an arch of solid masonry; and it is probable, he adds, that
                    every house of consequence had one of these reservoirs, as there is only a
                    record of one well of fresh water ever having been on the island, and that is
                    now dry. The rocks of Ormuz consist almost entirely of fine crystal salt; and,
                    from various specimens which are found on the surface, there can be little doubt
                    of its abounding with sulphur and a variety of metals, especially iron and
                    copper. It is mentioned that the southern part of the island is one entire heap
                    of cliffs and rocks. These sink abruptly, towards its northern extremity, into a
                    plain, comprising an extent of six or eight square miles of comparatively level
                    country, terminating in a sandy spit that divides the harbour of Ormuz into two
                    parts, and on which stands the old Portuguese fort. The harbour is tolerably
                    good, being surrounded on all sides by the land, though the bottom affords good
                    anchorage. The fort, which is still in a good state of repair, is built on a
                    narrow neck of land jutting into the sea, by which the walls are washed on the
                    northern and western sides, and was never of great extent or regular figure. The
                    walls have been most carefully and substantially built of the rock afforded by
                    the island. Strong bastions command each face, and the height from the water to
                    the ramparts may be about eighty feet. The walls are in good repair, but the
                    interior is in ruins. Two large reservoirs for supplying them with water still
                    subsist, and both are covered in. The roof of one rests on two rows of massy
                    pillars, and its diameter is about 100 feet. The fort was formerly separated
                    from the mainland by a canal cut through the neck of land, and this was crossed
                    by a drawbridge; but it is now chiefly filled up, the eastern part serving as a
                    dock for repairing boats. A rotten plank is the only passage to the gateway,
                    which is strongly defended by guns from the neck of the opposite bastion.
                    Several iron and two brass guns are mounted on the walls, bearing the Portuguese
                    arms. The carriages of the guns are so bad that they would not bear a single
                    discharge. A mud wall, just beyond the old ditch, encloses between itself and
                    the fort the few miserable huts that are occasionally tenanted on the island.
                    “Beyond this,” says Frazer, in his Narrative of a Journey through Khorassan (p.
                    47), “upon the plain extending to the feet of the mountains, he scattered the
                    ruins of the ancient Arabian and Portuguese city, with its villas and seats,
                    which are constructed of such perishable materials that scarcely <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194563937" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3937-0544"/>any relics of importance are
                    to be seen.” The only remarkable object is a tower near the wall, which Frazer
                    conjectures to have been a minaret built by Shah Abbas after he had captured the
                    place. Along the shore both of the eastern and western bays, not far from the
                    water’s edge, may be still seen a row of ruined houses, arcaded into apartments
                    of various sizes and dimensions, which, in the opinion of Frazer, have been
                    sirdabs or underground apartments for retiring to in warm weather, or cellars
                    for receiving merchandise. The whole was of the same solid architecture as the
                    first. The ground beyond, for a considerable space towards the mountains, was
                    thickly strewed with broken tiles, pottery, glass, and the other usual
                    destructible relics of an eastern city thrown into heaps of rubbish. Ormuz thus
                    was possessed of no natural advantages, either from soil or climate; the heats
                    during the summer being scarcely supportable by the human frame. It produces no
                    articles of provision, not even a drop of water; so that it required a great
                    exertion to render it habitable. The greater portion of the island consists of
                    volcanic rocks, and the remainder of uneven stony places, strongly impregnated
                    with salt; so that the means of improving the country do not exist. Not a tree
                    nor a shrub can be raised; for the first necessary, water, is entirely wanting,
                    and all vegetable supplies come from Kishmee or the mainland. Considering the
                    barrenness of the island, Frazer doubts where the blooming and aromatic shrubs,
                    that in former times were said to have decorated the streets, could have been
                    found. The surface of the plain, though level when contrasted with the mountains
                    beyond it, is still found extremely rugged on a nearer approach, and broken into
                    ravines. The rocks are strongly impregnated with iron; they rise in rugged
                    amorphous masses, strewing the ground with ruins, from which the mountains rise
                    abruptly in bare desolate crags, and sharp, lofty peaks, of every variety of
                    form and hue. “In many parts,” says Frazer, “these, as well as the plains below,
                    have a volcanic appearance, and a looseness of texture that alarms the traveller
                    lest the surface should give way under his foot, and swallow him up in yet
                    smoking ashes.” The only products of Ormuz are iron in various shapes, sulphur;
                    salt, which is produced from several salt springs, and is the only source of
                    revenue in the island. The export in the company’s ships is prohibited, lest it
                    should interfere with the monopoly of salt in India. But the export to other
                    places is considerable. The garrison of Ormuz consists of eighty soldiers
                    belonging to the imaum of Muscat, who live immured in this desolate spot in
                    great wretchedness. The broadsword and the target are their chief arms. These
                    swords are sharp and thin, and previous to an attack they make them quiver and
                    ring in the hand, with a jerk, whilst held in an upright position, and then
                    charge with loud shouts. Ormuz was entirely indebted for its pre-eminent
                    splendour to commerce, and it was long the great dépôt both of Indian and
                    European produce. When the Portuguese fleet had found their way to India round
                    the Cape of Good Hope, they soon cast a covetous eye on the wealth of Ormuz.
                    They made several attempts to gain possession of it, but without effect, till in
                    1514 it surrendered to Albuquerque, who approached with an overwhelming force.
                    It continued to be one of the chief seats of the Portuguese power till the reign
                    of Shah Abbas, who conceived the plan of its conquest, and of attaching it as an
                    appendage to the Persian empire. His attempt would have been vain had he not
                    been aided by an English squadron which happened to be cruizing in these seas;
                    and the commanders of which, being hostile to the Portuguese, readily fell in
                    with the schemes of the Persian monarch. Their combined forces having landed,
                    obliged the Portuguese to evacuate the town and to retire to the castle, which
                    was at last reduced, chiefly by famine. Under the Persian regime the town
                    decayed; the trade was ordered by the Shah to be transferred to Gombroon, on the
                    opposite coast; and all the inhabitants at last followed, leaving only a Persian
                    garrison. About the end of the last century Ormuz was taken possession of by the
                    imaum of Muscat, and the inhabitants were then reduced to forty families. But
                    the fort has since been repaired, and now contains 500 families. Long. 56. 40.
