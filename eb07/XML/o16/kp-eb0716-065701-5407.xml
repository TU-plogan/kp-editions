                <p><label type="entry">OSSIAN</label>, the son of Fingal, a celebrated Celtic bard,
                    who is commonly supposed to have flourished about the end of the second or the
                    beginning of the third century.</p>
                <p>Several incidents in the poems ascribed to him are conceived to point out this as
                    the era of the poet; particularly the engagement of Fingal with <hi
                    rend="italic">Caracul,</hi> “the son of the king of the world,” who, according
                    to Macpherson and Whitaker, is the same with the son of Severus, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Caracalla</hi> of Roman history. Fingal, who commanded the
                    Caledonians<pb break="no" facs="nls:194565420" xml:id="kp-eb0716-5420-0658"/> at
                    that memorable juncture, is said to have eluded the power of Severus, and gained
                    a signal victory on the banks of the Carron, in which Caracul fled from his arms
                    “along the fields of his pride.” As Gibbon observes, however, “Something of a
                    doubtful mist still hangs over these Highland traditions, nor can it be entirely
                    dispelled by the most ingenious researches of modern criticism; but if we could
                    with safety indulge the pleasing supposition that Fingal lived, and that Ossian
                    sung, the striking contrast of the situation and manners of the contending
                    nations might amuse a philosophic mind. The parallel,” he adds, “would be little
                    to the advantage of the more civilized people, if we compared the unrelenting
                    revenge of Severus with the generous clemency of Fingal; the timid and brutal
                    cruelty of Caracalla with the bravery, the tenderness, the elegant genius of
                    Ossian; the mercenary chiefs who, from motives of fear or interest, served under
                    the imperial standard, with the free-born warriors who started to arms at the
                    voice of the king of Morven: if, in a word, we contemplated the untutored
                    Caledonians, glowing with the warm virtues of nature, and the degenerate Romans,
                    polluted with the mean vices of wealth and slavery.”</p>
                <p>Speculations like these, however, though they may amuse by their novelty, or
                    surprise by a striking contrast of situation and of manners, can have no real
                    value in themselves, if they rest merely on a “pleasing supposition,”
                    unsupported by evidence. “That Fingal lived, and that Ossian sung,” can only be
                    believed upon the assumption that the poems ascribed to the son of the
                    Caledonian hero are authentic productions; and, until this be established, it is
                    obviously vain to attempt to deduce from them any inference as to the existence
                    of the one, the era of the other, or the circumstances and manners of the times
                    when they are said to have flourished. The primary question therefore is, Are
                    the poems attributed to Ossian, more especially those given to the world by
                    Macpherson, the genuine productions of a Celtic bard of the third century; or
                    are they, on the other hand, a forgery, palmed upon the world by an individual
                    who attempted to give currency to his own compositions under the mask and
                    pretence of a high antiquity?</p>
                <p>“The appearance of the poems, of Ossian,” says the Abbate Cesarotti, “was a
                    phenomenon so unexpected and extraordinary, that it is not surprising they
                    should have excited doubts and astonishment, even during the period of
                    enthusiasm itself, in a country scarcely known to history— wild, savage, and
                    covered with mists; in a state of society the most rude, miserable, and
                    barbarous, without commerce, without learning, without writing, and without
                    arts; how could there arise so transcendent a genius, who should at length come
                    to dispute the palm with the most celebrated poets of the most polished nations,
                    nay, even with those who for so many ages were regarded as models of the art?
                    This novelty was too much at variance with all received opinions to be believed
                    without question, or admitted without controversy. Was there truly an Ossian?
                    Was he really the author of the poems which have been published under his name?
                    Can this be a spurious work? But when? How? By whom? These are the questions
                    which have divided England and civilized Europe respecting this surprising
                    phenomenon. These are the doubts which have been raised by learned men and
                    critics; doubts which, though much weakened, have not yet been entirely removed
                    from the minds of many persons. Whatever opinion be adopted, it is certain that
                    various embarrassing difficulties present themselves, and that the most
                    strenuous advocates on both sides cannot fail to waver in their
                    conclusions.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    and Critical Dissertation was published by Dr John M‘Arthur (London, 1806, in
                    8vo), “one of the Committee of the Highland Society of London, appointed to
                    superintend the publication of Ossian in the original Gaelic.” But, for the sake
                    of the Celtic bard, it is to be hoped that this gentleman’s knowledge of Italian
                    cannot be taken as the measure of his acquaintance with Gaelic. We have been at
                    the pains to compare his translation with the original, and the result has been
                    to satisfy us that he was not only incapacitated, by ignorance of the language,
                    for translating any Italian work correctly; but that he has, in several parts of
                    the Historical and Critical Dissertation, been guilty of <hi rend="italic"
                    >material suppressions.</hi> Examples of both occur in his translation of the
                    passage above quoted. 1. The words of the original, “in uno stato di società. il
                    più rozzo, mescliino, e barbaro, senza commercio, senza idee, <hi rend="italic"
                    >senza serittura,</hi> senz’arti,” he renders, “in a state of society the most
                    unpolished, wretched, and barbarous thus <hi rend="italic">suppressing</hi> the
                    material words, “senza serittura,” <hi rend="italic">without writing,</hi>
                    containing an important admission on the part of the Italian translator of
                    Ossian. 2. His knowledge of the original may be judged of from his translation
                    of the following sentence: “Ecco le questioni, che per lungo tempo divisero
                    l’Inghilterra, e J’Europa colta sopra questo sorprendente fenomeno,” which he
                    renders thus: “These are questions that for a length of time have <hi
                    rend="italic">agitated</hi> and divided <hi rend="italic">public opinion in</hi>
                    England, <hi rend="italic">while</hi> Europe <hi rend="italic">regarded with
                    veneration</hi> this surprising phenomenon.” This is either ignorance, or
                    something still worse. Cesarotti says nothing about “Europe <hi rend="italic"
                    >regarding with veneration,''</hi> &amp;c.: what he states is, that the
                    questions he had indicated long divided England, <hi rend="italic">and</hi>
                    civilized Europe, respecting the unexpected and extraordinary appearance of the
                    poems of Ossian. Numerous instances of a similar and still more striking kind
                    might easily be added.</p></note></p>
                <p>The ingenious Italian translator having here suggested the questions which it is
                    most material to resolve, before any conclusion can be safely deduced from the
                    contents of the poems themselves, we shall endeavour to furnish our readers with
                    the means of judging for themselves respecting the whole matter in controversy;
                    first, by submitting a short historical account of the manner in which the poems
                    ascribed to Ossian are said to have been originally collected, translated, and
                    published, by Macpherson; secondly, by exhibiting a summary of the arguments
                    which have been employed to disprove the authenticity of these poems; thirdly,
                    by stating the results of the elaborate inquiry into the nature and authenticity
                    of the poems of Ossian, instituted by the Highland Society of Scotland, and
                    conducted by a Committee of that body, under the auspices of its chairman, Mr
                    Henry Mackenzie, by whom the Report was drawn up; and, lastly, by subjoining
                    some particulars respecting the other collectors of Celtic poetry, whose
                    proceedings form a curious sequel to those of Mr James Macpherson. It is only by
                    a clear and comprehensive statement of the whole case, that a rational judgment
                    can be formed respecting the various matters in dispute; nor is it possible
                    otherwise to enable the reader to decide for himself, whether the doubts raised
                    by learned men and critics have been removed, or even in any material degree
                    obviated.</p>

                <p>I. The first person who seems to have conceived the idea of collecting and
                    translating some of the traditional poems floating in the Highlands, was a young
                    man named Jerome Stone, formerly a schoolmaster at Dunkeld. In 1756, he
                    published, in the Scots Magazine, a translation in verse of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bas Fhroich,</hi> or the death of Fraoch, under the title of Albin and Mey; and
                    this specimen he accompanied with a short letter addressed to the editor,
                    indicating his opinion of the poetical merits of the various pieces in his
                    possession. Stone did not think of giving to the public the original of his
                    translation; but Mr Mackenzie, having procured it from Mr Chalmers of London,
                    into whose hands it had accidentally fallen, has inserted it in the appendix to
                    the Report of the Committee of the Highland Society, with Stone’s version and a
                    literal translation subjoined. This poem, according to Dr Graham, approaches
                    nearer to the style of the Gaelic fragments of Ossian than any thing he had yet
                    met with.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Essay on the
                    Authenticity of Ossian’s Poems, p. 208, et seq.</p></note> About the same time
                    Mr Pope, minister of Reay, in Caithness, had thoughts of making a collection of
                    the old Highland poems ascribed to Ossian, in concert with a gentleman then
                    living on Lord Reay’s estate; but the death of the latter, upon whose assistance
                    he had mainly depended, put an end to the scheme.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The next, and by far the most celebrated, collector of Gaelic poetry, was Mr
                    James Macpherson, whose translations first attracted notice to the supposed
                    productions of the Celtic muse, and whose proceedings in connection with these
                    gave rise to the controversy which so long divided the literary world. The
                    circumstances which originally led to the employment of this gentleman as a
                    collector and translator of Gaelic poetry, have been fully stated by Mr
                    Mackenzie, in the Report of the Committee of the Highland Society.</p>
                <p>Mr Home, author of Douglas, happening to be at Moffat, a watering-place in
                    Dumfriesshire, in the summer of 1759, met there with Macpherson, whom he found
                    officiating as tutor to Mr Graham, younger of Balgowan, whose father’s family
                    was then residing at that place. In the course of his inquiries about the
                    manners and customs of the Highlanders, Mr Home learned from Macpherson, that
                    one of their favourite amusements consisted in listening to the compositions of
                    their ancient bards, which were described as highly pathetic and imaginative;
                    and some fragments of these traditional poems, which, at Mr Home’s desire,
                    Macpherson translated from memory, struck him as exceedingly beautiful. Mr Home
                    communicated these pieces to his friends, whose opinion proved as favourable as
                    his own; and, under this impression, they prevailed on Macpherson to publish
                    them in a small volume at Edinburgh, at the same time undertaking to superintend
                    the publication, and also to defray the expense. To this volume Dr Blair wrote
                    an introduction; and, on its appearance, it attracted “universal attention.” The
                    literary circle of Edinburgh, consisting of David Hume, Dr Robertson, Dr Blair,
                    Dr Carlyle, Mr Home, and others, felt much interested in the discovery of what
                    seemed to be a new mine of poetical wealth; and a subscription was accordingly
                    entered into to enable Macpher son to make a tour through the Highlands for the
                    purpose of collecting larger and more complete poems, which he represented as
                    still existing there, and of which some of the pieces already published were
                    described by him as only detached and disconnected fragments. He particularly
                    mentioned a poem in an epic form, and of considerable length, on the subject of
                    the wars of Fion or Fingal, which he thought might be recovered entire. Mean
                    while, that is, about 1758, he published, in his own name, a poem, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Highlander,</hi> which appears to have sunk into oblivion
                    immediately after its publication; but the remembrance of this production was
                    revived by Mr Laing, in the controversy which subsequently arose respecting the
                    authenticity of the poems ascribed to Ossian; and it is not a little remarkable
                    that the style and imagery of the poem called Fingal occur in almost every page
                    of The Highlander.</p>
                <p>Under the patronage of the eminent individuals already mentioned, Macpherson
                    performed his literary tour in 1766; transmitting from time to time accounts of
                    his progress, and of the various poems which, as he said, he had succeeded in
                    collecting. The districts through which he travelled were chiefly the
                    north-western parts of Inverness-shire, the Isle of Skye, and some of the
                    adjoining islands; places which, from their remoteness, and the state of manners
                    that then existed in them, were thought the most likely to afford, in a pure and
                    genuine state, those traditionary tales and poems in the recital of which the
                    Highlanders were represented as taking so much delight. On his return from the
                    north, Macpherson passed some time with an early acquaintance of his own, Mr
                    Gallie, then a missionary in Badenoch; and availed himself of the assistance of
                    this gentleman, as well as of that of Mr Macpherson of Strathmashie, in
                    collating the different copies of the poems which he had collected, in
                    translating difficult passages, and in determining the meaning of obsolete
                    words.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is alleged
                    that Macpherson, when he undertook his journey to the Highlands, was but an
                    indifferent proficient in the Gaelic language. An instance of this, to which
                    much importance seems to be attached, is recorded in the Appendix to the
                    Committee’s Report (p. 95); and a Highland gentleman who met him in London in
                    1762 also describes him as being “very imperfectly acquainted with the Gaelic
                    language.” The instance mentioned in the Report, however, amounts only to a
                    verbal blunder in conversation, and is so very trifling, that we are surprised
                    to find it gravely adduced as a proof of Macpherson’s ignorance of Gaelic;
                    whilst as to the opinion expressed by the Highland gentleman who met Macpherson
                    in London, the measure of its value must be the competency of that individual to
                    form a correct judgment, a subject on which we have no information. The object
                    of impeaching Macpherson’s knowledge of Gaelic is to render it improbable that
                    he could have fabricated the originals of the poems which he professed to have
                    translated. But it is forgotten that Gaelic was his mother tongue; and that,
                    though his knowledge of that language might not be great, he could command the
                    assistance of others who were more skilful than himself.</p></note> He then
                    proceeded to Edinburgh, where he communicated to his patrons the result of his
                    expedition, and in 1762 published <hi rend="italic">Fingal,</hi> an epic poem in
                    six books, with some other detached pieces of a similar kind. In an
                    advertisement prefixed to Fingal, he states, that “some men of genius had
                    advised him to print the originals by subscription, rather than deposit them in
                    a public library and, in the preliminary dissertation, he says that “his
                    translation is literal, and that as he claims no merit on account of his
                    version, he wishes that the imperfect semblance which he draws may not prejudice
                    the world against an original which contains what is beautiful in simplicity, or
                    grand in the sublime.” In the year 1765, he published another epic poem,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Temora,</hi> to the seventh book of which he annexed
                    the original Gaelic; but of all the rest he published only translations. At his
                    death, however, he left a sum of money for defraying the expense of publishing
                    the originals of the whole, with directions to his executors for carrying that
                    purpose into effect. But, from whatever cause, this publication has not yet
                    appeared, and it is more than probable that it never will.<note anchored="true"

                    they were, their authenticity would be fully as liable to challenge or dispute
                    as the translations which Macpherson professed to have made from them. The
                    demand made by Dr Johnson and others was in itself most reasonable; and the
                    refusal to produce evidence, merely because men doubted in a case where there
                    was great room for incredulity, is either a proof that none whatever existed, or
                    an instance of perversity unexampled in the history of literary
                    controversy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“I suppose
                    my opinion of the poems of Ossian,” says Johnson, “is already discovered. I

                    it be shown by any other: to revenge reasonable incredulity by refusing
                    evidence, is a degree of insolence with which the world is not yet acquainted;
                    and stubborn audacity is the last refuge of guilt. It would be easy to show it
                    if he had it; but whence could it be had? It is too long to be remembered, and
                    the language formerly had nothing written. He has doubtless inserted names that
                    circulate in popular stories, and may have translated some wandering ballads, if
                    any can be found; and the names and some of the images being recollected, make
                    an inaccurate auditor imagine that he has formerly heard the whole.” <hi

                    that on these and from these fragments the forgery has been erected.” “You will

                    designs were all sign-post daubings. The most celebrated mimics on the stage, as
                    Eastcourt and Foote, were the most miserable actors; and, to come a little
                    nearer, the book written by Burke against civil society, under the name and

                <p>II. But if Blair, in his elaborate and rhetorical Dissertation, had done little
                    or nothing to remove the doubts which from the first were entertained as to the
                    authenticity. of the poems ascribed to Ossian, incredulity gained still greater
                    confidence from the formidable and systematic onset of Mr Laing. In the third
                    volume of liis History of Scotland, that gentleman, in treating of the
                    Highlanders, had adverted to the state of society and manners represented in
                    these poems, as existing amongst that people, about the end of the second or
                    commencement of the third century, and had thence deduced an argument against
                    the authenticity of productions displaying a refinement and cultivation of
                    sentiment inconsistent with all history and experience. “The productions of the
                    Celtic muse,” said he, “would persuade us to believe that the early manners of
                    the Highlanders displayed a civilization inconsistent with an utter ignorance of
                    the arts of life; an uniform heroism unknown to barbarians; a gallantry which
                    chivalry never inspired; a humanity which refinement has never equalled; and
                    that before their advance to the shepherd state, they possessed a correct taste,
                    a polished diction, a cultivated and sublime poetry, enriched with the choicest
                    images of classical antiquity, and intermixed with all the sentimental
                    affectation of the present times. Their history contains no marks of primeval
                    refinement, unless we can persuade ourselves that their descendants, as soon as
                    they approached observation, degenerated on emerging from the savage state, and
                    became more barbarous in proportion as they became more civilized.”</p>
                <p>The improbability of such an inversion of the ordinary law of human society is
                    sufficiently apparent. But Mr Laing, not content with urging this argument,
                    which he held to be “unanswerable,” annexed to the fourth volume of his history
                    a “Dissertation bn the supposed Authenticity of Ossian’s Poems,” in which he has
                    reduced his numerous detections, historical and critical, under a few general
                    heads, “and endeavoured,” as he says, “to disabuse his countrymen, and to put an
                    end, if possible, to the controversy and deception for ever.” These heads are,
                    the Roman History of Britain, the Middle Ages, Tradition, the Customs and
                    Manners of the Times, the Real Origin of the Poems, Imitations of the ancient
                    and modern Poets, the pretended Originals, and Macpherson’s avowal of the whole
                    imposture; thus embracing the whole question in all its bearings and details. In
                    such an article as the present, it is of course impossible to enter into a
                    subject branching out into so many divisions; or even to attempt giving an
                    abstract of the various arguments which have been urged by Mr Laing in
                    attempting to disprove the authenticity of the poems ascribed to Ossian. We
                    shall therefore content ourselves with indicating a few of the leading points,
                    leaving those who take an interest in the controversy, of desire further
                    information, to consult the Dissertation itself.</p>
                <p>On the first branch of his subject, Mr Laing contends that, as the Highlanders
                    originated from Ireland, and as their arrival from that country is established
                    by the concurrence of every Scottish and Irish historian, whether their first
                    migration is placed in 258 under Cairbar Riada, or postponed until 503, when
                    they were restored by Fergus MacErth and his brother Loam, there was not a
                    Highlander in Scotland of the present race at the beginning of the era which is
                    assigned to Fingal by Macpherson. He next shows, that by connecting his poems
                    with Roman history, Macpherson has fallen into the most ridiculous mistakes.
                    Gibbon had previously remarked the absurdity of making the Highland bard
                    describe the son of Severus “by a nickname invented four years afterwards,
                    scarcely used by the Romans till after the death of that emperor, and seldom
                    employed by the most ancient historians;”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    which it involved him.</p></note> and the detection is as complete with respect
                    to Carausius, who is represented as the contemporary and successor of that
                    emperor. The most noted or classical places in Scotland are also, by a dexterous
                    anticipation, appropriated to Ossian, as Carron, Glencoen or Cona, and Dumbarton
                    the Alcuith of Bede. The name of Balclutha Mr Laing considers as fictitious; and
                    in Fingal’s intercourse with other nations he discovers the same minute yet
                    conclusive anachronisms. The invasions from Lochlin, a name unknown until the
                    ninth century, are also, according to Mr Laing, equally fabulous with the
                    pretended exploits of Fingal against the Romans. The detections resulting from a
                    comparison of the incidents mentioned in these poems with the history of the
                    middle ages are not less important. They relate chiefly to Magnus, surnamed
                    Barefoot; Cathulà or Ketil, the friend of Fingal; Carrick-Thura, the palace of
                    the king of Innistore; and the circle of Loda.</p>
                <p>But one of the strongest points of Mr Laing’s argument is that which has for its
                    object to disprove that poems of such length could have been preserved entire,
                    for upwards of fifteen hundred years, by means of oral tradition alone. “It is
                    indeed strange,” says Hume, in a letter to Gibbon, “that any man of sense could
                    have imagined it possible, that above twenty thousand verses, along with
                    numberless historical facts, could have been preserved by oral tradition, during
                    fifty generations, by the rudest, perhaps, of all the civilized nations, the
                    most necessitous, the most turbulent, and the most unsettled. Where a
                    supposition<pb break="no" facs="nls:194565459" xml:id="kp-eb0716-5459-0661"/> is
                    so contrary to common sense, any positive evidence of it ought never to be
                    regarded. Men run with great avidity to give their evidence in favour of what
                    flatters their passions and their national prejudices.” The consideration of the
                    mutability of language also supplies an argument which cannot easily be
                    obviated. This is counteracted only by letters and by the art of printing; but
                    an unwritten language naturally diverges into different dialects, and in every
                    age assumes a new form, although the radical structure may remain. If these
                    poems, then, are alleged to have been preserved by oral tradition, in an
                    obsolete diction, that is, in a dialect disused by the people, this alone is
                    sufficient to confute their authenticity. But if it be maintained that the
                    language has remained invariably the same since the end of the second or
                    beginning of the third century, this is contrary to the experience of all
                    nations, and, besides, is disproved by the difference of the Gaelic from the
                    parent Irish, a page of which a few centuries old is confessedly unintelligible
                    to the people of the present day. Nor has the difficulty been in any degree
                    removed by the numerous attestations which have, at different times, been
                    obtained. No sooner were the translations published, than the traditionary
                    existence of the poems disappeared. When Dr Johnson visited the Western Isles,
                    the natives had nothing to communicate that deserved attention; and his
                    assertion that there was not a Gaelic manuscript above a century old still
                    remains undisproved by the publication of any such document. In proof that the
                    Highlanders were neither rude and illiterate, nor the Gaelic an unwritten
                    language, in the time of Ossian, it has been alleged that the Druids, when
                    expelled from Scotland, retired to Iona, where they established a college, and
                    lived and taught unmolested till the sixth century, when they were dispossessed
                    by St Columba. But, according to Mr Laing, there is no evidence, nothing indeed
                    but conjecture, that the Druids ever existed in Ireland; and the fact appears to
                    be certain, that there never was a Druid in Scotland, otherwise Tacitus, who
                    describes the destruction of their order in England, would most probably have
                    remarked their influence or existence under Galgacus in the Caledonian war. “The
                    man,” he adds, “who can thus create an historical fact, requires nothing but
                    genius to fabricate an epic poem.” Finally, if manuscripts be appealed to, “let
                    a single book of Fingal in manuscript, such as translated by Macpherson, of an
                    older date than a century, be produced and lodged in a public library, and there
                    is an end of the dispute.”</p>
                <p>Mr Laing then proceeds to show that the contradiction is not greater between the
                    primeval refinement ascribed to the Highlanders, and their recent barbarism,
                    than between their real manners at the period of Fingal and those described in
                    the poems of Ossian. He alleges that reli gion was avoided as a dangerous topic,
                    which led to detection; that, from the difficulty of inventing a religious
                    mythology, Macpherson has created a savage society of refined atheists, who
                    believe in ghosts, but not in deities; and that, solicitous only for proper
                    machinery, he has rendered the Highlanders a race of unparalleled infidels, who
                    believed in no gods but the ghosts of their fathers. And the same difficulty, he
                    adds, occurred in the adaptation of circumstances, peculiar customs, or rites,
                    to the supposed state of society; points on which Macpherson has laid himself
                    open to suspicion or detection. Mr Laing next traces the origin of the poems
                    ascribed to Ossian, which he ascribed to the failure of Macpherson’s avowed
                    poem, entitled The Highlander, published at Edinburgh in 1758, four years before
                    the appearance of Fingal, and a desire on the part of Macpherson to insure a
                    more favourable reception to his subsequent productions, by assigning to them a
                    remote antiquity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>λVhat
                    says Mr Macpherson' himself in his preface to Fingal? “Poetry, like virtue,

                    examined, its plot exhibits the very outlines of Fingal; that the inferiority of
                    The Highlander to Fingal affords no presumption whatsoever that the latter is
                    authentic; and that the Fragments of Gaelic Poetry published at Edinburgh in
                    1760, were produced when his taste and style had been considerably improved. But
                    the most copious and curious source of detection is, according to Mr Laing, the
                    constant imitation of the classics, the Scriptures, and such temporary
                    publications as were then in vogue. The details on this part of the subject
                    admit not of any condensation, and the reader is consequently referred to the
                    Dissertation itself. Some of the supposed imitations are perhaps a little
                    overstrained, and others not very obvious or striking; but the number that is
                    liable to neither objection is so great, and in many cases so apparent, as to be
                    altogether destructive of the notion that Macpherson translated from originals
                    which had been composed by a Celtic bard, who flourished fifteen centuries
                    before the time when his pretended compositions were given to the public. As to
                    the specimens of the original produced by Macpherson, Mr Laing contends that
                    they were translated into Gaelic from the <hi rend="italic">English
                    original</hi> by the translator himself; and, in particular, that the original
                    Gaelic of Malvina’s Dream was produced by the translator at the request of Lord
                    Kames. Lastly, he has shown that, from the very beginning, Macpherson avowed the
                    deceit, and that he ended, as we have already seen, by expressly vindicating and
                    appropriating to himself the poems which he had at first attributed to
                    Ossian.</p>

                    answer to Mr Laing’s masterly Dissertation on the same subject. But in reality
                    it is only a piece of captious controversial writing, deficient in critical
                    ability, displaying neither originality, acuteness, nor research, and as devoid

                    the discussion, to enter the lists even with this powerful antagonist.” It would
                    have been more creditable to Dr Graham, however, if he had not prefaced his
                    entry into the lists, as he calls it, by a most unpardonable misrepresentation.
                    In the Report of the Committee, there is not one word from which it can, by any
                    violence of construction, be inferred that they were guilty of the ridiculous
                    folly and presumption here ascribed to them. They very properly “wished
                    sedulously to avoid anything like controversy, desirous rather of procuring <hi

                    abundant proofs of the respect and deference which they showed for the views and
                    opinions of that distinguished person. Compare with this disingenuous

                    been published, and probably never will, because, if they were, their
                    authenticity would be fully as liable to challenge or dispute as the
                    translations which Macpherson professed to have made from them. The demand made
                    by Dr Johnson and others was in itself most reasonable; and the refusal to
                    produce evidence, merely because men doubted in a case where there was great
                    room for incredulity, is either a proof that none whatever existed, or an
                    instance, of perversity unexampled in the history of literary controversy.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“I suppose my opinion of the
                    poems of Ossian,” says Johnson, “is already discovered. I believe they never
                    existed in any other form than that which we have seen. The editor or author
                    never could show the original, nor can it be shown by any other: to revenge
                    reasonable incredulity by refusing evidence, is a degree of insolence with which
                    the world is not yet acquainted; and stubborn audacity is the last refuge of
                    guilt. It would be easy to show it if he had it; but whence could it be had? It
                    is too long to be remembered, and the language formerly had nothing written. He
                    has doubtless inserted names that circulate in popular stories, and may have
                    translated some wandering ballads, if any can be found; and the names and some
                    of the images being recollected, make an inaccurate auditor imagine that he has
                    formerly heard the whole.” <hi rend="italic">{Journey to the Western
                    Islands,</hi> pp. 273, 274, London, 1774.) Bishop Warburton expresses a similar
                    opinion. “Several fragments in these poems have been heard by living witnesses,
                    sung to the harp both in the Highlands and in Ireland. My solution of the
                    diffièulty is, that on these and from these fragments the forgery has been
                    erected.” “You will say,” he adds, “it is a work infinitely above one of those
                    <hi rend="italic">tame cheaters</hi> we call a sophist. I do not know how it is,
                    but mimicry is a species of poetic imitation so different from the true, that we
                    have seen excellent copies in painting from originals of great masters, by those
                    whose own designs were all sign-post daubings. The most celebrated mimics on the
                    stage, as Eastcourt and Foote, were the most miserable actors; and, to come a
                    little nearer, the book written by Burke against civil society, under the name
                    and character of Bolingbroke, is far superior to any other of his compositions.”

                <p>II. But if Blair, in his elaborate and rhetorical Dissertation, had done little
                    or nothing to remove the doubts which from the first were entertained as to the
                    authenticity. of the poems ascribed to Ossian, incredulity gained still greater
                    confidence from the formidable and systematic onset of Mr Laing. In the third
                    volume of his History of Scotland, that gentleman, in treating of the
                    Highlanders, had adverted to the state of society and manners represented in
                    these poems, as existing amongst that people, about the end of the second or
                    commencement of the third century, and had thence deduced an argument against
                    the authenticity of productions displaying a refinement and cultivation of
                    sentiment inconsistent with all history and experience. “The productions of the
                    Celtic muse,” said he, “would persuade us to believe that the early manners of
                    the Highlanders displayed a civilization inconsistent with an utter ignorance of
                    the arts of life; an uniform heroism unknown to barbarians; a gallantry which
                    chivalry never inspired; a humanity which refinement has never equalled; and
                    that before their advance to the shepherd state, they possessed a correct taste,
                    a polished diction, a cultivated and sublime poetry, enriched with the choicest
                    images of classical antiquity, and intermixed with all the sentimental
                    affectation of the present times. Their history contains no marks of primeval
                    refinemetìt, unless we can persuade ourselves that their descendants, as soon as
                    they approached observation, degenerated on emerging from the savage state, and
                    became more barbarous in proportion as they became more civilized.”</p>
                <p>The improbability of such an inversion of the ordinary law of human society is
                    sufficiently apparent. But Mr Laing, not content with urging this argument,
                    which he held to be “unanswerable,” annexed to the fourth volume of his history
                    a “Dissertation bn the supposed Authenticity of Ossian’s Poems,” in which he has
                    reduced his numerous detections, historical and critical, under a few general
                    heads, “and endeavoured,” as he says, “to disabuse his countrymen, and to put an
                    end, if possible, to the controversy and deception for ever.” These heads are,
                    the Roman History of Britain, the Middle Ages, Tradition, the Customs and
                    Manners of the Times, the Real Origin of the Poems, Imitations of the ancient
                    and modern Poets, the pretended</p>
                <p>Originals, and Macpherson’s avowal of the whole imposture; thus embracing the
                    whole question in all its bearings and details. In such an article as the
                    present, it is of course impossible to enter into a subject branching out into
                    so many divisions; or even to attempt giving an abstract of the various
                    arguments which have been urged by Mr Laing in attempting to disprove the
                    authenticity of the poems ascribed to Ossian. We shall therefore content
                    ourselves with indicating a few of the leading points, leaving those who take an
                    interest in the controversy, of desire further information, to consult the
                    Dissertation itself.</p>
                <p>On the first branch of his subject, Mr Laing contends that, as the Highlanders
                    originated from Ireland, and as their arrival from that country is established
                    by the concurrence of every Scottish and Irish historian, whether their first
                    migration is placed in 258 under Cairbar Riada, or postponed until 503, when
                    they were restored by Fergus MacErth and his brother Loam, there was not a
                    Highlander in Scotland of the present race at the beginning of the era which is
                    assigned to Fingal by Macpherson. He next shows, that by connecting his poems
                    with Roman history, Macpherson has fallen into the most ridiculous mistakes.
                    Gibbon had previously remarked the absurdity of making the Highland bard
                    describe the son of Severus “by a nickname invented four years afterwards,
                    scarcely used by the Romans till after the death of that emperor, and seldom
                    employed by the most ancient historians;”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    to Carausius, who is represented as the contemporary and successor of that
                    emperor. The most noted or classical places in Scotland are also, by a dexterous
                    anticipation, appropriated to Ossian, as Carron, Glencoen or Cona, and Dumbarton
                    the Alcuith of Bede. The name of Balclutha Mr Laing considers as fictitious; and
                    in Fingal’s intercourse with other nations he discovers the same minute yet
                    conclusive anachronisms. The invasions from Lochlin, a name unknown until the
                    ninth century, are also, according to Mr Laing, equally fabulous with the
                    pretended exploits of Fingal against the Romans. The detections resulting from a
                    comparison of the incidents mentioned in these poems with the history of the
                    middle ages are not less important. They relate chiefly to Magnus, surnamed
                    Barefoot; Cathulâ or Ketil, the friend of Fingal; Carrick-Thura, the palace of
                    the king of Innistore; and the circle of Loda.</p>
                <p>But one of the strongest points of Mr Laing’s argument is that which has for its
                    object to disprove that poems of such length could have been preserved entire,
                    for upwards of fifteen hundred years, by means of oral tradition alone. “It is
                    indeed strange,” says Hume, in a letter to Gibbon, “that any man of sense could
                    have imagined it possible, that above twenty thousand verses, along with
                    numberless historical facts, could have been preserved by oral tradition, during
                    fifty generations, by the rudest, perhaps, of all the civilized nations, the
                    most necessitous, the most turbulent, and the most unsettled. Where a
                    supposition<pb break="no" facs="nls:194565485" xml:id="kp-eb0716-5485-0663"/> is
                    so contrary to common sense, any positive evidence of it ought never to be
                    regarded. Men run with great avidity to give their evidence in favour of what
                    flatters their passions and their national prejudices.” The consideration of the
                    mutability of language also supplies an argument which cannot easily be
                    obviated. This is counteracted only by letters and by the art of printing; but
                    an unwritten language naturally diverges into different dialects, and in every
                    age assumes a new form, although the radical structure may remain. If these
                    poems, then, are alleged to have been preserved by oral tradition, in an
                    obsolete diction, that is, in a dialect disused by the people, this alone is
                    sufficient to confute their authenticity. But if it be maintained that the
                    language has remained invariably the same since the end of the second or
                    beginning of the third century, this is contrary to the experience of all
                    nations, and, besides, is disproved by the difference of the Gaelic from the
                    parent Irish, a page of which a few centuries old is confessedly unintelligible
                    to the people of the present day. Nor has the difficulty been in any degree
                    removed by the numerous attestations which have, at different times, been
                    obtained. No sooner were the translations published, than the traditionary
                    existence of the poems disappeared. When Dr Johnson visited the Western Isles,
                    the natives had nothing to communicate that deserved attention; and his
                    assertion that there was not a Gaelic manuscript above a century old still
                    remains undisproved by the publication of any such document. In proof that the
                    Highlanders were neither rude and illiterate, nor the Gaelic an unwritten
                    language, in the time of Ossian, it has been alleged that the Druids, when
                    expelled from Scotland, retired to Iona, where they established a college, and
                    lived and taught unmolested till the sixth century, when they were dispossessed
                    by St Columba. But, according to Mr Laing, there is no evidence, nothing indeed
                    but conjecture, that the Druids ever existed in Ireland; and the fact appears to
                    be certain, that there never was a Druid in Scotland, otherwise Tacitus, who
                    describes the destruction of their order in England, would most probably have
                    remarked their influence or existence under Galgacus in the Caledonian war. “The
                    man,” he adds, “who can thus create an historical fact, requires nothing but
                    genius to fabricate an epic poem.” Finally, if manuscripts be appealed to, “let
                    a single book of Fingal in manuscript, such as translated by Macpherson, of an
                    older date than a century, be produced and lodged in a public library, and there
                    is an end of the dispute.”</p>
                <p>Mr Laing then proceeds to show that the contradiction is not greater between the
                    primeval refinement ascribed to the Highlanders, and their recent barbarism,
                    than between their real manners at the period of Fingal and those described in
                    the poems of Ossian. He alleges that reli gion was avoided as a dangerous topic,
                    which led to detection; that, from the difficulty of inventing a religious
                    mythology, Macpherson has created a savage society of refined atheists, who
                    believe in ghosts, but not in deities; and that, solicitous only for proper
                    machinery, he has rendered the Highlanders a race of unparalleled infidels, who
                    believed in no gods but the ghosts of their fathers. And the same difficulty, he
                    adds, occurred in the adaptation of circumstances, peculiar customs, or rites,
                    to the supposed state of society; points on which Macpherson has laid himself
                    open to suspicion or detection. Mr Laing next traces the origin of the poems
                    ascribed to Ossian, which he ascribed to the failure of Macpherson’s avowed
                    poem, entitled The Highlander, published at Edinburgh in 1758, four years before
                    the appearance of Fingal, and a desire on the part of Macpherson to insure a
                    more favourable reception to his subsequent productions, by assigning to them a
                    remote antiquity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>What
                    says Mr Macpherson' himself in his preface to Fingal? “Poetry, like virtue,

                    pursued in vain, when living, is often bestowed upon them when they are not
                    sensible of it. This neglect of <hi rend="italic">living authors</hi> is not
                    altogether to be attributed to that reluctance which men show <hi rend="italic"
                    >in praising and rewarding genius.</hi> It often appears that the man <hi

                    in common life. His foibles, however, are obliterated by death, and his better
                    part, <hi rend="italic">his writings,</hi> remain: his character is formed from
                    them; and he that was <hi rend="italic">no extraordinary man</hi> in his own
                    time, becomes the <hi rend="italic">wonder of succeeding ages.</hi> From this
                    source proceeds our veneration for the dead. Their virtues remain, but the vices
                    which were once blended with their virtues have died with themselves. <hi
                    rend="italic">This consideration might induce a man, diffident of his abilities,
                    to ascribe his own compositions to a person whose remote antiquity, and whose
                    situation when alive, might well answer for faults which would be inexcusable in
                    a writer of this age."</hi></p></note> He shows, that when The Highlander is
                    examined, its plot exhibits the very outlines of Fingal; that the inferiority of
                    The Highlander to Fingal affords no presumption whatsoever that the latter is
                    authentic; and that the Fragments of Gaelic Poetry published at Edinburgh in
                    1760, were produced when his taste and style had been considerably improved. But
                    the most copious and curious source of detection is, according to Mr Laing, the
                    constant imitation of the classics, the Scriptures, and such temporary
                    publications as were then in vogue. The details on this part of the subject
                    admit not of any condensation, and the reader is consequently referred to the
                    Dissertation itself. Some of the supposed imitations are perhaps a little
                    overstrained, and others not very obvious or striking; but the number that is
                    liable to neither objection is so great, and in many cases so apparent, as to be
                    altogether destructive of the notion that Macpherson translated from originals
                    which had been composed by a Celtic bard, who flourished fifteen centuries
                    before the time when his pretended compositions were given to the public. As to
                    the specimens of the original produced by Macpherson, Mr Laing contends that
                    they were translated into Gaelic from the <hi rend="italic">English
                    original</hi> by the translator himself; and, in particular, that the original
                    Gaelic of Malvina’s Dream was produced by the translator at the request of Lord
                    Kames. Lastly, he has shown that, from the very beginning, Macpherson avowed the
                    deceit, and that he ended, as we have already seen, by expressly vindicating and
                    appropriating to himself the poems which he had at first attributed to
                    Ossian.</p>
                <p>Dr Graham’s Essay on the Authenticity of the Poems of Ossian professes to be an
                    answer to Mr Laing’s masterly Dissertation on the same subject. But in reality
                    it is only a piece of captious controversial writing, deficient in critical
                    ability, displaying neither originality, acuteness, nor research, and as devoid
                    of candour and fairness<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Dr Graham, in the Introduction to his Essay, has taken occasion to remark,
                    “that though the Committee of the Highland Society of Scotland has, <hi

                    has little to lose, and who may have the good fortune to gain some advantage in
                    the discussion, to enter the lists even with this powerful antagonist.” It would
                    have been more creditable to Dr Graham, however, if he had not prefaced his
                    entry into the lists, as he calls it, by a most unpardonable misrepresentation.
                    In the Report of the Committee, there is not one word from which it can, by any
                    violence of construction, be inferred that they were guilty of the ridiculous
                    folly and presumption here ascribed to them. They very properly “wished
                    sedulously to avoid anything like controversy, desirous rather of procuring <hi
                    rend="italic">evidence and information,</hi> than of <hi rend="italic">drawing
                    inferences</hi> from them and, so far from their Report embodying any expression
                    which could justify the strange assertion that they “considered it as beneath
                    their dignity to <hi rend="italic">stoop</hi> to the refutation of Mr Laing’s
                    arguments,” which was no part of the plan upon which they proceeded, it contains
                    abundant proofs of the respect and deference which they showed for the views and
                    opinions of that distinguished person. Compare with this disingenuous
                    allegation, the honest valedictory appeal of the ac <pb break="no" n="664"

                    ingenuity or talent. At the outset, Dr Graham seems disposed to throw James
                    Macpherson overboard. “I speak only of the poems,” says he; “of Macpherson’s
                    dreams I make no account.” But, unfortunately, the one can never be separated
                    from the other. The question is not as to the existence of detached poems,
                    songs, or “wandering ballads,” which nobody has disputed; but whether it is
                    possible now to produce the originals of Fingal, Temora, and other poems, of
                    which Mr Macpherson has given what he calls translations, and at the same time
                    to establish the authenticity of these originals. Until this be done, or until
                    some ancient manuscript of these poems shall have been published, all the
                    arguments employed by Mr Laing will remain in full force and unshaken. It is no
                    doubt true that Dr Blair has pronounced Ossian superior to Virgil, and that the
                    Italian translator, Cesarotti, who implicitly adopted his opinion, has re-echoed
                    the same extraordinary sentiment. This, however, is matter of taste alone; and
                    as Dr Blair’s Dissertation left the real question at issue exactly where the
                    ingenious author found it, the same thing may, without any discourtesy, be
                    affirmed of Dr Graham’s Essay. The attempts made, in the latter work, to answer
                    Mr Laing’s arguments in detail, have signally failed in the object contemplated,
                    particularly in all questions of a purely historical kind. In proof of this we
                    need only refer to his confused notions respecting the origin of the
                    Caledonians; the absurdities in which he has involved himself from not
                    understanding the statements of Bede, upon which he professes to ground part of
                    his refutation of Laing; and especially the extraordinary notion, contradicted
                    by all history, that Ireland derived its Celtic population from Scotland. In
                    grasping at straws, he also betrays a consciousness of the weakness of his
                    cause, or the difficulty of the side which he has undertaken to defend. It may
                    be true, as he alleges, and as several persons have testified, that Macpherson
                    was not at first very profoundly skilled in the Gaelic language; but it is to be
                    observed that this was his vernacular tongue, and that, at all events, he had
                    the assistance of persons whose knowledge of the Highland dialect has never, as
                    far as we know, been questioned or disputed.</p>
                <p>But Dr Graham, when at a loss to resolve difficulties by an appeal to facts, has
                    always a theory at hand to help him. The transmission of the poems of Ossian, by
                    oral tradition, through a period of more than fifteen centuries, is acknowledged
                    to be “a phenomenon of which we have no example in the history of literature.”
                    Yet we are desired to receive with undoubting faith this unparalleled anomaly;
                    first, because, from the time in which these poems were composed till that in
                    which “they were collected and translated by Macpherson, the Caledonians or
                    Highlanders remained unconquered; and, secondly, because, in consequence of this
                    permanency of political situation, their language remained unaltered, and
                    unmixed with any foreign idiom.” In this last point, however, Dr Graham
                    contradicts himself, and makes an admission which appears of itself to be fatal
                    to his theory. After informing his readers that the poems ascribed to Ossian
                    “bear throughout the stamp of antiquity,” he adds, “that <hi rend="italic">some
                    foreign,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">even some modern terms,</hi> sometimes occur
                    ;” but that “still the Gaelic idiom is maintained, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >purity</hi> of its structure preserved inviolate.” Nor is his reference to the
                    supposed history of the poems of Homer, as a case in point respecting the
                    alleged oral transmission of those ascribed to Ossian, much more fortunate than
                    his theory of the immutable permanency and purity of the Gaelic language. For
                    every scholar who has read Wolf’s <hi rend="italic">Prolegomena ad Eomerum</hi>
                    must be aware that this is neither more nor less than citing what is doubtful or
                    improbable, in one case, to support what is at least equally doubtful or
                    improbable in another. And as to the wonderfully retentive memory ascribed to
                    the old Highlanders, it may be sufficient to observe, that this new theoretical
                    element cannot be admitted upon a mere assumption without proof, and contrary to
                    all experience or probability. Lastly, Dr Graham, anxious to dispose of the
                    whole question at once, furnishes us with what he calls “a very obvious
                    criterion of originality.” “Mr James Macpherson,” says he, “was brought up in
                    the bosom of polished society; his mind was enriched with the stores of ancient
                    and modern literature; he was familiarized, from an early period of life, to the
                    modes of acting, and thinking, and expressing himself, which characterize the
                    scholar of the present times. That a person of such education, and of such
                    habits of thinking, should so completely divest himself of all his previous
                    acquisitions in literature, and science, and of every idea rendered familiar to
                    him by long use; and that he should be able to write with uniform consistency,
                    in the character of a person who is supposed to have lived fourteen hundred
                    years ago, and in a state of society so different from the present order of
                    things; in short, that a modern European should produce such a work as the
                    poetry of Ossian, distinguished exclusively by the ideas peculiar to people in
                    the most simple state of society,— all these, I confess, I must consider as <hi
                    rend="italic">efforts beyond the reach of humanityT</hi> We are not prepared to
                    admit that the real case is here fairly stated, or that Macpherson has preserved
                    the uniform consistency which Dr Graham has gratuitously ascribed to him; indeed
                    Mr Laing has shown that, in numerous cases, the very reverse is the fact. But
                    supposing that the doctor were correct to the letter in his statement of the
                    question, it follows that Chatterton achieved an “effort beyond the reach of
                    humanity,” by the composition of the poems he ascribed to Rowley, which are
                    entirely divested of every allusion to the modes and manners of the time when
                    they were written, whilst the language is almost as faultlessly antique as that
                    of the era to which the ingenious and unfortunate author chose to assign
                    them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The <hi
                    rend="italic">Gil Blas</hi> of Le Sage is another instance in point. Though
                    written by a Frenchman, it is, in sentiment, feeling, manners, and habits of
                    thought and expression, as completely <hi rend="italic">Spanish,</hi> as if it
                    had been the production of Cervantes himself</p></note></p>
                <p>III. We come now to the Report of the Committee of the Highland Society, which,
                    as a sort of judicial document, is particularly deserving of attention. The
                    Committee in question was appointed for the express purpose of collecting all
                    the evidence and information which could be obtained on the subject; and with
                    this view it began by circulating a set of queries, embracing the principal
                    points which had been brought into dispute in the controversy respecting the
                    authenticity of the poems ascribed to Ossian. Its declared object was sedulously
                    to avoid all controversy on the subject, and rather to collect materials from
                    which a judgment might be formed respecting the question at issue, than to
                    attempt to pronounce any formal decision of its own. In this spirit the Report
                    was drawn up by Mr Henry Mackenzie, the chairman; and although there is a
                    manifest and not unnatural bias in favour of the Celtic bard, yet, upon the
                    whole, it displays a candour, fairness, and impartiality which, on a subject
                    where national prejudices had been strongly excited, cannot be too highly
                    commended. It only remains for us, therefore, to lay before our readers the
                    results of this patient and laborious investigation, as these have been stated
                    in the Report itself, and to leave them to form their own judgment.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194565511" xml:id="kp-eb0716-5511-0665"/>
                <p>Before proceeding, however, to submit to the Society the general conclusions at
                    which they had arrived, the Committee felt themselves called upon to take notice
                    “of some difficulties in this investigation, which have struck, and must strike,
                    every impartial person at all acquainted with the subject, and Conversant at the
                    same time with the history of nations, and the progress of society.” 1. The
                    first of these is the circumstance of the language, in poems for which such a
                    high antiquity is claimed, being so nearly what it still is, in the common use
                    and understanding of the country. This has always been considered as a fatal
                    objection; and, as we have already seen, it is forcibly urged by Mr Laing, who
                    contends, that if the language had been ancient or obsolete, the poems could not
                    have been preserved, and that the circumstance of its being modern is a proof
                    that the poems could not be ancient. The Committee, however, suggest that
                    “perhaps the situation of the Highlands and Islands, where this poetry has been
                    preserved, and the little communication they had with other countries, may <hi
                    rend="italic">in some measure</hi> account for this circumstance.” 2. Another
                    preliminary difficulty adverted to is, that any human memory should have been
                    able to retain poems of such length, and so numerous, as some of those
                    Highlanders, from whose oral recitation the collectors of such poems professed
                    to obtain them, are said to have repeated. The solution offered by the Committee
                    is the common one, that “the power of memory in persons accustomed from their
                    infancy to such repetitions, and who are unable to assist or injure it by
                    writing, must not be judged of by any ideas or any experience possessed by those
                    who have only seen its exertions in ordinary life ;” and that “instances of such
                    miraculous powers of memory” are known in most countries, “where the want of
                    writing, like the want of a sense, gives an almost supernatural force to those
                    by which that privation is supplied.” 3.Athird difficulty, which has always
                    appeared to intelligent inquirers the hardest to be surmounted in this matter,
                    is the style of manners and of sentiment exhibited in the poems ascribed to
                    Ossian. The Committee reply, that in all the ancient Celtic poetry, a
                    distinction is made between the Fingalian race and their invaders or enemies,
                    the former assuming a degree of generosity, compassion, and delicate attention
                    to the female sex, which is denied to the latter; and, besides, that some
                    allowance ought to be made “for the colouring of poetry on the manners and
                    sentiments of the heroic persons of whom it speaks.” The real difficulty,
                    however,, is to explain how any poet living amidst barbarism, violence, and
                    anarchy, could have conceived or imagined a style of manners and sentiment so
                    different from all that he could ever have known or observed, and drawn such
                    pictures of generosity, compassion, and gallantry, as are to be found in the
                    poems of Ossian.</p>
                <p>Having disposed of these preliminary difficulties, the Committee proceed to
                    report, that there are two questions to which it has directed its attention, and
                    on which it now submits the best evidence it has been able to procure. These
                    are, 1st, What poetry, of what kind, and of what degree of excellence, existed
                    anciently in the Highlands of Scotland, and was generally known by the
                    denomination of <hi rend="italic">Ossianic,</hi> from the universal belief that
                    its father and principal composer was Ossian the son of Fingal? And, 2d, How far
                    that collection of such poetry published by Mr James Macpherson is genuine?</p>
                <p>In answer to the first of these questions, the Committee states with confidence
                    an opinion “that such poetry did exist; that it was common, general, and in
                    great abundance; that it was of a most impressive and striking sort, in a high
                    degree eloquent, tender, and sublime.” The second question, however, the
                    Committee found it “much more difficult to answer decisively.” It was possessed
                    of no documents to show how much of his collection Mr Macpherson had obtained in
                    the form in which he gave it to the world. The poems and fragments of poems they
                    had been able to procure contained often the substance, and sometimes almost the
                    literal expression, of <hi rend="italic">passages</hi> given by Mr Macpherson in
                    the poems of which he published translations. « But the Committee has not been
                    able to obtain <hi rend="italic">any one poem the same in title and tenor</hi>
                    with the poems published by him. It is inclined to believe that <hi
                    rend="italic">he was in use to supply chasms, and to give connection by
                    inserting passages which he did not find, and to add what he conceived to be
                    dignity and delicacy to the original, by striking out passages, by softening
                    incidents, by refining the language,</hi> in short, by <hi rend="italic"
                    >changing</hi> what he considered as too simple or too rude for a modern ear,
                    and <hi rend="italic">elevating</hi> what in his opinioh was below the standard
                    of good poetry. To what degree, however, he exercised these <hi rend="italic"
                    >liberties,</hi> it is impossible for the Committee to determine.” Such is the
                    deliberate judgment pronounced in the report; a judgment, we may observe, which
                    disposes of the whole matter in dispute, by establishing the important feet,
                    that there could exist no originals, in the proper sense of the term, from which
                    Macpherson’s <hi rend="italic">translations,</hi> manufactured as they are here
                    admitted to have been, could possibly have been derived. That he availed himself
                    largely of the traditionary poems and ballads which formerly circulated in the
                    Highlands, as in most other countries similarly situated, no one has ever denied
                    or disputed. This, indeed, has been the opinion even of those who most
                    strenuously contended thathis pretended translations, taken as a whole, were
                    spurious. But that there ever existed in the Gaelic language such long and
                    connected poems as those of <hi rend="italic">Fingal</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Temora,</hi> seems to be now definitively decided in the negative. The Report
                    concludes by stating, that the Committee “encountered many more difficulties,
                    and was obliged to bestow more labour, than it was at all aware of when it
                    undertook the investigation committed to it by the Society ;” and it adds, that
                    this labour “has, after all, <hi rend="italic">effected its purpose in a very
                    imperfect manner</hi> meaning, no doubt, in as far as regards the object
                    originally contemplated, of establishing the authenticity of the poems ascribed
                    to Ossian. In this “purpose,” indeed, if such was entertained, it has entirely
                    failed; but, on the other hand, it evinced perfect candour and impartiality in
                    its researches, and acted throughout with a jealousy and circumspection which it
                    rightly conceived to be due to itself, to the Society, and to truth.</p>
                <p>IV. In order to render our view of this subject as complete as possible, it only
                    remains to notice two other collectors of Gaelic poetry; namely, Mr Duncan
                    Kennedy, and Dr Smith of Campbelton.</p>
                <p>Mr Kennedy, originally a schoolmaster in Argyleshire, and afterwards an
                    accountant in Glasgow, appears to have begun to collect Gaelic poetry somewhat
                    prior to the year 1780; and his collection, consisting of three thin folio
                    volumes in manuscript, having been purchased by the Highland Society of
                    Scotland, is now in the possession of that body. Dr Graham, the author of the
                    Essay already mentioned, having opened a correspondence with Mr Kennedy, called
                    his particular attention to a passage in one of Dr Smith’s letters to Mr Henry
                    Mackenzie, in which the reverend gentleman states, that, on observing the beauty
                    of one or two passages of some poems communicated to him by Kennedy, the latter
                    said, <hi rend="italic">these were of his own composition</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and after stating to Kennedy how much it concerned his honour to take
                    notice of this charge, Dr Graham invited him “to come forward, and make a fair
                    acknowledgment of the share which he had in the business.” Kennedy, nothing
                    loth, obeyed the call thus made on him; and in his answer to Dr Graham’s
                    application, dated the 25th of October 1805, there is the following
                    extraordinary.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194565524" xml:id="kp-eb0716-5524-0666"/>
                <p>and, we may add, instructive passage: “As the rage of both parties must soon
                    subside, a fair division of property ought to take place, and poetical justice
                    [to be] distributed between Ossian and the fabricators. It will, therefore, be
                    admitted, at least by me, that Macpherson <hi rend="italic">has
                    interpolated</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that Smith <hi rend="italic">has
                    composed</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and that Kennedy, with much reluctance,
                    <hi rend="italic">is forced to confess, that he has ventured to make some
                    verses,</hi> which, perhaps his vanity may deceive him, but he is inclined to
                    think, <hi rend="italic">approach nearest to the genuine strains of Ossian that
                    have yet been produced in the Gaelic language?</hi> In the same communication he
                    declares that he composed about a sixth or seventh part of what is contained in
                    the manuscripts purchased by the Highland Society; that the Death of Carril is
                    entirely his own; that most of Bas Ossian he also claims; that considerable
                    portions of the Death of Diarmid, Goll, Os-cair, Garbh, Latha na Lìur, and other
                    poems in the collection, are of his composition; and that “a good Gaelic
                    scholar, of a good ear, and well acquainted with his imagery, and the
                    qualifications and names of his favourite heroes and professed enemies, <hi
                    rend="italic">may compose verses approximate to the excellence of the original,
                    and which not one in a thousand will be able to distinguish from the real?</hi>
                    strains of Ossian. Here is a full, free, and instructive confession, which,
                    although it excited the indignation and provoked the criticism of Dr Graham,
                    who, no doubt, expected something very different, appears, nevertheless, to be
                    distinguished for its frankness and candour, and which affords a significant
                    hint of that process of manufacture which was pursued by Macpherson in
                    concocting his pretended translations.</p>
                <p>The next, and only other, collector we have to notice is the Rev. Dr John Smith
                    of Campbel ton, who, like Kennedy, performs a secondary part in this
                    extraordinary literary imposture. It appears that Dr Smith had the use of
                    Kennedy’s manuscripts, and that he transcribed from them into his own collection
                    whatever he conceived to possess merit. In the year 1780, Dr Smith gave this
                    collection to the public in a translation; and, seven years afterwards, he
                    published the <hi rend="italic">originals,</hi> in an octavo volume, under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Scandana.</hi> Kennedy, however, in his letter to Dr
                    Graham, distinctly states that Dr Smith “<hi rend="italic">composed?</hi> or, in
                    other words, fabricated originals; and as he has frankly acknowledged the share
                    which he had in the fabrication of his own collection, the charge would carry
                    considerable weight, even if it were not indirectly admitted by Dr Smith
                    himself, which, as we shall presently see, is the case. Dr Graham, who appears
                    to have been most unfortunate in the sources to which he applied for
                    corroborative evidence, addressed a letter to Dr Smith, dated the 24th of March
                    1806, stating to him the confessions of Kennedy, including the charge of
                    fabrication against Smith himself, and requesting that he would point out the
                    manner in which he might be effectually vindicated from so disgraceful an
                    imputation. Dr Smith, however, being less sensitive on this point than his
                    correspondent, took the matter very calmly, and abandoned all his publications
                    to their fate with the most stoical indifference. “On the subject of your
                    letter,” says the reverend gentleman, in reply, “I have long ago said all I have
                    to say, and <hi rend="italic">take no further concern in the question.</hi> If
                    any allege he passed on me as ancient poetry what was his own composition, <hi
                    rend="italic">I have no interest in disputing his allegation.</hi> If I had, I
                    would try if he could write such verses as he claims (no doubt the best) on any
                    other given subject; and examine whether these passages were not <hi
                    rend="italic">by a dozen or score of other contributors.</hi> Unfortunately for
                    me, not only one, but every contributor, dead or alive, must renounce his right,
                    before I can take the merit of a verse or line, if vanity do not prompt me to
                    take the contribution of such as are dead, and unable to dispute my claim. But
                    this, I think, I shall leave to others; and if they claim the translation as
                    well as the original, I will not dispute it, nor care who may believe and who
                    may doubt it. The stopping of my plough by a shower of rain coming on gives me
                    more concern than either.” This is, perhaps, the most extraordinary answer that
                    ever was made to a charge of literary imposture. Dr Graham says, “it will be
                    found replete with good sense;” but, for our part, we discover in it merely a
                    studied evasion of the important question, to which it so much concerned Dr
                    Smith to give a distinct and unequivocal answer. It is some consolation,
                    however, to find, that the strange proceedings in which this gentleman appears
                    to have been engaged, were not, like those of Macpherson, productive of profit.
                    The eyes of the public had already been opened; and, from one of Dr Smith’s
                    letters to Mr Mackenzie, we learn that <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >l</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">ιe profits</hi> of his
                    publication were only a serious <hi rend="italic">loss?</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> a circumstance which affected him so sensibly, that he adds, “I could
                    never since think of Gaelic poetry with pleasure or with patience, <hi
                    rend="italic">except to wish it had been dead before I was born.”</hi></p>
                <p>We have thus placed before our readers as complete and comprehensive a view of
                    this famous controversy as our limits would possibly permit. The subject has no
                    doubt lost much of its original attraction; indeed public opinion appears to
                    have gradually settled down into a decided conviction, that the poems of Ossian,
                    as they appear in the pretended translations of Macpherson, are substantially a
                    forgery. But the controversy as to their authenticity or spuriousness, which was
                    for a considerable time carried on with so much acrimony, forms a curious
                    chapter in the literary history of Scotland; and, for this reason alone, we have
                    endeavoured to exhibit a condensed view of the origin, the progress, and, we may
                    add, the termination, of the dispute, at the same time furnishing such
                    collateral information as seemed calculated to throw light upon the principal
                    question agitated by the advocatesand opponents of the Ossianic hypothesis. <hi
