                <p><label type="entry">OXFORD</label>, the capital of the English county of the same
                    name, is situated at the junction of the river Cherwell with the Isis, which
                    about eight miles lower down receives the waters of the Thame, and then becomes
                    the Thames, a contraction of Thame-Isis. It is fifty-five miles from London by
                    the High Wycombe road, and fifty-eight by Henley. It is pleasantly situated on
                    ground rising gently from the rivers which almost surround it, and its immediate
                    vicinity smiles with fertile and verdant meadows; beyond which, on the east,
                    south, and west sides, it is bounded by an amphitheatre of hills, and on the
                    north the view is extended over a rich district in the highest state of
                    cultivation. The air is pure and salubrious; and from the neighbouring heights,
                    the city, with its spires, and domes, and towers, presents an impressive
                    spectacle of all that is lovely in nature, magnificent in art, and sacred in
                    antiquity.</p>
                <p>The locality of Oxford is favourable for intercourse with the whole of the
                    kingdom. It is nearly in the centre of England; and good lines of road pass
                    through it from almost every quarter. Its vicinity supplies most of the first
                    necessaries of life with facility; and though formerly the enormous price of
                    fuel was the subject of serious complaint, that evil has been remedied by a
                    canal which joins the Grand Junction Canal at Braunston, in Northamptonshire,
                    and has proved a great advantage to the city, by conveying the coals of
                    Staffordshire at a cheap rate, whilst the capital expended in the undertaking
                    has become a very lucrative investment to those who embarked money in the
                    project. Besides the canal, Oxford has water communication by the river Thames
                    with both sides of the kingdom. The Thames and Severn Canal unites these two
                    rivers through the Stroud Canal, and thus goods may be conveyed downwards to
                    Oxford from Bristol, Gloucester, Worcester, and Birmingham, and upwards from the
                    mouth of the Thames near the metropolis of the empire.</p>
                <p>The city, properly so called, was formerly surrounded by walls, considerable
                    portions of which still remain. It is of an oval form, and about two miles in
                    circumference. The municipal limits, which are now made co-extensive with the
                    parliamentary boundary, comprehends the whole or part of twenty parishes, the
                    extreme extent of the borough each way being now about three miles. Four
                    principal streets, broad and well built, cross each other at the centre; but the
                    communications between these streets are rather narrow. The High Street is
                    generally admired, as well for its length as for the number and the magnificence
                    of the buildings on both sides of it; the effect of which is much heightened by
                    its curvature, which at every advance opens up new views of architectural
                    grandeur. In this street is the entrance to the market, which is well stored
                    with provisions of every kind, equal in quality to any in the kingdom. The
                    townhall is a fine building, serving the purpose which its name expresses, as
                    well as that of a county-hall; and the assizes, the county-sessions, the
                    election for city and county members, as well as public meetings, are held in
                    it. It was built in 1754, at the expense of Mr Rowney, then member for the city;
                    but has been since considerably improved by the united funds of the county and
                    the city. It is one hundred and thirty-five feet in length by thirty-two feet in
                    breadth, and is the apartment in which, in the year 1814, the freedom of the
                    city was presented to George IV., the emperor of Russia, the king of Prussia,
                    and many other distinguished personages. Adjoining to this edifice is the
                    council-chamber, for meetings of the city council, which is adorned with
                    portraits of eminent persons and benefactors. The corporation now consists of a
                    mayor, ten aidermen, and thirty councillors, with a recorder, and justices of
                    the peace appointed by the crown. The city returns two members to the House of
                    Commons. These, before the Reform Act, were elected by the freemen; but the
                    ten-pound householders are now added to them. Oxford is a county of itself. The
                    county-jail, a large building, was erected upon the site of the ancient castle
                    about thirty years ago; but, besides the county-jail, there is a city prison and
                    a bridewell. The remains of the original tower of the fortress, and a large
                    magazine for storing provisions for the garrison, are still preserved.</p>

                <p>Some have pretended to trace the origin of Oxford to remote antiquity; but their
                    speculations can only be looked upon as fanciful conjectures. No credit can be
                    given to any statement respecting it previous to the reign of Alfred. In 727, a
                    monastery was founded at Oxford, or, as it was originally called, Oxenford,
                    dedicated to the Holy Trinity. The habitations of the laity attracted to the
                    neighbourhood were probably the origin of the town; and as the clergy, previous
                    to the Conquest, were the sole depositories of learning, and the only teachers
                    to whom the people could look for instruction, and as every monastery became
                    more or less a kind of school, it is not improbable that the educational
                    department of the monastery was the germ of the University of Oxford.</p>
                <p>In the course of thirty years, between 979 and 1009, the town was thrice consumed
                    by fire; and during the contests between the Danes and Saxons, it often suffered
                    severely. It was the occasional residence of King Edmund, surnamed Ironside, who
                    was murdered there; of Canute the Great, who repeatedly held parliaments in it;
                    and of Harold, surnamed Harefoot, who was crowned and died in Oxford.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants having refused to open their gates to William the Conqueror, he
                    obtained entrance by force, and levied a heavy tax on the townsmen as a
                    punishment for their resistance; and the better to restrain their rebellious
                    spirit, he built and fortified a strong castle on the west side of the town,
                    near the river.</p>
                <p>The successors of the Conqueror frequently made Oxford the place of their
                    residence, and several of them were munificent patrons of its schools. In the
                    contest between King Stephen and the Empress Maud, the latter, having taken
                    shelter in the castle, was besieged in it by the king in person, and only
                    escaped by stratagem the day before it surrendered.</p>
                <p>In 1177, the princes and chief lords of Wales did homage here for their
                    territories and estates to Henry II. This monarch resided, during a great part
                    of his reign, in the palace of Beaumont, which was built in the north suburbs by
                    Henry I. In this palace Richard Coeur-deLion was born; and here King John passed
                    many of his troubled hours. Richard I. was a great promoter of learning, and
                    gave especial encouragement to Oxford, which was the place of his birth. Many
                    new halls or schools were established under his patronage, and by means of funds
                    furnished from his private exchequer. To such a pitch had he raised the
                    reputation of Oxford, that in the succeeding reign its schools were attended by
                    not less than three thousand students; but in the year 1209 this prosperity was
                    sadly overcast, and the town, as a seat of education, threatened with total
                    destruction. A student, whilst engaged in some manual exercise, accidentally
                    killed a woman belonging to the town, and, being alarmed for the consequences,
                    took to flight. The mayor and burgesses surrounded the hall to which the
                    supposed murderer belonged, and demanded that he should be delivered up. They
                    were informed that the accused student had fled; but this answer by no means
                    appeased the clamours of the multitude, who seized three students, entirely
                    unconnected with the affair, and hanged them without trial or inquiry. The
                    teachers and scholars, justly enraged at this barbarous outrage, unanimously
                    quitted Oxford, and betook themselves to Cambridge and other places; and they
                    did not return till the humbled inhabitants had repeatedly applied for pardon,
                    and expressed the deepest contrition for their conduct.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Henry VIII. Oxford was elevated to the rank of a city, and that
                    of a bishop’s see; and it was at Oxford that Archbishop Cranmer, and Bishops
                    Ridley and Latimer, were executed as heretics, by order of Queen Mary, in
                    October 1555.</p>
                <p>In the year 1577, the plague raged with dreadful mortality in the town. During
                    the trial of a popish bookseller, accused of circulating mischievous pamphlets,
                    nearly all the persons present were suddenly seized with sickness; and within
                    forty hours upwards of three hundred died, amongst whom were the chief baron,
                    the high sheriff, several justices of the peace, and most of the jurors. When
                    the plague broke out in London, King James withdrew to this city for safety; but
                    the dreadful scourge visited Oxford not long afterwards, and made such awful
                    devastation that the scholars fled from the University, and the citizens shut up
                    their shops; and not a living creature, besides nurses and corpse-bearers, was
                    to be seen in the streets, which were covered with grass, even in the
                    market-place.</p>
                <p>During the struggles between Charles I. and his parliament, the king, in
                    consequence of the disaffection of the citizens of London, removed his court to
                    Oxford; being well assured of the loyalty of the townsmen, and the inviolable
                    allegiance of the university. The melancholy winter of the year 1646 was spent
                    by the unfortunate monarch within the walls of Christ-Church; where he assembled
                    a parliament of his diminished and disheartened adherents, and where he wrote
                    his memorable letter to Lord Digby, in which he declared, “‘if I cannot live as
                    a king, I will die as a gentleman.” Though the city was strongly fortified, and
                    considered as a post of great importance by both parties, it never happened,
                    during the war, to be the scene of any great military transaction; but the
                    negotiations for peace between Charles and the republican party were chiefly
                    carried on at Oxford.</p>
                <p>The last parliament which met in this city was convened by Charles II. in 1681,
                    and lasted only seven days. The party spirit and turbulence displayed, not only
                    by the populace, but by the representatives, compelled the king to order its
                    premature dissolution, to prevent the passing of a bill for banishing and
                    excluding from the throne his brother, the Duke of York, afterwards James
                    II.</p>
                <p>Oxford has the transcendent glory of being the cradle of the Reformation.
                    Wickliffe, whose name will be venerated by all who value the truths of
                    Christianity, and the progress of the human mind, was warden of Canterbury
                    College; and it was here that he read those lectures on divinity which shook to
                    its foundation that spiritual despotism which held Europe in thraldom, and here
                    he first inculcated those truths which form the basis of religious liberty.</p>
                <p>The University contains twenty colleges and five halls.</p>
                <p>Merton College, the oldest in point of legal establishment, was founded by Walter
                    de Merton, bishop of Rochester, who established it by charter, dated 7th January
                    1264. It consists of three courts. The chapel, which is situated at the west end
                    of the outer court, is a fine specimen of old English architecture. The tower
                    and gate of the outer court were constructed in the early part of the fifteenth
                    century; and the whole of the other part was rebuilt in 1589. The second, or
                    large inner court, exhibits a mixed style of architecture; the third, or small
                    court, is the oldest, and is supposed to have been built at the same time with
                    the library, which forms its south and west sides. This is the oldest library in
                    the University, and possesses many valuable manuscripts and early printed books.
                    In the hall of this college Queen Elizabeth was entertained at dinner on her
                    visit to the University in 1592.</p>
                <p>University College is said to have owed its origin to King AJfred; but it is
                    ascertained that it was founded by the University, with funds left by William of
                    Durham, in 1249. It stands on the south side of the High Street, and consists of
                    two quadrangular courts, which were built at various times between the years
                    1634 and 1675.</p>
                <p>Baliol College was projected by John de Baliol, father <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194565759" xml:id="kp-eb0716-5759-0684"/>of the unfortunate king of
                    Scotland, in 1263; but, in consequence of his sudden death, it was only founded
                    in 1282, by his widow, Dervorguilla. The architecture is very irregular; none of
                    the present buildings arc of earlier date than the fifteenth, and the east and
                    south-east sides were rebuilt in the beginning of the eighteenth century. The
                    court of the quadrangle is one hundred and twenty feet by eighty; there is also
                    belonging to the college an area on the north-west, containing lodgings for the
                    students, and a new building fronting the street one hundred and eight feet in
                    length.</p>
                <p>Exeter College was founded in 1315, by Walter de Stapleton, bishop of Exeter. It
                    has been built at various times, and forms one extensive quadrangle, nearly a
                    hundred and thirty-five feet square. The architecture of this College is of an
                    uniform and simple character. The whole of the west front has recently been
                    renewed with Bath stone, and a handsome new building erected, facing Broad
                    Street.</p>
                <p>Oriel College was founded in 1326, by Adam de Brom; and shortly after was taken
                    under the protection of Edward II. It consists of a quadrangular range of
                    buildings, with two ranges on the east and west sides of the garden, between
                    which is the library, an elegant modern building, from a design by Wyatt.</p>
                <p>Queen’s College was founded by Robert de Eglesfeld, and obtained a charter from
                    Edward HL, dated the 18th January 1340. The present buildings are of modern
                    erection; they consist of two courts, divided by the hall and chapel, in an
                    oblong form, three hundred feet in length by two hundred and twenty in breadth.
                    The library, which contains about 18,000 volumes, is a magnificent room, a
                    hundred and twenty-three feet by thirty.</p>
                <p>New College. The foundation-stone of this college was laid by William of Wykeham,
                    for his scholars of Winchester College, in the year 1380; but the buildings were
                    not completed till 1386. As originally projected by the founder, they consist of
                    a spacious quadrangle, including the chapel, hall, and library. A range of
                    cloisters, extending a hundred and forty-six feet by a hundred and five, with
                    the area within, were consecrated in 1400, as a burial-place for the college.
                    The chapel is one of the finest buildings in the University, and is exceedingly
                    beautiful and chaste in its interior decorations.</p>
                <p>Lincoln College was founded by Richard Fleming, bishop of Lincoln, in 1427, and
                    completed by Bishop Rotherham. The chief buildings compose two quadrangular
                    courts. The larger, which contains the library and hall, was built soon after
                    the founder’s death; but the smaller, in which is situated the chapel, whose old
                    painted glass windows are the finest in Oxford, was not built till two centuries
                    afterwards.</p>
                <p>All-Souls College was founded in 1437, by Archbishop Chicelc. It consists of two
                    spacious courts, the one opening into the High Street, and the other into the
                    court where the Radcliffe Library is situated. The latter quadrangle, which was
                    erected in the beginning of last century, is a hundred and seventy-two feet in
                    length by a hundred and fifty-five in breadth; the buildings are in the mixed
                    Gothic style of architecture, and very handsome. On the south side is a
                    beautiful chapel, with an altarpiece by Raphael Mengs. The library, which is on
                    the south side, is a hundred and ninety-eight feet in length by thirty-two and a
                    quarter in breadth, and forty feet in height, and contains above 110,000
                    volumes.</p>
                <p>Magdalene College was founded by William of Wayn-flete, bishop of Winchester,
                    under a license dated the 18th July 1457. It is situated on the east side of the
                    city, neat· the Cherwell, and is one of the finest ranges of buildings in the
                    University. On the side fronting the High Street there is a finely-proportioned
                    tower, a hundred and forty-five feet in height. The chapel is a beautiful Gothic
                    structure, which has recently been restored, in good taste. Magdalene College
                    being bound by its statute to entertain the kings of England and their sons when
                    at Oxford, it has frequently been the scene of royal festivity. Edward IV. and
                    Richard III. were both entertained here by the founder. Prince Arthur paid a
                    visit to this college in 1496; and in 1605 James I. held his court within its
                    walls, on which occasion Henry prince of Wales was admitted a member of the
                    society. In 1649, Oliver Cromwell, Fairfax, and other officers of the
                    parliamentary army, had a sumptuous dinner provided for them here, and
                    afterwards played at bowls in the college green.</p>
                <p>Brazen-Nose College was founded by William Smyth, bishop of Lincoln, in concert
                    with his friend Sir Richard Sutton. The buildings were begun in 1509, and
                    occupied the site of several halls, amongst which was Brazen-Nose Hall, whence
                    the new foundation derived its name. It consists of an extensive quadrangle, a
                    smaller court on the south, a range of buildings called the New Buildings, and
                    the principal’s lodgings. The front of this college forms the west side of
                    Radcliffe Square.</p>
                <p>Corpus Christi College was founded and endowed in the year 1516, by Richard Fox,
                    bishop of Winchester. The building, which stands to the east of Christ-Church,
                    originally consisted of one large quadrangle, with a chapel, hall, and library;
                    but various additions have since been made. The altar-piece in the chapel is the
                    Nativity by Rubens. The library contains some curious printed books and
                    manuscripts.</p>
                <p>Christ-Church College is indebted for its origin to the munificence of Cardinal
                    Wolsey, who commenced it in 1524, under the designation of Cardinal College,
                    upon a scale of magnificence far surpassing that of any of the other founders;
                    but upon his disgrace Henry VIII. seized the revenues. In 1532 Henry was induced
                    to grant the college a charter, and directed that it should be called King Henry
                    VIII.’s College; but about twelve or thirteen years afterwards Henryconverted
                    the college into a cathedral church, translating to Oxford the episcopal see of
                    Oseney; and thus it became an ecclesiastical endowment, with a foundation for
                    children annexed to it. Besides the cathedral, the buildings consist of two
                    spacious quadrangles, with two smaller courts; and in the tower, which rises
                    from the gateway in the· centre of the principal front, is suspended the bell
                    called “Great Tom.” The cathedral is supposed to have been completed about 1180,
                    but parts of it are of much earlier date. The hall built by Wolsey, with its
                    roof of richly carved oak, ornamented with the armorial bearings of Wolsey and
                    Henry VIII, is a fine specimen of his magnificent taste.</p>
                <p>Trinity College was founded in 1554, by Sir Thomas Pope, who purchased for this
                    purpose the extensive buildings of Durham College. This college formerly
                    consisted chiefly of a low quadrangle, with hall, library, and chapel. In 1664,
                    extensive additions were made, and soon afterwards a new court of three sides
                    was built by Sir Christopher Wren.</p>
                <p>St John’s College was founded and endowed in 1557, by Sir Thomas White, a citizen
                    and merchant of London. It consists of two quadrangles, and has in front a wide
                    terrace and a row of lofty elms. The inner court was built in 1635, from a
                    design by Inigo Jones.</p>
                <p>Jesus College owes its foundation to Dr Hugh ap Rice, or Price. Queen Elizabeth
                    instituted the establishment by charter, dated the 27th June 1571; but though
                    nominally foundress, she bestowed little patronage, and still less property, on
                    the college, the funds having been supplied by Dr Price and the munificence of
                    other individuals. The buildings form two quadrangles, the first measuring
                    ninety feet by seventy, and the second a hundred by ninety. The front towards
                    the street was rebuilt in 1756.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194565772" xml:id="kp-eb0716-5772-0685"/>
                <p>Wadham College was projected by Nicholas Wadham; but dying before his plan could
                    be put in execution, his widow founded it in 1613. It consists of one quadrangle
                    about a hundred and thirty feet square. The hall is one of the largest in the
                    University. The Royal Society originated in this college, and its meetings were
                    held in a room over the gateway, from 1652 to 1659.</p>
                <p>Pembroke College. Though in the charter, which is dated 1624, King James is
                    called founder, and the Earl of Pembroke the chancellor of the University, yet
                    they contributed little or nothing towards the establishment of this college;
                    the real founders were Thomas Tesdale and Richard Wightwick. It consists of a
                    small neat quadrangle; and the chapel attached to it, which was erected in 1728,
                    is an elegant building of the Ionic order.</p>
                <p>Worcester College was founded in 1714, under the will of Sir Thomas Cooks. It is
                    situated upon the western side of the city, near the banks of the Isis. It
                    consists of a range of buildings, having the library, hall, and chapel in the
                    centre, an elegant line of new buildings on the north, and the old buildings on
                    the south side.</p>
                <p>Hertford College, anciently Hart Hall, was elevated to the rank of an independent
                    college in the year 1740; but since 1805 no principal could be elected, owing to
                    the nature of the statutes. It has now ceased to exist as a college. The site is
                    occupied, under an act of parliament passed in 1816, by St Mary Magdalene
                    Hall.</p>
                <p>The halls were originally the private property of inhabitants of the town, who
                    let them for the use of the students; but after the endowment of colleges, the
                    halls gradually fell into disuse. Five, however, still remain, and the students
                    who belong to them wear the same dress, and have the same university privileges,
                    as the other students; but the halls have no fellowships or scholarships, and
                    whatever property they possess is held in trust by the University. The names of
                    the halls are St Mary’s, Magdalene, New Inn, St Alban’s, and St Edmund’s. There
                    is nothing in their architecture worthy of remark.</p>
                <p>The Bodleian, or Public Library, was founded by Sir Thomas Bodley, at the close
                    of the sixteenth century, on the remains of that which was originally
                    established by the Duke of Gloucester. The erection of the present building was
                    begun in 1610. The principal room is in the form of the letter H. The Bodleian
                    is one of the five libraries which, according to act of parliament, receives a
                    copy of every newly-published book. The continual accessions which it has
                    received have rendered it one of the best libraries in Europe. The library is
                    open between Ladyday and Michaelmas from nine in the morning till four in the
                    afternoon, and between Michaelmas and Ladyday from ten in the morning till three
                    in the afternoon. No book can be taken out of the library; and from the
                    illiberal nature of the regulations, it is of little use, êven to the resident
                    members of the University. The Arundel Marbles are placed in an apartment on the
                    north side of the schools.</p>
                <p>The Radcliffe Library is one of the most imposing architectural ornaments of the
                    University. It was founded by Dr Radcliffe, who bequeathed L.40,000 for its
                    erection; and the building was executed by Gibbs between the years 1737 and
                    1749.</p>
                <p>The Clarendon Printing-house was erected in 1711, from the profits arising out of
                    the sale of Lord Clarendon’s History of the Rebellion, the copyright of which
                    was presented to the university by his lordship’s son. It is a massive
                    structure, two stories high. The business of printing for the university was
                    carried on in this building till 1830, when it was removed to the present
                    printing-house, which was commenced in 1826, and ready for use in the following
                    year.</p>
                <p>The Theatre was built by Gilbert Sheldon, archbishop of Canterbury, and
                    chancellor of the University in 1669, on the plan of the Theatre of Marcellus at
                    Rome; and the architect was Sir Christopher Wren. It is used for public
                    meetings, for the recital of prize compositions, and occasionally for conferring
                    degrees.</p>
                <p>A museum was founded in 1682, by Elias Ashmole. At the extremity of the northern
                    suburbs stands the Observatory; and at the entrance of the city by the London
                    road are the Physic Gardens, which were commenced in 1622 by the Earl of
                    Derby.</p>
                <p>When Henry VIII. elevated Oxford to the rank of a bishop’s see, he converted the
                    ancient church of St Frideswide into the cathedral. It is built in the form of a
                    cross, with a spire in the middle; and the tower contains ten bells, which
                    formerly belonged to Oseney Abbey. The length of the chapel from east to west is
                    a hundred and fifty-four feet. The nave was originally almost double its present
                    length, but was in part taken down by Cardinal Wolsey, to make room for the
                    dwellings of the canons. The length of the transept from north to south is a
                    hundred and two feet. The height of the western part is forty-one feet, and of
                    the choir thirty-seven feet. This building contains monuments of great
                    antiquity. Most of the windows were destroyed in 1651; those that remain, with
                    others since executed, display some historical scenes connected with sacred
                    subjects. It has of late years been thoroughly repaired, and has recently been
                    adorned by a fine statue of Dr Cyril Jackson, long president of the college. It
                    was executed by Chantrey, and is universally allowed to be an admirable
                    likeness.</p>
                <p>In noticing the parochial churches of the city, the first to be mentioned is that
                    of St Mary, which, though the public service is partly conducted under the
                    direction of the University, and it is hence called the University Church, does
                    in fact belong to the vicar and the inhabitants of the parish. It is a spacious
                    Gothic structure, finished in the year 1498. The lofty spire, a hundred and
                    eighty feet in height, is a conspicuous object, and the tower contains six large
                    and well-toned bells. In 1828 it was repaired and very highly finished, but in
                    harmony with the original plan.</p>
                <p>There arc thirteen other parish churches. St Peter’sin-the-East is an interesting
                    edifice, of a very ancient date; and is supposed to have been originally built
                    by St Grym-bald, under the patronage of Alfred. St Michael’s is of equal
                    dimensions with St Mary Magdalene’s, and is said to have belonged to the canons
                    of St Frideswide, before the Norman conquest. The windows are large and pointed.
                    St Martin’s, or, as it is more commonly called, Carfax, is the church of the
                    city, at which the mayor and corporation attend divine service. It has been
                    rebuilt within the last fifteen years, upon the site of a structure of great
                    antiquity, and much enlarged. St Peter’s-in-the-Bailey, at the west end of the
                    city, was opened for divine service in 1740, and a gallery added to it thirteen
                    years after, at the expense of an individual named Flexney. It is seventy feet
                    in length and thirty-eight in breadth,'with a tower containing only two bells.
                    St Aldate’s, of great antiquity, is said to have been founded or restored in
                    1004. It is a venerable pile, consisting of a nave, two aisles, and a chancel,
                    and is about a hundred feet in length. St Ebbe’s is a plain, modern church,
                    built in 1817. The church of St Mary Magdalene is a neat stone edifice,
                    eighty-eight feet in length, said to have been founded in 1194, and is
                    remarkable for three uniform pointed windows in a chantry chapel within it, and
                    a parapet of open trefoil work of great beauty. St Giles is an edifice venerable
                    from its age, being furnished with numerous lancet-shaped windows. It is a solid
                    and capacious building, though not sufficiently so for the population of the
                    parish, which has rapidly increased. Holywell Church, so named from a well of
                    great sanctity in ancient times, and near to it, is a small building, with a
                    tower <pb break="no" facs="nls:194565785" xml:id="kp-eb0716-5785-0686"/>said to
                    have been built in 1464; but the church itself is much more ancient. It has an
                    embattled tower, containing six bells. St Clement’s, in the eastern suburb, is a
                    handsome edifice, lately enlarged, owing to the great increase of inhabitants.
                    St Thomas’s Church, at the western extremity of the city, was founded by the
                    canons of Oseney in 1141. It is about a hundred feet in length, and has lately
                    been much improved. The church or chapel of St John is also the chapel of Merton
                    College; but the parishioners have a part of the north side allotted to them as
                    the place of sepulture, the chaplain of the college reading the burial service.
                    There is also the church of All Saints, in the High Street. Besides these parish
                    churches, there are four places of worship for Protestant dissenters and
                    Wesleyans, and a small but neat chapel for the Roman Catholics. The population
                    amounted in 1801 to 10,534, in 1811 to 11,916, in 1821 to 14,901, in 1831 to
                    18,436, and in 1833 to 20,411. This does not include those persons resident in
                    the several public buildings comprehended in the University, or in the House of
                    Industry, or the Radcliffe Infirmary. The census is taken at a period of the
                    year when the colleges are not at the fullest, and the absent students, fellows,
                    and professors, are consequently included in the enumerations of other
                    districts. The whole number residing in the university amounted in 1801 to 1171,
                    in 1811 to 1015, in 1821 to 1463, and in 1831 to 1634. The residents in the
                    House of Industry were 219, and those in the Radcliffe Infirmary 145; thus
                    making the whole population at the census of 1831 to be 22,186. The system of
                    education taught in the colleges will be treated of under the article <hi
