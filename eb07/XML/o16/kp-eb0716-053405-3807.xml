                <p><label type="entry">ORICHALCUM, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Aurichalcum</hi></label>,
                    a metallic substance resembling gold in colour, but very inferior in value. It
                    was well known to the Romans, who often took advantage of its resemblance to
                    gold; for some sacrilegious characters, who could not resist the temptation of
                    taking gold from temples and other public places, chose to conceal their guilt
                    by replacing it with orichalcum. It was thus that Julius Caesar acted when he
                    robbed the capitol of three thousand pounds weight of gold; in which he was
                    followed by Vitellius, who despoiled the temples of their gifts and ornaments,
                    and replaced them with this inferior metal. It has been a matter of dispute with
                    philosophers and others, what the composition of this metal could be, or how it
                    was procured; it is probable, at least, that it was analogous to our brass, if
                    not wholly the same with it.</p>
                <p>The Romans were not only in possession of a metallic substance, called by them
                    <hi rend="italic">orichalcum,</hi> and resembling gold in colour, but they knew
                    also the manner of making it; and the materials from which they made it were the
                    very same with those from which we make brass. There are, indeed, authors of
                    great repute who think very differently, and consider the art of making brass as
                    an invention wholly modem. Thus Μ. Cronstedt does not think it just to conclude
                    from old coins and other antiquities, that the making of brass was known in the
                    most ancient times; and the authors of the French <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopédie</hi> assure us that our brass is a very recent invention. It
                    appears, however, from Pliny <hi rend="italic">(Nat. Hist.</hi> lib. xxxiv. §
                    2), and from the concurring testimony of other writers, that <hi rend="italic"
                    >orichalcum</hi> was not a pure or original metal; but that its basis was
                    copper, which the Romans changed into <hi rend="italic">orichalcum</hi> by means
                    of <hi rend="italic">cadrnia,</hi> a species of earth which they threw upon the
                    copper, and which it absorbed. It has indeed been contended that the <hi
                    rend="italic">cadmia</hi> of Pliny was native arsenic; an opinion which scarcely
                    merits confutation, but which must appear extremely groundless, when we reflect
                    that it is impossible to make either brass or copper from arsenic, and that
                    Pliny expressly calls the substance from which brass was made a <hi
                    rend="italic">stone.</hi> The testimony of Ambrose bishop of Milan in the fourth
                    century, and of Primasius bishop of Adrumetum, in Africa, in the sixth, and of
                    Isidorus bishop of Seville in the seventh, all seem to confirm Pliny’s account
                    We may therefore safely conclude, that the Romans knew the method of making
                    brass by mixing <hi rend="italic">cadmia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">calamine</hi>
                    with copper. Yet it is probable they were not the inventors of this art, but
                    borrowed it from some other country. It appears from a variety of testimonies
                    that brass was made in Asia, in a manner similar to that employed at Rome; and a
                    variety of places are mentioned where it was commonly made. It is supposed by
                    some that in India, as well as in other parts of Asia, it was made in the
                    remotest ages.</p>
                <p>With respect to <hi rend="italic">orichalcum,</hi> it is generally supposed that
                    there were two sorts of this metal, one factitious, and the other natural. The
                    factitious, whether we consider its qualities or its composition, appears to
                    have been the same with our brass. As to the natural <hi rend="italic"
                    >orichalcum,</hi> there is no impossibility in supposing that copper ore may
                    have been so intimately blended with an ore of zinc, or of some other metallic
                    substance, that the compound, when smelted, might yield a mixed metal of a paler
                    hue than copper, and resembling the colour of gold or of silver.</p>
                <p>We know of no country in which <hi rend="italic">orichalcum</hi> is found at
                    present; nor was it anywhere found in the age of Pliny, who does not seem to
                    have known the country where it had ever been obtained. He admits, indeed, that
                    it had been formerly dug out of the earth; but it is remarkable, that in the
                    very passage where he mentions by name the countries most celebrated for the
                    production of different kinds of copper, he only says in general, concerning <hi
                    rend="italic">orichalcum,</hi> that it had been found in other countries, but
                    without specifying any particular country. Plato acknowledges that <hi
                    rend="italic">orichalcum</hi> was a thing only talked of even in his time; it
                    was then nowhere to be met with, although in the island of Atlantis it had been
                    formerly extracted from the mine. The Greeks were in possession of a metallic
                    substance called <hi rend="italic">orichalcum</hi> before the foundation of
                    Rome. It is mentioned by Homer and by Hesiod, and by both of these poets in such
                    a manner as shows that it was then held in great esteem. Other ancient writers
                    have expressed themselves in similar terms of commendation; and it is
                    principally from the circumstance of the high reputed value of <hi rend="italic"
                    >orichalcum</hi> that authors have been induced to suppose that the ancient
                    metal of this name was a natural substance, very different from the factitious
                    one in use at Rome, and probably in Asia, and which, it has been shown, was in
                    no respect different from our brass.</p>
                <p>But this conclusion cannot be validly deduced from their <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194563820" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3820-0535"/>encomiums upon <hi
                    rend="italic">orichalcum;</hi> for, at whatever time the method of making it was
                    first discovered, its novelty and scarcity, joined to its utility, would enhance
                    its value; at east there can be no absurdity in supposing, that when first
                    introduced it was greatly prized, even though it be granted that it possessed no
                    other properties than such as uppertain to brass.</p>
                <p>With respect to the etymology of the word there exists great diversity of
                    opinions. Those who write it <hi rend="italic">αurichal-vm</hi> think it is
                    composed of the Latin word <hi rend="italic">aurum,</hi> gold, and the Greek <hi
                    rend="italic">χα</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">κος, brass</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">copper.</hi> But the most general opinion is that it is
                    composed of ò¢o¢, <hi rend="italic">a mountain,</hi> and χαλxoς, <hi
                    rend="italic">brass,</hi> alluding perhaps to its being found in mountains or
                    mountainous countries.</p>
