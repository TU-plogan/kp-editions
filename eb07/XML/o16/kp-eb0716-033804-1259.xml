                <p><label type="entry">OMMON</label>, a district of Arabia, which comprises a
                    portion of the southern coast extending from its eastern extremity of Rasalgate
                    to the entrance of the Persian Gulf. In the interior it is one of the wildest
                    parts of the country, and is little known, but is generally supposed to consist
                    of sandy deserts. Along the coast the country is more fertile, and the
                    inhabitants are an industrious and active race, pursuing with ardour both
                    commerce and navigation. The soil is well watered by the rivers which flow from
                    the ranges of mountains along the coast. Its produce is confined almost
                    exclusively to dates and a little wheat, which appears to be scarcely sufficient
                    for its own consumption, as, according to Frazer (see Narrative of a Journey
                    into Khorassan, p. 17), large quantities of the latter article are imported from
                    Bushire and Bassora. On the other hand, large quantities of dates are also
                    exported; those of Ommon enjoying, it is said, a preference over the produce of
                    other places, particularly in Sinde, to which they are exported. Dates are the
                    great staple of these countries, being the staff of life; and they are the
                    standard by which the value of landed estates is estimated. Landed property,
                    although it usually descends by inheritance, may be disposed of in any way the
                    proprietor pleases. The sovereign’s claim is confined to the tenth of the
                    produce, and he can in no way interfere with the proprietor’s rights, although
                    he may divest him of any command which he possesses, or expel him from the
                    district if he pleases. Lands are usually let out in lease, or annual rent
                    payable in a portion of the produce. Slaves are made use of here, as throughout
                    Arabia, in the labours of agriculture; but they are treated with kindness and
                    indulgence. The property of the Arabs which they possess independently of land,
                    consists for the most part in live stock, sheep, goats, camels, asses, a few
                    horses, and cows; camels being in value from thirty to three hundred dollars
                    a-piece, according to blood and quality. The asses of Omgaon are celebrated as
                    the finest of Arabia; and individuals of the best breed sell for very
                    extravagant sums. The value of the common kind varies from one to forty dollars;
                    goats from four to six dollars; sheep from one and a half to six dollars. No
                    mules are reared, nor are horses abundant in the province. The cows have humps,
                    and resemble those of India. Milk, butter, and ghee are very abundant, and good
                    of their kinds; which is the more remarkable, as the cattle have little or no
                    pasture in the neighbourhood, and are fed upon dried fish a little salted, of
                    which they become very fond. Ommon is by no means celebrated for its
                    manufactures, which consist of turbans and waistbands, or girdles of cotton and
                    silk, striped or checked with blue, and having the ends ornamented with red,
                    green, or yellow borders; cloaks, called abbas, made of sheep’s wool or camel’s
                    hair, and of various degrees of fineness; cotton canvass, gunpowder, and arms of
                    no superior quality; and earthen jars for the market of Zanguebar. They also
                    prepare a sweetmeat in high esteem, called <hi rend="italic">hulwak,</hi> from
                    honey or sugar, the gluten of wheat and ghee, with a few almonds; and sharks’
                    fins and dried salt-fish for the eastern markets. Frazer states, that the
                    provinces of Arabia, of which Muscat is the first, are too poor to consume much
                    foreign produce, or to afford any considerable quantity of their own in
                    exchange. Still, he adds, there is a certain demand for many Indian productions
                    and other articles, as rice, sugar, spices, cotton cloths, silk, indigo, ship
                    timber, and coffee from Mocha, cowries, ivory, Joarree grain, gums, civet oil
                    for burning, cocoa-nuts, wood for building, and slaves from Zanguebar and other
                    African ports; dates, rose-water, &amp;c. from Bushire and Bassora. A
                    considerable quantity of these articles is sent to this country merely in
                    transit, as it is a great entrepôt of the commerce which is carried on between
                    India, Arabia, Persia, and Eastern Africa; but no inconsiderable portion is
                    consumed in the country, and paid for chiefly in dollars and cowries; and he is
                    at a loss to understand where this quantity of specie is procured. But it is
                    obvious that the country can only procure it by the sale of its own produce.
                    There is no other source from which it can be obtained; nor need a passing
                    traveller be surprised that he cannot comprehend at a glance all the resources
                    which an extensive district may possess for carrying on foreign trade. Where can
                    any country find equivalents to exchange with foreigners for their produce <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194561272" xml:id="kp-eb0716-1272-0339"/> but within
                    itself? The fact stated by Mr Frazer, of the abundance of specie given in
                    exchange for foreign articles, speaks for itself. It is an index of the state of
                    wealth; nor need it excite the smallest incredulity or surprise. The climate of
                    Osnmon is extremely unfavourable for European constitutions; scarcely any native
                    of Europe ever resides here without experiencing its fatal effects. The heat is
                    always great. Frazer mentions, that during his abode there, which was in July,
                    the heat varied from 90° to 102° of Fahrenheit; the greatest inconvenience
                    experienced was from the suffocating heat of the nights, as a parching wind blew
                    from the rocks, preventing that cool freshness which the dewy morning brings in
                    most countries, and keeping the frame so continually relaxed and unrefreshed by
                    sleep, as to render it predisposed to the attacks of disease. The natives are
                    the most expert navigators in these seas, and use a very singular species of
                    craft, which are broad in proportion to their length, and are constructed of
                    planks fastened together by nails, and tied and sewed together with cords. This
                    country was early invaded by the Portuguese, who acquired possession of Muscat,
                    its principal port, which they retained for nearly two centuries. Ommon was
                    invaded and conquered, in the course of the last century, by Nadir Shah. But the
                    native princes, when his armies were engaged in other quarters, took the
                    opportunity of re-conquering their dominions, which they have ever since
                    retained. The chief towns are Rostak, the residence of the imaum; Muscat, which
                    is chiefly known to Europeans; and Kalhat and Sohar.</p>
                <p>The country is ruled by a supreme chief or imaum, who, besides, holds in
                    possession the islands of Keshmee and Ormuz in the gulf, and rents from the
                    court of Persia Gomberoon, and Binderabbassec and its dependencies, including
                    the district of Juroom, which extends from Meenab, on the south-east, to
                    Khumeer, on the north-west, including about eighty miles of sea-coast. His
                    revenues are derived from various sources. He receives a tenth part of the
                    produce of the territories of 0mmon, which is trifling; a duty of a half per
                    cent, on all merchandise passing up the gulf on Arab bottoms, amounting,
                    according to Frazer’s estimate, to 160,000 dollars a year; the rents of valuable
                    sulphur mines, which he holds of the Persian government; and considerable landed
                    property in the country of Ommon, which brings him in only some thousands of
                    dollars in the year. Commerce is perhaps the chief source of his income. He
                    possesses five fine ships, his private property, two of them mounting fifty and
                    forty guns respectively, besides four other vessels such as are used on the
                    Arabian coast. His vessels trade to all parts of India and the East, to the
                    coasts of Arabia and Africa, to Madagascar and the Mauritius, besides the ports
                    of the Persian Gulf.</p>
