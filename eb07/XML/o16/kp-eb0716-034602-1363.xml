                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">OPPIAN</label>, a Greek poet, was born at Corycia or
                    Anazarba, in Cilicia, towards the close of the reign of Marcus Aurelius. His
                    father, Agésilas, held a distinguished rank in the senate of his native place,
                    not so much on account of his birth or his riches, as the credit he obtained for
                    the extent of his knowledge and his love of philosophy, which was the object of
                    all his studies, and the guide of all his actions. To his son he was careful to
                    give an education conformable to his own principles, causing him to be
                    instructed in music, geometry, and particularly the belles-lettres. The young
                    Oppian, however, had scarcely completed his studies, when an unlooked-for
                    reverse damped his ardour, and destroyed all his hopes. Septimius Seve∙</p>

                <p>rus, having mounted the throne, to which he had succeeded in hewing out a way
                    with his sword, arrived at Anazarba, and immediately the senate of the place
                    threw themselves at the feet of the conqueror. Agésilas alone, conceiving
                    himself bound to withhold from an usurper the homage which was due only to the
                    legitimate sovereign, stood aloof upon this occasion; a circumstance which so
                    irritated Severus, that he deprived the philosopher of all his property, and
                    banished him to the island of Melitus, now <hi rend="italic">Meleda,</hi>
                    situated in the Adriatic. Thither Oppian followed his father, and it was in this
                    compulsory retreat that he conceived and executed his two poems on the Chase and
                    on Fihsing, entitled <hi rend="italic">Cynegetica</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Halieutica.</hi> When they were finished, he went to Rome, and presented them
                    to the son of Severus, Antoninus Caracalla, who relished them so much that he
                    permitted the author to demand of him whatever recompense he pleased. Oppian
                    asked only for the release of his father, with permission to the latter to
                    return to his own country; and the emperor, as much touched with the filial
                    affection of the son as he had been delighted with the verses of the poet, not
                    only granted the favour he had asked, but added the gift of a gold statera
                    (about L.l. 4s. of our money) for each one of the verses which he had just heard
                    recited, If, as Suidas pretends, these verses amounted to twenty thousand, never
                    did poet receive so splendid a recompense. But Oppian did not long enjoy his
                    good fortune. Scarcely had he returned to his own country when he sunk into the
                    grave, at the early age of thirty, having fallen the victim of a contagious
                    malady which then desolated the city of Anazarba. His fellow-citizens erected to
                    his memory a magnificent tomb, whereon was engraved an inscription in Greek
                    verse, which Lorenzo Lippi has rendered as follows:</p>
                <p>Oppianus vatum decus immortale fuissem, Invida ni gelidum rapuisset Parca sub
                    Orcum, Me juvenem placidae clarum splendore Camaenae, Si livor longae violasset
                    tempora vitae,</p>
                <p>Non mihi laude parem quemquam terra alma tulisset.</p>
                <p>This is all that we learn of Oppian from the anonymous Greek historian of his
                    life, whom all the succeeding biographers have faithfully copied. We must,
                    however, except the learned editor of his works, Schneider, who, being struck
                    with the disparity of style which he remarked in the poems on the Chase and on
                    Fishing, conceived that two works, which, according to him, were so different in
                    merit, could not possibly have been the productions of the same author.
                    Accordingly, he supposed that there were two Oppians, the first of whom, a
                    native of Cilicia, and au- 1thorofthe <hi rend="italic">Halieutica,</hi>
                    preceded the second by several years.</p>
                <p>In the opinion of Schneider, it is to the latter that we are indebted for the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cynegetica,</hi> in which the author has, according to him,
                    attempted to reproduce, but with great inferiority of talent, the manner and
                    some of the imagery of the first Oppian. Μ. Belin de Ballu has, however,
                    completely refuted this bold hypothesis, in the preface to his Greek edition of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Cynegetica,</hi> published at Strasburg in 1786. How,
                    indeed, could it be reconciled with the unanimous concert of praise which
                    critics, ancient and modern, have lavished upon this poet? John Tzetzes calls
                    him a model of grace; J. C. Scaliger compares him to Virgil, in mint <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> numbers, harmony, and elegance of style; Gaspar 3arth,
                    Conrad Gesner, and many others, never cite him I except to couple his name with
                    laudatory epithets. It is not easy, however, to reconcile so much praise
                    bestowed on the one hand, and so little regard evinced for the works of Oppian
                    on the other; nor can we help feeling some astonishment, when we consider that,
                    from the date of the <hi rend="italic">editio princeps,</hi> printed at Florence
                    in 1515, two centuries elapsed before the appearance of the first really
                    critical edition, published by Schneider in the year 1777. During this long
                    period, it is true, there appeared several editions at considerable intervals,
                    particularly that of Aldus, Venice, 1517, which Schneider considers as very
                    defective, and regards as the source of all the faults which, till his time, had
                    disfigured the text; that of’Vascosan, Paris, 1549; and that of Rittershusius,
                    Leyden, 1597. No edition appeared in the seventeenth, nor any in the eighteenth
                    century, until the year 1777, when that of Schneider was published at Strasburg,
                    containing the Greek text, accompanied with a Latin translation, and followed by
                    the paraphrase in prose which the sophist Eutechnius had made of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ixcutica,</hi> another poem attributed toOppian, but which,
                    unfortunately, has not come down to our time. This was followed by the edition
                    of Belin de Ballu, published at Strasburg in 1786,but containingonly the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cynegetica,</hi> of which the editor published, at the same place,
                    the following year, a good French translation, enriched with critical notes, and
                    a curious extract from El Doinaí’s history of animals, translated from the
                    Arabic by Baron Silvestre de Sacy, who, however, for some reason, withheld his
                    name. Prior to this there were two French translations, one by Florent
                    Chris-tien, preceptor to Henry IV. when prince of Bearn; and another by Fermat,
                    a counsellor of Toulouse, who, in 1690, published a prose version of the books
                    on Hunting by Arrian and Oppian. The poem on Fishing was translated into English
                    heroic verse by Jones and others, belonging to St John’s College, Oxford, and
                    printed there in 1722, 8vo, with a life of the author prefixed. The Latin
                    translation of Lorenzo Lippi, printed in 1478, preceded by thirty-seven years
                    the <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> the Greek
                    text. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
