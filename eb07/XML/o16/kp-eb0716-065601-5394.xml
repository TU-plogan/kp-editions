                    >,</hi> a celebrated cardinal, and one of the most remarkable men of his time,
                    was born at Laroque-en-Magnoac, a village in the diocese of Auch, in the year
                    1536. In the strictest sense of the Spanish expression, he was “the son of his
                    own works.” There is reason to believe that his father, who died in distress in
                    Spain, exercised the profession of farrier; and this opinion is in accordance
                    with the common tradition, according to which D’Ossat was ushered into the world
                    by an army-farrier. At the age of nine, he found himself without any known
                    parents, and having no other resource than public charity. But a gentleman of
                    the neighbourhood, named De Marca, received the orphan into his house, and
                    caused him to be educated along with one of his nephews, who had been committed
                    to his care. In this situation the progress of D’Ossat was so striking, that in
                    a very few years he was thought capable of acting as preceptor to the companion
                    of his studies. In 1559 he received orders to attend his pupil, and two other
                    nephews of Μ. de Marca, to Paris; and he was likewise intrusted with the charge
                    of a son of a merchant in Lectoure, who accompanied them. To these youths he
                    devoted the utmost care and attention till the year 1562, when, having completed
                    their course of study, they returned to their relations; thus relieving him from
                    those extrinsic duties, the performance of which had impeded his own progress,
                    and prevented him from increasing at pleasure the amount of his own
                    acquirements. During this period, however, he had studied rhetoric and
                    philosophy, and, in particular, had profited by the lessons of Ramus, whose bold
                    and penetrating mind had enabled him to strike into new paths of inquiry. Hence,
                    when Charpentier, the fierce champion of Aristotle, attacked Ramus, D’Ossat
                    defended the doctrine of his master in a judicious production, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Expositio</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Disputationem</hi><hi rend="italic">Jacobi Car-penterii de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Methodo,</hi> Paris, 1564, in 8vo, the elegant and close
                    dialectics of which so disconcerted Charpentier, that the only answer he could
                    make to his adversary consisted in scurrility and abuse. D’Ossat quitted Ramus
                    to study the civil law under Cujas in the university of Bourges. His intention
                    was to qualify himself for the profession of advocate; and accordingly, having
                    taken his diploma, he returned to Paris in the year 1568, and was admitted to
                    the bar. But being as yet almost unknown, and without the means necessary to
                    enable him to wait for employment in the ordinary course of the profession, he
                    had not long attended the sittings of the parliament of Paris ere he became
                    convinced that he would never find his place amidst so much that was arbitrary
                    on the bench, and the barbarism that reigned at the bar. Fortunately for him,
                    however, the celebrated Paul de Foix then filled the office of counsellor to the
                    parliament. The merit of D’Ossat could not escape the notice of a magistrate who
                    cherished so strong a passion for letters. De Foix, notwithstanding his
                    enthusiasm for Aristotle, and his favour for Charpentier, sought out the modest
                    advocate, admitted him to the learned society which met at his house, and having
                    seen cause to esteem him more and more in proportion as he became acquainted
                    with him, procured for D’Ossat the situation of counsellor to the présidial, or
                    local court, of Melun; an office which appears to have imposed on him little or
                    no duty, since he continued to hold it as late as the year 1588. D’Ossat having
                    in this way become necessary to his patron, accompanied him into Italy in the
                    year 1574. A political mission of pure etiquette had been confided to De Foix,
                    and he accordingly considered his journey merely as an opportunity thrown in his
                    way of adding to his literary enjoyments. Whilst he travelled on horseback,
                    D’Ossat explained to him Plato, whilst De Thou read the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paratitla</hi> of Cujas; and all the three, like worthy friends of Montaigne,
                    sometimes discoursed together on the peripatetic philosophy. The orthodoxy of De
                    Foix having been called in question by the pope, and his holiness having ordered
                    “an information” on the conduct which he had pursued in the parliament, D’Ossat
                    composed an apologetical memoir in behalf of his friend. But this defence
                    produced no other result than making its author advantageously known.</p>
                <p>De Foix withdrew from Rome, in order to allow the proceeding which had been
                    commenced against him to fall asleep. D’Ossat, however, remained; and it was
                    probably during this interval that he took holy orders. In 1581, De Foix
                    returned to Rome as ambassador of Henry III., and chose D’Ossat as his
                    secretary. This choice was, in every respect, fortunate; and so completely did
                    the secretary enter into the views of his principal as to the manner of
                    conducting business, that the resemblance observable in the style of their
                    despatches has induced an erroneous belief that these were all prepared by
                    D’Ossat. After the death of De Foix, D’Ossat was employed in the same capacity
                    by Cardinal Hippolyte d’Este, official protector of the church of France, whose
                    entire confidence he had gained; and he acquired a still greater ascendency over
                    Cardinal de Joyeuse, who succeeded Cardinal d’Este. After the disgrace of
                    Villeroi, Henry III. offered the place of that minister to D’Ossat; but he
                    refused to succeed a man who had strong claims on his gratitude. Besides, he
                    foresaw that, in this elevated post, it would be impossible for him to make head
                    against the intrigues of the Guises; and he loved his country too well to render
                    himself subservient to their ambition. His experience prevented him from being
                    seduced, like so many others, by the pretexts of the League; he maintained a
                    courageous fidelity to his sovereign; and he wrote, in the name of Cardinal de
                    Joyeuse, a letter approving of the murder of the Guises. Joyeuse afterwards
                    allowed himself to be drawn into the ranks of the Leaguers; but he repaired his
                    error by a noble devotion, which no subsequent act belied, to Henry IV. D’Ossat
                    being charged by the queen-dowager, the widow of Henry III., to solicit the
                    celebration of the obsequies of that unfortunate prince, vainly endeavoured,
                    during several years, to overcome the resistance of the pope, who refused his
                    assent to a ceremony which had been consecrated' by usage. Whilst he was thus
                    interceding for the memory of Henry HL, De Thou dedicated to him a poem he had
                    written on the death of that royal victim. D’Ossat, though without any public
                    character, and without orders from the French ministry, zealously interposed to
                    effect the reconciliation of Henry IV. with the holy see; and this prince being
                    informed of his spontaneous exertions, as well as of his capacity, wrote to
                    request him to put himself in communication, and act in concert, with the Duke
                    of Nevers, who was then on his way to Rome, provided with full powers. The duke,
                    however, despising an auxiliary calculated to prove the more useful as he was
                    less conspicuous, undertook to conduct the negotiation alone, and completely
                    failed. Nevertheless, Clement VIII. was exceedingly desirous that Henry should
                    be solemnly admitted into the communion of the Catholic Church; but he wished,
                    at the same time, to keep terms with Spain, and to obtain condi tions
                    advantageous to the holy see.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, he acted with an “innocent duplicity," which completely deceived the
                    Spaniards. One of them, who held the office of chamberlain to the pope, having
                    published a pamphlet in order to prove that a relapsed heretic could neither be
                    absolved nor recognised as king, D’Ossat wrote a triumphant reply. Clement,
                    however, although he approved of the substance of this production, required that
                    it should only be circulated privately. D’Ossat entertained no doubt whatever as
                    to the real intentions of the pope; but in the negotiation, with which he was
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194565407" xml:id="kp-eb0716-5407-0657"/>at length
                    exclusively intrusted, he had constantly to guard against the captious and
                    formalist character of the court of Rome. When he had smoothed all obstacles,
                    Duperron was sent to Rome to join him in receiving the stipulated absolution in
                    name of the king. The first condition which the pope wished to impose on the
                    royal commissioners, was to deposit the crown of France at the feet of the
                    pontifical throne. But the representatives of Henry declared firmly that they
                    would never consent to any proposition inconsistent with the independence of the
                    royal authority; nor did they show themselves less decidedly opposed to every
                    clause which had a tendency to compromise anew the tranquillity of the state, or
                    excite alarm amongst the Huguenots. The Spanish faction murmured at not being
                    able to prevent an absolution, which conciliated to Henry the opinion of a great
                    number of his subjects. But their discontent was unavailing. Everything had been
                    satisfactorily arranged, and Duperron was appointed to the bishopric of Evreux;
                    whilst D’Ossat, who had brought about this happy result, received as his
                    recompense the title of councillor of state, and the bishopric of-Rennes.</p>
                <p>During the remainder of his life he actively co-operated in all the diplomatic
                    affairs which were conducted in Italy. By his means the connection which had
                    subsisted nearly thirty years between Margaret of Valois and Henry IV. was
                    dissolved. The dispensation granted by the pope, to validate the union of
                    Catherine of Bourbon and the Duke de Bar, was also his work. He took part in the
                    negotiation concerning the restitution of the marquisate of Saluées; observed
                    the astute conduct of the Duke of Savoy; induced the Grand Duke of Tuscany to
                    evacuate the forts which he occupied in the isles of If and Pomègue near
                    Marseilles; proved, in a memoir which he distributed to the sacred college, that
                    the peace recently concluded at Vervins was more necessary to Spain than to
                    France; and was chosen to announce that peace to the senate of Venice. In
                    satisfying Clement VIII. respecting the delay of publication experienced by the
                    Council of Trent, the guarantees which the edict of Nantes granted to the
                    Protestants, and the rigorous measures ordained against the Jesuits, DOssat
                    displayed all the resources of an insinuating mind, and dissipated the clouds
                    formed by the Spanish influence at the court of Rome. His experience appears to
                    have been only once at fault, in a case where he took counsel of his affections
                    rather than of his judgment. We allude to the assent which he gave to a project
                    of the pope for placing upon the throne of England the Duke or Cardinal of
                    Parma, to the prejudice of the son of Mary Stuart.</p>
                <p>DOssat, by his simple and modest character, no less than by his prudence, his
                    private virtues, and his talents, had procured for himself many friends, and
                    reached the highest consideration he could attain in the face of the double
                    obstacle of poverty and obscurity of birth, when, in the year 1599, he received
                    a cardinal’s hat, which was conferred on him at the earnest solicitation of the
                    king. The following year he was appointed to the bishopric of Baïeux, which,
                    however, he almost immediately found means to resign with advantage.
                    Nevertheless, his last years were embittered by vexation, and saddened by
                    disappointment. To support his dignity, he had only two benefices, the revenues
                    of which were in part seized on by the neighbouring gentlemen. The king had
                    granted him a pension sufficient for a man accustomed to limit his personal
                    wants; but it was not regularly paid. Sully, who hated, in the person of DOssat,
                    the protégé of Villeroi, hesitated not, first to suspend, and then altogether to
                    discontinue, the annual prestation to which the bounty of his sovereign had
                    given him a title; and the cardinal would have been exposed to all the pangs of
                    shame and misery, if the heirs of Hippolyte d’Este had not paid to him a legacy
                    of L.500, which had been exigible for more than ten years. Besides, DOssat, who
                    only saw the internal situation of France with the eyes of Villeroi, formed an
                    exaggerated notion of some disorders produced by the rigorous administration of
                    Sully; and, under this impression, wrote to the king a letter, in which he drew
                    a dark picture of the dangers with which he believed the state to be threatened.
                    Sully, more irritated than ever, was loud in his complaints against the
                    cardinal; and in his <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> may be found the
                    imputations which he laid to the charge of a man who, like himself, had devoted
                    all his thoughts to the service of his sovereign. DOssat, however, had the
                    consolation of learning that he retained the esteem of Henry IV., if he had lost
                    the favour of his great minister. He died on the 13th of March 1604, in the
                    sixty-eighth year of his age; and as he had no known relations, he divided his
                    little property between his two secretaries and the poor.</p>
                <p>Madame d ’ Arconville published a prolix Life of Cardinal d’Ossat, Paris, 1771,
                    in two vols. 8vo, in which she inserted a translation of a remarkable memoir on
                    the effects of the League, composed in Italian by D’Ossat, and containing an
                    able exposition of the character of the policy pursued by the Guises, with the
                    consequences which might be expected to result from it. The Letters published
                    under the name of Cardinal Joyeuse may also be regarded as the productions of
                    D’Ossat; but it is to the collection of his own Letters addressed to Villeroi
                    that he is chiefly indebted for his classical reputation in diplomacy.
                    Chesterfield recommended them to his son as the work best calculated to give him
                    an insight into the conduct of affairs; and Wicquefort appears to have had them
                    continually in view in his treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">E</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ambassadeur.</hi> The language of D’Ossat is natural and full of
                    sincerity; his statements are marked by a grave and concise simplicity; he is
                    almost never betrayed into any false step or unguarded expression; and he
                    interests us equally by his modesty and his loyalty. Now, when the court of Rome
                    is no longer the centre of negotiations, and the ideas of men have taken another
                    course, his diplomatic correspondence has necessarily lost much of its
                    importance; but with reference to the history of the time to which it refers, it
                    must ever be consulted with advantage. As the collection of his Letters does not
                    commence until the month of April 1593, it thus leaves a gap in his political
                    life from the year 1589 until the period in question. The first edition was
                    published at Paris in 1624, folio, by the brothers Dupuy; but it has been much
                    surpassed by that of Amelot de la Houssaye, which appeared at the same place in
                    1697, in two vols. with notes, and which was reprinted with additional notes at
                    Amsterdam, 1707, 1714, and 1732, in five vols. 12mo. This work was translated

                    province of Trieste. It stands on the western side of the island, on a
                    promontory, and is the see of a bishop, but with only 360 houses and 1540

                    channel which is not passable by vessels. It is well cultivated, and very
                    productive of wine. It contains two townships or communes, with 1600 houses and
                    7200 inhabitants.</p>
