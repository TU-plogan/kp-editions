                    >όπτομαι,</hi> which signifies to <hi rend="italic">see,</hi> is the name given
                    to that branch of natural philosophy which treats of the nature and properties
                    of light; of the changes which it suffers either in its qualities or in its
                    course when transmitted through bodies, when reflected from their surfaces, or
                    when passing near them; of the structure of the eye, and the laws of vision; and
                    of the construction of those instruments in which light is the chief agent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">history.</hi></p>
                <p>The early history of optics, like that of all the sciences cultivated in ancient
                    times, is involved in much obscurity. After the art of glass-making was
                    discovered, lenses and spheres of glass seem to have been used as
                    burning-glasses. In Aristophanes’s comedy of <hi rend="italic">The Clouds</hi> a
                    burning sphere is distinctly described. Pliny speaks of globes of glass which
                    produced combustion when held to the sun. Lactantius informs us that a globe of
                    glass full of water could, when exposed to the sun, kindle a fire even in the
                    coldest weather. And it appears that globes of glass were used by the Vestal
                    Virgins to kindle the sacred fire, and by surgeons to burn the flesh of sick
                    persons that required to be cauterised.</p>
                <p>Among the earliest speculators on vision were Pythagoras and Plato; the former
                    held that bodies became visible by means of particles projected from their
                    surfaces and entering the eye, while the latter, in order to give the eye some
                    share in the matter, supposed that something emitted from the eye met with
                    something emitted from the object, and was again returned into the organ of
                    vision. The followers of Plato, however, though they had deteriorated rather
                    than improved the conclusion of Pythagoras, were acquainted with two important
                    facts in the science. They taught that light moved in straight lines, and that
                    when it was reflected regularly from the surfaces of polished bodies the angle
                    of incidence was equal to the angle of reflexion.</p>
                <p>The earliest writer on optics was Euclid, the celebrated geometer, whose treatise
                    on the subject is still extant.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    books on optics and catoptrics, and proceeds on the Platonic theory, that the
                    visual rays pass from the eye to the object, forming a cone whose apex is in the
                    eye and whose base is the object. He shews that the angles of incidence and
                    reflexion are equal, and that the incident and reflected rays lie in a plane at
                    right angles to the reflecting surface; and he discusses the apparent magnitude
                    and form of objects, and the apparent place of the images formed by reflexion
                    from plane, convex, and concave mirrors. The book on optics contains sixty-one,
                    and that on catoptrics thirty-one theorems.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Dr. Smith is of opinion that this treatise was not written
                    by Euclid the geometer; an opinion which he rests on the number of blunders
                    which the author has committed. Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Optics,</hi> vol. ii.

                <p>As a naturalist .Aristotle made some valuable optical observations. He described,
                    with tolerable correctness, the phenomena of rainbows, halos, and parhelia. He
                    considered the rainbow as produced by the reflexion of the sun’s rays from the
                    drops of rain which gave an imperfect image of the sun; and he ascribes the
                    light which appears in the sun’s absence to the reflective power of the
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <p>The speculations of Seneca and Cleomedes derive any interest they may possess
                    from their absurdity. Seneca noticed the magnifying power of a bottle of glass
                    in enlarging small letters, and he observed that an angular piece of glass
                    produced all the colours of the rainbow. Cleomedes, in his cyclical theory of
                    motion, has given an elaborate explanation of the manner in which rays
                    proceeding from the eye render the objects which they meet visible, but it is
                    too stupid to demand the slightest attention.</p>
                <p>The science of optics may be justly considered as owing its origin to the
                    celebrated Claudius Ptolemy, the astronomer of Alexandria, who flourished at the
                    end of the first century. His work entitled <hi rend="italic">Ptolemaei</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Opticoum Sermones</hi><hi rend="italic">quinque ex
                    ArabicoLatine</hi><hi rend="italic">versi,</hi> was known in the time of Roger
                    Bacon to have treated on astronomical refractions, but it had escaped the notice
                    of philosophers, and its valuable contents were unknown until 1816, when
                    Delambre published an analysis of it from the manuscript in the Royal Library at
                    Paris. Montucla had, long before the discovery of the French manuscript,
                    mentioned that a manuscript copy of Ptolemy’s Optics was in the catalogue of the
                    Bodleian Library of Oxford. This interesting manuscript, which Professor Rigaud
                    was so kind as to examine at our request, belongs to the Savilian Library, and
                    had been the property of Sir Henry Savile himself. As in the Parisian manuscript
                    the first book is wanting, but it has no blank spaces like the Parisian one, and
                    it is accompanied with a preface by the translator, containing an abstract of
                    the work, and stating that the fifth book is imperfect. The translator mentions
                    that the second book had been previously translated from Arabic into Latin by
                    Amiratus Eugenius, a Sicilian, from the latest of two copies of which, the new
                    translation was made. The following abstract of this interesting work is taken
                    from Delambre’s Analysis, and from the translator’s abstract as communicated to
                    us by Professor Rigaud.</p>
                <p>“The Optics of Ptolemy consists of five books. The <hi rend="italic">first</hi>
                    book is wanting, but from the recapitulation of it at the beginning of the
                    second, it appears to have contained a dissertation on the relations between
                    light and vision, founded on the idea that the visual rays issue from the eye.
                    In the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> book he shews that we see better with two
                    eyes than with one, and that the object is not seen in the same place with one
                    eye as with two. Vision, he says, is single, if the two axes of the pyramids of
                    the visual rays are directed in the same manner on the object, but becomes
                    double if the axes are not directed in a similar manner, and if the distance is
                    a little less than the distance between the eyes. He next proceeds to find,
                    geometrically, the circumstances which produce single or double images. He
                    ascribes imperfection of sight in old men to a want of the visual virtue, which,
                    like the other faculties, decays with the approach of age; and he states that
                    those who have <hi rend="italic">concave</hi> eyes see at a less distance than
                    those who have not such eyes. Rapidity of motion, he asserts, confounds the
                    colours on awheel. If the colour is in the direction of a radius the wheel will
                    appear entirely of this colour, and if different colours are at different
                    distances from the centre, these will <pb break="no" facs="nls:194561402"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-1402-0349"/>appear on the wheel as so many concentric circles
                    differently coloured. When, after looking long at a coloured object, we direct
                    the eye to another, we attribute to it the colour of the first.</p>
                <p>“In the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> book, which treats of reflexion from plane
                    and concave mirrors, he shews, that in a plane mirror the object is seen in the
                    perpendicular, drawn from the object to the plane of the mirror and continued
                    behind it. He mentions that objects appear smaller towards the zenith and larger
                    toavards the horizon, because in the former case we see them in a position to
                    which we are less accustomed.</p>
                <p>“In concave mirrors the objects appear concave, and in convex ones they appear
                    convex, and the image is seen at the point of intersection of the reflected ray,
                    and the line drawn from the object to the centre of the sphere.</p>
                <p>“The <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> book treats of concave and compound mirrors,
                    and of the effects of two or more mirrors. In these mirrors an object may be
                    reflected and rendered visible by all the parts of the mirror, or by three, or
                    two, or even one point. The image may be either on the surface of the mirror, or
                    before the surface, or behind the eye, or behind the mirror. When the image is
                    behind the mirror, the distance of the object from the mirror is less than that
                    of the image. When the image is between the eye and the mirror the distance of
                    the object from the eye will be sometimes greater than the distance of the image
                    from the mirror, and sometimes it will be equal to it, and sometimes less. When
                    the object is between the mirror and the eye it will be seen in a part different
                    from that where it really is; and if we give it a motion in one direction it
                    will appear to move in the opposite direction.</p>
                <p>“The <hi rend="italic">fiftldoock</hi> is the most curious and valuable of th e
                    whole work. Ptolemy begins by explaining the experiment with the piece of money,
                    which, when concealed behind the side of a vessel, becomes visible by filling it
                    with water. The refraction of the visual ray in penetrating the water makes us
                    see the piece of money out of its place, and in the prolongation of the
                    primitive direction of the ray emitted from the eye. In order to measure this
                    refraction at different angles, Ptolemy employs a circle divided into 360°, the
                    inferior half of which is plunged in the water, so that the refracting surface
                    covers one of the diameters of the circle. The centre of the circle is marked by
                    a small coloured body, and a second similar body is fitted to one of the
                    quadrants out of the water, and at a given distance from the vertical diameter;
                    a third coloured body slides on the lower part, which is immersed in the water.
                    This last body is then pushed with a rod till the eye placed on the body in the
                    air sees all the three in a straight line. The two distances of the second and
                    third body from the vertical diameter are thus measured on the graduated
                    circle.</p>
                <p>“In this manner Ptolemy obtained the results in the following table, which
                    contains the angles of refraction from <hi rend="italic">air</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">water</hi> from 10° up to 80° of incidence.</p>

                <p>The mean of these ratios is 0 ’ 76736, differing little from the correct one,
                    viz. 0∙7486; and it is interesting to remark, that at an incidence of 40° and
                    50, where the angle of refraction can be measured most accurately, the results
                    of Ptolemy approach very near to the truth.</p>
                <p>“In order to measure the angles of refraction from air into glass, Ptolemy
                    adopted the ingenious idea of procuring a semi-cylinder of pure glass, and
                    adjusting the diameter of it so as to coincide with the horizontal diameter of
                    the graduated circle already described. By performing the very same experiments
                    which he made with water, he found that there was no refraction at a
                    perpendicular incidence; but that for every other position the angle in the air
                    was always greater than the angle in the glass, and the refraction greater than
                    in water. When the three bodies were placed in appearance in the same straight
                    line they always remained there, whether the eye was placed above the glass or
                    below it. The following are the refractions from <hi rend="italic">air</hi> to
                    <hi rend="italic">glass</hi> which he obtained in this manner :—</p>

                <p>Ptolemy now discusses the important subject of astronomical refraction, which he
                    ascribes to the difference of density between ether and air. If the visual ray,
                    he remarks, is stopped by an impenetrable body, it could not shew us a body
                    which is hid behind the first; and if the second becomes visible, it can only be
                    on account of the flexion of the visual ray. This flexion takes place at its
                    passage into a medium of different density; and the possibility of this flexion,
                    he asserts, may be proved by the following phenomena. By observations on the
                    stars, it was found that the parallels drawn through the apparent place of those
                    which rise or set, are those nearer the north pole than the paral-lels<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194561415" xml:id="kp-eb0716-1415-0350"/> which pass
                    through their apparent place when they are in the meridian; and the nearer the
                    stars are to the horizon, the greater is the approach of their parallels to the
                    pole. By observing a circumpolar star, Ptolemy found that it was nearer the pole
                    in its lower passage across the meridian; but when it was near the zenith, its
                    parallel became greater in appearance, whereas in the first case it became
                    smaller. Hence it follows that refraction raises the stars towards the zenith.
                    In order to explain the manner in which refractions operate, Ptolemy makes use
                    of the same figure upon which Cassini has since founded his theory. He employs
                    almost the same reasoning in order to determine the quantity of the refraction.
                    He remarks, that the more a ∙ star is elevated, the less will be the difference
                    between its true and its apparent place, and that this difference will be
                    nothing in the zenith, because a perpendicular ray experiences no flexion. He
                    demonstrates by a figure, that in every case the refraction carries the star
                    towards the zenith; and he states that the height of the atmosphere is unknown,
                    but that it must begin below the sphere of the moon. From this general account
                    of the fifth book of the Optics of Ptolemy, it will be seen that he gives a
                    theory of astronomical refractions much more complete than that of any
                    astronomer before the time of Cassini.</p>
                <p>These important results, which, without any other assistance, would have enabled
                    the optician to trace the progress of the rays of light through lenses of all
                    forms, were not applied as they might have been, to extend the boundaries of the
                    science. Banished from Europe, optics, along with the other sciences, found
                    shelter in Arabia; and after a period of a thousand years, it was destined to
                    receive fresh accessions in that favoured country.</p>
                <p>Alhazen, who flourished about the end of the eleventh century, was the individual
                    who gave this fresh impulse to optical science.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>AIontucla has very incorrectly charged
                    Alhazen with borrowing the greater part of his optics from Ptolemy. Delambre has
                    refuted this opinion, and rendered it probable that the Arabian philosopher
                    never saw the work of Ptolemy. What assistance he obtained from his predecessors
                    who flourished after Ptolemy cannot now be ascertained. See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Connaissance</hi><hi rend="italic">des Terns</hi> for 1816.</p></note> He
                    establishes the opinion of Pythagoras, that vision is performed by rays which
                    proceed from the object to the eye; and he states that vision is not completed
                    till the ideas of external objects are conveyed by the optic nerves to the
                    brain; and after a description of the eye and its parts, he assigns to each of
                    them the function which it performs in vision. He maintains that we see objects
                    singly with two eyes, because we must perceive only one image when it is formed
                    on corresponding parts of the retina. The instrument employed by Alhazen for
                    measuring the angle of refraction, is more complex than that used by Ptolemy,
                    and his knowledge of the refraction of the atmosphere and of fluids, is
                    obviously inferior to that of the Alexandrian philosopher. Alhazen ascribes to
                    refraction the twinkling of the stars, and the contraction of the diameters and
                    distances of the heavenly bodies; and it follows from his method of reasoning,
                    that refraction elevated the stars towards the pole and not towards the zenith,
                    as had been sagaciously ascertained by Ptolemy. Alhazen has described <hi
                    rend="italic">seven</hi> species of mirrors, and he was the first person who
                    determined the focus of rays after reflexion, when the place of the object is
                    known. He has treated largely of optical illusions, whether produced in direct
                    or in refracted and reflected vision; and he ascribes the size of the horizontal
                    moon to the apparent form of the concavity of the sky, which is imagined to be
                    more remote in the horizon than any where else. Alhazen likewise observed that
                    objects were magnified when held close to the plane wall of the larger segments

                <p>The mean of these ratios is 0∙66976, whereas that obtained by Ptolemy is 0∙68736,
                    and the true ratio 0∙645l6.</p>
                <p>In comparing this last table with the similar one given by Ptolemy, we cannot
                    fail to be struck with their entire similarity, with the single exception of the
                    angle of refraction at 30° of incidence, which Vitello makes 19° 30', and
                    Ptolemy, in the Paris copy, 20° 30'. Now, in the Oxford manuscript, the numbers
                    are 18° 30'; and Professor Rigaud conjectures that the real number has been 19°
                    30', the same as Vitello’s. Hence we cannot on any just grounds regard the
                    measures of refraction given by the Polish philosopher as any thing else than
                    those of Ptolemy, from whom he must have borrowed them.</p>
                <p>By comparing the two tables for water, we are inclined to make the same
                    unfavourable supposition. The refraction for 20°, 30°, and 50° of incidence are
                    exactly the same in both; and Vitello’s measure for70°, viz.45° 30', is the same
                    as Ptolemy’s in the Oxford manuscript.</p>
                <p>But this opinion is converted into certainty when we examine Vitello’s table of
                    the refractions from water into glass, in which all the measures are <hi
                    rend="italic">identically</hi> the same with those of Ptolemy.</p>
                <p>In the course of his experiments, Vitello was led to observe that whenever light
                    was reflected or refracted by transparent bodies, a certain portion of it was
                    lost, but he does not estimate the quantity, contenting himself with the
                    observation that bodies always appear less luminous when seen by refracted and
                    reflected light. In treating of the cause of the rainbow, he shews that
                    refraction is as necessary<pb break="no" facs="nls:194561428"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-1428-0351"/> to its production as reflexion, hut he of course
                    does not ascribe the colours to refraction, regarding it merely as a means of
                    giving strength or condensation to the solar rays. He imitated the colours of
                    the rainbow, (which, like Seneca, he considers as having their origin in a
                    mixture of the sun’s rays with the blackness of the cloud), by placing a white
                    piece of paper beneath a circular vessel of glass containing water; but he says
                    that they are not the same colours with those of the rainbow, because they are
                    not in the same number, and do not reach the eye after reflexion. He shews that
                    in those countries where the meridian altitude of the sun exceeds the
                    semi-diameter of the rainbow, a rainbow cannot be seen at noon. His observations
                    on the foci of glass spheres, on the twinkling of the stars, and on other
                    optical phenomena, are of no value, and rather tend to confirm the severe
                    censures which Baptista Porta has pronounced upon his scientific character.</p>

                    have agreed in regarding Bacon as the inventor of the telescope, while Dr. Smith

                    content ourselves with giving a single extract respecting the telescope and
                    microscope.</p>
                <p>“Greater things than these may be performed by refracted vision. For it is easy
                    to understand by the causes above mentioned, that the greatest things may appear
                    exceeding small, and on the contrary; also that the most remote objects may
                    appear just at hand, and on the contrary. For we can give such figures to
                    transparent bodies, and dispose them in such order with respect to the eye and
                    the objects, that the rays shall be refracted and bent towards any place we
                    please; so that we shall see the object near at band, or at a distance, under
                    any angle we please. And thus from an incredible distance we may read the
                    smallest letters, and may number the smallest particles of dust and sand, by
                    reason of the greatness of the angle under which we may see them; and on the
                    contrary, we may not be able to see the greatest bodies just by us, by reason of
                    the smallness of the angles under which they may appear; for distance does not
                    affect this kind of vision, excepting by accident, but the quantity of the
                    angle. And thus a boy may appear to be a giant, and a man as big as a mountain,
                    forasmuch as we may see the man under as great an angle as the mountain, and as
                    near as we please; and thus a small army may appear a very great one, and,
                    though very far off, yet very near us, and on the contrary. Thus also the sun,
                    moon, and stars may be made to descend hither in appearance, and to appear over
                    the heads of our enemies; and many things of the like sort, which would astonish
                    unskilful persons.”</p>
                <p>Whether these remarks were the result of speculation or of actual experiment, it
                    is not easy at this distance of time to determine; but in opposition to the
                    opinion of Dr Smith, we may adduce a passage from <hi rend="italic">ΜccονdCs,
                    Pathway to Knowledge,</hi> printed in 1551, in which he distinctly speaks of a
                    glasse used by friar Bacon. “Great talke there is of a glasse he made at Oxford,
                    in which men might see things that weare don, and that was iudged to be don by
                    power of euill spirites. But <hi rend="italic">I know</hi> the reason of it to
                    be good and natu ral, and to be arright by geometry (with perspective as a part
                    of it), and to stand as well with reason as to see your face in a common
                    glass.”</p>
                <p>On the authority of various passages in the writings of friar Bacon, Mr. Molyneux
                    is of opinion that he was acquainted with the use of spectacles, and when Bacon
                    says that “this instrument (a plano-convex glass, or large segment of a sphere),
                    is useful to old men, and to those that have weak eyes; for they may see the
                    smallest letters sufficiently magnified,” we are at least entitled to conclude
                    that the particular way of assisting decayed sight which he describes was known
                    to him, though he may not have used his segment of a glass sphere in looking at
                    objects separated by an interval from its plane side. But whether spectacles
                    were in use or not in Bacon’s time, it is quite certain that they were known and
                    used about the time of his death, which happened in 1292. Alexander de Spina, a
                    native of Pisa, who died in that city in 1313, having seen a pair of spectacles
                    made by some other person, who was unwilling to communicate the secret of their
                    construction, got a pair made for himself, and found them so useful, that he
                    cheerfully made the invention public. Μ. Spoon,<note anchored="true"

                    the invention between 1280 and 1311. Signior Redi, from whom Spoon quotes the
                    preceding fact, states that he possesses a manuscript written in 1299, <hi
                    rend="italic">Di Governo della Familia de Scan-dro di Pissozzo,</hi> in which
                    the author says, “I find myself so pressed by age, that I can neither read nor
                    write without those glasses they call spectacles, lately invented, to the great
                    advantage of poor old men, when their sight grows weak.” It is stated also in
                    the Italian Dictionary <hi rend="italic">Della Crusea,</hi> under the head of
                    <hi rend="italic">Occhiale</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Spectacles,</hi> that friar
                    Jordan de Rivalto, who died at Pisa in 1311, tells his audience, in one of his
                    sermons, which were published in 1305, “that it is not twenty years since the
                    art of making spectacles was found out, and is indeed one of the best and most
                    necessary inventions in the world.” Bernard Gordon, too, a celebrated physician
                    of Montpellier, in his <hi rend="italic">Lilium Medi~ cinae,</hi> published
                    about 1305, recommends an eye salve as capable of making the patient read the
                    smallest letters without spectacles; and ÂIuschenbroek informs us that it is
                    inscribed on the tomb of Salvinus Armatus, a Florentine nobleman, who died in
                    1317, that he was the inventor of spectacles.</p>
                <p>Before we quit the period of Friar Bacon we must notice a claim to the invention
                    of the telescope which has been made in favour of Leonard Digges, an Englishman,
                    because this claim, whatever be its amount, supports undeniably the prior claim
                    of Bacon. The claim of Digges is founded on passages in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pantometria</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Stratiotikos.</hi> The first of these
                    works appeared at London in 1571, and a second edition of it, edited by his son
                    Thomas Digges, Esq., was published in 1591. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stratiotikos</hi> was published in 1579 and also in 1590. In the preface to the
                    second edition of the <hi rend="italic">Pantometria,</hi> Thomas Digges remarks:
                    “My father, by his continuell painfull practices, assisted by demonstrations
                    mathematical, was able, and sundrie times hath, by proportional! glasses, duely
                    situate in conuenient angles, not onely discouered things fàrre off, read
                    letters, numbred peeces of money, with the verye coyne and superscription
                    thereof, cast by some of his freends of purpose upon downes in the open fields,
                    but also seuen miles off declared what hath beene doone in priuate places.”</p>
                <p>In thetwenty-first chapter of the first book, Leonard Digges himself says, “But
                    marvellous are the conclusions that may be performed by glasses (mirrors)
                    concave and convex, of circular and parabolic forms, using for multiplications
                    of <pb break="no" facs="nls:194561441" xml:id="kp-eb0716-1441-0352"/>beams,
                    sometimes the aid of glasses transposed, which, by practice, should unite or
                    dissipate the images or figures presented by the reflection of others. By these
                    kind of glasses, or rather frames of them placed in due angles, yee may not only
                    set out the proportion of an whole region, yea, represent before your eye the
                    lively image of every house, village, &amp;c., and that in as little or great
                    space or plan as ye will presente; but also augment or dilate any parcell
                    thereof, so that, whereas, at the first appearance a whole tonn shall present
                    itself so small and compact together that ye shall not discover any difference
                    of streets, yee may, by application of glasses in due proportion, cause any
                    peculiar house or room thereof dilate and shew itself in as ample form as the
                    whole touns at first appeared, so that yee shall discern any trifle, or read any
                    letter lying there open, especially if the sun beams may come into it, as
                    plainly as if you were eorpore-ally pressent, although it be distant from you as
                    far as eye can discrie. But of these conclusions I mind not here more to
                    introduce, having at large, in a volume by itself, opened the miraculous effects
                    of perspective glasses.”</p>
                <p>Now it is a curious fact that Thomas Digges exprèssly says that his father’s
                    knowledge of optics “partly grew by the aid he had by one old written book of
                    Bakon’s Experiments, that by strange aduenture, or rather destinie, came to his
                    hands.”</p>
                <p>In support of the opinion that the telescope was known in England more than forty
                    years before 1609 or 1610, when it was supposed to have been invented in
                    Holland, we may quote a passage or two from the celebrated John Dee’s
                    mathematical preface to Euclid, written at Matloke on the 9th of February 1570,
                    the year in which it was published. “Is it not,” says he, “greatly against the
                    sovereignty of man’s nature to be so overshot and abused with things before his
                    eyes? things far off to seem neer, and neer to seem far off; small things to
                    seem great and great to seem small; one man to seem an army, ora man to be
                    constantly afraid of his own shadow; yea, so much to fear, that if you, being
                    alone, near a certain glasse,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>By a glass, he means “any thing from which a beam
                    reboundeth.”</p></note> and profer with dagger or sword to foyne at the glasse,
                    you shall suddenly be moved to give back by reason of an image appearing in the
                    air between you and the glass, with like hand, sword, or dagger, and with like
                    quickness foyning at your eye, likewise as you do at the glasse.” He then
                    mentions that such a glass was in the possession of a gentleman famous and
                    honourable for his good service done to his country. Dee likewise speaks of
                    having seen once or twice in company -with Orontius at St. Denis in 1551; “The
                    lively image of another man in the air aloft, walking to and fro or standing
                    still ;” but the most remarkable passage is that in which he speaks of the means
                    of ascertaining the numbers of an enemy’s army; “The herald, pursuivant,
                    sergiant royall, captain, or whosoever is careful to come near the truth herein;
                    besides the judgment of his expert eye, his skill of ordering taeticaly, the
                    help of his geometrical instrument; ring or stafte astrono-mical, commodiously
                    framed for carriage and use. <hi rend="italic">He may wonderfully help himself
                    by perspective glasses,</hi> in which I trust our posterity will prove more
                    skilful and expert, and to greater purposes than in these days can be credited
                    to be possible.”</p>
                <p>When polite learning began to revive in Europe some of the more abstract sciences
                    began to be cultivated with success. Maurolycus, a teacher of mathematics at
                    Messina, was particularly distinguished by his optical researches, of which he
                    published an account in his <hi rend="italic">Theoremata</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">Lumine</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Umbra</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">JDiaphanorum Partes,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >seu libri tres.</hi> In the first of these works, which was completed in 1525,
                    but not published till 1575, Maurolycus treats of the measure of light, or the
                    illumination of bodies, and he particularly explained the curious phenomenon
                    which had been observed since the time of Aristotle, that when the sun shone
                    through an aperture of any form, the figure of the aperture always appeared
                    round, except when the sun was eclipsed, when it had the appearance of a
                    crescent. He shews that each point of the aperture is the apex of two opposite
                    cones of rays, one of which has the sun for its base, while the other, when cut
                    by a plane at right angles to its axis, will produce a luminous circle, whose
                    diameter will be proportional to the distance of the plane from the aperture.
                    “Consequently if these images be taken at a considerable distance from the
                    aperture, and therefore be pretty large when the aperture itself is small; since
                    the whole image consists of a number of images, all of which are circular, the
                    image of the sun formed by the aperture, of whatever form it be, must be
                    circular also; and it will approach the nearer to a perfect circle the smaller
                    is the aperture and the more distant the image.” It may be easily shewn, indeed,
                    that a small aperture acts like a lens in forming an inverted picture of all
                    external objects in a dark chamber, and that then pictures become more distinct
                    in their outline as the aperture becomes smaller. Hence the sun’s image is
                    round, or a crescent, according as the sun’s disc is entire or eelipsed. In
                    studying the phenomena of vision Mauro-lyeus was very successful. He shews that
                    the crystalline humour is a lens which collects the rays which enter the eye and
                    converges them to foei on the retina; but he does not seem to have found that
                    these foci depict an exact image or picture of the object upon the retina.
                    Limited, however, as this discovery was, it enabled him to ascertain the cause
                    of <hi rend="italic">long</hi> and <hi rend="italic">short-sightedness,</hi> the
                    pencils in the former case coming to a focus before they entered the retina, and
                    in the latter at points beyond the retina. Hence, as in both these cases, vision
                    is indistinct either from a too early or a too late convergence of the rays, he
                    concluded that concave glasses of suitable focus would relieve the ∣
                    short-sighted person, and convex glasses the long-sighted ∣ person.</p>
                <p>The subject of the rainbow also occupied Maurolycus’s <hi rend="subscript">
                    t</hi> i attention. He found the diameter of the outer bow 42°, ∣ and that of
                    the inner from 53° to 56°; but according to the theory which he adopted, namely
                    that part of the sun’s rays! were partly reflected from the exterior of the
                    drop, while <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> the rest entered the drop and
                    circulated within it by reflexion along the sides of an octagon; the diameters
                    of the bow should have been 45° and 56° ∙ Maurolycus supposed the colours of the
                    rainbow to be <hi rend="italic">four,</hi> namely, <hi rend="italic">orange,
                    (crocus), green, blue, and purple.</hi> Taking his <hi rend="italic">crocus</hi>
                    to be red, his enumeration in leaving out the yellow, as Dr. Wollaston did more
                    recently, shew much accuracy of observation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The yellow which is in the sun’s direct rays is observed
                    when the sun’s rays are reflected from the sky or from clouds.</p></note>
                    Maurolycus attempted to discover the law of refraction but without success. He
                    supposed that the angle of refraction was always five-eighths of the angle of
                    incidence, which is a tolerably correct estimate in the case of glass, but quite
                    erroneous for bodies of low and high refractive powers.</p>
                <p>Maurolycus may be considered as the first discoverer of the aberration of figure,
                    in so far as he observed that the rays which were incident at a distance from
                    the axis of a transparent sphere, had their focus nearer the sphere than those
                    which were incident nearer the axis. This happy observation was the result of
                    his having noticed the caustic curves formed by such spheres, which he justly
                    described as arising from the continued intersections of the refracted rays.</p>
                <p>While the Sicilian philosopher was making newand important discoveries a
                    celebrated Neapolitan, Joannes Baptista Porta, was endeavouring to promote the
                    interests of science, as an ardent collector of its stores,aswell as an original
                    inquirer., into its mysteries. He established an Academy of Sciences <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194561454" xml:id="kp-eb0716-1454-0353"/> which held its
                    sittings in his own house, and which numbered among its members all the <hi
                    rend="italic">virtuosi</hi> in Naples. Each member was bound to contribute to
                    the common stock something not commonly known, and in this way he obtained the
                    materials for his <hi rend="italic">Magia Naturalis</hi> which appeared in the
                    year 1560,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A second and

                    when he was only about fifteen years of age. This work was speedily translated
                    into French, Hebrew, Spanish, and Arabic, and went through numerous editions in
                    different parts of Europe. The Papal court viewed with jealousy the proceedings
                    of a society which devoted so much energy to the spread of knowledge, and,
                    though Baptista Porta was a Roman Catholic, the meetings of the academy were
                    prohibited by the ecclesiastical power. Although Baptista Porta was well
                    acquainted with the writings of his predecessors, yet the principal invention
                    recorded in his Natural Magic is that of the camera obscura, which he seems to
                    have brought to great perfection. He remarks, in the 17th chapter of this work,
                    that if a small aperture is made in the shutter of a dark room, distinct images
                    of all external objects will be depicted on the opposite wall in their true
                    colours; and he further adds that if a convex lens be fixed in the opening, so
                    that the images are received on a surface at the distance of its focal length,
                    the pictures will be rendered so much more distinct that the features of a
                    person standing on the outside of the window may be readily recognised in his
                    inverted image. Various attempts seem to have been made to obtain an erect image
                    of objects in the camera obscura, but the contrivances for this purpose had the
                    effect, as Baptista Porta assures us, of making the pictures so obscure that
                    there was no pleasure in viewing them. He observes, however, that the image may
                    be best rendered erect by receiving it “upon a concave mirror properly adapted
                    to the convex lens and held at a great distance from the hole.” The effect of
                    this expedient, he says, cannot be sufficiently admired. Baptista Porta applied
                    his instrument to the representation of eclipses of the sun, and of hunting
                    scenes, battles, and other events produced by moveable pictures and drawings. In
                    this way he magnified small objects and drawings, and produced the effects of
                    the magic lantern by the light of the sun in place of that of a lamp. He
                    considered the eye as a camera obscura, the pupil as the hole in the window
                    contracting and dilating with different lights, and the crystalline lens as the
                    principal organ of vision, though he seems to have regarded it not as his convex
                    lens but as the tablet on which the images of external objects were formed, the
                    cornea being, no doubt, in his estimation, the part of the eye which formed the
                    picture. Baptista Porta was doubtless acquainted with what may be called the
                    simplest form of the refracting telescope, namely, that in which a convex lens
                    is the object-glass, and the eye placed six inches behind its focus, the
                    eye-glass. He found that when his eye was thus placed behind a convex lens, he
                    could read a letter which he could not read with his naked eye. His lens must
                    have exceeded in focal length, the distance at which his eye saw distinctly, for
                    the magnifying power of such a telescope is equal to the focal length of the
                    object-glass divided by that distance.</p>
                <p>In another place Porta, after mentioning the effects produced by a concave and a
                    convex lens separately, remarks, “that if you knew how to combine one of each
                    sort rightly, you would see both far and near objects larger and more clearly.”
                    “If Porta,”-says Mr. Drinkwater Bethune, in his admirable life of Galileo, “had
                    stopped here, he might more securely have enjoyed the reputation of the
                    invention, but he then professes to describe the construction of his instrument,
                    which has no relation whatever to his previous remarks.” “I shall now endeavour
                    to shew in what manner we may contrive to recognise our friends at the distance
                    of several miles, and how those of weak sight may read the most minute letters
                    from a distance. It is an invention of great utility, and grounded on optical
                    principles, nor is it at all difficult of execution; but it must be so divulged
                    as not to be understood by the vulgar, and yet be clear to the sharp-sighted.”
                    The description which follows, seems far enough removed from the apprehended
                    danger of being too clear; and indeed every writer who has hitherto quoted it,
                    has merely given the passage in its original Latin, apparently despairing of an
                    intelligible translation. With some alterations in the punctuation, which appear
                    necessary to bring it into any grammatical construction, it may be supposed to
                    bear something like the following meaning :—“Let a view be contrived in the
                    centre of a mirror, where it is most effective. All the solar rays are
                    exceedingly dispersed, and do not in the least come together (in the true
                    centre); but there is a concourse of all the rays in the central part of the
                    said mirror, half way towards the other centre, where the cross diameters meet.
                    This view is contrived in the following manner: A concave cylindrical mirror
                    placed directly in front, but with its axis inclined, must be adapted to the
                    focus; and let obtuse angled, or right angled triangles be cut out with two
                    cross lines on each side drawn from the centre, and a glass <hi rend="italic"
                    >(specillum)</hi> will be completely fit for the purposes we mentioned.” If it
                    were not for the word <hi rend="italic">specillum,</hi> which, in the passage
                    immediately preceding this, Porta contrasts with <hi rend="italic"
                    >speculum,</hi> and which he afterwards explains to mean a glass lens, it would
                    be very clear that the foregoing passage, supposing it to have any meaning, must
                    be referred to a reflecting telescope; and it is a little singular, that whilst
                    this obscure passage has attracted universal attention, no one, so far as we are
                    aware, has taken any notice of the following unequivocal description of the
                    principal part of Newton’s construction <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the same
                    instrument. It is in the fifth chapter of the seventeenth book, where Porta
                    explains by what device exceedingly minute letters may be read without
                    difficulty. “Place a concave mirror so that the back of it may lie against your
                    breast; opposite to it and within the burning point, place the writing; put a
                    plane mirror behind it, that may be under your eyes. Then the images of the
                    letters which are in the concave mirror, and which the concave has magnified,
                    will be reflected in the plane mirror, so that you may read without difficulty.”
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi></p>
                <p>On these grounds Porta claimed for himself the invention of the telescope; and
                    his death which took place in 1615, at the age of eighty, is said to have been
                    hastened by the exhaustion of writing a work on that instrument.</p>
                <p>At a more advanced age, Baptista Porta composed another work entitled, <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Refractione Optices</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >parte,</hi><hi rend="italic">libri novem,</hi> which appeared in 1593, but
                    contains nothing that is deserving of particular notice.</p>
                <p>The subject of the rainbow, which had hitherto been a <hi rend="italic">questio
                    vexata</hi> among philosophers, now began to excite notice, as much from the
                    absurdity of the theories which were advanced to explain it, as from the native
                    interest of the subject. Clichtoveus, whom Dr. Priestley supposes to be the
                    person who distinguished himself by his opposition to Luther, had maintained
                    that the second rainbow was a reflected image of the first, not only from the
                    faintness of its light, but from the inversion of its colours; an opinion which
                    our celebrated countryman, Dr. Gilbert has justly ridiculed, alleging, that the
                    whole form of the bow ought to be inverted as well as its colours, and that it
                    ought to have its convex side downwards.</p>
                <p>A more correct theory of the rainbow was about this time proposed by J. Fleschier
                    of Breslau, in his treatise entitled, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Iridibus doctrina Aristotelis</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Vitellionis,</hi> which was published in 1571. He supposes the rays to suffer
                    two refractions, one on entering, and the other on emerging <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194561467" xml:id="kp-eb0716-1467-0354"/> from the drop, but after one
                    ray had thus been separated into a coloured beam by these refractions, he
                    supposed that this beam was reflected to the eye from another drop.</p>
                <p>These views, imperfect as they are, paved the way for the true theory of the
                    rainbow. <hi rend="italic">A</hi> ntonio de Dominis, archbishop of Spalatro,
                    first broached this theory in his treatise <hi rend="italic">De Padus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Fisus et Lucis,</hi> which was published in 1611. He justly
                    asserts that two refractions in a drop of water, and one intermediate
                    reflection, were sufficient to bring back to the eye of the spectator the rays
                    of light by which the bow was formed. An experiment with a globe of glass
                    enclosing water, either suggested to him or confirmed this opinion. In following
                    out this experiment, however, our author committed several mistakes. He
                    explained the exterior boav by the same number of refractions and one reflexion,
                    but he supposed that the rays which formed it were returned to the eye by a part
                    of the drop lower than that which transmitted the red of the interior bow. In
                    addition to this mistake, he supposed that the rays which went to form one of
                    the bows, came from the upper part, and that which went to form the other bow
                    from the under part of the sun’s disc. Notwithstanding these mistakes, De
                    Dominis is entitled to be regarded as the true discoverer of the cause of the
                    primary rainbow.</p>
                <p>The treatise containing these discoveries was not published till after the use of
                    the telescope by Galileo, but Bartolo, who published it, informs us in the
                    preface, to use the words of the author of the <hi rend="italic">Life of
                    Galileo,</hi> “that the manuscripts was communicated to him from a collection of
                    papers written twenty years before, on his enquiring the archbishop’s opinions
                    with respect to the newly discovered instrument, and that he got leave to
                    publish it, ‘ with the addition of one or two chapters.’ The treatise contains a
                    complete description of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> telescope, which, however, is
                    proposed merely to be an improvement on spectacles; and if the authoPs intention
                    had been to interpolate an after-written account in order to secure to himself
                    the undeserved honour of the invention, it seems improbable that he would have
                    suffered an acknowledgment of additions, previous to publication, to be inserted
                    in the preface. Besides, the whole tone of the work is that of a candid and
                    truth-seeking philosopher, very far indeed, removed from being, as Montucla
                    calls him, conspicuous for ignorance even among the ignorant men of his age. He
                    gives a drawing of a convex and concave lens, and traces the passage of the rays
                    through them; to which he subjoins, that he has not satisfied himself with any
                    determination of the precise distance to which the glasses should be separated
                    according to their convexity and concavity, but recommends the proper distance
                    to be found by actual experiment, and tells us that the effect of the instrument
                    will be to prevent the confusion arising from the interference of the direct and
                    refracted rays, and to magnify the object by increasing the visible angle under
                    which it is viewed.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>From the great liberality of his sentiments, and his conversion to the protestant
                    faith, this eminent ecclesiastic was obliged to leave Italy, and to take refuge
                    in London, in 1616, where he lived some years. Having been induced to return to
                    Italy, his imprudence exposed him to new persecutions, and having been
                    imprisoned by Urban VIII. he died of poison in the prison of the Inquisition.
                    Sentence was passed upon him after his death, and his body, with all his books
                    and papers were publicly burnt in the Campo de Fero, in the year 1624.</p>
                <p>We now approach the time when the telescope was unquestionably invented. We have
                    no doubt thatthis invaluable instrument was invented by Roger Bacon or Baptista
                    Porta, in the form of an experiment, though it perhaps had not in their hands
                    assumed the maturity of an instrument made for sale, and applied to useful
                    purposes both terrestrial and celestial. If <hi rend="italic">a</hi> telescope
                    is an instrument by means of which things at a distance can be seen better than
                    by the naked eye, then Baptista Porta’s concave lens with his eye looking at the
                    image which it formed, and reading a letter too remote to be otherwise legible,
                    was a real telescope; but if we give the name to a tube having a convex object
                    glass at one end, and a convex or a concave lens at the other, placed at the
                    distance of the sum or the difference of their focal lengths, then we have no
                    distinct evidence that such an instrument was used before the beginning of the
                    seventeenth century.</p>
                <p>In his <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Dioptrics,</hi> Descartes has ascribed the
                    invention of the telescope to James Metius, a citizen of Alkmaer in Holland; but
                    Huygens in mentioning this claim<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Dioptrics,</hi> p. 163-4.</p></note> says,
                    that “<hi rend="italic">to his certain knowledge</hi> telescopes were made
                    before this, at Middleburg in Zealand, about the year 1609, either by John
                    Lippersheim, whom Sirturus mentions, or by Zacharias (Jansen), whom Borellus
                    makes the first inventor of them in his book <hi rend="italic">de Vero
                    Telescopii</hi><hi rend="italic">inventore.</hi> The telescope which they made
                    did not exceed a foot and a half long. But much earlier than both, Joannes
                    Baptista Porta a Neapolitan, had delivered the rudiments of this art in his book
                    on dioptrics and natural magic, published fifteen years before telescopes
                    appeared in our Belgium. In these books he speaks of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >specilla</hi> as shewing things placed at a distance as if they were nigh, and
                    also of the construction of concave and convex lenses. But that he made no great
                    progress in this art is hence evident, that in all that time it did not become
                    famous; and that he did not discover any of those things in the heavens that
                    were observed afterwards. And this shews that his invention was not owing to his
                    skill, but to some accidental experiments. For though he had some degree of
                    knowledge in mathematicks, yet he did not understand those fundamental
                    principles and abstruse theorems in dioptricks, that are necessary to invent a
                    telescope by reason; and by much less did those illiterate mechanicks that I
                    mentioned before. But no wonder that good luck and casual experiments should
                    produce this effect; after spectacles and concave glasses, for defective eyes of
                    both sorts, had been commonly used for above three hundred years, it is rather
                    surprizing that so obvious a thing should be so long unknown.”</p>
                <p>In this passage Huygens leaves the claims of his two Dutch friends on the same
                    level; but though Borellus adopts the conclusion that Jansen was the inventor,
                    yet it has been ingeniously suggested, that Jansen’s claim as the inventor of
                    the microscope, has been mixed up with the invention of the telescope, on the
                    evidence adduced by Borellus. On this hypothesis Lippersheim is supposed to have
                    invented the telescope by accident in 1609, and that Jansen possessing an
                    instrument so like it, had been able, after hearing of Lippersheim’s
                    contrivance, to make a similar instrument without having seen the telescope of
                    his rival.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>Much light has recently been thrown on the history <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    telescope by Professor Moll, who has discussed the claims of the various
                    competitors with much sagacity and fairness. It appears from the official acts
                    and journals of the States General of Holland, still existing among the archives
                    at the Hague, that on the 2d of October 1608 that body took into consideration a
                    petition from Hans (John) Lippershey, a native of Wesell, and spectacle maker at
                    Middleburg, praying, that an instrument which he had invented for seeing at a
                    distance, might be rewarded, either by granting an exclusive privilege of making
                    it for thirty years, or an annual pension to enable him to make these
                    instruments for Holland alone. It was resolved, that a committee<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194561480" xml:id="kp-eb0716-1480-0355"/> should communicate with the
                    petitioner, and enquire if he could not so improve the instrument <hi
                    rend="italic">so as to enable one to look through it with both eyes.</hi>
                    Lippershey offered to make three telescopes of <hi rend="italic">rock
                    crystal</hi> for <hi rend="italic">one thousand florins</hi> each, (about L.83
                    each) but the committee was instructed to get him to moderate his charge, and
                    promise never to transmit his invention to any body. On the 6th of October a
                    bargain was made that Lippershey should construct one instrument of rock crystal
                    for the State, at the price of 900 florins, (L.75) 300 florins to be paid down,
                    and 600 when the telescope was completed and approved of. On the 16th December
                    the committee report, “that they examined the instrument invented by Lippershey
                    to see at a distance <hi rend="italic">with two eyes,</hi> and that they
                    approved of it.” But, in reference to the exclusive privilege, they “resolved
                    that, whereas it appears <hi rend="italic">that many other persons have a
                    knowledge of this new invention</hi> to see at a distance, it is expedient to
                    refuse the prayer of the petitioner for an exclusive privilege, but that he will
                    be commanded to make, within a certain time, two other instruments of his
                    invention for seeing with two eyes, at the same price.” These two new
                    instruments were delivered before the 13th February 1609·</p>
                <p>While these transactions were going on, Jacob Adriaansz, sometimes called Metins
                    of Alkmaer petitioned the States-General on the !7th of October 1608, for an
                    exclusive privilege for a similar instrument. He was the third son of Adriaan
                    Anthonisz, or Metius, who discovered the approximate ratio of the diameter of a
                    circle to its circumference. His petition still exists among the manuscripts of
                    Huygens, in the library at Leyden. He alleges, that he began his researches as
                    far back as 1606; that the invention was accidental, and when he was making
                    other experiments; and that, in 1608, when he sent in his petition, his
                    instrument was made of bad materials. He at the same time readily admits, that a
                    spectacle maker of Middleburg had offered before him a similar instrument to the
                    States, which had been tried by Prince Maurice, and other persons.</p>
                <p>With regard to the claims of Zacharias Jansen, or rather Tansz or Zansz, they
                    cannot be supported by any evidence, and there is reason to believe, as we shall
                    afterwards see, that his invention of the microscope was mistaken for the
                    invention of the telescope.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    which he has established by authentic documents.</p>
                <p>“That on the 21st of October 1608, John, or Hans Lippershey, a native of Wezel, a
                    spectacle maker of Middleburg, in Zeeland, was actually in possession of the
                    invention of telescopes.</p>
                <p>“That, on the 17th of October, of the same year 1608, Jacob Adriaansz, sometimes
                    called Metins of Alkmaer in Holland, also was in possession of the art of making
                    telescopes, and that he actually made those instruments; but that either from
                    disgust or some other reason, he afterwards concealed his invention, and thus
                    actually gave up every claim attached to the honour of it.</p>
                <p>“That there is little reason to believe that either ∏ans, or his son Zacharias
                    Zansz, were also inventors of the telescope; but there is every probability that
                    this Hans, or John, or his son Zacharias Zansz, invented a compound microscope
                    about 1590.</p>
                <p>“That this Lippershey used reek or mountain crystal in the construction of
                    telescopes, and that he is the inventor of the Binoculus.”</p>
                <p>when Galileo was at Venice in 1609, he heard rumours that an instrument which
                    represented distant objects as if they were near, had been invented by a Dutch
                    spectacle maker. This rumour was confirmed by a letter which he received from
                    James Badorere at Paris, and Galileo, who asserts that he had never seen one of
                    the instruments, set himself to discover the principle of their construction,
                    and to make one for his own use. It has become a question, though one of no
                    interest, and affecting the veracity more than the reputation of Galileo,
                    whether the Italian philosopher had actually seen one of the new instruments. We
                    cannot hesitate for a moment in believing Galileo’s assertion; and even if we
                    confide in the statement made by Fuearius, that he had himself seen one of the
                    Dutch telescopes, which at that time had been brought to Venice, it by no means
                    follows that Galileo saw it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The following is Galileo’s account of the matter, from a letter which he wrote in
                    March 1610: “It is about ten months ago that it came to our ears, that a glass
                    had been worked by a Belgian, by the help of which, visible objects, though at a
                    great distance from the eye of the observer, may be seen distinctly. (In the
                    Italian of the Saggiatore it is added, <hi rend="italic">ne pia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aggiunto, no more was added, or this was all.)</hi> And some
                    experiments were related of the admirable effects of this instrument, which some
                    believed, and others not. A few days afterwards the same was confirmed by
                    letters of a noble Frenchman, Jacob de Badorere, from Paris; all which
                    occasioned me to apply myself wholly to enquire into the cause of this, and to
                    think on the means by which the invention of a similar instrument might be
                    brought about; in which I succeeded in a sb.ort time, assisted by the-doctrine
                    of refraction: and I first procured a leaden tube, (an organ pipe) at the end of
                    which I adapted spectacle glasses, both plane on one side, the one convex on the
                    other side, the second concave. Bringing the eye near the concave glass, I saw
                    the objects large, and near enough: they appeared three times nearer, and nine
                    times larger, than if seen with the naked eye.</p>
                <p>“Afterwards I made another instrument, which made objects appear sixty times
                    larger.</p>
                <p>“Finally, sparing neither industry nor expence, I succeeded so far as to make an
                    instrument of such excellence, as to make the objects seen through it appear a
                    thousand times larger, and more than thirty times nearer, than if seen with the
                    natural power of the eye.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    with this information only, Galileo returned to Padua and succeeded in finding
                    out the principle in the following night.</p>

                    therefore have been obtained from Holland; and in a letter from Sir William

                    you can get them.” In a letter dated July 6, 1610, Sir Christopher Heyden writes
                    to his friend Camden, “I have read Galileus, and to be short, do concur with him
                    in opinion, for his reasons are demonstrative; and of my own experience with one
                    of our ordinary trunks, I have told eleven stars in the Pleiades, whereas no age

                    From this and other facts, Professor Rigaud infers “that it is perfectly clear
                    that Harriot and his friend had been in the habit of using telescopes before the
                    discoveries of Galileo were known to them; and it appears likewise that in
                    1610,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Before
                    February.</p></note> they were manufactured in England.” The magnifying power of

                    1610, he says, “I have received the perspective cylinder that you promised me,
                    and am sorrie that my man gave you not more warning, that I might have had also

                    spot which represents unto mc the man in the moone (but without a head) is first
                    to be scene. A little after, neare the brimme of the gibbous parts, towards the
                    upper corner, appeare luminous parts like starres, much brighter than the rest;
                    and the whole brimme along lookes like unto the description of coasts in the
                    Dutch bookes of voyages. In the full she appears like a tarte that my cooke made
                    me the last weeke. Here a vaine of bright stuffe, and there of darke, and so

                    yet an ingenious younge man that accompanies me here often, and loves you and
                    these studies much, sees manie of these things, even without the helpe of the

                    Protheroe.”</p>
                <p>It is highly probable that the first Dutch telescopes had their eye-glass
                    concave, like Galileo’s, though this supposition is opposed by the traditional
                    story of a large and inverted image of a weathercock having been seen through
                    the earliest of them, in which case the eye-glass must have been convex. Even so
                    late as the period when Descartes published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dioptrics,</hi> which was in 1637, no other telescope but a Galilean one had
                    been described, excepting in Kepler’s <hi rend="italic">Diaptrica,</hi> which
                    appeared at Frankfort in 1611. In his 86th proposition he explains the theory of
                    the telescope, and has shewn how an instrument which produces the same effects
                    might be made, by substituting for the usual concave eye-glass <hi rend="italic"
                    >one or more convex</hi> eye-glasses. Kepler, however, does not seem to have
                    constructed such a telescope, and father Scheiner<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Rosa Ursina.</hi>
                    1650.</p></note> seems to have been the first person who embodied the plan in an
                    actual instrument, which has ever since been known by the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">astronomical telescope,</hi> in consequence of the inversion of
                    the images not being disagreeable in astronomical observations.</p>
                <p>The real inventor of the compound microscope is as little known as the inventor
                    of the telescope. It would be in vain to inquire into the history of the single
                    microscope, for the magnifying power of globes was known to the ancients; and no
                    individual ambition or national partiality has endeavoured to assign the honour
                    of inventing it to any person whatever. We agree with Professor Moll, that
                    Zacharias Zansz, or Jansen, has the best claims to be considered as the inventor
                    and constructor of the compound microscope. He seems to have made one so early
                    as 1590, and to have presented one to the Archduke Albert of Austria, who gave
                    it to Cornelius Drebell, who lived, as mathematician to the king, at the court
                    of our James the First. William Borcel, the envoy to England from the States <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> Holland, saw in England, in 1619, and in the hands of
                    Cornelius Drebell, the very microscope which Tansz had given to the archduke.
                    This account of its history was given by Drebell himself. The microscope in
                    question was eighteen inches long, consisting of a tube of gilt copper two
                    inches in diameter, supported by two sculptured dolphins, resting on a base o.
                    ebony, upon which the objects were placed. Μ. Fontana, a Neapolitan, first
                    described the compound microscope, consisting of two convex lenses, in his work
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Novae</hi><hi rend="italic">Terrestrium et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Celestium</hi><hi rend="italic">Observationes,</hi> which appeared
                    in 1646, but claims to have made the discovery so early as 1618, though he does
                    not adduce any evidence whatever of this fact. Huygens, on the contrary, says,
                    “It does not appear that these microscopes were made in the year 1618, because
                    Sirturus, who published a book that year about the origine and construction of
                    telescopes, would hardly have been silent upon so remarkable an invention, if it
                    had been thus known. Fontana, indeed, lays claim to it from the year 1618, in
                    his book of <hi rend="italic">Observations,</hi> published in 1646; but the
                    testimony of Lyrsalis, there printed, goes no higher than the year 1625. But
                    that my countryman Drebelius made these compound microscopes at London in the
                    year 1621,1 have often been informed by several eye-witnesses, and that he was
                    then reckoned the first inventor of them.”</p>
                <p>This testimony of Huygens in favour of Drebell, is in direct contradiction to the
                    statement said by Borelli to have been made to the Dutch envoy in 1619·</p>
                <p>In consequence of this conflicting evidence, Galileo may be regarded as having
                    the best claim to the invention of the compound microscope. Viviani distinctly
                    informs us in his <hi rend="italic">Life of Galileo,</hi> that he was led to the
                    invention of the microscope by that of the telescope, and that in the year 1612,
                    he actually sent a microscope in a present to Sigismund King of Poland. Having
                    been dissatisfied with the performance of this instrument, he seems to have
                    devoted himself twelve years afterwards to its improvement; and in a letter to
                    P. Frederigo Cesi, he says that he had delayed to send him the microscope, the
                    use of which he describes, as he had only then brought it to perfection, owing
                    to the difficulty he experienced in making the glasses.<note anchored="true"

                    and died. The village authorities found a little glass instrument in his pocket,

                    looking into the eye-glass, they were struck with terror at the sight of the
                    gigantic animal, and the remains of the poor philosopher, who was then proved to
                    be a sorcerer, were pronounced unworthy of Christian burial. Some bold sceptic,
                    however, explored the mystery, and produced the giant which had alarmed
                    them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                <p>_ The name of Kepler, though associated principally with astronomical discovery,
                    will ever be venerated by the cultivators of optical science. His researches,
                    which relate principally to vision and refraction, are contained in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Paralipomena</hi><hi rend="italic">ad Vitellionem,</hi> published
                    at Frankfort in 1604, and in his <hi rend="italic">Dioptrica,</hi> already
                    referred to. His discoveries respecting vision, though founded to a certain
                    degree on the views of Maurolycus and Baptista, are nevertheless to agreat
                    extent original. He was the first person who actually shewed that distinct and
                    inverted images of external objects are formed upon the retina, as in the camera
                    obscura, by the foci of pencils emanating from every point of the object. He
                    explained all the phenomena of distinct and indistinct vision, and shewed how
                    that indistinctness could be removed by the use of convex and concave glasses.
                    Although D’Alembert<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Opuscules</hi><hi rend="italic">Mathématiques,</hi> tom. i. p.
                    265.</p></note> has asserted that all optical writers before him had assumed it
                    as an axiom that every visual point is seen in the direction of its visual ray,
                    yet, as Dr. Wells has observed, this assertion is not well founded, for Kepler
                    had long ago maintained that objects are perceived not along the visual rays,
                    but along lines which pass from their pictures on the retina through the centre
                    of the eye; an opinion in which he has been followed by Dechales and Dr.
                    Porterfield, to the last of whom Dr. Reid has by mistake ascribed the discovery
                    of this law. Hence Kepler was led at once to the true theory of erect objects
                    being seen from inverted images, which he considered as the business of the
                    mind, which, when it judges of an impression made on the lower part of an
                    inverted image on the retina, considers it as made by rays proceeding from the
                    higher parts of an erect object, a necessary consequence of his opinion that
                    objects are perceived in lines passing through the centre of the retina. Kepler
                    has wisely declared his ignorance of the manner in which the mind perceives
                    images on the retina, and he blames Vitellio for attempting the solution of a
                    question which does not belong to optics. In order to explain the adaptation of
                    the eye to different distances, Kepler supposed that the ciliary processes draw
                    the sides of the eye towards the crystalline lens, by which change the globe of
                    the eye is elongated, and the retina placed at a greater distance from the
                    crystalline, so as to accommodate the eye to the distinct vision of near
                    objects.</p>
                <p>The refraction of light in its passage through different media, is treated at
                    great length, but very unsatisfactorily, by Kepler. Although he failed in his
                    attempts to discover the law of refraction, yet he arrived at certain rifles of
                    refraction for glass, which enabled him to discover many of the leading
                    principles of convex and concave lenses. He found, for example, that below 30°
                    of incidence, the angle of refraction was nearly two-thirds of the angle of
                    incidence; that at 90° of incidence the angle of refraction was 42°; and that if
                    the refracted ray fell at a greater obliquity than 42°, upon the interior
                    surface of glass, it would be totally reflected back again into the glass at an
                    angle equal to that of incidence. He then shews, by applying these principles,
                    that plano-convex lenses of glass have their foci at a distance from the lens
                    equal to the diameter of the sphere of which their convex surface is a portion,
                    and that equi-con vex lenses have their focal length equal to the radius of the
                    sphere of which their convexities are a portion. When the lens has its surface
                    unequally convex, he makes the focal length equal to a mean of the radii of the
                    two spheres. The same properties being proved in reference to concave lenses,
                    Kepler proceeds to find the focus of refracted rays, when they radiate from
                    points at different distances from the lens. He proved also that rays issuing
                    from the focus of a lens will emerge on the other side of it parallel; that if
                    they issue from a point between the focus of the lens, they will diverge after
                    refraction, while those which issue from a point beyond the focus will converge;
                    and, finally, that when the distance of the radiant point is equal to twice the
                    focal length of the lens, the distance of the image will be equal to the
                    distance of the object.</p>
                <p>In treating of the refraction of the atmosphere, Kepler remarked that the
                    quantity of refraction would alter if the atmosphere varied in weight, and that
                    it would be different at different temperatures. In one of his letters to
                    Breggcr, dated in 1605, on the colours of the rainbow, he makes the following
                    observation :—“The sun’s rays arc not coloured except with a definite quantity
                    of refraction. Whether you are in the optical chamber, or standing opposite
                    glass globes, or walking in the morning dew, every where it is obvious that a
                    certain and definite angle is observed, under which, when seen in dew, in glass,
                    in water, the sun’s splendour appears coloured, and under no other angle. There
                    is no colouring by mere reflexion, without the refraction of a clearer
                    medium.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>Although Tycho and Kcpler made many ineffectual at- &lt; tempts to discover the
                    law of refraction, yet the honour of that great discovery was reserved for
                    Willebrord Snellius, Professor of Mathematics at Leyden, who died at the age of
                    thirty-five, leaving behind him a manuscript work on the subject. The doctrine
                    of refraction having become more important after the invention of the telescope,
                    Snellius devoted himself to its investigation, and “after many troublesome
                    experiments and attempts,” succeeded in his research. Supposing AB to be the
                    refracting surface of water, an object under the water at D appeared as if it
                    were raised and seen in the line RC. He then produced RC till it intersected at
                    E a line DK drawn parallel to the perpendicular MN, and he asserted that at
                    every angle at which the object D was viewed, it would appear at E, and that CD
                    was to CE in a given ratio, such as 4 to 3, when the refracting body was water.
                    Now this is a true geometrical expression of the law of refraction, though the
                    same truth may be better enunciated in other two ways. If we continue the lines
                    CE CD, till they meet <hi rend="italic">Ad,</hi> a line perpendicular to AD, in
                    the points/and <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> then on account of the parallels <hi
                    rend="italic">Ad,</hi> KD; CD is to CE as <hi rend="italic">Cd</hi> is to C/;
                    but <hi rend="italic">ACd</hi> is the complement of the angle of refraction, and
                    AC/ the complement of the angle of incidence, and <hi rend="italic">Ad,</hi>
                    A∕are their secants. Hence it follows from Snellius’ result, <hi rend="italic"
                    >that the cosecants of the angles of incidence and refraction are in a constant
                    ratio,</hi> which is a correct mathematical expression of the law of refraction.
                    Again, in the triangle CDE, the sides CD CE are to one another as the Sines of
                    the opposite angles, that is, as the Sines of the anglesDEC orKEC,orECNor RCM,
                    and of CDE orDCN; that is <hi rend="italic">the sines of the angles of incidence
                    and refraction are</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:194561519"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-1519-0358"/><hi rend="italic">in a constant ratio,</hi> which
                    is the usual and most distinct expression of the law of refraction. In giving
                    this law of Sncllius ’, Hnygens has in our opinion forgotten hisusual courtesy,
                    when he states that Willebrord Snellius did not “thoroughly comprehend his own
                    invention,” and “never imagines that the ratio was the ratio of the Sines.” Now
                    we cannot conceive it possible that a man like Snellius, who was a good
                    geometer, was ignorant of the two simple trigonometrical expressions of his
                    geometrical law; and we do not doubt that he preferred his own for two distinct
                    reasons. In the first place, it connects itself with the leading physical
                    phenomena of the apparent rise of the refracted object from D to E, and by
                    substituting CF for CD it furnishes us with a much more simple and accurate
                    method of obtaining by projection the refracted ray from the incident one. If RF
                    for example, is the incident ray, we have only to divide CF into two parts, CE,
                    EF, so that CF is to CE in the constant ratio belonging to the refracting
                    body.</p>
                <p>But whether we are right in this conjecture or not, it is an unquestionable truth
                    that Snellius discovered the <hi rend="italic">true law</hi> of refraction,
                    though he did not express it in trigonometrical language.</p>
                <p>In the year 1637, about eleven years after the death of Snellius, Descartes
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Dioptrics,</hi> in which, without ever
                    mentioning the name, or alluding to the labours of Snellius, he announces the
                    true law of refraction expressed in term of the Sines, as the result of his own
                    enquiries. As Snellius’s work existed only in manuscript, it was quite possible
                    that Descartes knew nothing of its contents, but Vossius, in his work <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Natura Lucis,</hi> states, that the heirs
                    of Hortensius had communicated freely to Descartes the manuscripts of that
                    professor, among which was that of Snellius’s work, and Huygens confirms this
                    allegation when he states in his Dioptrics that he had himself seen the whole
                    manuscript volume of Snellius, and had heard that Descartes had also seen
                    it,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bossut is incorrect
                    in saying that Huygens <hi rend="italic">assures us</hi> that Descartes saw the
                    manuscript volume of Hortensius. His words are, <hi rend="italic">“et</hi><hi

                    (Dioptrica,</hi> p. 3.)</p></note> and that it was perhaps from hence that he
                    deduced (elicuerit) that measure which consists in the Sines. We should not have
                    entered so minutely into this subject, had not Μ. Biot<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Traité de Physique,</hi>
                    tom. iii. p. 204, 205.</p></note> thrown into entire oblivion the labours of
                    Snellius, and ascribed to Descartes the undoubted discovery of what he calls
                    “this great property of light.” The same eminent philosopher likewise ascribes
                    to Descartes the discovery that the incident and refracted rays are always in
                    the same plane, a truth which was well known to Ptolemy, and which is clearly
                    included in Snellius’s expression of the law of refraction. In opposition to the
                    opinion of Μ. Biot, we must place those of Huygens, Montncla, Bossut, Priestley,
                    David Gregory, Smith, Hutton, Robison, Young, and Playfair; and we shall dismiss
                    the subject after giving the admirable reasons which induced Professor Playfair
                    to decide against Descartes. “There is no doubt, therefore,” says he,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Professor Playfair’s
                    Dissertation in this Work, vol. ii. p. 101.</p></note> “that the discovery was
                    first made by Snellius; but whether Descartes derived it from him, or was
                    himself the second discoverer, remains undecided. The question is one of those,
                    where a man’s conduct in a particular situation can only be rightly interpreted
                    from his general character and behaviour.</p>
                <p>“If Descartes had been uniformly fair and candid in his intercourse with others,
                    one would have rejected with disdain a suspicion of the kind just mentioned. But
                    the truth is, that he appears throughout a jealous and imperious man, always
                    inclined to depress and conceal the merit of others. In speaking of the
                    invention of the telescope, he has told minutely all that is due to accident,
                    but has passed carefully over all that proceeded from design, and has incurred
                    the reproach of relating the origin of that instrument without mentioning the
                    name of Galileo. In the same manner, he omits to speak of the discoveries of
                    Kepler, so nearly connected with his own; and, in treating of the rainbow, he
                    has made no mention of Antonio de Dominis. It is impossible that this should not
                    produce a favourable impression ∙, and hence it is that the warmest admirers of
                    Descartes do not pretend that his conduct towards Snellius can be completely
                    justified.</p>
                <p>“Descartes would have conceived his philosophy to be disgraced if it had borrowed
                    any general principle from experience, and he therefore derived, or affected to
                    derive the law of refraction from reasoning or from theory.”</p>
                <p>Even if Descartes had liberally taken from his optical wreath the law of the
                    Sines, and generously placed the hallowed branch on the brow of the accomplished
                    Snellius, he would have added to his reputation as a man, without shortening his
                    immortality as a philosopher. His Dioptrics consists of ten chapters. The first
                    treats of light, the second of refraction, the third of the eye, the fourth on
                    lenses in general, the fifth on the images formed on the bottom of the eye, the
                    sixth on vision, the seventh on the mode of perfecting vision, the eighth on the
                    figures which transparent bodies require to turn the rays by refraction, suited
                    to all modes of vision, the ninth on microscopes, and the tenth on the mode of
                    polishing glasses. The inability of spherical surfaces to converge rays to one
                    point or focus, had been long known to opticians, and Kepler, though he
                    conjectured that surfaces generated by the revolutions of the conic sections,
                    might have such a property, left the subject just as he found it. Descartes,
                    however, has discussed it in a most ingenious manner, in the eighth chapter of
                    his Dioptrics. He has shewn how parallel, and converging, and diverging rays may
                    be brought to accurate foci by means of ellipsoidal and hyperboloidal surfaces,
                    so that if such surfaces, could be executed by opticians, all optical
                    instruments would receive the highest degree of perfection which they could
                    attain from the removal of spherical aberration. In order to carry this system
                    into effect, he contrived machines for grinding elliptical and hyperbolical
                    lenses, and in the tenth chapter of his Dioptrics he has given perspective
                    drawings and descriptions of them. In the years 1627 and 1628, when he was
                    residing at Paris, Μ. Mydorgius, with whom be lived on the most intimate habits,
                    urged him to undertake the grinding of hyperbolical and elliptical lenses, and
                    he soon became a great master of the art of glass grinding. He found it
                    necessary, however, to associate with himself in this undertaking an eminent
                    artist, Μ. Ferrier, who, as an optical instrument maker, was well acquainted
                    both with the theory and the practice of his art. After many failures, a
                    tolerably good hyperbolic convex lens was completed; but the concaves were found
                    to be more difficult; and in consequence of Μ. Ferrier refusing to accompany
                    Descartes to Franeker, and having occasioned him much needless expence in the
                    erection of his laboratory <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, a quarrel took place,
                    and the great practical object which they had in view was for a while abandoned.
                    Descartes, however, was sanguine in his expectations, and not aware that there
                    was another aberration more difficult to overcome than that of spherical figure,
                    he expected to be able to make the greatest discoveries in the heavens by means
                    of his new lenses. With the assistance of Μ. Huygens, the father of the
                    celebrated philosopher, he induced some Dutch artists to renew the attempts of
                    Ferrier; but these and his subsequent endeavours to construct such lenses have
                    failed, though we cannot allow ourselves to think that the attempt is a hopeless
                    one.</p>
                <p>Descartes made some interesting observations upon vision, particularly on the
                    method by which we judge of the distances and magnitude of objects; but his
                    principal discovery in physical optics relates to the theory of the rainbow<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194561532" xml:id="kp-eb0716-1532-0359"/>. He discovered
                    the true cause of the exterior rainbow, and in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Traite</hi><hi rend="italic">des Meteores,</hi> proves that it was produced by
                    two refractions, and two intermediate reflections within the drop, thus
                    explaining most satisfactorily the faintness of its illumination, and the
                    inversion of its colours. He has clearly shewn also, why the interior bow is 42°
                    in diameter, while the exterior one is 52°; though he did not understand the
                    true origin of the colours. We regret to add, that Descartes gives his
                    explanations of both the interior and exterior bows without ever mentioning the
                    name of Antonio de Dominis, who was the real discoverer of the cause of the
                    rainbow; and our regret is increased, when we are compelled to add, that Μ. Biot
                    has, contrary to the opinion of all philosophers, given his aid to Descartes in
                    depriving the Italian philosopher of the only discovery which has immortalised
                    his name.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In his Optics,
                    book ix. p. 147, Sir Isaac gives almost the whole merit of the explanation of

                    in his <hi rend="italic">Meteors,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mended that of the

                <p>The science of optics is under considerable obligations to Christopher Scheiner,
                    a Jesuit, and professor of mathematics at Ingolstadt. He completed the theory of
                    vision in so far as he proved by direct experiment that the pictures of external
                    objects were distinctly delineated on the retina. By paring away the coats from
                    the back of the eyes of sheep and oxen, and also the human eye, he made the
                    inverted pictures distinctly visible, and exhibited the experiment publicly at
                    Rome in 1625. In his work entitled <hi rend="italic">Oculus,</hi> published in
                    1652, he speaks of the great resemblance of the eye to the camera obscura, and
                    gives various contrivances for erecting the images. He adopts the theory of
                    Kepler respecting the visible direction of objects, and he observed the
                    interesting fact that the pupil of the eye is dilated in viewing distant, and
                    contracted in viewing near objects. In measuring the refractive powers of the
                    humours of the eye, he makes that of the aqueous humour diífer little from that
                    of water, and that of the crystalline humour differ little from that of glass,
                    ascribing to the vitreous humour an intermediate refractive power. By tracing
                    the progress of the visual rays through all the humours of the eye, he
                    demonstrates that the retina, and not the crystalline lens, is the seat of
                    vision; and he describes some interesting experiments respecting vision through
                    one or more small apertures. We owe also to Scheiner the interesting experiment
                    of exhibiting on the wall of a darkened room the disc of the sun with all its
                    spots by means of a telescope. When Kircher afterwards describes this appearance
                    he represents the spectator as “fixed with the utmost astonishment.”</p>
                <p>A new and very interesting branch of optics had begun to excite the attention of
                    philosophers, namely that of the double refraction of light. Erasmus
                    Bartholinus, a physician at Copenhagen, and the author of several excellent
                    works on geometry, received from some Danish merchants that frequented Iceland,
                    “a crystal stone like a rhombic prism, which, when broken into small pieces,
                    kept the same figure.” With this substance, which was called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iseland spar,</hi> from its locality, Bartholinus made a number of experiments
                    both chemical and optical, and he has published an account of the optical
                    results which he obtained in a small volume which appeared at Copenhagen in
                    1669, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Erasmi</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Frederick III. king of Denmark. In <hi rend="italic">seventeen</hi> experiments
                    and <hi rend="italic">twelve</hi> propositions this able and sagacious
                    philosopher has presented us with an excellent summary of the more prominent
                    phenomena of double refraction. He has shewn that Iceland spar has the property
                    of double refraction, that is, of giving two images of all objects seen through
                    it, whether its faces are parallel or inclined, like those of a prism; that the
                    incident light is equally divided between these two pencils; that one of these
                    refractions is performed according to the law of Snellius, the ratio of the
                    Sines being as 1 to 1∙667, but that the other is performed according to an
                    extraordinary law which had not previously been observed’by philosophers. He
                    observed also a position in which the object appears six-fold, but he did not
                    discover that this took place only in some specimens which were composite or
                    irregular crystals.</p>
                <p>These discoveries of Bartholinus having been communicated to the Royal Society of
                    London, and printed in No. 67 of their <hi rend="italic">Transactions,</hi> they
                    attracted the notice of Christian Huygens, a celebrated Dutch philosopher of the
                    finest genius and the highest attainments. Having given a new theory of
                    refraction, he wanted to repeat Bartholinus’s experiments principally with the
                    view of ascertaining if they opposed any difficulties to that theory. His work
                    on this subject, entitled <hi rend="italic">De Vestrange Refraction</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">du Cristal</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Islande,</hi> which forms the 5th chapter
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Traite</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Lumiere,</hi> was
                    written in 1678, and was read to Cassini, Roemer, and De la Hire, and to several
                    other members of the Royal Academy of Sciences, which he had been invited to
                    join by the liberality of the French king; but it was not published till 1690,
                    when he was resident at the Hague. After giving Bartholinus the credit of having
                    discovered some of the principal phenomena of double refraction, he describes
                    the general properties of Iceland spar in forming two images of objects, and he
                    shews that all the phenomena are related to the axis, or that diagonal of the
                    rhomb, in the direction of which the crystal has no double refraction. He proves
                    that the double refraction, or separation of the two images, gradually increases
                    as the inclination of the refracted ray to the axis increases, and becomes a
                    maximum in a plane at right angles to the axis. In the few preceding chapters of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Traite</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Lumiere</hi> he had
                    explained all the phenomena of reflexion and refraction upon a new theory, in
                    which he supposes light to be produced in the same manner as sound, by means of
                    undulations propagated in an elastic ethereal medium, an hypothesis revived by
                    Euler and extended by Dr. Young, and now almost universally embraced under the
                    name of the undulatory theory. In applying the same theory to explain the
                    phenomena of double refraction, he supposes the ray produced by the <hi
                    rend="italic">ordinary</hi> refraction of the medium to be produced by <hi
                    rend="italic">spherical</hi> undulations propagated through the crystal, while
                    the ray formed by the <hi rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> refraction is
                    produced by <hi rend="italic">spheroidal</hi> undulations, the ratio of the two
                    refractions, determining the form of the generating ellipse. Huygens then
                    proceeds to shew that this theory affords, by calculation, results agreeing very
                    exactly with those which he had obtained by direct experiment. This discovery is
                    perhaps the most splendid which has occurred in the history of optical
                    science.</p>
                <p>When Huygens had finished his researches on double refraction, he discovered what
                    he calls a “wonderful phenomenon,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>' Une <hi rend="italic">phénomène merveilleux,</hi> que j’ay
                    découvert après avoir écrit tout ce que dessus.” <hi rend="italic">(Traité de la
                    Lumière,</hi> p. 88.)</p></note> and, though he acknowledges that we cannot find
                    the cause of it, yet he thinks it proper to indicate the phenomenon that others
                    may inquire into it. This discovery is that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >polarisation of the light,</hi> which forms the two pencils of Iceland spar,
                    and he confesses that he must add to his theory other suppositions in order to
                    explain it, though he thinks that a theory confirmed by so many proofs will
                    still preserve its plausibility <hi rend="italic">(vraisemblance).</hi> Huygens
                    had naturally supposed that the light which composed the two pencils was like
                    all other light, but upon transmitting the two rays formed by one rhomb of
                    calcareous spar through another rhomb, he was astonished to perceive that when
                    the two rhombs were similarly placed as if they had formed one larger one,
                    neither of the rays suffered double refraction in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194561545" xml:id="kp-eb0716-1545-0360"/>passing through the second
                    rhomb, the ordinary ray from the first being only ordinarily refracted by the
                    second rhomb, and the extraordinary ray only extraordinarily refracted. The same
                    thing took place when one of the rhombs, the second, for example, was turned
                    round 90°, with this difference, that the ordinary ray of the first rhomb
                    suffered only extraordinary refraction, and the extraordinary ray only ordinary
                    refraction from the second rhomb. But in all other positions of the second
                    rhomb, excepting these two rectangular ones, the ordinary and extraordinary rays
                    of the first rhomb were each divided into two by the second rhomb, so that there
                    were now <hi rend="italic">four</hi> rays sometimes of equal but generally of
                    unequal brightness, and such that the light of all the four never exceeded that
                    of the single ray incident on the first rhomb.</p>
                <p>Huygens discovered also the double refraction of quartz, or rock crystal, but he
                    committed a great mistake in supposing that its double refraction was regulated
                    by an entirely different law, the light being in this case <hi rend="italic"
                    >propagated through it in two spherical waves, one of which was a little slower
                    than the other.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    preface as having been obtained after he had read his work to his colleagues in
                    the Academy of Sciences. It is, however, founded on an incoιτect observation, as
                    the extraordinary refraction of rock crystal is produced by spheroidal
                    undulations like that of Iceland spar, with this difference only, as afterwards
                    discovered by Μ. Biot, that the spheroid is a prolate one.</p>
                <p>Even if Huygens had not immortalised his name by these great discoveries, his
                    treatises on dioptrics and on halos, and his construction of refracting
                    telescopes of immense size, would have given him the highest reputation. His
                    treatise on dioptrics, which was not published till 1703, among his posthumous
                    works, and which he had begun to prepare at an early period of his life, was
                    particularly admired by Sir Isaac Newton. It contains a copious explanation of
                    theproperties of lenses of all forms; andtheir spherical aberration is treated
                    with much perspicuity, having previously, in the 6th chapter of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Lumiere,</hi> published an
                    interesting discussion respecting the figures of transparent bodies for
                    refracting and reflecting light to a single focus. The subject of vision, and
                    the method of assisting long and short-sighted persons by lenses, is ably
                    discussed, and nearly the latter half of the work is devoted to the theory of
                    telescopes, telescopic eye-pieces and microscopes.</p>
                <p>Many of these theoretical views Huygens submitted to the test of experiment.
                    Having acquired great expertness in the art of grinding lenses, he executed
                    refracting telescopes 12 and 24 feet in focal length, and afterwards one of 120
                    and another of 123 feet, with which he discovered Saturn’s ring, and the fourth
                    of his satellites. These two last objectglasses he presented to the Royal
                    Society; but as it was impracticable to use tubes of such enormous length,
                    Huygens contrived a method of mounting them without tubes at the top of a long
                    pole. The practical knowledge which he had thus acquired, was published along
                    with his Dioptrics in a work entitled, <hi rend="italic">Com mentarii</hi><hi

                    the first volume of his optics.</p>
                <p>Among the eminent men who gave an impulse to optical discovery, we must assign a
                    considerable place to our countryman James Gregory. This eminent mathematician
                    in confirming the experiments of Vitello and Kircher on the angles of
                    refraction, discovered the true law which had previously been found by Snellius.
                    He made the refractive power of water 1∙3347, which coincides <hi rend="italic"
                    >exactly</hi> with that of the middle ray between the lines D and E of
                    Fraunhofer. Having discovered before the publication of his work that Descartes’
                    dioptrics contained the law of refraction, he mentions the circumstance, and
                    ascribes his being unacquainted with that work to the “want of new mathematical
                    books,” in the library of the college of Aberdeen. Although Baptista Porta
                    appears from the extract which we have already given from his Natural Magic, to
                    have made the nearest possible approach to the invention of the Newtonian
                    reflecting telescope, or rather microscope, yet his experiment excited no
                    notice, and no instrument could be said to have been invented. James Gregory,
                    however, has described what is now known by the name of the Gregorian Reflecting
                    Telescope, at the end of his <hi rend="italic">Optica Pranata,</hi> published in
                    1663. It consisted of a parabolic concave mirror perforated at the centre, and
                    having in front of it a small concave elliptic speculum, at a distance a little
                    greater than the sum of their focal lengths. The parallel rays emitted by a
                    remote object formed an image of that object in front of the great mirror, and
                    in its focus; and in the conjugate focus of the small speculum, behind the great
                    speculum, there was formed another image of the object, which was magnified by
                    an eye glass. In 1664, Messrs Rives and Co. English opticians, attempted to
                    construct a six foot Gregorian telescope, under the superintendence of its
                    inventor, but, after a rough trial of it, Mr. Gregory, not aware of the nice
                    adjustments which it required, conceived that the figure of the speculum was
                    defective, and, being on the eve of going abroad, he never even made a tube for
                    the mirrors. Stimulated by the failure of his friend, Newton, “altered,” as he
                    says, “the design of the instrument,” and “placed the eye glass at the end of
                    the tube rather than at the middle ;” and, therefore, he was obliged to reflect
                    the rays to a side by an oval plane speculum. Sir Isaac actually constructed one
                    of these instruments with his own hands, and described it in a letter to a
                    friend, dated the 23d February 1668-9. The aperture of the speculum was one
                    inch, its focal length <hi rend="italic">six</hi> inches, the eye glass, which
                    was a plano-convex lens, about i <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi

                    power 39 times. He considered it as equal to a three or four feet refractor, and
                    it shewed distinctly the four satellites of Jupiter, and the phases of
                    Venus.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Brewster’s <hi

                    which was better than the first, and which is preserved in the library of the
                    Royal Society. The next Newtonian reflecting telescope of any importance, was
                    executed by Mr. John Hadley in 1719 or 1720, with a speculum six inches in
                    diameter, and five feet in focal length; but for a long time the Gregorian form
                    was the most popular in England. About 1672 Μ. Cassegrain substituted a convex
                    speculum for the small concave one of Gregory, which had the advantage of
                    shortening the tube of the telescope without diminishing the power of the
                    instrument.</p>
                <p>Other claimants have arisen for the honour of inventing the reflecting telescope.
                    Father Mersenne in a letter to Descartes in 1637, suggested the idea of using
                    concave mirrors in reflecting telescopes; but Descartes endeavoured to convince
                    him that his views were not likely to succeed. At a later period Fontenelle, in
                    the <hi rend="italic">History of the Academy of Sciences,</hi> for 1700, has
                    very recklessly ascribed the invention of this instrument to Father Zucchi, an
                    Italian jesuit, who published, at Lyons in 1652, a volume, entitled, <hi
                    rend="italic">Optica</hi><hi rend="italic">Philosophica.</hi> In this work he
                    says, that he thought of substituting concave specula for object glasses, and
                    having <pb break="no" facs="nls:194561558" xml:id="kp-eb0716-1558-0361"/>found a
                    concave metallic mirror in a cabinet of curiosities, he applied to it a concave
                    eye glass, and observed with it celestial and terrestrial objects. As no small
                    speculum was used in this combination, it was neither a Newtonian, Gregorian,
                    nor Cassegrainian telescope; and if Zucchi conceived himself the inventor of a
                    reflecting telescope, why did he conceal it till 1652, and why did he not get a
                    real speculum made to give his idea a fair trial.</p>
                <p>Among the discoveries of the 17th century, that of the inflexion of light ranks
                    among the most important. This addition to physical optics was made by Francis
                    Maria Grimaldi, an Italian jesuit, who published an account of it in a work
                    entitled, <hi rend="italic">Physicomatltxsis de</hi><hi rend="italic">Lumine,
                    Coloribus et Iride, aliisque annexis,</hi> which was published at Bologna in
                    1665, two years after his death. Introducing a ray of the sun’s light into a
                    dark room, and through a very small aperture, he remarked, that it formed a cone
                    of light in which all bodies had their shadows larger than if the rays passed in
                    straight lines by their edges. Round these shadows he noticed three coloured
                    fringes becoming narrower as they were farther from the body, and in strong
                    light he observed similar coloured fringes, varying from two to four, according
                    to the distance of the shadow from the body. Hence our author concluded that
                    light is bent from its rectilineal path in passing by the edges of bodies.</p>
                <p>When he admitted the light through two small apertures, so near each other that
                    the one luminous cone did not penetrate the other till at a considerable
                    distance from the apertures, he observed that the rays so interfered with one
                    another, as to render the spot illuminated by their <hi rend="italic">united
                    light more obscure than when it was illuminated by either of them singly.</hi>
                    This extraordinary result is announced in the following proposition: “That a
                    body actually illuminated, may become, more obscure by adding a new light to
                    that which it already receives,” and may be regarded as the first discovery of
                    the interference of light.</p>
                <p>Dr. Robert Hooke, one of the most ingenious and able men of the century which he
                    adorned, not knowing of the discovery of Grimaldi, communicated to the Royal
                    Society in 1672, an account of “the discovery of a new property of light not
                    mentioned by any optical writers before him.” In a subsequent communication in
                    1675, he draws the following conclusions from his experiments:—1. There is a <hi
                    rend="italic">deflection</hi> of light, differing both from reflexion and
                    refraction, and seeming to depend on the unequal density of the constituent
                    parts of the ray, whereby the light is dispersed from the place of condensation,
                    and rarified, or gradually diverged into a quadrant. 2. This deflection is made
                    towards the superficies of the opaque body perpendicularly. 3. Those parts of
                    the diverged radiations, w hiclι are deflected by the greatest angle from the
                    straight or direct radiation, are the faintest, and those that are deflected by
                    the least angles are the strongest. 4. Rays cutting each other in one common
                    foramen, do not make the angles at the vertex equal. 5. Colours may be made
                    without refraction. 6. The diameter of the sun cannot be taken with common
                    sights. 7∙ The same rays of light, falling upon the same point of an object,
                    will turn into all sorts of colours by the various inclination of the object. 8.
                    Colours begin to appear when two pulses of light are blended so well, and so
                    near together, that the sense takes them for one.”</p>
                <p>Weowe,also, to Dr. Hooke the first accurate experiments that were made on the
                    subject of thin plates, which, we believe,hadbeen firstobserved by Mr.
                    Boyle.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Experiments and Observations upon Colours,</hi> 1663.</p></note> He
                    investigated the leading phenomena as exhibited in the colours of the soap
                    bubble, and between two plates of glass pressed together. He discovered that the
                    colours depended upon certain thicknesses of the thin plates, but he failed in
                    determining the relation between given thicknesses and given colours. He
                    succeeded in splitting mica into plates of extreme tenuity, as to give the most
                    brilliant colours, one giving a <hi rend="italic">yellow,</hi> another a <hi
                    rend="italic">blue,</hi> and the two together a <hi rend="italic">deep
                    purple.</hi> In his <hi rend="italic">Micrographia,</hi> printed about seven
                    years before any of Newton’s experiments were made on the same subject, Dr.
                    Hooke has published the follow ing remarkable explanation of these phenomena,
                    which coincides in a singular manner, with that which is now universally
                    received: “It is most evident, says he, that the reflection from the under or
                    further side of the body, is the principal cause of the production of these
                    colours. Let the ray fall obliquely on the thin plate, part thereof is reflected
                    back by the first superficies,—part refracted to the second surface, whence it
                    is reflected and refracted again. So that, after two refractions and one
                    reflection, there is propagated a kind of fainter ray, and by reason of the time
                    spent in passing and repassing, this fainter pulse comes behind the former
                    reflected pulse; so that hereby, (the surfaces being so near together that the
                    eye cannot discriminate them from one) this confused or duplicated pulsc, whose
                    strongest part precedes, and whose weakest follows, does produce on the retina
                    the sensation of a yellow. If these surfaces are further removed asunder, the
                    weaker pulse may become coincident with the reflection of the second, or next
                    following pulse, from the first surface, and lagg behind that also, and be
                    coincident with the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, or eighth; so that, if
                    there be a thin transparent body, that from the greatest thinness requisite to
                    produce colours, does by degrees grow to the greatest thickness,—the colours
                    shall be so often repeated, as the weaker pulse does lose paces with its primary
                    or first pulse, and is coincident with a subsequent pulsc. And this, as it is
                    coincident, or follows from the first hypothesis I took of colours, so upon
                    experiment have I found it in multitudes of instances that seem to prove
                    it.”</p>
                <p>Galileo, and the philosophers of the Accademia del Cirnento, had proposed to
                    measure the velocity of light by means of a base on the surface of the globe;
                    but such an attempt was utterly hopeless, and it was only in a wider range that
                    this problem could be solved. Baffled in finding an explanation of some
                    irregularity in the emersion of the first satellite of Jupiter, Cassini and
                    Roemer had concluded that it depended on the distance of Jupiter from the earth,
                    and that in order to explain it it was necessary to suppose, that the light of
                    the satellite required ten or eleven minutes to move across the earth’s orbit.
                    This happy idea seems to have first occurred to Cassini, but he speedily
                    abandoned it, while Roemer pertinaciously cherished the hypothesis, and at last
                    immortalised himself by demonstrating in the most rigorous manner that light
                    moves through the diameter of the earth’s orbit, a distance of 190 millions of
                    miles, in eleven minutes.</p>
                <p>Passing over the valuable researches of Tschirnhausen, a Saxon nobleman, on
                    caustic curves, which had been previously discovered, and the discoveries of
                    Mariotte and de la Hire, respecting the seat of vision, which have not
                    terminated in any satisfactory conclusions, we are brought to one of the most
                    brilliant periods of optical discovery.</p>
                <p>In the year 1665, Sir Isaac Newton, when only23 years: of age, bought three
                    prisms, but he does not seem to have <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> made any
                    particular experiments with them. In 1666, however, he bought another, with
                    which he proposed to repeat Grimaldi’s experiment, on the elongation of the
                    sun’s image produced by the prism. In the course of this and the two or three
                    subsequent years, he made and perfected his great discovery of the <hi
                    rend="italic">different refrangibility of light,</hi> which he communicated to
                    the Royal Society on the 6th of February 1672, having, on the 18th of January,
                    announced it as “the oddest if not the most considerable detection <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194561571" xml:id="kp-eb0716-1571-0362"/> which hath
                    hitherto been made in the operations of nature.” Having found that refraction
                    could not be produced without colour, he was led to direct his attention to the
                    perfection of the reflecting telescope, and produced the instruments which we
                    have already mentioned. Another result of this discovery was the completion of
                    the theory of the rainbow, the origin of the colours of which had hitherto
                    perplexed philosophers.</p>
                <p>The next optical discovery made by Sir Isaac Newton, related to the <hi
                    rend="italic">colours of thin plates,</hi> or of thin transparent bodies, such
                    as the soap bubbled We have already seen that Dr. Hooke had made some progress,
                    both in observing the phenomena and in investigating the cause of such colours;
                    but it is to Newton that we owe an elaborate analysis of the subject. In a
                    letter from Sir Isaac to Dr. Hooke, dated 5th February 1676, he acknowledges
                    that the latter had previously observed “the dilatation of the coloured rays by
                    the obliquation <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the eye, and the opposition of a black
                    spot at the contact of two convex glasses, and at the top of a water bubble,”
                    (soap bubble). In the course of his experiments on thin plates, Newton was led
                    to the discovery of the colours of thick plates, and he devised a theory for
                    explaining both classes of phenomena, known by the name of the theory of fits of
                    easy reflexion and transmission. This theory, remarkable for its ingenuity, is
                    now no longer an expression of the phenomena, and has given way to the theory of
                    undulations, which Hooke had the sagacity to anticipate as affording the true
                    cause of the colours of thin plates.</p>
                <p>Early in 1676, Newton communicated to the Royal Society his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theory of the Colours of Natural Bodies,</hi> in which he ascribes all the
                    varieties of colour exhibited in nature to the circumstance “that the
                    transparent parts of bodies, according to their several sizes, reflect rays of
                    one colour and transmit those of another, on the same grounds that thin plates
                    or bubbles do reflect or transmit those rays.” This theory, perhaps the finest
                    of all Newton’s optical speculations, has met with much opposition. It was
                    controverted by Mr. Delaval, Sir John Herschel, and others, in its leading
                    propositions: but some recent discoveries afford us reason for believing that
                    the principal objections to it are groundless, and that with some modifications
                    it may yet be placed among the finest generalizations in science.</p>
                <p>Sir Isaac Newton’s experiments on the inflexion of light were never finished by
                    their author. His observations were limited, and his theory incorrect; and
                    indeed it was only from the hands of those who adopted the undulating system
                    that a true explanation of the phenomena could be expected.</p>
                <p>The experiments of our author on the refractive powers of bodies, from which he
                    anticipated that the diamond “was probably an unctuous substance coagulated,”
                    have on this account been regarded with high favour, while his few observations
                    on the double refraction and polarisation oflight have almost disappeared from
                    the history of optics.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    optical discoveries to a new work, entitled <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the

                    Brewster is now occupied, having had access to the interesting collection of the
                    papers of Sir Isaac, in the possession of the Earl of Portsmouth.</p></note></p>
                <p>The next great step in the history of optical discovery is the invention of the
                    <hi rend="italic">achromatic telescope,</hi> or telescopes which are free from
                    colour. When Sir Isaac Newton found that he could not produce refraction without
                    colour, he abandoned the improvement of the refracting telecide as hopeless, and
                    devoted himself to the construction of reflectors. The opinion at which he had
                    arrived respecting the impracticability of refracting light without colouring
                    it, was, however, an erroneous one, which he had deduced from an incorrect
                    observation of the relative length of the prismatic spectra formed by different
                    bodies, when the mean refraction was the same. In less than two years after
                    Newton’s death, namely, in 1729, Mr. Chester More Hall, of More Hall in Essex,
                    was led by the study of the human eye,which he erroneously conceived to be
                    achromatic, to consider the possibility of constructing a telescope by an
                    analogous combination of media. After many experiments, he found two kinds of
                    glass capable of producing, by their combination, refraction without
                    colour.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr. Hall might
                    have got this hint from David Gregory’s <hi rend="italic">Catoptrics,</hi>
                    published at Edinburgh in 1713. “But if,” says he, “on account of physical
                    difficulties in grinding and polishing proper specula, we should still use
                    lenses, <hi rend="italic">it would perhaps be useful to employ media of

                    refractive power as glass), is joined by nature, who does nothing in vain, with
                    the aqueous and vitreous humours, (not unlike water in their refractive power),
                    to paint the image as distinctly as possible in the bottom of the eye.”

                    which, with afocal length of twenty inches, bore an aperture of more than
                    two-and-a-half inches, one of which was long afterwards in the possession of the
                    Rev. Mr. Smith of Charlotte Street, Rathbone Place, and was found to be
                    achromatic. Another of Mr. Hall’s telescopes was in the possession of Mr.
                    Ayscough, optician in Ludgate Hill, in 1754. Mr. Hall, however, kept his
                    invention a secret; none of his instruments were either sold or exhibited for
                    sale, and those into whose hands they fell do not seem to have discovered either
                    their principle or their value.</p>
                <p>Without calling in question the merits of Mr. Hall, we must do justice to those
                    of Mr. John Dollond, an undoubted inventor of the achromatic telescope, who,
                    unacquainted with the instruments of Mr. Hall, proceeded step by step, in a
                    scientific progression, till he invented and constructed the achromatic
                    telescope in 1757. To this eminent individual, and the other members of his
                    family, we owe the construction of many of the finest instruments by which the
                    science of astronomy has been so much promoted. Mr. Peter Dollond, the son of
                    John Dollond, first suggested and used the triple object-glass, in which a
                    better correction of the spherical aberration was effected, by placing the
                    concave flint glass between two convex lenses of crown glass.</p>
                <p>The mathematical world owe many obligations to.Euler, Clairaut, D’Alembert, and
                    Boscovich, for their able investigations of the theory of achromatism, but their
                    investigations did not prove of any practical value; and it has been justly
                    stated by Sir John Herschel, “that from all the abstruse researches of Clairaut,
                    Euler, and D’Alembert, and other celebrated geometers, nothing hitherto has
                    resulted beyond a mass of complicated formulas, which, though confessedly exact
                    in theory, have never yet been made the basis of construction for a single good
                    instrument, and remains therefore totally inapplicable, or at least unapplied in
                    practice.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>No attempt had hitherto been made to measure the intensity of different lights
                    emanating either directly from luminous bodies, or when transmitted through or
                    reflected from different bodies. This subject, to which the name of Photometry
                    has been given, was begun by Huygens and P. F. Marie, who describes an
                    instrument called a <hi rend="italic">lucimeter;</hi> but it is to Μ. Bouguerand
                    Μ. Lambert that we owe the most scientific and complete investigation of this
                    class of facts.</p>
                <p>Bouguer’s earliest experiments were published in 1729, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Optical Essay on the Gradation of Light,</hi> which was republished in 1760,

                <p>Bouguer was followed in this inquiry by Μ Lambert, an able German mathematician,
                    who published an account of his researches at Augsburg in 1760, in a duodecimo

                <p>Passing over the minor labours of Porterfield, Turner, Mazeas, Dutour, Buffon,
                    Scheiffer, Darwin, Melville, Mitchell, and others we come to the period of Sir
                    William Herschel. Since the discovery of the belts and nearest satellites of
                    Saturn, no discovery of any importance had been made respecting the natural
                    history of the heavens. At the age of 36, when Sir William was residing at Bath,
                    he devoted much of his time to the construction of telescopes; and the following
                    accountofhis progress is too interestingtobe given in any other language than
                    his own,—“When I resided,” says he, “at Bath, I had long been acquainted with
                    the theory of optics and mechanism, and wanted only that experience which is so
                    necessary in the practical part of these sciences. This I acquired by degrees at
                    that place, where, in my leisure hours, by way of amusement, I made for
                    my-selfseveral twofeet, five feet, seven feet, ten feet, and twenty feet
                    Newtonian telescopes, besides others of the Gregorian form, of eight inches,
                    twelve inches, two feet, three feet, five feet, and ten feet, focal length. My
                    way of doing these instruments at that time, when the direct method of giving
                    the figure of any one of the conic sections to specula was still unknown to me,
                    was to have many mirrors of each sort cast, and to finish them all as well as I
                    could, then to select by trial the best of them, which I preserved; the rest
                    were put by to be re-polished. In this manner, I made no less than two hundred
                    seven-feet, one hundred and fifty ten-feet, and about eighty twenty-feet, not to
                    mention those of the Gregorian form, or of the construction of Dr. Smith’s
                    rejecting microscope, of which I also made a great number. My mechanical
                    amusements went hand in hand with the optical ones. The number of stands I
                    invented for these telescopes it would not be easy to assign. I contrived and
                    delineated them of different forms, and executed the most promising of the
                    designs. To these labours we owe my seven-feet Newtonian telescope stand, which
                    was brought t&lt; its present convenient construction about 1778.”</p>
                <p>By means of these instruments, with which he surveyed the heavens with unwearied
                    diligence, he discovered the Georgian Sidus, with six satellites, two new
                    satellites circulating round Satum, the quintuple belt and double ring of the
                    same planet, and various other astronomical phenomena of the highest interest.
                    In 1783 he finished a twenty-feet reflector, with an aperture of 18 <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi><hi rend="subscript">
                    s</hi> inches, and formed the design of constructing a still larger instrument.
                    On the recommendation of Sir Joseph Banks, his Majesty George III. agreed to
                    defray the expense of a large telescope, and under his munificent patronage,
                    which has never since been imitated by his successors, Sir William began in
                    1785, and completed on the 27th August 1789, a reflecting telescope forty feet
                    in focal length, having its great speculum <hi rend="italic">four feet</hi> in
                    breadth three-and-a-half inches thick, and weighing, when newly cast, 2118
                    pounds. On the 28th of August, the day after this gigantic instrument was
                    erected, Sir William discovered a new satellite of Saturn, and in the same year
                    another sa tellite, both of which were nearer the body of the planet than the
                    other five discovered by Huygens and Cassini. In this manner the telescope,
                    which was a toy in the hands of Galileo, became with Sir William Herschel a vast
                    machine, carrying the observer himselfi and directed and moved by appropriate
                    mechanism.</p>
                <p>An improvement in the achromatic telescope, of great value, though not yet
                    brought into practical use, was made by Dr. Robert Blair. Although in the
                    achromatic telescope composed of crown and flint glass, the colour was as
                    completely corrected as it was possible to do with such lenses, yet it had long
                    been observed that there were residual colours, which formed what are called a
                    secondary spectrum, and which arise from the coloured spaces in the spectrum,
                    produced by crown glass not having the same size as those in a spectrum of equal
                    length produced by flint glass. Various attempts had been made in vain to obtain
                    other substances, in which this <hi rend="italic">irrationality,</hi> as it was
                    called, of the coloured spaces did not exist; and Dr. Blair was hence led to
                    attempt the removal of the secondary spectrum by other means. The plan which he
                    adopted was the following. He made each lens of his compound object-glass
                    achromatic, but in such a way that the secondary spectrum produced by the one
                    should be corrected by the secondary spectrum produced by the other. Such an
                    object-glass required two fluid media and three lenses of glass, and Dr. Blair
                    succeeded in constructing them so as to be perfectly free from all secondary
                    colour. In the course of his experiments, however, he was fortunate enough to
                    discover that the muriatic acid mixed in proper proportions with metallic
                    antimony, or butter of antimony, as it was called, gave a spectrum, in which the
                    colours had exactly the same proportion as crown glass; and hence, by enclosing
                    this fluid between two lenses of crown glass, the one next the object being
                    plano-convex and the other a meniscus, he obtained an object-glass in which the
                    rays of different colours were bent from their rectilineal course with the same
                    equality and regularity as in reflexions. To such an object-glass he proposed to
                    give the name of <hi rend="italic">aplanatic,</hi> to indicate the entire
                    removal of all aberration.- Dr. Robison informs us that one of these telescopes,
                    which did not exceed <hi rend="italic">fifteen inches</hi> in length, equalled
                    in all respects, if it did not surpass, the best of Dollond’s achromatic
                    telescopes <hi rend="italic">forty-two inches</hi> long. After the death of Dr.
                    Blair, his son, Mr. Archibald Blair, attempted in vain to produce instruments of
                    the same perfection. Had this young man lived, he might have executed something
                    better, but he was cut oft' at an early age, and has left to the Royal Society
                    of Edinburgh an account of his father’s methods, which we hope may prove useful
                    to science.</p>
                <p>Hitherto the undulatory theory of light as proposed by Huygens and supported by
                    Hooke and Euler, had met with few adherents; and the reputation of Newton had
                    given to the theory of emission an adventitious authority to which it was not
                    entitled. Dr. Young, however, boldly threw down the gauntlet and maintained the
                    theory of Huygens with the greatest ingenuity and talent. In his paper of 1800,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Outlines of Experiments and Observations on Sound and
                    Light,</hi> he shews that light has a strong analogy with sound, and that it is
                    produced by the undulation of a highly elastic etherial medium which pervades
                    all nature. In another paper, which he published in 1801, <hi rend="italic">On
                    the Theory of Light and Colours,</hi> he applies the theory of undulations to
                    the explanation of natural phenomena; and lays down the following hypotheses: 1.
                    That a luminiferous ether pervades the universe, rare and elastic in a high
                    degree. 2. That undulations are excited in this ether whenever a body becomes
                    luminous. 3. That the sensation of different colours depends on the different
                    frequency of vibrations excited by light in the retina; and, 4th, that all
                    material bodies are to be considered, with respect to the phenomena of light, as
                    consisting of particles so remote from each other as to allow the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194561597" xml:id="kp-eb0716-1597-0364"/>etherial medium to pervade
                    them with perfect freedom, and either to retain it in a state of greater density
                    and of equal elasticity, or to constitute together with the medium an aggregate
                    which may be considered as denser but not more elastic. Hethen proceeds to
                    demonstrate in nine propositions, some of the leading truths in the theory,
                    applying them in corollaries to the colour of striated surfaces, the colours of
                    thin plates, the colours of thick plates, and the colours produced by inflexion.
                    In 1802, Dr. Young published <hi rend="italic">An account of some causes of the
                    Production of Colours not hitherto observed.</hi> The cases described in this
                    paper are the colours of delicate fibres and of mixed plates. The first he
                    explains by the interference of two portions of light, one reflected from the
                    fibre and the other bending round its opposite side, and at last coinciding
                    nearly in direction with the former portion. The colours of mixed plates are
                    those produced when moisture, butter, or tallow, are placed between two plates
                    of glass, so that portions of air arc intermixed with these substances. A candle
                    seen through such a medium is surrounded with a sort of halo, and Dr. Young
                    considers the colours as produced by the light which passes through one of the
                    media, moving with greater velocity so as to anticipate the light which comes
                    more slowly through the other.</p>
                <p>In 1803, Dr. Young published what may be considered as his principal paper,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Experiments and Calculations relating to Physical
                    Optics,</hi> in which he has given an experimental demonstration of the general
                    law of interference. By intercepting the rays which passed on one side of a body
                    which formed fringes by reflexion, the fringes disappeared whether the
                    interception was made on one side or the other of the body. This admirable
                    experiment established the truth of his law of interference, and paved the way
                    for those splendid generalizations respecting the undulatory theory which have
                    so widely enlarged the boundaries of optics.</p>
                <p>In April 1814, in a review of Malus, Biot, and Brewster’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Experiments on Light,</hi> which he contributed to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quarterly Review,</hi> he first published his explanation of the colours of
                    crystallised plates produced by polarised light by the law of interference, an
                    explanation which is now universally admitted. In the article on <hi
                    rend="italic">Chromatics,</hi> which Dr. Young contributed to this work, the
                    reader will find a full account of the discoveries to which the law of
                    interference has been so successfully applied. One of the most important
                    applications of the undulatory theory was published in that article for the
                    first time. Dr. Young has there given an expression of the velocity of reflected
                    light at a perpendicular incidence from bodies of various refractive powers,
                    which is a simple function of the index of refraction.</p>
                <p>In giving an account of Sir William Herschel’s discoveries, we have not mentioned
                    his discovery of invisible heating rays beyond the red extremity of the
                    spectrum, because we have ourselves succeeded in discovering the luminous rays
                    at that part of the spectrum. In repeating Sir W. Herschel’s experiments, Μ.
                    Ritter of Jena placed muriate of silver in different parts of the spectrum, and
                    found that it soon became black <hi rend="italic">beyond</hi> the violet
                    extremity, less black in the violet rays, becoming still less black in the blue
                    and green, and so on till the blackness vanished. When he used muriate of
                    silver, slightly blackened or disoxygenated, its white or original colour was
                    partly retained by the red, and still more by the supposed invisible rays beyond
                    it. In these experiments of Ritter’s, as well as in those of Sir W. Herschel,
                    the solar spectrum, when seen by the eye, as thrown upon paper, is extremely
                    short. A great part of th e violet extremity as well as the red extremity is
                    invisible, so that when the thermometer and the muriate of silver seemed to be
                    wholly out of the spectrum, they were completely within the violet and the red
                    spaces, as we have placed beyond a doubt by comparing the length of a spectrum
                    on paper with that which can be rendered visible by directly looking through a
                    telescope at a highly magnified one.</p>
                <p>Without knowing of the experiments of Ritter, Dr. Wollaston discovered the
                    chemical effects which exist at the violet end of the spectrum; but the merit of
                    this experiment decidedly belongs to Scheele, who discovered that muriate of
                    silver was more blackened in the violet rays than in any other part of the
                    spectrum. The principal discovery in optics, which we owe to Dr. Wollaston is
                    his method of observing the spectrum, and his discovery of <hi rend="italic"
                    >five</hi> fixed lines in it. The following is his own description of it: “I
                    cannot conclude these observations on dispersion without remarking that the
                    colours into which a beam of white light is separable by refraction, appear to
                    me to be neither seven, as they usually are seen in the rainbow, nor reducible
                    by any means (that I can find) to three, as some persons have conceived; but
                    that, by employing a very narrow pencil of light, four primary divisions of the
                    prismatic spectrum may be seen with a degree of distinctness that, I believe,
                    has not been described nor observed before.</p>
                <p>“If a beam of day-light be admitted into a dark room by a crevice ⅛ of an inch
                    broad, and received by the eye at a distance of ten or twelve feet, through a
                    prism of flint glass <hi rend="italic">free from veins,</hi> held near the eye,
                    the beam is seen to be separated into the four following colours only, red,
                    yellowish green, blue, and violet; in the proportion represented in the
                    figure.</p>
                <p>“The line A that bounds the red side of the spectrum is somewhat confused, which
                    seems, in part owing to the want of power in the eye to converge red light. The
                    line B, between red and green, in a certain position of the prism, is perfectly
                    distinct; so also are D and E, the two limits of violet. But C, the limit of
                    green and blue, is not so clearly marked as the red; and there are also, on each
                    side of this limit, other distinct dark lines,/ and <hi rend="italic">g,</hi>
                    either of which in an imperfect experiment, might be mistaken for the boundary
                    of these colours.</p>
                <p>“The position of the prism in which the colours are most clearly divided is when
                    the incident light makes about equal angles with two of its sides. I thus found
                    that the spaces AB, BC, CD, DE, occupied by them, were nearly as the numbers 16,
                    23, 36, 25.</p>
                <p>“Since the proportions of these colours to each other have been supposed by Dr.
                    Blair to vary according to the medium by which they are produced. I have
                    compared with this appearance the coloured images caused by prismatic vessels,
                    containing substances supposed by him to differ most in this respect, such as
                    strong but colourless nitric acid, rectified oil of turpentine, very pale oil of
                    sassafras, and Canada balsam also nearly colourless. With each of these I have
                    found the same arrangement of the four colours, and, in similar positions of the
                    prisms, as nearly as I could judge, the same proportions of them.<note

                    paragraph are quite incorrect. Dr. Blair’s results to which they stand opposed
                    have been placed beyond the reach of doubt.</p></note></p>
                <p>“But, when the inclination of any prism is altered so as to increase the
                    dispersion of the colours, the proportions of them to each other are thus also
                    changed, so that the spaces AC and CE, instead of being as before 39 and 61, may
                    be found altered as far as 42 and 58.” These interesting observations are

                    manner with the beautiful law established by the Dutch philosopher.</p>
                <p>These researches of Dr. Wollaston, but particularly the discoveries of Dr. Young,
                    had about this time drawn the attention of the philosophers of France to the
                    subject of double refraction. Laplace had considered the deviation of the
                    extraordinary ray, as due to the action of the attractive and repulsive forces
                    by which Newton and his successors had endeavoured to explain the ordinary
                    refraction and reflexion of light; and the Institute of France were thus led in
                    1808 to propose the double refraction of light as the subject of a prize to be
                    adjudged in 1810. Among the few memoirs which were sent in competition for this
                    prize, that of E. L. Malus, colonel of the imperial corps of engineers was the
                    successful one. After his return from the fatal expedition to Egypt he had
                    composed his <hi rend="italic">Traite</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Optique,</hi> a work of great
                    merit; but as soon as the subject of double refraction w∙as announced, he
                    devoted himself to the inquiry with equal ardour and success. Residing in the
                    Rue des Enfers, in Paris, he happened to view, through a doubly refracting
                    prism, the windows of the palace of the Luxembourg, which were then reflecting
                    to his eye the rays of the setting sun, and, on happening to turn round the
                    prism, he was surprised to perceive that one of the two images of each window
                    vanished in every quadrant of the rotation of the prism. In pursuing this
                    remarkable experiment he was conducted to the splendid discovery which forms an
                    epoch in the history of optics, <hi rend="italic">that when a pencil of light is
                    reflected by a surface of glass at an angle of</hi> 54° 35', <hi rend="italic"
                    >or of water at an angle of 52°</hi> 45 ’, <hi rend="italic">the reflected light
                    possesses all the characters of one of the pencils formed by double
                    refraction.</hi> Hence the pencil was said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >polarised</hi> by reflexion. When a pencil thus reflected was made to fall on
                    another surface of the same kind at the same angle, but so that the plane of the
                    second reflexion was at right angles to the plane of the first, then not a
                    single ray of the light suffered reflexion, the whole pencil suffering
                    refraction only. When the light fell upon a plate of glass the light reflected
                    from the second surface acquired the same property.</p>
                <p>On the 11th of March 1811, Malus announced to the Institute, that, when a pencil
                    of light was thus polarised by reflexion, the light which was at the same time
                    transmitted through the surface consisted of a portion of light polarised in an
                    opposite direction, and proportional to that which was reflected, and of another
                    portion not modified, which preserves the properties of direct light. This last
                    portion becomes less and less by transmitting the ray through a number of plates
                    in succession till the transmitted pencil is wholly polarised in one
                    direction.</p>
                <p>Malus likewise made several experiments on the polarisation of light by metals,
                    and he was led to the conclusion, that the difference between transparent and
                    metallic bodies was, that the former refract all the light polarised in one
                    direction, and reflect all that is polarised in the other, while metallic bodies
                    reflect what they polarise in both directions.</p>
                <p>In a series of experiments on crystals and organised substances, communicated to
                    the Institute on the 19th August 1811, Malus found that they all <hi
                    rend="italic">depolarised</hi> a pencil of polarised light; that is, a pencil of
                    polarised light which refused to be reflected by another surface properly
                    placed, recovered its power of being reflected after being transmitted through
                    crystals and organised substances. All crystals which did not crystallise in the
                    form of the cube or the regular octahedron were found to possess the property of
                    depolarisation; and the organised substances which he found to possess the same
                    property, were the transparent and fibrous portions of leaves and flowers, the
                    pellicles which cover the hazel, silken and woollen fibres, white hairs, scales,
                    horn, ivory, feathers, the skins of quadrupeds and fishes, shells, and the
                    whiskers of a whale. Malus intended to prosecute this subject to a greater
                    extent, but his brilliant career of discovery terminated by his death on the 7th
                    February 1812.</p>
                <p>The loss of Malus, great as it was felt to be, was immediately supplied by his
                    distinguished colleague in the Institute, Μ. Arago, who has added to this and
                    other departments of science so many brilliant discoveries. On the 11th of
                    August 1811, before the death of Malus, Μ. Arago communicated to the Institute a
                    memoir “On a particular modification which the luminous rays experience in their
                    passage through certain transparent bodies.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Upon exposing thin plates of sulphate of lime, mica, and rock-crystal, to
                    polarised light, and subsequently analyzing the light which they transmitted by
                    a prism of calcareous spar, Μ. Arago observed the most splendid complementary
                    colours changing with every variation in the inclination of the plate. When the
                    light was incident perpendicularly, and the plate turned round in its own plane,
                    the colours were in all positions the same, though they varied in intensity. He
                    found two positions at right angles to each other, in which the crystal gave no
                    colour, and these positions were those in which the principal section of the
                    crystal was perpendicular to, or coincident with the plane of primitive
                    polarisation. Setting out from these positions, the intensity of the ray
                    gradually increased, and became a maximum at an angle of 45° to that plane. When
                    the crystallised plate was fixed, and the analysing plate turned round so as to
                    vary the inclination of the plane of reflexion from it, to that of the fixed
                    plate which polarised the light primitively, the change in the colours was most
                    beautiful. Μ. Arago observed that the colour reflected in any one position of
                    the analysing plate was <hi rend="italic">complementary</hi> to the colour
                    reflected in the perpendicular position. He also found that the power of
                    depolarising the different colours diminished with the thickness of the plate,
                    and he reduced mica to such a degree of thinness that it depolarised no colours
                    at all. In studying the same phenomena in sulphate of lime and rock crystal, Μ.
                    Arago was led to the conclusion that the colours depended on some other cause
                    ∙than that of the thinness of the plate. Μ. Arago likewise discovered the
                    depolarising property in a piece of flint glass, about three quarters of an inch
                    in thickness.</p>
                <p>We owe also to Μ. Arago the discovery of circular polarisation in quartz, which
                    he made in 1811. By transmitting polarised light along the axis of the prism he
                    observed the tints to be different in their nature from the ordinary tints of
                    the mineral, although they increased and diminished with the thickness of the
                    plate. When analysed with a prism of Iceland spar, he observed that the true
                    images had complementary colours as in the ordinary tints, and that the colours
                    changed, descending in Newton’s scale as the prism was turned round, so that if
                    the colour of the extraordinary image was <hi rend="italic">red,</hi> it became
                    in succession <hi rend="italic">orange yellow, green,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >violet</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and hence he drew the important inference
                    that the differently coloured rays had been polarised in different planes in
                    passing along the axis of the crystal. Μ. Arago’s duties in the Observatory
                    prevented him from pursuing these valuable discoveries with that continuity of
                    labour which they demanded.</p>
                <p>A very important discovery was made by Μ. Arago respecting the colours of thin
                    plates.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mémoires
                    d’Arcuel, tom. iii. <hi rend="italic">Sur les Couleurs des Lames
                    Minces.</hi></p></note> When the rings of thin plates were examined through a
                    rhomb of Iceland spar, Μ. Arago discovered that when the principal section of
                    the rhomb was parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence, the
                    intensity of the light in one of the images varied with the incidence, and that
                    this image vanished altogether when the pencil of light was inclined 35° to the
                    surface, or when it was incident at the maximum polarising angle. This result
                    was the same, whether he examined the reflected<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194561623" xml:id="kp-eb0716-1623-0366"/> or the transmitted rings.
                    Hence he inferred that the light of both the systems of rings was polarised in
                    the plane of incidence, at the polarising angle for glass. Μ. Arago has likewise
                    shewn that the colours of the reflected and transmitted rays are complementary,
                    and that their intensities are exactly equal, completely neutralising each other
                    or forming white light when they are superposed. The most interesting
                    experiment, however, made by Μ. Arago, is that in which he examined the rings
                    when a convex lens was pressed upon a metallic reflector. When viewed with a
                    prism of Iceland spar, as before, one of the two images vanished at the maximum
                    polarising angle of the glass, but the phenomena were different above and below
                    this angle. At less angles, the dimensions and the colours of the rings were the
                    same in both images, which differed only in the quantity of their light; but at
                    greater angles, the rings in the two images had their colours complementary, the
                    one beginning from a white centre, and the other from a black one.</p>
                <p>We have already seen that Dr. Young first applied the principle of interference
                    to explain the colours of crystallised plates; but he did not explain why these
                    colours are not produced excepting with polarised light. MM. Arago and Fresnel
                    entered upon this inquiry, and obtained a satisfactory solution of the
                    difficulty. They found that two rays of light polarised in the same plane,
                    produced fringes by their interference as in common light; that no interference
                    at all takes place when these planes are at right angles to each other: and that
                    at an intermediate inclination, the interference is diminished, and the fringes
                    decrease in intensity. In following out these interesting results, they found
                    that two oppositely polarised pencils will not interfere even when their planes
                    are made to coincide, unless they belong to a pencil which had been wholly
                    polarised in one plane.</p>
                <p>We owe also to Μ. Arago the beautiful discovery that the quantity of polarised
                    light in the reflected and transmitted pencils of common plates are exactly
                    equal.</p>
                <p>We are indebted likewise to Μ. Arago for some important results respecting the
                    interference of light. We have already seen that the interior fringes formed by
                    diffraction disappear when the light which passes by one side of the inflecting
                    body is stopped. Μ. Arago observed that these fringes were displaced by making
                    the same light pass through a thin plate of some transparent substance, and that
                    the bands were always shifted to the side on which the plate was placed. The
                    amount of this displacement determines the velocity of light in the interposed
                    medium, and consequently gives us a measure of the refractive power of that body
                    with the highest degree of accuracy.</p>
                <p>In conjunction with Μ. Biot, Μ. Arago published a valuable series of experiments
                    on the density and refractive power of <hi rend="italic">nine</hi> gaseous
                    bodies measured in relation to atmospheric air taken as unity. Hydrogen stood at
                    the head of the table, with a refractive index equal to 6∙61436, (or 7 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 0335 if we use the density given by Berzelius) whilst
                    oxygen stood at the foot of the table with a refractive index of 0.8616.</p>
                <p>Among the most successful cultivators of physical optics, Μ. Biot holds a
                    distinguished place. His attention was first directed to the colours of
                    crystalline plates discovered by Μ. Arago, and by nice instruments and
                    indefatigable labour he determined the general laws of the phenomenon in
                    reference to the thickness of the plates, and the composition of the tints as
                    observed in sulphate of lime and rock crystal, calcareous spar, and arragonite.
                    He observed that at a perpendicular incidence the two colours correspond to
                    those seen by reflexion and transmission in thin plates of air, and he concluded
                    that the thicknesses at which these colours were developed, were proportional to
                    the thickness of the plate of air which gave the same tint in Newton’s scale.
                    These thicknesses were found to vary with the nature of the crystal, and were
                    always much greater than the thicknesses of thin plates which gave the same
                    tints. He had at first supposed that at oblique incidences the changes of colour
                    followed the same law as in thin plates, but he afterwards found that the tint
                    depended on the thickness of the crystal traversed by the refracted ray, and as
                    the square of the sine of the angle which the direction of the ray formed with
                    the optic axis. In these experiments Μ. Biot considered arragonite, sulphate of
                    lime, topaz, and mica, as all having one axis of double refraction like
                    calcareous spar.</p>
                <p>In order to explain these various phenomena, Μ. Biot communicated to the
                    Institute in 1812<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    Polarisation.</hi> In this theory the particles of a polarised ray are supposed
                    to preserve their primitive polarisation till they reach a certain depth in the
                    crystal, when a succession of isochronous oscillations round their centre of
                    gravity take place, the axes of polarisation being carried alternately to each
                    side of the axis of the crystal. The depth through which the particle is carried
                    during each of these oscillations, is assumed to be twice the depth through
                    which it has passed before the oscillations began. When the ray emerges from the
                    crystalline plate, the oscillations are supposed to stop, and the ray assumes a
                    <hi rend="italic">fixed polarisation,</hi> (in which the axes of the particles
                    are arranged in two rectangular directions) as if the last oscillation had been
                    completed when it quitted the plate.</p>
                <p>The remarkable colours discovered by Μ. Arago alone the axis of quartz, were
                    carefully studied by Μ. Biot, and he and Μ. Seebeck, nearly about the same time
                    discovered the existence of the very same colours in several essential oils and
                    solutions, such as oil of turpentine, oil of laurel, oil of lemons, syrup of
                    sugar, the two first turning the planes of polarisation from right to left, and
                    the two last from left to right. In a memoir laid before the Institute in 1818,
                    he has shewn that the angular rotation of the plane of polarisation is directly
                    proportional to the thickness of the plate and inversely to the square of the
                    length of the fits as given by Newton. He then concludes that this property of
                    turning the particles of light round their centres of gravity resides in the
                    ultimate particles of solid or fluid bodies, that it is necessary to their very
                    existence, and thaï it is entirely independent of their mutual distances and
                    mode of aggregation.</p>
                <p>Μ. Biot afterwards resumed this subject, and extended his researches to a great
                    variety of substances; and he has still more recently employed circular
                    polarisation in detecting the constituents of particular vegetable substances,
                    where chemical analysis had partly or wholly failed. He has shewn that the
                    soluble portion of plants, or the farinaceous matter of grain and roots, to
                    which he has given the name of <hi rend="italic">dextrine,</hi> and which Μ.
                    Raspail had considered to be of the nature of gum, turns the planes of
                    polarisation more powerfully to the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> (hence the name
                    <hi rend="italic">dextrine)</hi> than the syrups of <hi rend="italic">cane
                    sugar;</hi> and that all the <hi rend="italic">gums,</hi> and the syrups of the
                    <hi rend="italic">sugar of grapes,</hi> turn the planes of polarisation to the
                    left. Μ. Biot has also applied the same method of research in ascertaining the
                    changes which take place in the sap of trees, and in analysing the processes of
                    vegetation which are concerned in the growth of wheat and rye. His researches
                    are of great practical value in an agricultural point of view, and ought to
                    impress on those whom it most concerns, the important truth, that the most
                    recondite discoveries in science will sooner or later find an useful
                    application.</p>
                <p>One of the most important discoveries made by Μ. Biot was the true nature of the
                    double refraction and polarisation in quartz, which Huygens had been unable to
                    develope. Μ.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194561636" xml:id="kp-eb0716-1636-0367"/>
                <p>Biot found that it differed from that of calcareous spar, in having the phenomena
                    regulated by a <hi rend="italic">prolate</hi> in place of an <hi rend="italic"
                    >oblate</hi> spheroid, the least refracted image being the ordinary ray in
                    quartz, and the extraordinary one in Iceland spar.</p>
                <p>Whilst these valuable researches were carrying on in France, Sir David Brewster
                    was occupied with the same subject in Scotland. In his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Treatise on New Philosophical Instruments,</hi> published in the beginning of
                    1813, he has shewn that chromate of lead and realgar exceed the diamond<note

                    have their high refractive powers in the order of their inflammabilities; that
                    fluor spar and cryolite have their refractive powers below all solid substances,
                    (excepting <hi rend="italic">ta-basheer),</hi> and lower dispersive powers than
                    all other bodies; and that all doubly refracting crystals have a double
                    dispersive power. He shewed that oil of cassia had the least, and sulphuric acid
                    the greatest action upon green light; that a tertiary spectrum is formed, when
                    prisms of the same substance but different angles are made to correct the
                    dispersion, by the inclination of one of them; and that achromatic combinations
                    may be effected by prisms and lenses of the same kind of glass.</p>
                <p>In the year 1812, he began to study the subject of the polarisation of light, in
                    consequence of having become acquainted with Malus’s celebrated discovery of the
                    polarisation of light by reflexion. He discovered the remarkable property of the
                    agate, by which it gives only a single distinct image polarised in one plane;
                    the property of depolarisation possessed by almost all minerals, and by many
                    animal and vegetable substances;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the previous discovery of Μ. Arago of the colours of crystalline plates, or with

                    complete polarisation of the exterior and interior rainbows.</p>
                <p>In the course of these inquiries our author discovered the two beautiful systems
                    of elliptical coloured rings, which we see by transmitting polarised light along
                    the two optical axes of topaz; and in consequence of his using a conical in
                    place of a parallel beam of light in these experiments, he was led to observe
                    the same system of rings, under different modifications, in various other
                    bodies. While examining the depolarising effect of a plate of mica at an oblique
                    incidence, he was led to the discovery of the polarisation of light by oblique
                    transmission through bundles of crystallised or uncrystallised plates; and
                    though Malus had anticipated him in this discovery, yet he had determined the
                    law of the phenomena, which had escaped the notice of that skilful observer.</p>
                <p>Hitherto no idea had been formed of the mechanical condition of bodies in which

                    1814 and 1815, a new light was thrown upon the subject, by three discoveries
                    made by Sir David Brewster, namely, that the polarising structure could be
                    produced in glass by heat, and also by rapid cooling;<note anchored="true"

                    exhibits the complementary colours by polarised light.</hi><note anchored="true"

                <p>We have already seen that Malus considered the property of polarisation by
                    reflexion as independent of the other modes of action which bodies exercise upon
                    light. In order to investigate this subject, Sir David Brewster made an
                    extensive series of experiments to determine the angles of maximum polarisation
                    by reflexion, from the surfaces of bodies, and from the separating surfaces of
                    different media. After encountering many difficulties, he was led to the
                    discovery of the very simple law <hi rend="italic">that the index of refraction
                    is the tangent of the aìigle of polarisation,</hi> which is rigorously true for
                    all separating surfaces, and for rays of all refrangi-bilities; and hence we
                    obtain an immediate explanation of the perplexing fact, that at the maximum
                    polarising angle the polarisation of the ray is never complete. When this law is
                    expressed geometrically, it informs us that when a ray of light is polarised by
                    reflexion, the reflected ray forms a right angle with the refracted ray; that
                    the sum of the angles of reflexion and refraction is a right angle, or counting
                    from the surface, that the angles of reflexion and refraction are equal. In the
                    same paper, our author has shewn that light may be completely polarised by two,
                    three, or more reflexions, at angles all above or all below, or partly above and
                    partly below the angle of complete polarisation, a greater number of reflexions
                    being required, as the incident ray approaches either to the refracting surface,
                    or to a line perpendicular to it. In the same paper, it is shewn that every ray
                    of light polarised by reflexion has been acted upon by the refracting force; and
                    that total reflexion exercises an analogous action upon light with metallic
                    surfaces.</p>
                <p>The influence of heat in producing a transient polarising structure in glass, led
                    our author to an elaborate examination of the subject in 1815.<note

                    the edge of a thick plate of glass is laid on a bar of hot iron, the heat
                    gradually propagates itself along the plate, and its path is marked by the most
                    beautiful fringes of polarised light; but no sooner has the heat entered the
                    plate of glass, than similar fringes appear on its upper edge, <hi rend="italic"
                    >where there is no heat at all.</hi> After a certain period, the w hole surface
                    of the glass is covered with coloured fringes, which are arranged in two similar
                    polarising structures at the edges, separated by two dark lines or axes from an
                    opposite structure in the middle. When the glass is removed from the iron, the
                    fringes gradually disappear, and are extinguished when the heat is uniformly
                    diffused over the glass. If the plate of glass is made very hot in boiling oil,
                    and is then allowed to cool with its edges against a plate of cold iron, it will
                    exhibit in a fainter degree the fringes above described; but they are now all
                    reversed, the middle structure having the same character as the external
                    structures bad formerly, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> If, when a plate
                    of glass is covered over with the polarised tints, it is suddenly cut in two by
                    a diamond in the direction of its length, the whole structure is instantly
                    changed, and each piece has the same properties and structure as the whole,
                    exactly like a portion detached from the end of a magnet. The same properties he
                    found in muriate of soda, fluor spar, obsidian, semi-opal, horn, tortoiseshell,
                    and various animal and vegetable bodies. The tints thus developed by heat
                    exhibit, by their being made to cross one another and by other modifications, a
                    series of the most brilliant phenomena within the whole range of optics.</p>
                <p>In continuing these experiments, our author found that when the plate of glass,
                    after being brought to a red lient, was allowed to cool quickly, it exhibited
                    permanently the same coloured fringes, a discovery which had likewise been made

                    subject which had exercised the sagacity of Huygens, Benjamin Martin, Brougham,
                    Robison, and Mains. The last of these philosophers ascribed the multiplication
                    of the images to the interception of the pencils by fissures within the crystal,
                    and the colours to the thin plate of air which it enclosed; but Sir David
                    Brewster discovered the true cause of the phenomena, and proved that there were
                    no fissures nor plates of air; that the multiplication of the images arise from
                    one or more veins of calcareous spar, which divided the rhomb into prisms, so as
                    to form composite crystals, having the axes of crystallization and of double
                    refraction of the two contiguous crystals turned round 180°, so that each of the
                    two pencils formed by double refraction are subdivided in passing from the one
                    crystal to the other. He has shewn also that the colours are the polarised tints
                    produced by thin plates crystallized, these plates giving the regular system of
                    coloured rings seen along the axis of calcareous spar, the light being polarised
                    by the first prism of spar, and analysed by the last. Hence it follows that the
                    polarised tints of crystals were seen and studied by Huygens and his successors,
                    without having any idea of what they were.</p>
                <p>The crystalline lenses of animals had hitherto been supposed to increase

                    correcting the spherical aberration. Sir David Brewster, however, shewed, in
                    1816,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    density from the centre, being accompanied with another diminishing in density,

                    rising to a bright yellow of the first order. About the same time he discovered

                <p>In the beginning of February 1815, when examining the action of metals upon
                    polarised light, our author discovered that complementary colours were produced
                    by one or more reflexions from plates of gold, silver, and other metals; that
                    analogous colours were produced by total reflexion; that common light was wholly
                    polarised in the plane of incidence by a number of metallic reflexions, this
                    number being greater in silver and gold than in the other metals. Though ex
                    amined with much care both by our author and Μ. Biot,<note anchored="true"

                    phenomena were still veiled in obscurity.</p>
                <p>Hitherto all crystals were believed to have one axis of double refraction, like
                    Iceland spar or quartz; but in the year 1817,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans.</hi> 1818, p.
                    199.</p></note> Sir David Brewster discovered that the greater number of
                    crystals, and among these arragonite, sulphate of iron, sulphate of barytes,
                    sulphate of strontian, topaz, felspar, and nitre, had <hi rend="italic">two
                    axes</hi> of double refraction, which he called resultant axes, and which were
                    more or less inclined to each other, as the intensity of the real axes more or
                    less approached to equality. By measuring the deviation of the two pencils in
                    different planes, he found that the double refraction was the same in every part
                    of the same ring, disappearing along the resultant axis, and increasing with the
                    value of the tints; and by projecting the coloured rings, and measuring the
                    angular distances from the axis at which the same tints were produced, he was
                    led to the true physical law of the tints, and of the deviation of the
                    extraordinary ray. This general law, when applied to the polarised tints, is
                    thus expressed: <hi rend="italic">The tint produced at any point of the sphere,
                    by the joint action of two axes, is equal to the diagonal of a parallelogram
                    tvhose sides represent the tints produced by each axis separately, and ιchose
                    angle is double of the angle formed by two planes passing through that point of
                    the sj)here and the respective axis.</hi> When the law is applied to the
                    phenomena of double refraction, it may be thus expressed: <hi rend="italic">The
                    increment of the square of the velocity of the extraordinary ray produced by the
                    action of two axes of double refraction, is equal to the diagonal of a
                    parallelogram whose sides are the increments of the square of the velocity
                    produced by each axis separately, and calculated by the law of Huygens, and
                    whose angle is double of the angle formed by two planes passing through the ray
                    and the respective axis.</hi> When the two rectangular axes are of equal
                    intensity and of the same character, the preceding law gives the very same
                    results as the law of Huygens does for one axis placed at right angles with the
                    other two. When the crystal has three equal rectangular axes, their forces are
                    in equilibrio in every part of the sphere, and there is neither double
                    refraction nor polarisation. When the first of these laws is applied to the
                    mysterious actions of sulphate of lime, with the origin and classification of
                    which Μ. Biot had been so much perplexed, and which he has represented by
                    complicated and empirical formula?, the whole mystery disappears, and <hi
                    rend="italic">all</hi> the diversified and capricious variations of tint which
                    he had ascribed to secondary forces, become the legitimate and calculable
                    results of two axes of double refraction.</p>
                <p>During these laborious researches, our author was led to the law by which the
                    primitive forms of minerals are connected with the number of their axes of
                    double refraction, and to point out the connexion between the optical structure
                    and chemical composition of crystals.</p>
                <p>The absorption of common light, in virtueof whichcrystals exhibit different
                    colours, or shades of colour, in different directions, had been long observed by
                    Wollaston, Cordier, Bournon, De Drée, and others; but Sir David Brewster
                    discovered that in a great numberof coloured crystals, both with one and two
                    axes of double refraction, polarised light was absorbed, according to regular
                    laws depending on the inclination of the ray to the axis or axes of the crystal,
                    and that in such crystals the two pencils are always differently coloured, the
                    difference of colour disappearing in the direction of the axis, and rising to a
                    maximum at right angles to it. These phenomena are finely seen in super-acetate
                    of <pb break="no" facs="nls:194561662" xml:id="kp-eb0716-1662-0369"/>copper,
                    dicliroite, Brazilian topaz, and augite. These properties are shewn by our
                    author to be singularly modified by heat, and even communicated to crystals
                    which do not naturally possess it. Absorbing crystals have been called <hi
                    rend="italic">dichroitic,</hi> and the property itself <hi rend="italic"
                    >dichroism.</hi></p>
                <p>The subject of circular polarisation was likewise examined by our author in
                    quartz and amethyst.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Edin∙ Trans,</hi> vol. iχ. p. 139.</p></note> He found that heat
                    entirely removed from quartz the power of producing circular polarisation, when
                    the substance was reduced to fusion; he discovered it near the resultant axis of
                    chrysoberyl, and in certain specimens of unannealed glass.<note anchored="true"

                    of the amethyst, he found that this interesting mineral combines the opposite
                    structures of the two kinds of quartz, being composed of alternate strata of
                    right and left-handed quartz, these two opposite actions destroying each other
                    at their junction, where the colouring matter of the amethyst is principally
                    apparent.</p>
                <p>In all the experiments on the polarisation of light by reflexion from
                    crystallised surfaces, their action was supposed to be the same as that of
                    common solids and fluids, and Malus had distinctly stated it as the result of
                    experiment, that Iceland spar had the same polarising angle on all its surfaces
                    and in every azimuth, its action being “independent of the position of the
                    principal sections,” “that its reflecting power extends beyond the limit of the
                    polarising forces of the crystal, and that as light is only polarised by
                    penetrating the surface, the force which produces extraordinary refraction
                    begins to act only at this limit.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    240.</p></note> Doubting the accuracy of these results, Sir David Brewster
                    instituted a series of experiments <hi rend="italic">on the action of
                    crystallised surfaces upon light,</hi> by which he has established the
                    remarkable fact that the angle of complete polarisation varies from 57° 14' to
                    59° 32', on the surface of the rhomb of calcareous spar, being a minimum in the
                    plane of the principal section, and a maximum in a plane perpendicular to it.
                    But it is not merely the polarising angle that is changed. When the ordinary
                    reflecting force is weakened by causing the reflexion to be made from the
                    refracting surface of oil of cassia and Iceland spar, he found that the light
                    was no longer polarised in the plane of reflexion, and that the deviation from
                    this plane depended on the inclination of the ray to the axis of the crystal,
                    the deviation becoming less and less as the refractive power of the fluid was
                    diminished. In the same paper he has shewn that by altering the mechanical
                    condition of the surfaces of crystals, and making the ray enter this surface
                    from fluids of différent refractive powers, the ordinary or the extraordinary
                    image may be weakened or extinguished at pleasure.<note anchored="true"

                <p>In the year 1816, Sir David Brewster discovered a remarkable system of coloured
                    rings in apophyllite, a singularly constituted crystal, one part of which has
                    one axis, whilst another part has two axes of double refraction. Different parts
                    of this crystal possess different degrees of double refraction, with the same
                    thickness, and at the same inclination to the axis; and the beautiful and
                    symmetrical figure which a perfect crystal exhibits by polarised light, deline-I
                    ated in the most splendid colours, is perhaps the finest sight I which the
                    mineral kingdom can present to us.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of polarised light, our author discovered also a singular structure in certain
                    crystals of chabasie, in which the double refraction gradually diminishes in
                    successive strata, then vanishes, and reappears with an opposite sign, the one
                    double refraction being positive and the other negative; but the most remarkable
                    of all these structures was that of <hi rend="italic">analcime,</hi> in which he
                    discovered a new species of double refraction, in which the phenomena are

                    modification of these spectra; phenomena not yet brought within the palc of the
                    undulatory theory. In the third paper, <hi rend="italic">on the double

                    double refraction, and that the doubly refracting properties, which are not
                    inherent in the molecules themselves, are produced by the pressure caused by the
                    forces of aggregation, which generally differ in intensity in the direction of
                    the three rectangular axes. The same author has more rcccntly succeeded in
                    producing regular double refraction by the expansive presence of heat. The other

                    the quantities of light polarised at all incidences, both by reflexion and
                    transmission; and has explained all the phenomena of partial polarisation, and
                    those produced by any number of successive reflexions and transmissions. In the
                    last of these three papers our author shews that the quantity of polarised light
                    in the light reflected and transmitted by a transparent plate is not equal at
                    all angles of incidence, and that the proposition is true when applied to
                    surfaces alone, the apparent equality in the first case being produced by
                    unexcluded light polarised perpendicular to the plane of reflexion.</p>
                <p>We have already seen that Malus, Biot, and Sir David Brewster had been baffled in
                    their attempts to unravel the complex pheñomena of metallic polarisation. The
                    last of these authors had at various times resumed the investigation; but it was
                    not till February 1830, that he communicated the result to the Royal Society, in
                    a paper entitled, <hi rend="italic">on the phenomena and laws of elliptic
                    polarisation, as exhibited in the action of metals upon light.</hi><note

                    of elliptical polarisation, connecting the phenomena of circularly polarised
                    light with those of plane polarised light, the action of <hi rend="italic"
                    >silver</hi> approaching nearest to that of totally reflecting surfaces by which
                    circular polarisation is produced, and that of <hi rend="italic">galaena</hi> to
                    transparent bodies or those not metallic, by which plane polarisation is
                    produced. The colours accompanying these phenomena have no relation to those of
                    crystallised plates, and in the case of silver and gold are extremely beautiful
                    and splendid.</p>
                <p>Hitherto the analysis of solar light by Sir Isaac Newton had been regarded as
                    complete, and incapable of any farther development. From this analysis he
                    himself deduced the conclusion, <hi rend="italic">that to the same degree of

                    is a maximum at that point where the same colour is most intense in the compound
                    spectrum. Hence it follows that all the colours in the solar spectrum are
                    compound, consisting of red, yellow, and blue light in different proportions, so
                    that if at any point we separate as many rays of each colour as is necessary to
                    produce <hi rend="italic">white</hi> light, by absorbing the excess at that

                    Sir David Brewster, by means of absorbing media. But in a very recent
                    communication made to the Royal Society, (in June 1837), he has explained a new
                    method of effecting this by perfectly transparent media, which he calls <hi

                <p>The late Dr. Thomas John Seebeck of Nuremberg, was an active and successful
                    cultivator of the science of Optics. His first experiments on this subject were
                    published in Schweigger’s Journal for April 1813 and December 1814. In 1811 Μ.
                    Arago observed the polarising structure in thick pieces of flint, and in 1812
                    Sir David Brewster had noticed the same property in some pieces of plate
                    glass.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    observed the regular figure produced by polarised light, when the glass had the
                    regular form of cubes and cylinders. In cubes of an inch in diameter, he found
                    them to be indistinct, and not produced by fluor spar or rock salt. In his
                    second paper of December 1814, he shews that a plate of glass made red hot, and
                    set upon its edges to cool, exhibits at the part which cools first a series of
                    coloured fringes, which spread over the whole plate, the structure which
                    produces them remaining permanently fixed in the glass. These experiments arc
                    posterior to those made in Scotland on the effects of heat upon glass, and on
                    the polarising structure of glass cooled in water.</p>
                <p>Early in 1816, Dr. Seebeck discovered the property of certain essential oils in
                    producing the polarised tints, the property ofsingle refraction possessed by
                    tourmaline, and the system of coloured rings produced by Iceland spar; but in
                    these discoveries he was anticipated, as we have seen, by others, though he is
                    entitled to all the merit of a second discoverer.</p>
                <p>In 1809 Dr. Seebeck communicated to the Academy of Sciences at Berlin, an
                    interesting memoir <hi rend="italic">on the unequal production of heat in the

                    different powers of these media to refract the rays of solar heat; but Sir David
                    Brewster explained them by supposing that colourless transparent bodies exercise
                    the same variety of absorptive action upon heat that coloured bodies do upon
                    light, the body in the last case becoming coloured in consequence of that
                    action. Hence the maximum ordinate of heat will shift its position with the
                    nature of the body, and we shall no doubt find media, several maxima and minima,
                    and points of no heat at all, according as we increase the size of the prism or
                    the thickness which the heat traverses.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    whose curve of heat is well ascertained, and then to determine the changes which
                    take place in the curve by interposing thick plates of transparent solids and
                    fluids.</p>
                <p>This eminent philosopher would have done still more for the science of optics,
                    had he not been attracted to the study of thermo-electricity, in the creation
                    and extension of which he has immortalised his name.</p>
                <p>We are indebted to Dr. A. Seebeck for a series of instructive and accurate
                    experiments on the polarising angle of different substances, which confirm the
                    accuracy of the law of the tangents,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    different azimuths.</p>
                <p>We come now to that auspicious period in the history’ of optics, when this
                    science was destined to receive the grandest accessions from the genius of Μ. A.
                    Fresnel, engineer of roads and bridges. What Newton did for astronomy, Fresnel
                    did for physical optics; and all Europe will, we are persuaded, confirm the
                    decision which places him pre-eminently above all the other cultivators of this
                    branch of science. The discoveries of Fresnel, however, are so connected with
                    theoretical considerations, that it is impossible, in a historical sketch, to
                    give any thing like an idea of their magnitude and importance. The phenomena of
                    rotatory polarisation in quartz, which had so much perplexed philosophers, have
                    been completely explained by Fresnel. He found that they arise from the
                    interference of two circularly polarised pencils, propagated with different
                    velocities along the axis of quartz, the one revolving from right to left, and
                    the other from left to right, and that a plane polarised ray is equivalent to
                    two circularly polarised rays of half the intensity. These facts he verified
                    experimentally, by an achromatic combination of right and left-handed prisms of
                    quartz, so disposed as to double the refraction of the images.</p>
                <p>Μ. Fresnel had also found that light was circularly polarised by two total
                    reflexions from glass at an angle of about 54° 37 ’, and by placing between two
                    rhombs of glass, each of which polarised the light circularly and had their
                    planes of reflexion at right angles to each other, a crystallised plate, he
                    observed the light transmitted through this system exhibited phenomena analogous
                    to those seen along the axis of rock crystal. The rhomb of glass so cut, that
                    when the incident rays enter and leave it perpendicularly, they have suffered
                    two reflexions at an angle of 54° 37', is well known by the name of Fresnel’s
                    rhomb.</p>
                <p>Fresnel’s theory of double refraction and polarisation, one of the finest efforts
                    of genius, conducted its author to many important results which had escaped the
                    notice of the most diligent observers. Hitherto ithadbeen taken for granted by
                    all, and appeared to be proved by Biot’s experiments on topaz, that in biaxal
                    crystals one of the rays <pb break="no" facs="nls:194561688"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-1688-0371"/>followed the ordinary law of the sines; but it
                    followed from Fresnel’s theory that it did not, and by a series of the nicest
                    and most difficult experiments he determined, that neither of the two rays have
                    a constant velocity, both being performed according to a new law. What had been
                    called the extraordinary ray, he found by his theory to be regulated by the law
                    discovered by Sir David Brewster, and simplified in its mathematical expression
                    by Μ. Biot, and he shewed that all the phenomena of double refraction could be
                    accurately calculated. The axes of elasticity in Fresnel’s theory are the same
                    as the axes of double refraction in Sir David Brewster’s, and the laws of the
                    composition and resolution of such axes in uniaxal, biaxal, and tessular
                    crystals, which have no double refraction previously given by the latter, arc
                    all necessary results of the same theory.</p>
                <p>But the most remarkable part of Fresnel’s theory is his explanation of the
                    polarisation of light. The hypothesis of <hi rend="italic">transversal
                    vibrations</hi> first presented itself to Dr. Young while considering the law of
                    extraordinary refraction in biaxal crystals, as communicated to him by Sir David
                    Brewster. Μ. Fresnel, however, shewed that it was a necessary consequence of the
                    laws of interference, and that the vibrations of a polarised ray are on the
                    surface of the wave, and perpendicular to the plane of polarisation. In
                    unpolarised light they are also only on the surface of the wave, and this
                    species of light is conceived to “consist of a rapid succession of systems of
                    waves polarised in every possible plane, passing through the normal to the front
                    of the wave.” Hence light is polarised by resolving the vibrations into two sets
                    in two rectangular directions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>We have already slightly noticed the fine discoveries of MM. Arago and Fresnel on
                    the interference of polarised light, and we can now only refer with admiration
                    to the beautiful series of experiments by which the phenomena of moveable
                    polarisation were properly explained, and brought under the dominion of the
                    undulatory theory. When a polarised ray proceeding from a luminous point was
                    transmitted through two rhomboids of Iceland spar of equal thickness, whose
                    principal sections were inclined 45° to the plane of primitive polarisation, the
                    emergent light will diverge as if from two near points, and the two portions
                    will be oppositely polarised. MM. Arago and Fresnel found that the light formed
                    by the union of these pencils was <hi rend="italic">plane, circularly,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">elliptically</hi> polarised, according to the difference of
                    the paths traversed when they met. Following out this principle, MM. Arago and
                    Fresnel were led to an <hi rend="italic">experimentum crucis,</hi> to determine
                    the accuracy of the theory of moveable polarisation. A homogeneous ray of
                    polarised light was transmitted through a plate of sulphate of lime, having its
                    principal section inclined 45° to the plane of primitive polarisation, and of
                    such a thickness that it should be circularly polarised according to the
                    undulatory theory, and plane polarised according to the other; and the result
                    was decisive against the theory of moveable polarisation.</p>
                <p>We owe also to Μ. Fresnel the true theory of the inflexion or diffraction of
                    light The Institute of France made this the subject of their physical prize for
                    1818, and the memoir of our author was the successful one. He had at first
                    adopted and extended the theory of Dr. Young, that the fringes arise from the
                    interference of the direct and inflected light; but he was afterwards obliged to
                    admit, that rays passing at a sensible distance from the reflecting body,
                    deviate from their primitive direction, and interfere with the direct light.
                    This interesting effect he ascribes to a number of elementary waves sent from
                    each portion of the surface of the principal wave when it reaches the reflecting
                    body, and he determines the resultant of all the elementary waves sent by these
                    portions to a given point. Upon applying this theory to various cases of
                    inflexion, he found it to agree so well with observation, that, with the
                    exception of the case of diffraction by narrow apertures, the theory did not err
                    more than the 2500th part of an inch.</p>
                <p>Among the many important discoveries of Fresnel we must enumerate the theory of
                    the reflexion of light. Dr. Young had shewn on the undulatory theory, that at a
                    perpendicular incidence the intensity of the reflected light was a very simple
                    function of the index of refraction.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    another process at the same result, without knowing, we believe, what had been

                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Id</hi> tom. χ.</p></note> The
                    conclusions, however, at which this distinguished mathematician arrived, were
                    inconsistent with observation; and Fresnel had the good fortune to give a
                    complete solution of the problem, by combining the doctrine of transversal
                    vibrations with the theory of waves. He assumes, that the elasticity of the
                    ether in the two media are equal, but their density different, though he also
                    solved the problem on the more general assumption, that the elasticity was
                    different in the two media. He thus obtained formulae for all incidences and all
                    refractive powers, and the law of the tangents, as well as that of the equality

                    these formulae. At a perpendicular incidence the formula coincides with that of
                    Young and Poisson, and at 90° the whole light is reflected, a result which has
                    been verified by observation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Contemporary with the discoveries of Fresnel were those of the late Μ. Fraunhofer
                    of Munich, who made several important observations on the solar spectrum, on the
                    diffraction of light, on refractive and dispersive powers, and on the
                    refrangibility of the light of the fixed stars. By using fine prisms entirely
                    free of veins, he discovered that the solar spectrum was crossed by about 590
                    black lines, and he executed a beautiful drawing of the spectrum, in which the
                    most important of these arc projected. Fraunhofer was not aware that Dr.
                    Wollaston had previously discovered <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> of these lines;
                    but this slight anticipation does not in the least degree diminish the
                    singularity of this splendid discovery. He discovered similar lines in electric
                    light, and in the spectra of the Moon, Venus, Mars, Castor, Pollux, Sirius,
                    Capella, Betalgeus, and Procyon;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    7. Sir David Brewster asserts, that all the coloured stars derive their colours
                    from defective lines in their spectra, having found these lines in those most
                    strongly coloured.</p></note> but none whatever in artificial white flames.
                    These lines he found to have a fixed position in relation to the coloured
                    spaces, and, by measuring accurately the distance of prominent lines in the
                    different coloured spaces, he obtained measures of the refractive and dispersive
                    powers of bodies with a degree of accuracy hitherto unknown. Fraunhofer
                    considered these lines as having their origin in the nature of the sun’s light;
                    but Sir David Brewster, who by particular methods has discovered more than twice
                    the number of lines reckoned by Fraunhofer, has established the curiousfact,
                    that many of them are produced also by the action of the earth’s atmosphere. In
                    his researches on this subject Sir David Brewster discovered the remarkable
                    property possessed by nitrous gas of producing analogous lines in great numbers,
                    increasing in width with the thickness of the gas, or with an augmentation of
                    its temperature. “The power of heat alone,” says this author, “to render a gas,
                    which is almost colourless, as red as blood, without decomposing it, is in
                    itself a most singular result; and my surprise was greatly <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194561701" xml:id="kp-eb0716-1701-0372"/>increased, when I afterwards
                    succeeded in rendering the same pale nitrous acid gas so absolutely black by
                    heat, that not a ray of the brightest summer sun was capable of penetrating
                    it.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    discovered numerous fixed lines disposed at equal distances, in the vapour of
                    bromine and iodine, and Sir David Brewster has very recently discovered hundreds
                    of lines under very singular circumstances, in the spectrum of an artificial
                    substance, resembling mother-of-pearl;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    what is most interesting, these lines are <hi rend="italic">moveable, shifting

                    substance. He has also discovered, that broad dark bands like those produced by
                    absorbing media, but entirely different from the nearly equidistant bands formed
                    by single thin plates, are produced by a number of thin plates in a state of

                <p>Among the most distinguished contributors to optical discovery, Sir John Herschel
                    occupies a high place. The deviations of the polarised tints from the colours of
                    thin plates, or those of Newton’s scale, had been discovered by Sir David
                    Brewster in acetate of lead, tartrate of potash and soda, apophyllite, topaz,
                    and various other minerals. He had divided these crystals into two classes, viz.
                    those that had the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> ends of the rings <hi
                    rend="italic">inwards,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> ends <hi

                    the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> ends <hi rend="italic">outwards.</hi><note

                    of Science,</hi> No. xii. p. 348∙</p></note> In his paper of 1818, he states,
                    that “in almost all crystals with two axes, the tints in the neighbourhood of
                    the resultant axes, when the plate has a considerable thickness, lose their
                    resemblance to those of Newton’s scale, as will be more minutely described in
                    another paper.” Conceiving that these deviated tints arose from the
                    superposition of systems <hi rend="italic">of</hi> rings of different colours,
                    Sir John Herschel examined the coloured rings by homogeneous light, and
                    established the important fact that the inclination of the resultant axes varied
                    in the different colours of the spectrum, the poles or centres of the rings
                    approaching to each other in red, and receding in violet light, in some
                    crystals; while in others they receded from each other in red, and approached in
                    violet light. In tartrate of potash and soda, for example, the inclination of
                    the axes was 75° 42' in <hi rend="italic">red,</hi> and only 55° 14' in <hi

                    These various axes all lie in the same plane, excepting in borax. In the paper
                    containing this discovery, and in other two,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    described various interesting phenomena which he discovered in different

                    conclusions respecting the law of proportional action of these crystals on the
                    different colours of the spectrum.</p>
                <p>We have already seen that the force which produces circular polarisation had been
                    deemed a property of the ultimate particles of bodies, and totally unconnected
                    with their mode of aggregation. In 1820 Sir John Herschel made the beautiful
                    discovery, that the direction of the circular polarisation in quartz was
                    invariably the same with that of the plagiedral planes round the summit, the
                    direction of the polarisation being retrograde or direct, according as these
                    planes leant forward or backward round this summit.</p>

                    appeared during the last century.</p>
                <p>Μ. Fresnel was, we believe, the first person who observed the change produced by
                    heat on the tints of sulphate of lime. It is to Μ. Mitscherlich, however, that
                    we owe the most complete investigation of this subject. He found that heat
                    expands crystals differently in different directions. Iceland spar is expanded
                    by it in the direction of its axis, while it is in a slight degree contracted in
                    directions perpendicular to the axis. The rhomb thus approaches to the cube, and
                    the double refraction is diminished. Μ. Mitscherlich also found that the
                    inclination of the optical or resultant axes, which is about 60°, diminishes
                    with heat till they actually form one axis, when by a farther increase of heat
                    they again separate, and open out, as it were, in a plane at right angles to
                    that of the laminae. We have repeated this experiment, and enjoyed the
                    remarkable sight of observing the one system of rings marching towards the other
                    in the plane of the laminae, and changing their form and size as they
                    advanced.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    discovered by Sir David Brewster in glauberite. At the freezing point glauberite
                    has two optical axes for all the colours of the spectrum, the inclination of the
                    axes being <hi rend="italic">greatest</hi> in <hi rend="italic">red,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">least</hi> in <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> light. When heat
                    is applied, the two axes approach, and those of different colours unite
                    successively, the crystal possessing the remarkable property of being a <hi

                    increasing the temperature, the optical axes open out in the same order, but in
                    a plane at right angles to that in which they formerly lay, and long before the
                    temperature has reached that of boiling water the planes of the axes in all the
                    prismatic colours are perpendicular to their first position.<note

                    Μ. Marx has discovered an analogous property in topaz, in which the two axes
                    separate with heat, the variation being greater in the coloured than in the

                    extraordinary ray in calcareous spar (the line F was used) had its deviation
                    increased 2' 34", as the refractive index increased 0∙00043, by a rise of
                    temperature equal to 64°, the refracting angle of the prism being 59° 55' 9",
                    whereas the refractive power for the ordinary ray either does not change at all,
                    or decreases with the temperature by a quantity extremely small. In rock crystal
                    he found the deviation to be 42", or 0∙00027, both on the ordinary and
                    extraordinary ray, the angle of the prism being45° 20' 5". In arragonite he
                    found that the double refraction decreased a little with the temperature.<note

                    actions of the differently coloured rays in crystals with one and two axes of
                    double refraction. His measures were taken in reference to the fixed lines in
                    the spectrum, and the minerals he employed were rock crystal, calcareous spar,
                    arragonite, and colourless topaz. He confirmed the existence of two dispersive
                    powers in doubly refracting crystals, announced long before by Sir David
                    Brewster; and the variation of the inclination of the optic axes with the

                    no doubt unacquainted with the previous labours of these authors, otherwise he
                    would not have passed them over without notice.</p>
                <p>Like every other branch of physical science, optics owes much to the profound
                    researches of Μ. Poisson, which are in general of too recondite a nature to find
                    a place in a popular treatise. The theory of the colours of thin plates was left
                    incomplete by Dr. Young. The two interfering portions from the upper and under
                    surface of the plate were obviously unequal, and therefore could not destroy one
                    another wholly by interference, as they are found to do. Μ. Poisson remedied
                    this defect by shewing that there must be an infinite number of partial
                    reflexions within the plate, at each of which a very small portion of light was
                    reflected, so that the sum of all these portions oflight makes upfor the defect
                    of one of the pencils, and makes the interfering pencils equal. Hence Μ. Poisson
                    has shewn that at a perpendicular incidence, and at points where the effective
                    thickness of the plate is an exact multiple of the length of half an undulation,

                    plate were suppressed altogether, and' the bounding media in absolute contact,
                    so that when these media have the same refractive power, no light will be

                <p>In treating of the subject of diffraction, Μ. Poisson was led to the curious
                    result that the centre of the shadow of a small opaque circular disc, exposed to
                    light diverging from a single point, is as much illuminated by the diffracted
                    light as it would be by the direct light, if the opaque disc were removed. By
                    cementing a small metallic disc upon a plate of pure and homogeneous glass, Μ.

                    Cauchy, a French mathematician of distinguished eminence. In determining the law
                    of propagation of a plane wave, he shews that a disturbance originally limited
                    to a given plane will give rise to three pairs of plane waves with uniform
                    velocities, and parallel to the original plane, the two waves of each pair
                    moving in opposite directions, but with equal velocities. He shews that the
                    separate pairs will move with velocities represented by the reciprocals of the
                    axes of an ellipsoid, the form of which is regulated by the position of the
                    plane wave, and the nature of the system, the absolute displacement of the
                    molecules being parallel to the direction of these axes. Hence a system of plane
                    waves superposed at the point of original disturbance, will be divided into
                    three corresponding systems, and these will generate by their superposition a
                    curved surface of three sheets, each sheet being touched by all the plane waves
                    of the system. If these principles are established, it will follow as a
                    necessary consequence <hi rend="italic">that a single ray of light mill be

                    discovering this ray, or stated the precise physical condition on which its
                    existence depends; but it “would seem to arise from the circumstance that the
                    vibration normal to the wave is not absolutely insensible, so that the actual
                    vibrations are not accurately in the plane of the wave.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See p.375, (note).</p></note> “The results of
                    Μ. Cauchy’s general theory,” continues Professor Lloyd, “embrace and confirm
                    those of Fresnel; and the mathematical laws of the propagation of light are
                    shewn to be particular cases of the more general laws of the propagation of
                    vibratory motion in any elastic medium composed of attracting and repelling
                    molecules. Considered, however, simply with reference to the theory of light,
                    the solution given by Μ. Cauchy cannot, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> conceive, be
                    considered as a complete <hi rend="italic">physical</hi> solution. In other
                    words, the phenomena of light are not connected <hi rend="italic">directly</hi>
                    with any given physical hypothesis; but are shewn to be comprehended in the
                    results of the general theory, in virtue of <hi rend="italic">certain assumed
                    relations</hi> among the constants which that theory involves. If, indeed, we
                    were able to assign the precise physical meaning of these equations of
                    condition, we should have nothing more to desire in the general theory of light;
                    for these equations must necessarily express the characteristic properties of
                    the vibrating medium. In this point of view, their discussion becomes <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> subject of the highest interest; and it is probable that
                    the important conclusions of which we have yet to speak, may in this manner be
                    confirmed and extended.”</p>
                <p>Before quitting this subject, however, we ought to mention that there is an
                    essential difference between the theories of Fresnel and Cauchy. In the former a
                    ray is said to be polarised in or parallel to any plane, when the vibrations of
                    the molecules of ether are <hi rend="italic">perpendicular</hi> to that line or
                    plane; whereas, in Cauchy’s theory, a ray is said to be polarised in or parallel
                    to any plane, when the vibrations of the ether are performed in a parallel to
                    that plane.</p>
                <p>The inability of the undulatory theory to explain the dispersion of light,was
                    long one of the few exceptions to its universalapplication. Dr. Young supposed
                    that the material particles of bodies are incapable of permanent vibrations;
                    that these vibrations will retard those of the ether; and that this retardation
                    will be proportional to their frequency. The Rev. Mr. Challis, adopting Dr.
                    Young’s idea, has endeavoured to explain the manner in which the undulations of
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194561727" xml:id="kp-eb0716-1727-0374"/>the ether
                    within bodies are modified by their material atoms. He supposes that a sensible
                    reflexion takes place at every interruption of continuity in the medium; and he
                    infers that the mean effect produced by a retarding cause proportional to the
                    reflective power of the atoms, will be to make the condensation corresponding to
                    a given velocity greater in a certain proportion than in free space, and to
                    diminish the velocity of propagation in the same proportion. Mr. Airy has more
                    recently endeavoured to remove this difficulty, by supposing that in refracting
                    media there may be something depending on time which alters their elasticity, in
                    the same manner as in air the elasticity is greater with a quick than with a
                    slow vibration of particles.</p>
                <p>An anonymous writer in a very recent number of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Philosophical Magazine,</hi> has proposed another hypothesis for obtaining a
                    difference of elasticity. He supposes that the ether accumulates itself round
                    the particles of transparent media, and forms spheres of a density increasing
                    towards their centres; and he infers that a succession of vibrations
                    communicated through a medium thus constituted will give rise to new vibrations
                    propagated with various velocities corresponding to those of the different rays
                    in the spectrum.</p>
                <p>The complete removal of this difficulty from the undulatory theory has been
                    effected by the skill of Μ. Cauchy. Regarding the sphere of action of the
                    ethereal molecules as indefinitely small, in comparison with the length of an
                    undulation, it had been inferred that the velocity of the undulations must be
                    constant in the same medium; but this restriction being removed as a groundless
                    one, Μ. Cauchy has considered the problem in a more general manner, and has
                    arrived at the result, that there exists a general relation between the length
                    of the undulations and the velocity with which they are propagated, or the index
                    of refraction; and consequently that rays of different colours will have
                    different degrees of refrangibility. This relation is expressed by an equation
                    involving two arbitrary constants, depending on the nature of the medium, and
                    determinable by two values of the index of refraction for two waves of a known
                    length. The refractive index for waves of other lengths may then be computed.
                    Professor Powell has done this for several media,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Phil. Τrans.</hi>

                    have been determined by Fraunhofer, Rudberg, and himself; but though there is a
                    general coincidence with the theory, the differences are in some cases rather
                    inauspicious.</p>
                <p>Μ. Cauchy has more recently deduced from his general theory the remarkable fact,
                    that in a particular case of reflexion the reflected pencil exceeds the incident
                    one in intensity, a result which has been confirmed by direct experiment.</p>
                <p>In examining the two rays produced by the double refraction of quartz, Mr. Airy
                    was led to a discovery which we consider as one of the most important in its
                    results, and one of the most beautiful in its phenomena, that has yet been made
                    in this branch of optics. The circular polarisation of the two rays along the
                    axis of quartz had been studied by different philosophers, and had been
                    explained by Fresnel with singular ingenuity, on the principles of the
                    undulatory theory. No attempt, however, had been made to account for the
                    existence of this property only in the rays which pass near the axis of the
                    crystal, or to define the limit where the circular polarisation ended, and the
                    plane polarisation commenced. Fresnel, and all who have written on the subject,
                    seem to have shrunk from this difficulty; but Mr. Airy thought that the two
                    kinds of polarisation must have some connecting link, and by the aid of theon
                    <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> and experiment he succeeded in discovering it. In
                    place of the two rays in quartz consisting of plane polarised light, as was
                    universally believed, Mr. Airy has shewn that they both consist of elliptically
                    polarised light, the greater axis of the ellipse for the one ray being in the
                    principal plane of the crystal, and the greater axis of the other perpendicular
                    to that plane. One of the rays he found to be right-handed elliptically
                    polarised, and the other left-handed elliptically polarised. The proportion of
                    the axes of the ordinary ray is more nearly one of equality than the proportion
                    of the axes of the extraordinary ray, each proportion being one of equality when
                    the direction of the ray coincides with the axis, and becoming more unequal with
                    the inclination, according to a law not yet discovered. The results calculated
                    from the theory are in perfect accordance with those which Mr. Airy has obtained
                    from very nice and difficult experiments; so that we may regard this beautiful
                    and singular property of the two rays of quartz as perfectly established.</p>
                <p>Without knowing of the beautiful experiments of Μ. Arago, already referred to,
                    Mr. Airy was led to make the same experiment on the coloured rings formed
                    between a lens andametallic reflector, and to drawthe same conclusion from it in
                    favour of the undulatory theory. From a consideration of the formulae of
                    Fresnel, Mr. Airy was led to expect that if the rings were formed between two
                    substances of different refractive powers, such as plate glass and diamond, the
                    light being polarised perpendicular to the plane of incidence, they should have
                    a black centre at incidences less than the polarising angle of the glass, and
                    greater than the polarising angle of the diamond; while they should have a white
                    centre at all intermediate angles. These anticipations Mr. Airy confirmed by
                    experiment; and in the course of his observations he observed certain
                    peculiarities in the phenomena, from which he has drawn the following
                    conclusions, viz.</p>
                <p>1. When the angle of incidence is less than the maximum polarising angle of the
                    diamond, the nature of its reflexion is similar to that of metallic reflexion;
                    the phase of vibration in the plane of reflexion being more retarded than that
                    of vibrations perpendicular to the plane of reflexion, but perhaps by a smaller
                    quantity than in reflexion from metals.</p>
                <p>2. In the neighbourhood of the polarising angle, the nature of the reflexion is
                    different from any that has hitherto been described. The vibrations in the plane
                    of reflexion do not vanish, but on increasing the angle of incidence by three or
                    four degrees, the phase of vibration is gradually retarded by about 180°. In the
                    reflexion of light whose vibrations are perpendicular to the plane of reflexion,
                    there is no striking difference between the effects of diamond and those of
                    glass.</p>
                <p>3. For angles of incidence greater than the polarising angle, there is no
                    sensible difference between the effects of diamond and those of glass.<note

                <p>Hitherto the mathematical theory of light owed almost all its development to the
                    distinguished members of the Institute of France—to Malus, Arago, Fresnel,
                    Poisson, Ampere, and Cauchy; but it was now destined to receive a powerful
                    impetus from those eminent members of Trinity College, Dublin, who have nobly
                    sustained the honour of their country by their genius and discoveries. In his

                    of three sheets, on the supposition that there is a triple refraction. It has

                    In these researches Sir W. Hamilton was conducted to the discovery of some new
                    geometrical properties of the wave surface. He found that this surface has four
                    conoidal cusps at the extremities of the resultant or optical axes, at each of
                    which the wave is touched by an infinite number of tangent planes, forming a
                    tangent cone of the second degree, while at the extremities of the lines of
                    single wave velocity, there are four circles of plane contact, in every part of
                    each of which the wave surface is touched by a single plane. These eusps and
                    circles, the existence of which does not seem to have been suspected by Fresnel,
                    have led Sir W. Hamilton to some remarkable theoretical conclusions respecting
                    the laws of refraction in biaxal crystals. To this new property he has given the
                    name of conical refraction, because a single ray is refracted into an infinite
                    number, forming a kind of cone. This conical refraction is of two kinds,
                    external and internal. In external conical refraction, one internal cusp ray
                    corresponds to an external cone of rays; and in internal conical refraction, an
                    external ray incident at an angle corresponding to the line of single wave

                <p>Sir W. Hamilton requested Professor Lloyd, of Trinity College, Dublin, to inquire
                    experimentally into the existence of these two kinds of conical refraction. For
                    this purpose he selected arragonite, a crystal of great biaxal energy, and
                    having its optic axes inclined about 20°. It was cut with parallel faces
                    perpendicular to the line bisecting the two optic axes. Upon looking at the
                    light of a distant lamp through the crystal, and in the direction of one of the
                    optical axes, Professor Lloyd saw a point more luminous than the space
                    immediately about it, and surrounded by something resembling a stellar
                    radiation. Hence the direction of the optical axes may be determined by this
                    modification of common light. When the adjustment was perfected, and the light
                    transmitted in the exact direction of the cusp ray, there appeared at first a
                    luminous circle, with a small dark space in the centre, and in this dark central
                    space were two bright points, separated by a narrow and-well-defined dark line.
                    These appearances rapidly changed in shifting the minute aperture next the eye.
                    On examining the emergent cone with a plate of tourmaline, Professor Lloyd was
                    surprised to observe that only one radius of the circular section vanished in a
                    given position of the tourmaline, and that the vanished ray ranged through 360°,
                    while the tourmaline was turned through 180°. Hence it follows that, all the
                    rays of the cone are polarised in different planes. On a more attentive
                    examination of this phenomenon, Professor Lloyd discovered the remarkable law,
                    “that the angles between the planes of polarisation of any two rays of the cone
                    is half the angles between the plane containing the rays themselves and the
                    axis.” This law he found to be in perfect accordance with the theory.</p>
                <p>The verification of the second kind of conical refraction Professor Lloyd found
                    to be more difficult. The angle of the coneofrays which theory indicated, should
                    be seen within the crystal when a single external ray corresponding with a ray
                    refracted along an optical axis, was 1° 55' in arragonite. The external ray was
                    divided into two, but when the critical incidence was gained, after much care in
                    the adjustment, Professor Lloyd “at last saw the two rays spread into a
                    continuous circle, whose diameter was apparently equal to their former
                    interval.</p>
                <p>“This phenomenon was exceedingly striking. It looked like a small ring of gold
                    viewed upon a dark ground; and the sudden and almost magical change of the
                    appearance from two luminous points to a perfect luminous ring, contributed not
                    a little to enhance the interest.</p>
                <p>“The emergent light, in this experiment, being too faint to be reflected from a
                    screen, I repeated the experiment with the sun’s light, and received the
                    emergent cylinder upon a small piece of silver paper. I could detect no sensible
                    difference in the magnitude of the circular sections at different distances from
                    the crystal.</p>
                <p>“When the adjustment was perfect, the light of the entire annulus was white, and
                    of equal intensity throughout. But when there was a very slight deviation from
                    the exact position, two opposite quadrants of the circle appeared more faint
                    than the other two, and the two pairs were of complementary colours. The light
                    of the circle was polarised, according to the law which I had before observed in
                    the other case of conical refraction. In this instance, however, the law was
                    anticipated from theory by Professor Hamilton.” <supplied cert="low"

                <p>In addition to these interesting results, Professor Lloyd has published an
                    account of a new case of interference, in which the experimental exhibition of
                    the fact is much more manageable than in the experiment of two slightly inclined
                    mirrors given by Fresnel. Professor Lloyd causes the light reflected at an angle
                    of 90° from the surface of a single piece of plate glass or a metallic
                    reflector, to interfere with the direct light that passes parallel to the
                    reflecting surface and near it. A screen placed on the other side of the mirror
                    receives the direct and the reflected pencils, which, meeting under a small
                    angle, after having traversed paths differing by a small amount, interfere.
                    Professor Lloyd also received the two pencils upon an eye-piece placed at a
                    short distance from the reflector, and saw a very beautiful system of bands, in
                    every respect similar to one half of the system formed by the two mirrors in
                    Fresnel’s experiment.</p>
                <p>Professor Lloyd has more recently, in 1836 and 1837, communicated to the Royal
                    Irish Academy the results of his researches, <hi rend="italic">On the
                    propagation of light in uncrgstallised media.</hi> His object was to simplify
                    and develope that part of Μ. Cauchy’s theory, which relates to the propagation
                    of light in an ethereal medium of uniform density, and to extend the same theory
                    to the case of the ether enclosed in uncrystallised substances, taking into
                    account the action of the internal molecules. In the first part of his memoir,
                    Professor Lloyd has given good reason for concluding that the theory in its
                    present form is insufficient to explain the phenomena of light in bodies, and
                    that it becomes necessary to take into account the action of the material
                    molecules. In doing this he limits himself to the comparatively simple case, in
                    which the molecules of the ether and the body are uniformly diffused. In the
                    expression for the velocity of propagation, each term consists of two parts, one
                    of which is due to the action of the ether, and the other to that of the body.
                    “It is not improbable,” says Professor Lloyd, “that there may be bodies for
                    which the first or principal term is nearly nothing, the two parts of which it
                    is composed being of opposite signs, and nearly equal. In this case the
                    principal part of the expression for the velocity will be that derived from the
                    second term; and, if that term be taken as an approximate value, it will follow,
                    that the refractive index of the substance must be in the subduplicate ratio of
                    the length of the wave nearly. Now, it is remarkable that this law of
                    dispersion, so unlike any <pb break="no" facs="nls:194561753"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-1753-0376"/>thing observed in transparent media, agrees pretty
                    closely with the results obtained by Sir David Brewster in some of the metals.
                    In all these bodies the refractive index (inferred from the angle of maximum
                    polarization) <hi rend="italic">increases</hi> with the length of the wave. Its
                    value for the red, mean and blue rays, in silver, are 3∙866, 3∙27l, 2∙824, the
                    ratios of the second and third to the first, being ∙85 and ∙73. According to the
                    law above given, these ratios should be ∙88 and ∙79∙</p>
                <p>We are indebted also to Professor Lloyd for an admirable history <hi
                    rend="italic">Of the progress and present state of physical optics,</hi>
                    published in the <hi rend="italic">Fourth Report</hi> of the meeting of the
                    British Association, held in Edinburgh; a history not less characterised by its
                    candour and truth, and absence of all national partiality, than by the profound
                    and accurate knowledge of the subject which it everywhere displays. The only
                    cultivator of physical optics to whom Professor Lloyd has done injustice is
                    himself; and we are glad of the opportunity which we here enjoy, of giving a
                    brief and imperfect account of his original and valuable researches.</p>
                <p>It is with no less pleasure that we proceed to give an account of the optical
                    discoveries of another Irish philosopher, who, at an early period of life, has
                    placed himself in a distinguished position both as a mathematician and a natural
                    philosopher. We have already seen that Μ. Ampère gave a direct demonstration of
                    Fresnel’s construction for finding the surface of the wave. His solution,
                    however, was extremely difficult and complicated. Mr. James Maccullagh was led
                    in 1829 to believe, from the simplicity and elegance of the results, that there
                    must be some simpler method of arriving at them, and, upon considering the
                    subject with attention, he was led to a concise demonstration of the same
                    theorem, and of some of the other leading points of Fresnel’s theory. He has
                    demonstrated a geometrical construction for finding the magnitude and direction
                    of the elastic force arising from a displacement in any direction, and by his
                    construction, with the aid of a few lemmas, he is immediately led to all the
                    conclusions established by Μ. Fresnel. The magnitude and direction of this force
                    are represented by means of an ellipsoid, having for its semiaxes the three
                    principal indices of the medium, these axes coinciding in direction with, and
                    being inversely proportional to, the axes of Fresnel’s generating ellipsoid.</p>
                <p>The properties of the wave surface and its use in determining the directions and
                    velocities of reflected and refracted rays, seem to have been discovered
                    independently by Sir W. Hamilton, Μ. Cauchy, and Mr. Maccullagh, and in a paper
                    entitled, <hi rend="italic">Geometrical propositions applied to the wave theory

                <p>Hitherto the remarkable laws of the double refraction of quartz, developed by the
                    successive labours of Arago, Biot, Fresnel, and Airy, were merely a set of
                    independent facts unconnected by any theory; but Mr. Maccullagh in a paper <hi
                    rend="italic">On the laws of the double refraction of quartz,</hi> sent to the
                    Royal Irish Academy, in February 183G, has shewn how they may be explained
                    hypothetically, by introducing differential coefficients of the third order into
                    the equations of vibratory motion.</p>
                <p>The theory of the action of the metals upon light having been long among the
                    desiderata of physical optics, Mr. Maccullagh thought that it would be important
                    to represent the phenomena of elliptic polarisation, discovered by Sir David
                    Brewster, by means of empirical formulae, in a manner analogous to that employed
                    by Fresnel in the case of total reflexion. Mr. Maccullagh has applied his
                    formulae to steel, and in computing from it the intensity of light reflected
                    when common light is used, he obtained the remarkable result, that the intensity
                    decreases very slowly up to a large angle of incidence (less that 75°), and then
                    increases up to 90°, where there is total reflexion. This result entirely
                    accords with the remarkable fact discovered by Mr. Potter,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">≡ Edin-Journal of
                    Science,</hi> N. S. No. 4.</p></note> that the intensity decreases with the
                    angle of incidence as far as 70°. Mr. Maccullagh conceives that experiments
                    alone can decide whether the subsequent increase indicates a real phenomenon, or
                    arises from an error in the empirical formulae.</p>
                <p>Mr. Maccullagh deduces also from his formulae the phenomenon observed by Mr. Airy
                    in the diamond; and he has applied it successfully to the phenomena discovered
                    by Μ. Arago, respecting the rings formed between a transparent and a metallic
                    surface. In this experiment Mr. Maccullagh and Prof. Lloyd have both discovered
                    a curious appearance unnoticed by any other author. Through the last twenty or
                    thirty degrees of incidence, the first dark ring surrounding the central spot,
                    which is comparatively bright, remains constantly of the same magnitude, though
                    the other rings dilate greatly by an increase of incidence.</p>
                <p>Hitherto the undulatory theory had been unable to give any explanation of the
                    variation of the polarising angle, when the light was reflected in different
                    azimuths from calcareous spar, and other doubly refracting surfaces. Mr.
                    Maccullagh, however, was induced to exercise liis mathematical skill on this
                    interesting subject; and so earlyas 1834, he communicated to Professor Lloyd an
                    expression for the angle of polarisation at the surface of crystallised media,
                    when the plane of reflexion coincides with the principal section of Fresnel’s
                    ellipsoid; and he found that the law, which he extended by analogy to all cases,
                    represented with much exactness the observations of Sir David Brewster.<note

                    its plane of polarisation, and being embarrassed by his third ray, he altered
                    Cauchy’s six equations of pressure, so as to make them afford only two rays, and
                    give a law of refraction exactly the same as Fresnel’s.</p>

                    the plane of incidence coincides with the principal section of the crystal, and
                    had confirmed its accuracy by experiment. Μ. Seebeck had also pointed out a
                    defect in Mr. Maccullagh’s formulae, No. 2 and 3, which induced the latter to
                    resume the subject; and in a new paper read to the Irish Academy on the 9th
                    January 1837, a solution of the following problem is given for the first time
                    :—“Supposing a ray of light, polarised in a given plane, to fall on a doubly
                    refracting crystal, it is required to find the plane of polarisation of the
                    reflected ray, and the proportion between the amplitudes of vibration in the
                    incident, the reflected, and the two refracted rays.” The hypotheses employed by
                    our author are these, viz.</p>
                <p>1. The density of the ether is the same in all media.</p>
                <p>2. The vibrations are parallel to the plane of polarisation.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">vis viva</hi> is preserved.</p>
                <p>4. The vibrations are preserved; that is, the resultant of the incident and
                    reflected vibrations are the same as the resultant of the refracted vibrations.
                    “This theory,” says the author, “represents very accurately the experiments of
                    Sir David Brewster and Μ. Seebeck, on the light reflected in air from a surface
                    of Iceland spar.”</p>
                <p>We owe also to Mr. Maccullagh some interesting views <pb break="no"

                    light transmitted by the diamond and by gold leaf· He conceives that there is a
                    change of phase produced by refraction, as well as by reflexion, from these
                    bodies, the change being different according as the light is polarised in the
                    plane of incidence, or perpendicular to it. If the incident ray, therefore, is
                    polarised in any intermediate plane, the refracted ray should be elliptically
                    polarised, which was found to be the case in gold leaf. He conceived that the
                    same remark explains the appearance of double refraction in specimens of the
                    diamond which give only a single image, and that other precious stones are
                    likely to have similar properties. Our author has obtained a general formula for
                    the difference of phase between the two component portions of the refracted
                    light, one polarised in the plane of incidence, and the other perpendicular to
                    it. He finds from this formula, that the difference of phase, which is nothing
                    at a perpendicular incidence, increases until it becomes equal to the
                    characteristic, at an incidence of 90°; and when the light emerges into air, the
                    difference of phase is doubled. In submitting this formula to the test of
                    experiment, which Mr. Maccullagh has not yet done, it will be requisite to
                    ascertain that the diamond is not composed of strata of different refractive
                    powers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See page

                <p>Μ. Lamé, an eminent-professor in the Polytechnic School, has recently endeavoured
                    to determine the laws according to which the molecules of ether and of bodies
                    act upon each other. He arrives at the conclusion that “the action of ponderable
                    matter upon the ether varies in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance,
                    and that the elasticity of the ether itself is proportional to its density.” He
                    concludes that the retardation of the vibratory motion, in penetrating into a
                    dense body, will be greater the less the length of an undulation; so that the
                    refraction will be greater for the shorter undulations, a result which he
                    regards as the true explanation of dispersion.</p>
                <p>“Μ. Lamé,” says Professor Lloyd, “has endeavoured to connect the phenomena of
                    double refraction with an assumed constitution of the ethereal fluid. He takes
                    the case in which the ether is supposed to be distributed round the molecules of
                    the body in confocal ellipsoidal shells; and he concludes that a vibratory
                    movement, propagated from a vacuum into a body so constituted, will be
                    separated, at its entrance, into two component movements, which will advance
                    with different velocities.</p>
                <p>“The two component vibrations, he finds, will be at right angles, and parallel to
                    the lines of greatest and least curvature of the elementary ellipsoids. Thus,
                    the bifurcation of a ray of light on entering a crystallised medium, and the
                    opposite polarisation of the two pencils, are found to be consistent with a
                    molecular constitution such as that described.</p>
                <p>“These results are of the highest interest, and will, no doubt, receive an early
                    examination from those engaged in the same department of analysis. Their author
                    seems to be persuaded that his methods will lead him to the mathematical lawsof
                    other phenomena, which he conceives to depend, in like manner, on the motions of
                    the ethereal fluid.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>In a memoir more recently communicated to the Aca~ lemy of Sciences, Μ. Lamé has
                    sought to determine the node of vibration of the ethereal particles which

                    density. He considers transparent homogeneous )odies as consisting of a
                    multitude of such molecules, dis-ributed uniformly in space, and at distances
                    incomparably ;reaterthan their diameter; and he conceives that the waves

                    this article. As the nature of this work requires that the subject be treated in
                    a very popular manner, we shall pass briefly over those branches of Optics which
                    are generally treated mathematically, and which occupy a prominent part in all
                    ordinary treatises, and occupy our limited space with the more interesting
                    departments of Chromatics, Physical Optics, the Double Refraction and
                    Polarisation of Light, the Explanation of Natural Phenomena, the Laws of Vision,
                    and the Construction of Optical Instruments.</p>
                <p>INTRODUCTION.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> ancients confounded the phenomena of vision with
                    those of light, by supposing that when we see external objects something passes
                    from the eye to the object. The phenomena of light, however, are totally
                    independent of those of vision, and have a real existence in nature, whether we
                    suppose them to be objects of vision or not.</p>
                <p>1. Light is the element by means of which we see external bodies. These bodies
                    may be divided, in reference to light, into two classes, <hi rend="italic"
                    >self-luminous</hi> and <hi rend="italic">non-luminous,</hi> or dark bodies. The
                    first class include the sun, the stars, flames of all kinds, and bodies which
                    become luminous by friction, heat, and electrical and magnetical action. Such
                    bodies become visible by the light which they themselves emit, and we then
                    obtain a knowledge of their apparent form. The sun, for example, is seen to be
                    round, and the flame of a candle to be of a conical shape. The second class of
                    bodies <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> ∙however, are never visible but when placed
                    in the light of self-luminous bodies. It includes the moon and all the primary
                    and secondary planets, of which we see only those portions upon which the sun’s
                    light directly falls, and all the other objects upon our own globe. When we
                    bring a lighted candle into a room its light falls upon all the objects in the
                    apartment, and they become visible. These bodies reflect or throw back the light
                    of the candle, and they scatter it in all directions, because they are,
                    generally speaking, visible, wherever we place our eye. But objects also become
                    visible by the light thrown oft' by non-luminous. When the moon has the form of
                    a sharp crescent, we see the obscure part of its circular disc by the light
                    thrown upon it from the earth, which is at that time almost fully illuminated by
                    the sun. In like manner in the room lighted with a candle, objects are seen in
                    corners and places upon which the light of the candle does not fall. These
                    objects, however, are illuminated by the light of the candle thrown back by the
                    white ceiling and walls of the apartment; and hence the reason why the ceilings
                    and apartments should always be white, and why the walls should be white if we
                    wish to obtain the greatest quantity of light from a given flame.</p>
                <p>2. The light thrown off from all bodies whether self-luminous or non-luminous, is
                    of the same colour as themselves. A red hot body, or a stick of red sealing wax,
                    will make a sheet of white paper appear red if held near them.</p>
                <p>3. But though coloured bodies throw off light of the same colour with themselves,
                    bodies do not appear of the same' colour as that of the light which falls upon
                    them. All <pb break="no" facs="nls:194561779" xml:id="kp-eb0716-1779-0378"
                    />bodies which arc white in white light, appear of the same colour as that of
                    the light which falls upon them; but other bodies, such as red wax, appear red
                    even in white light, a property which they derive from a peculiar structure
                    acting upon the different colours of which white light is composed. Bodies of
                    this kind when illuminated with lights of different colours, always appear
                    brightest in light of the same colour which they exhibit in white light. Thus a
                    stick of yellow wax is more luminous than a stick of red wax, but the yellow wax
                    will be less luminous than the red wax if we illuminate them both with red
                    light.</p>
                <p>4. Bodies in their relation to light, are divided into two classes, <hi
                    rend="italic">opaque</hi> and <hi rend="italic">transparent.</hi> An <hi
                    rend="italic">opaque</hi> body is one that stops the light that falls upon it,
                    such as a piece of coal, or a plate of silver; and a <hi rend="italic"
                    >transparent</hi> body is one which transmits the light through it, such as
                    glass, water, and air. The most opaque body, however, may be made transparent by
                    making it sufficiently thin, and the most transparent one may become opaque by
                    making it sufficiently thick.</p>
                <p>5. The opacity of bodies, or their power of intercepting light, gives rise to
                    what is called the <hi rend="italic">shadows</hi> of bodies. As the shadows of
                    bodies are of the same size as the bodies, we thence deduce the fundamental
                    optical fact, <hi rend="italic">that light moves in straight lines.</hi> The
                    same fact may be proved in a thousand ways, but most simply by placing three
                    small holes in a straight line. In this case the light will pass through them,
                    but if any one of them deviates from the straight line, the light will be
                    stopped. The same thing is finely seen without any experiment, by admitting
                    light into a dark room through an aperture of an inch wide. Its path, marked out
                    by the floating dust which it illuminates, will be seen to be a straight
                    line.</p>
                <p>6. Light issues or radiates in every direction and from every point in the
                    surface of luminous and visible bodies. This fact is proved by the circumstance,
                    that we see such bodies wherever we place our eye. However much we may magnify
                    the bright part of the sun’s disc through a telescope, or a sheet of white paper
                    through a microscope, we shall never see any points destitute of light.</p>
                <p>7. Light consists of separate and independent <hi rend="italic">parts,</hi>
                    which, when reduced to the smallest magnitude, are called <hi rend="italic">rays
                    of light.</hi> A beam of light transmitted into a dark room may be actually
                    divided into smaller portions in a variety of ways. The smallest portion that we
                    can allow to pass may be called a ray of light, and possesses the same
                    properties as the larger beam.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Light moves at the rate of∖</hi> 92,000 <hi rend="italic"
                    >miles in a second.</hi> This extraordinary property of light has been deduced
                    by direct calculation from the immersions and emersions, in eclipses of
                    Jupiter’s satellites, which become visible to us nearly a quarter of an hour
                    earlier when the earth is nearest Jupiter, than when it is farthest from that
                    planet. The exact velocity of light obtained in this manner, is 192,500 miles in
                    a second; whereas, Dr. Brinkley and Μ. Struve have found it to be 191,515 miles
                    in a second, from the phenomena of aberration.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="smallcaps">Aberration,</hi>
                    vol. i. p. 31.</p></note> This last determination is undoubtedly the most
                    correct. The mean, however, of 192,000 is most easily remembered.</p>
                <p>The velocity with which light travels is so inconceivable, that we require to
                    make it intelligible by some illustrations.</p>
                <p>It moves from the sun to the earth in 7½ minutes, whereas a cannon ball fired
                    from the earth, would require <hi rend="italic">seventeen gears</hi> to reach
                    the sun.</p>
                <p>Light moves through a space equal to the circumference of the earth, or about
                    25,000 miles in about the 8th part of a second. The swiftest bird would require
                    <hi rend="italic">three weeks</hi> to perform this journey.</p>
                <p>Light would <hi rend="italic">demonstrably</hi> require <hi rend="italic">five
                    years</hi> to move from the <hi rend="italic">nearest</hi> fixed star to the
                    earth, and <hi rend="italic">probably</hi> many thousand years from the most
                    remote star seen by the telescope. Hence if a remote visible star had been
                    created at the time of the creation of man, it may not yet have become visible
                    to our system.</p>
                <p>9. When light falls upon any body, whether rough or smooth, coloured or
                    uncoloured, a part of the incident light enters the body, and is either lost
                    within it, or transmitted through it; and part of it is reflected from its
                    surface, either in the same or in a different direction from that in which it
                    came. The light which enters the body and is lost, the light which is
                    transmitted through the body, and the light which is reflected from it, suffer
                    certain changes in its direction, and in its physical properties. It belongs to
                    the <hi rend="italic">geometrical</hi> or mathematical part of optics, to assign
                    the laws which regulate the change of direction which light experiences when it
                    is transmitted through, or reflected from bodies, whose density is uniform, and
                    whose surfaces have a geometrical form; and to <hi rend="italic">physical</hi>
                    optics, to explain the changes in the physical properties which light acquires
                    in passing through bodies, in passing near them, or in being reflected from
                    their surfaces.</p>
                <p>The laws or rules which regulate the reflexion of light, constitute that branch
                    of optics which is called <hi rend="italic">catoptrics,</hi> and the laws* which
                    regulate the changes of deviation which light experiences when transmitted
                    through bodies, is called <hi rend="italic">dioptrics.</hi></p>
                <p>PART I. CATOPTRICS, OR THE REFLEXION OF LIGHT.</p>
                <p>The word <hi rend="italic">catoptrics,</hi> derived from the Greek words <hi
                    rend="italic">κατα from,</hi> and oπτo∕xαι, <hi rend="italic">to see,</hi>
                    signifies that department of optics which treats of the reflexion of light from
                    the polished and regularly formed surfaces of bodies, such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >water, glass,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">metals.</hi></p>
                <p>The name of <hi rend="italic">speculum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mirr or,</hi>
                    has commonly been given to bodies that have regularly formed and highly polished
                    surfaces. The word <hi rend="italic">speculum</hi> is generally applied to
                    polished metals, and <hi rend="italic">mirrors</hi> to reflectors made of glass
                    and covered with an amalgam of tin and mercury, to increase their power of
                    reflecting light.</p>
                <p>There are four kinds of specula used in optics, namely, <hi rend="italic">plane,
                    convex, concave,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cylindrical,</hi> and when light
                    falls upon any of these specula, which we shall always consider to be formed of
                    polished metal, it is reflected according to the same law.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">General Law of Pefiexion.</hi></p>
                <p>Let AD be a ray of light which falls upon a <hi rend="italic">plane speculum</hi>
                    MN, and strikes it at the point D, this ray will be driven back in the direction
                    DB, so inclined to the original ray AD that if we raise from the point D a line
                    DE perpendicular to MN, the angle BDE will be equal to the angle ADE. The ray AD
                    is called the <hi rend="italic">incident</hi> ray, DB the <hi rend="italic"
                    >reflected</hi> ray, ADE the <hi rend="italic">angle of incidence,</hi> and BDE
                    the <hi rend="italic">angle of reflexion.</hi> The two rays AD, DB, and the
                    perpendicular DE, all lie in the same plane AEBD. This plane is sometimes called
                    the <hi rend="italic">plane of incidence,</hi> and sometimes the <hi
                    rend="italic">plane of reflexion,,</hi> and it is always at right angles to the
                    reflecting surface MN.</p>
                <p>when the reflecting surface is <hi rend="italic">concave</hi> as MN in fig. 2,
                    and is part of a sphere, whose centre is C, a ray of light AD falling upon any
                    point D, will be reflected in a direction D B, so as to form the same angle BDC
                    with a line CD drawn from the centre<pb break="no" facs="nls:194561792"

                    the incident ray AD does, viz. the angle ADC. In this case the line DC is
                    perpendicular to the reflecting surface at D.</p>
                <p>When the speculum is <hi rend="italic">convex</hi> as in fig. 3, and C the centre
                    of its spherical surface, then if we draw CE, passing through any point D, of
                    the spherical surface MN, any ray of light AD, incident at D, will, after
                    reflection, take a direction DB, having the same inclination BDE to DE, that the
                    incident ray AD has. In this case, also, the prolonged radius of curvature CE,
                    is perpendicular to the surface MN at D.</p>
                <p>When the surface is cylindrical, the form of the reflecting line, or the line
                    lying in the plane of reflexion, is a circle in one direction, a straight line
                    in another, and an ellipse in all intermediate ones, but in every case the
                    reflected ray will take such a direction that the angle which it forms with a
                    line perpendicular to a plane touching the cylinder at the point where the ray
                    strikes it, will be equal to the angle which the incident ray forms with the
                    same perpendicular. This is true of all curved surfaces whatever.</p>
                <p>The results now stated have been established by direct experiment for all
                    inclinations of the incident ray, so that it is a law universally true, that in
                    the reflexion of light <hi rend="italic">the angle of incidence is equal to the
                    angle of reflexion.</hi> Hence it follows, that when the incident ray is
                    perpendicular to any surface, it is reflected back in the direction in which it
                    came, and when the incident ray is parallel to the reflecting surface, (when
                    plane) or is inclined 90° to it, it will pass on without suffering any change in
                    its direction.</p>
                <p>The equality of the angles of incidence and reflexion is finely seen in the game
                    of Billiards, in the reflexion of a hand-ball from a wall, and in the reflexion
                    of sound.</p>
                <p>By means of the law of reflection we can easily determine, even without any
                    calculation, the effects produced upon light by specula and mirrors, and the
                    shape, and magnitude, and position of the images of all objects seen by
                    reflexion from them. These effects we shall now proceed to consider in their

                    at F, will also be removed farther from them. Hence F will approach to 0, and
                    when A is infinitely distant, and the rays parallel, F will coincide with 0. But
                    if A approaches to the mirror, the incident rays will approach to the
                    perpendiculars, and as the reflected rays will do the same, their point of

                    and the reflected ray will coincide with the incident ray.</p>
                <p>If A still advances towards the mirror, the incident rays will get within the

                    reflected rays will be parallel, as seen in fig. 7, and when A comes still
                    nearer the mirror, the reflected rays will diverge as if they proceeded from
                    some point behind the mirror, this point being called the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The conjugate foci of a concave mirror may be easily found by projection. The
                    following rule will give the focus more accurately when the rays AD', AD" are

                    the quotient will be the conjugate focal distance required, or FD. If twice AD
                    is less than CD, the conjugate focal point will not be before the mirror, but

                <p>In order to understand how images are formed, let us suppose that a soldier is

                    and the blue trousers, so that it has no distinct colour, but a mixture of all
                    these. If we close the shutters, so as to allow no <pb break="no"

                    but the red light of the coat, and the blue light of the trowsers, it will be
                    illuminated only by a mixture of red and blue light. But if we close all the
                    shutters SS, and leave only a small hole A, about half an inch in diameter, then
                    it is obvious that the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> rays at and below R, passing
                    through the hole A, will illuminate the opposite wall at and above <hi

                    his body upon the upper part of the wall. If we make the hole A smaller and
                    smaller, the inverted image of the soldier will become more and more distinct,
                    the colours will be better separated, and the picture may be made so distinct,
                    that the features of the individual could be recognised. Now this separation of
                    the various lights that at first fell upon the wall is effected solely by
                    diminishing the aperture through which they pass, for if the aperture is
                    exceedingly small, then as no two rays can proceed from the same point, they
                    cannot fall upon or illuminate the same point, and hence each point of the
                    object is represented on the wall by the colour of the light which it throws
                    out.</p>
                <p>As the coloured rays from the soldier are thrown off in all directions, an
                    inverted image of that soldier may be formed in any part of space, by excluding
                    all the other rays except those which pass through a small aperture. It is
                    manifest, from a simple inspection of fig. 11, that the size of the inverted
                    image will diminish not onl½ with the distance of the aperture from the soldier,
                    but also with the distance of the ground W W from the aperture.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Formation of Images by Concave Mirrors.</hi> —The effect of a
                    concave mirror in forming an image is the same as that of an aperture; but it
                    produces a finer effect, and acts upon a different principle.</p>
                <p>Let AB, fig. 12, be a concave mirror, C its centre, and MN an object placed
                    before it. Of all the rays which flow from every part of this object in every
                    direction, we shall consider only those which issue from its extremities MN. The
                    rays from Μ radiate in every direction, but those which fall upon the mirror,
                    namely, the pencil or cone MAB, are the only ones which require our notice. This
                    pencil of diverging rays will have its focus at a point <hi rend="italic">m</hi>
                    farther from the mirror than its principal focus, and in like manner the pencil
                    NAB will have its focus at some point <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> pencils
                    intermediate between Μ and N having their foci at points intermediate between
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> These points may be found
                    by projection, as already described, or by the rule given for diverging
                    rays.</p>
                <p>The image <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> is obviously an inverted picture of the
                    object MN, and its size is to that of the object as the distance of the image
                    from the mirror is to the distance of the object from it, that is, as nA is to
                    NA, as may be found from projection, or from an experimental measurement of the
                    distance, when a mirror is actually used.</p>
                <p>From the doctrine of reflected diverging rays it follows, and may be proved by
                    projection, that as the object MN approaches to the mirror, the image <hi
                    rend="italic">mn</hi> will recede from the mirror, till the object and image
                    meet one another at the centre C, where they will have the same size. If MN
                    still moves towards the mirror within C, the image <hi rend="italic">mn</hi>
                    will move outwards beyond C, and the image will now be larger than the object.
                    If the object comes to the place <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> and is of the same
                    size as <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> the image of it will be formed at MN, and
                    will have the same size as MN. If the object goes still nearer the mirror the
                    image will go still farther off than MN, increasing in size. When the object
                    reaches the principal focus half way between C and D, the image will be
                    infinitely distant; and when the object goes still nearer the mirror, as in fig.
                    13, where it is placed at MN, between the principal focus</p>
                <p>F and the mirror AB, the rays will diverge in front of the mirror, and form an
                    inverted <hi rend="italic">virtual image, mn,</hi> behind the mirror. As the
                    image MN approaches the mirror, the virtual image <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> also
                    approaches to it.</p>
                <p>If we take a concave mirror of some size, and place before it any highly luminous
                    or strongly illuminated object, such as a plaster of Paris cast, we may obtain
                    an interesting experimental proof of the preceding results. When the image is
                    formed in front of the mirror, it will appear suspended in the air, and the
                    effect of this will be greatly heightened iι it is received on a cloud of thin
                    blue smoke raised from a chafing dish below the place of' the image. By
                    considering that as the object moves from AIN to C, fig. 12, the image <hi
                    rend="italic">mil</hi> advances to C, we obtain an explanation of the celebrated
                    experiment with the dagger mentioned by John Dee, in our history of the science,
                    in which a person with a drawn dagger striking at the mirror is met by another
                    person, viz., his own image, returning the stroke.</p>

                <p>If the object MN is the sun, a small image of his disc will be formed at <hi
                    rend="italic">mn,</hi> in which are collected all the rays of light which fall
                    upon the surface of the mirror. It will therefore have such a degree of heat as
                    to melt even the hardest gems and metals. Such a mirror is called a burning
                    mirror, from its effects.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Formation of Images by Convex Mirrors.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> As convex mirrors often form a part of household furniture, we are more
                    familiar with their properties. They always form <hi rend="italic">erect</hi>
                    images of objects, which appear at a distance behind them.</p>
                <p>If AB is a convex mirror whose centre is C, and principal focus F, and MN an
                    object placed before it, it is obvious, from our description of fig. 10, that
                    the diverging pencils Μ AB, NBA, will diverge more after reflexion, as if they
                    came from virtual foci <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> behind the mirror, so that our
                    eye receiving such diverging rays will see an erect image <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn</hi> of the object MN placed behind the mirror, and between its principal
                    focus F and D. If MN approaches to AB, <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> will approach
                    it also, and if MN recedes from the mirror, <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> will also
                    recede from it, their relative sizes varying as their distances. When the object
                    touches the mirror, the image also touches it, and they are then exactly of the
                    same size.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Formation of Images by Plane Mirrors.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> Every person is familiar with the effects of a plane mirror, or
                    looking-glass. The image of any object placed before it is seen behind it of the
                    same size, in the same position, and at the same distance from the mirror. In
                    order to understand this, let AB be the mirror, MN the object, and Ethe eye of
                    the observer, situated in any given position. Rays from Μ and N fail upon every
                    part of the mirror, but MC, MD are the only ones from Μ which can reach the eye
                    E, as all the rest are reflected either above or below the eye E. In like
                    manner, the rays NF, NG are the only ones from N which can enter the eye. The
                    extremity Μ of the object will therefore be seen in the direction E<hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi>, and the concourse or virtual focus of the reflected rays
                    will, as shewn in fig. 6, be at a point <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> so situated,
                    that if MArn is at right angles to the mirror, <hi rend="italic">Am</hi> will be
                    equal to AM. For the same reason, the point N will be seen at <hi rend="italic"
                    >n,</hi> as far behind the mirror as N is before it; and it is obvious, from the
                    parallelism of M<hi rend="italic">m</hi> and Nn, and the equality of the
                    distance of Μ, <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> and N, <hi rend="italic">n</hi> from
                    AB, that <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> is equal to MN.</p>
                <p>If two plane mirrors are inclined to each other, as AC, B, fig. 16, and an object
                    MN placed between them, an eye situated so as to receive the reflected rays,
                    will see a series of images of MN all arranged symmetrically. Behind AC, for
                    example, an image <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> will be formed, and behind BC
                    another image M‘N'. But as the rays which form these images again fall upon the
                    mirrors, we shall see images of <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> and M‘N' formed by AC
                    and BC, thus <hi rend="italic">m</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">n'</hi> will be the
                    image of <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> formed by BC, and M"N" an image of M‘N',
                    formed by A C. In like manner, <hi rend="italic">m"n"</hi> will be the image of
                    <hi rend="italic">m'n'</hi> formed by AC, and the image of M"N" formed by BC
                    will also lie upon <hi rend="italic">m"n"',</hi> so that we shall have two
                    images at <hi rend="italic">m"n!'</hi> overlapping each other, and forming one
                    exactly, if the angle ACB is exactly one-sixth part of 3β0°, or 60°; but if it
                    is not, the compound image <hi rend="italic">m"n"</hi> will be seen double and
                    imperfect. The five images above described, reckoning the double one at <hi
                    rend="italic">m"n"</hi> as only one, will, together with the object MN, to which
                    all the images are equal and similar, constitute a perfect equilateral triangle,
                    so that if MN is a coloured and an irregular object, the symmetrical figure
                    composed by it, and all its images, will be highly beautiful and agreeable to
                    the eye. If MN, in place of being perpendicular to the mirror BC, had been
                    inclined to it, no pair of images would have formed a straight line, as in the
                    figure, and the combination would have been more beautiful. This is the
                    principle of the <hi rend="italic">Kaleidoscope,</hi> in as far as the
                    multiplication and arrangement of the images is concerned; but this instrument
                    has already been so admirably described by an eminent writer, in our article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Kaleidoscope,</hi> that we must refer the reader to it for
                    farther information.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Formation of Images by Cylindrical Mirrors.</hi> —It is not
                    easy, in a diagram, to represent the progress of rays in the formation of an
                    image by a cylindrical mirror. As a cylinder is in one direction a plane mirror,
                    in another a convex mirror, and in all others an elliptical one, the
                    eccentricity of the ellipse passing through all degrees, from a circle to a
                    straight line, different parts of a regular figure presented to such a mirror
                    will appear of diffèrent sizes, and at different distances behind it. Part of
                    the figure will have the same form and position as in a plane mirror, part as in
                    a convex mirror, and the other parts of the image will have intermediate sizes
                    and positions. Hence the image will be completely distorted. If the mirror is
                    placed horizontally, the human face will appear of the right size from ear to
                    ear, but contracted, as in a convex speculum, from brow to chin. Hence, if a
                    distorted picture is properly drawn, and properly presented to the mirror, that
                    is, if the cylinder is placed vertically before the picture, the image of the
                    distorted picture will be rectified; the length between the ears will be
                    contracted into the same proportional size as the shortness between the brow and
                    the chin, and their shortness will remain unaffected. Such a distorted picture
                    will be afterwards represented in the part of this article on Optical
                    Instruments.</p>

                <p>Ifwe hold a drop of pure water or an irregular piece of clear glass in the sun’s
                    rays, each will have a sort of shadow like opaque bodies. Hence it follows, that
                    light has not passed freely through them, and must, therefore, have suffered
                    some change in its direction, either while entering these bodies, or passing
                    through them, or emerging from them. The change which it has suffered is called
                    <hi rend="italic">refraction,</hi> and the nature of this change will be
                    discovered by observing the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194561844"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-1844-0383"/>effects produced upon light by transparent bodies,
                    whose surface is flat and regular.</p>
                <p>For this purpose let AB, fig. 17, be the surface of <hi rend="italic">water</hi>
                    in a vessel, and RC a ray or pencil of light proceeding from a candle or from
                    the sun, through a small hole, and falling upon the water at C. Part of this
                    light will be <hi rend="italic">reflected</hi> in the direction Cr, so that the
                    angle rCP, is equal to RCP, PQ being a line perpendicular to the water at C; but
                    the greater part of the light will enter the water at C, and in place of going
                    straight on to e, it will be <hi rend="italic">bent</hi> or refracted at C, or
                    the ray Re will be <hi rend="italic">broken back</hi> at C, and proceed in a
                    straight line to E. Drawing a circle PAQB round C as a centre, and from the
                    point E, where the refracted ray cuts it, drawing EK parallel to PQ, it was
                    found by Snellius that CD was to CE or Ce as 3 to 4, and we have shewn in the
                    history of optics, that if R∕and EF are drawn perpendicular to PQ, CD is to Ce
                    as EF is to <hi rend="italic">Rf.</hi> But Ilf is the sine of the <hi
                    rend="italic">angle of incidence</hi> RCP, and EF is the sine of the angle ECQ,
                    which is called the <hi rend="italic">angle of refraction.</hi> Now, Snellius
                    discovered by numerous experiments, that whatever was the magnitude of the angle
                    of incidence RCP, the magnitude of the angle of refraction was such that CD was
                    to Cc as 3 to 4, or in a constant ratio. Hence it follows, that the sines of the
                    angles of incidence and refraction <hi rend="italic">Ilf</hi> and EF, are in the
                    case of water in the constant ratio of 4 to 3.</p>
                <p>Snellius in his manuscripts did not mention the <hi rend="italic">constant ratio
                    of the sines,</hi> but merely the <hi rend="italic">constant ratio of CD
                    and</hi><hi rend="italic">Ce,</hi> which is the same. The ratio of the sines was
                    first mentioned by Descartes, but there can be no doubt that Snellius knew it
                    perfectly, and that he preferred the use of the ratio of CD to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ce,</hi> for the following reason: When a luminous body is placed at E below
                    water, and its light passes through a small aperture at C, it is found to be
                    refracted or bent into the direction CR, so as to be seen by an eye at R, in the
                    direction Re. It will, therefore, be seen, as it were, elevated from E to D.
                    Hence Snellius preferred giving the law of this elevation, to any other law not
                    connected with the phenomena.</p>
                <p>As the incident ray RC approaches to the perpendicular PQ, the refracted ray CE
                    approaches also to the perpendicular, and CD becomes less and less, and when RC
                    coincides with PC, or when the ray is incident perpendicularly, the refracted
                    ray CE will coincide with CQ, or the incident ray will suffer no refraction at
                    C. When the angle of incidence RCP increases, and RC approaches to the surface
                    of the water CB, the angle of refraction ECQ will also increase, the line CD
                    will increase, and the refracted ray approach also to the surface CΛ, and when
                    RC coincides with BC, <hi rend="italic">Ce</hi> will coincide with CA, and no
                    light whatever will enter the water but it will all be reflected. When <hi
                    rend="italic">Ce</hi> coincides with CA, CD will be 3, and D will coincide with
                    K.</p>
                <p>Such are the phenomena and law of refraction when light passes from a rare medium
                    such as <hi rend="italic">air,</hi> into a dense medium such as <hi
                    rend="italic">water,</hi> the ray being always <hi rend="italic">refracted
                    from</hi> the perpendicular, according to the fixed law already described. Let
                    us now suppose, that the ray of light passes from a dense medium, such as water
                    placed above AB, into a rare medium, such as air placed below AB, and let PQ be
                    a perpendicular to the surface of the water at C. It is found by experiment that
                    the ray neither goes straight on to <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> nor is refracted
                    towards the perpendicular as before, but is refracted from the perpendicular
                    into the direction CE, so that if the line KED is drawn through E, parallel to
                    PQ, and cutting the original direction of the ray Re prolonged, in the point D,
                    CD will be to CE or Ceas 4 to 3, and in a constant ratio, or Ilf the sine of the
                    angle of incidence will be to EF the sine of the angle of refraction in the
                    constant ratio of 4 to 3. When the ray RC coincides with PC, so that the angle
                    of incidence is nothing, the angle of refraction will also be nothing, and the
                    refracted ray CE will coincide with CQ, the incident ray having gone straight on
                    without experiencing any refraction; but when the angle of incidence increases,
                    and RC approaches towards BC, the refracted ray CE will approach to CA, which it
                    will reach long before R reaches B. When CE reaches CA, the ray RC wall no
                    longer emerge from the water into the air, but will suffer what is called <hi
                    rend="italic">total reflexion</hi> at C, and at every angle of incidence beyond
                    that at which this total reflexion commences, the light will continue to be
                    totally reflected till RC coincides with RB.</p>
                <p>If w e repeat all the above experiments with <hi rend="italic">plate</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">crown glass,</hi> in place of <hi rend="italic">water,</hi> we
                    shall find the very same phenomena reproduced, with this difference only, that
                    the constant ratio of CD to <hi rend="italic">Ce,</hi> or of the sines <hi
                    rend="italic">Ilf</hi> to EF, in place of being as 3 to 4 in one case, (see fig.
                    17,) and 4 to 3 in the other (see fig. 18,) will be as 2 to 3, and as 3 to 2, or
                    in the case of water the ratio will be as 1 to 1∙333, and in glass as 1 to
                    1∙500. The number 1∙333 is called the <hi rend="italic">index of refraction</hi>
                    for <hi rend="italic">water,</hi> and 1∙500 the <hi rend="italic">index of
                    refraction</hi> for <hi rend="italic">glass.</hi> In like manner it is found
                    that the index of refraction for <hi rend="italic">tabasheer</hi> is 1*111,
                    being less than that for w∙ater; for flint glass 1∙600, for diamond 2∙500, and
                    for chromate of lead about 3 ’ 00. Hence it follows, that bodies refract light
                    in different degrees, measured by" their indices of refraction. In order to have
                    an ocular representation of the different degrees of refraction, we have drawn
                    in fig. 19, the different refracted rays, corresponding to a given incident ray
                    RC, supposing the surface AB to be first <hi rend="italic">air,</hi> (the medium
                    above it being a vacuum), then <hi rend="italic">tabasheer,</hi> then <hi
                    rend="italic">flint glass,</hi> then <hi rend="italic">diamond,</hi> and,
                    lastly, <hi rend="italic">chromate of lead.</hi></p>
                <p>When the index of refraction of any body is knowm, we can easily ascertain the
                    progress of a ray of light which falls upon such a body, and its direction after
                    quitting the body. The following example of this we shall give for plate glass.
                    Let AB be the surface of a piece of plate glass whose index or ratio of
                    refraction is as 2 to 3, or as I to l∙50, and let a ray of light RC fall upon it
                    at C. Prolong RC to <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> and upon a scale of equal parts
                    take in the compasses CD, equal to 10 of these parts, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ce</hi> equal to 15, or CD equal to 2, and <hi rend="italic">Ce</hi> to 3
                    parts. Upon C as a centre with the radius <hi rend="italic">Ce</hi> describe the
                    semicircle AEB, and through D draw KDE, perpendicular to AB, and meeting the
                    semicircle in E, join CE, and CE will be the refracted ray. When the ray passes
                    from a denser to a rarer medium, as in fig. 18, <hi rend="italic">Ce</hi> is
                    made equal to 10, and CD to 15, and DK being drawn perpendicular to AB, and a
                    line <pb break="no" facs="nls:194561857" xml:id="kp-eb0716-1857-0384"/>drawn
                    from C to the point E, where DK cuts the circle, CE will be the refracted ray.
                    This method, which is obviously much more simple and elegant than when we use
                    the sines of the angles, is, so far as we know, new, and we shall use it in
                    future for determining the place of the refracted ray. It is obvious, that when
                    D and K coincide with A, fig. 18, DK becomes a tangent to the circle at A, and
                    the light suffers total reflexion.</p>
                <p>If the preceding experiments arc repeated with various solids and fluids, it will
                    be found, that the same law of refraction takes place with all of them, the
                    index of refraction varying more or less in each, the refractive power being
                    least in the gases, and less in fluids, generally speaking, than in solids, as
                    will be seen in the following table of refractive powers, collected from various
                    authors, and determined by methods possessing various degrees of accuracy.</p>

                <p>In the preceding Table, the letter Naffixed to any index of refraction, indicates
                    that the observation was made by Newton; H, Hauks· bee; E, Euler; Μ, Malus; C ’.

                    Haidinger; W, Wollaston; Br, Sir David Brewster; and Br. Y, by Dr. Young, who
                    calculated the indices from Sir David Brewster’s observations.</p>

                <p>If light is regarded as consisting of material particles, it must move with
                    greater velocity in bodies than in vacuo, in the proportion of the sines to
                    which the refraction of these bodies is proportional. The power of bodies,
                    therefore, to refract and reflect light, must be inversely proportional to their
                    specific gravities; for if a body of small specific gravity has the same index
                    of refraction as a body of great specific gravity, the former must have
                    exercised a greater absolute force upon light than the latter.</p>
                <p>On the hypothesis of emission, it has been shewn by Sir Isaac Newton, that the
                    absolute refractive power of bodies is proportional directly to the square of
                    the cosine of their maximum angle of refraction, and inversely to their specific
                    gravity; that is, calling R the absolute refractive power, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Having shewn how to find the refracted ray, when the incident ray is given, and
                    the constant ratio of refraction which belongs to any transparent body, we may
                    trace the progress of rays through bodies of any form whatever, provided we have
                    the lines given which are perpendicular to the surface of the body at the points
                    where the rays fall upon it. In all spherical surfaces this perpendicular is a
                    line drawn through the point of incidence and the centre of the spherical
                    surface; and in all other cases it is a line perpendicular to a line touching
                    the surface at the point of incidence.</p>
                <p>The names of <hi rend="italic">prisms</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lenses</hi> have
                    been given to those transparent bodies which are most useful in optical
                    experiments, and in the construction of optical instruments. Sections of these
                    different refracting bodies are shewn in the annexed diagram.</p>
                <p>1. A <hi rend="italic">prism,</hi> represented in the figure at A, is a solid
                    piece of glass, having three plane surfaces, AR, AS, RS, which are called its
                    refracting faces, the light passing through any two of them.</p>
                <p>2. A <hi rend="italic">plane lens,</hi> B, is a lens, the centre of whose
                    surfaces are infinitely distant. Its sides are therefore parallel like a piece
                    of plane glass.</p>
                <p>3. A <hi rend="italic">spherical lens,</hi> C, is a lens whose surfaces have the
                    same centre, and is consequently a sphere or a part of one.</p>
                <p>4. A <hi rend="italic">double convex lens,</hi> D, has two convex spherical
                    surfaces, whose centres are on opposite sides of the lens. It is said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">equally convex</hi> when the radii of its two surfaces are equal;
                    and <hi rend="italic">unequally convex</hi> when the radii are unequal.</p>
                <p>5. A <hi rend="italic">plano-convex lens,</hi> E, is a lens which has one of its
                    surfaces flat or <hi rend="italic">plane,</hi> and the other <hi rend="italic"
                    >convex.</hi></p>
                <p>6. A <hi rend="italic">double concave lens,</hi> shewn at F, is a solid bounded
                    by two concave spherical surfaces. It is <hi rend="italic">equally concave</hi>
                    when its surfaces have the same radius, and <hi rend="italic">unequally
                    concave</hi> when they have different radii.</p>
                <p>7. A <hi rend="italic">plano</hi><hi rend="italic">concave lens,</hi> G, has one
                    of its surfaces concave and the other plane.</p>
                <p>8. A <hi rend="italic">meniscus lens,</hi> H, has one of its surfaces <hi

                    surfaces meeting if continued. The convexity predominates, and it acts as a
                    convex lens.</p>
                <p>9. A <hi rend="italic">concave-convex lens,</hi> I, differs from the meniscus
                    only in the circumstance that the two surfaces do not meet if continued. Hence
                    the concavity predominates, and the lens acts as a concave one.</p>

                <p>As prisms are essential parts of optical instruments, and are of peculiar value
                    in experiments on light, it is necessary to have a correct idea of the phenomena
                    which they exhibit, in refracting rays of light.</p>
                <p>Let ABE be a prism of two equal sides BA, BE, and made of glass whose index of
                    refraction is 1∙500, or whose ratio of refraction is as 1∙500 to 1, or as 3 to
                    2, and let RC be a ray incident on its first surface at C. It is required to
                    determine the path of this ray after it has suffered refraction at both its
                    surfaces AB, BE. From any scale set oft’CG equal to 10 divisions, and CR equal
                    to 15, and through G draw GD perpendicular to AC. From the point C, and on the
                    line CD, set off CD equal to CR, and through D and C draw DCc,—Cc will be the
                    refracted ray. From a scale on which Cc is 10, set off CcG equal to 15 parts,
                    and drawing <hi rend="italic">gd</hi> perpendicular to BE, make cc?equal to cC,
                    and draw through <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and c the line <hi rend="italic"
                    >der,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">er</hi> will be the path of
                    the ray refracted by the second surface BE of the prism. When the radius Cc will
                    not reach the perpendicular <hi rend="italic">gd,</hi> the ray Cc will not be
                    refracted at all, but will suffer total reflexion. When total reflexion
                    commences, the point <hi rend="italic">d</hi> will fall, in the line EB, and the
                    perpendicular <hi rend="italic">gd</hi> will touch the circle described with the
                    radius cC round c, at the point <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> At all greater angles
                    of incidence the ray Cc will be totally reflected.</p>
                <p>The sine of the angle of incidence at c, when the ray Cc is not able to emerge
                    from the prism, but suffers total reflexion, will be found in the case of plate
                    glass (whose</p>
                <p>1 2</p>
                <p>index of refraction is 1∙500), to be equal to ——, or -, or 1'500 3</p>
                <p>0∙666; the angle corresponding to which is 41° 48'.</p>
                <p>The total reflexion which thus takes place within transparent bodies, is a very
                    remarkable and highly interesting phenomenon. The light is far more brilliant
                    than what is obtained from the brightest silver, which gives more reflected
                    light than any other metal; and it possesses curious physical properties, which
                    will be explained in a subsequent part of the article. The phenomenon of total
                    reflexion may be finely seen by filling a tumbler-glass with water, and placing
                    it above the head so as to see the image of a candle reflected from the lower
                    side of its surface when at rest. The brilliancy of the image surpasses that of
                    every other species of reflexion. Diamonds, precious stones, and the glass
                    ornaments of chandeliers, &amp;c. &amp;c., are often cut so as to send to the
                    eye light that has suffered total reflexion. The brilliant white lustre of
                    dew-drops arises from totally reflected light.</p>
                <p>To a person under perfectly still water, the vision of objects either out of the
                    water or on the bottom, must be very singular. The whole visible heavens, in
                    place of being a hemisphere, will appear like a cone, with an angle of 97°. “All
                    objects,” says Sir John Herschel, “down to the horizon, will be visible in this
                    space, and those near the horizon much distorted and contracted in dimensions,
                    especially in height. Beyond the limits of this circle will be seen the bottom
                    of the water and all subaqueous objects, reflected, and as vividly depicted, as
                    by direct vision. In addition to these peculiarities, the circular space above
                    mentioned will appear surrounded with a perpetual rainbow of faint but delicate
                    colours.” In order to understand this, let MN be the surface of the water, and E
                    an eye at the bottom. Let DE be the direction in which a horizontal ray ND,
                    would be refracted at D, and CE the direction in which MC would be refracted at
                    C. Then it is clear that all objects on the horizon will be seen in the
                    directions ED, EC, and as the same is true in every azimuth, ACEDB will be a
                    section of the cone, which will comprehend within it all objects in the visible
                    horizon. The sun and moon will appear to rise at A and set at B. They will have
                    the appearance of ovals, with their smaller diameters vertical. They will quit
                    the horizon, and descend to it again very slowly, as the angle of refraction
                    varies very slowly from 90° of incidence downwards. If a man fishing near N
                    stands up to his knees in water, his knees will just be seen above the water, in
                    the direction EB, and his body standing within the cone BEA, while his legs will
                    be seen bright, and inverted in the direction of about EN, by the total
                    reflexion of the lower surface MN, of the water. If we draw <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ce</hi> and De?, making the angles cCE, <hi rend="smallcaps">íZDE,</hi> equal
                    to CED, then all objects in the water, to the right hand of <hi rend="italic"
                    >d,</hi> and to the left hand of <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> will be seen by total
                    reflexion from the inner surface MN of the water, in the space surrounding the
                    cone AEB. An object at <hi rend="italic">e</hi> will be seen by reflexion from
                    the point C, in tile direction EC, and an object at <hi rend="italic">d</hi> by
                    reflexion from D; but none of the objects between <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">d</hi> will be seen by reflexion to the eye at E. Hence we see
                    the reason why the fisherman’s legs, like other objects under water, will be
                    seen by total reflexion in a direction near to EN. The circular rainbow, or
                    rather fringe of colours, which separates the objects out of the water from
                    those which are beneath it, and seen by total reflexion, is that band of colour
                    which always bounds light that is totally reflected.</p>
                <p>It frequently happens, both in optical experiments and in optical instruments,
                    that light is refracted at the surfaces of two media placed in contact, such as
                    water and glass, and in compound lenses of flint and crown glass, either
                    touching one another or united by a cement. In all such cases, it is necessary
                    to determine the refraction which light experiences at their refracting surface.
                    It is found by experiment, and may be proved theoretically, that the index of
                    refraction for the separating surfaces of media is equal to the quotient of the
                    most refractive, divided by the least refractive medium. Thus, the index of
                    refraction for the separating surface of water and plate glass will be <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>- · <hi rend="strikethrough">θ?</hi>, or 1-122, which is
                    l∙33o nearly the same as that of tabasheer. In oπLr, therefore, to find the
                    refracted ray in this case, let MN be <pb break="no" facs="nls:194561922"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-1922-0389"/>a parallel stratum of water resting upon a piece
                    of parallel ’glass OP. A ray RC, will be refracted in the direction Cc', and may
                    be found by the method formerly given. In order to find the change produced in
                    the direction of the ray at c', take a point//', in the line c ʹ C, so that if
                    c'C is l∙122, <hi rend="italic">c'g</hi> ’ shall be 1O00, then drawing <hi
                    rend="italic">g'd'</hi> perpendicular to the refracting surface, make <hi
                    rend="italic">c'd'</hi> equal to c'C; and having drawn through the points <hi
                    rend="italic">d', c'</hi> the line <hi rend="italic">d’c'c',</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">c'c</hi> will be the refracted ray. This
                    ray being incident on the second surface of the glass plate at <hi rend="italic"
                    >c,</hi> will be refracted in a direction <hi rend="italic">cr,</hi> which may
                    be found by the method formerly described. It will be found both by projection
                    and by experiment, namely, by looking through the compound plate MNOP, and
                    observing any distant object, that the finally refracted rayer is parallel to
                    the incident ray RC.</p>
                <p>If the angle RCA, fig. 23, the complement of the angle of incidence, is
                    increased, the point <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> where the refracted ray emerges
                    from the side BE of the prism, approaches to E, and the angle rcE diminishes,
                    till at a particular inclination of the incident ray, the angle RCA will become
                    equal to the angle rcE. When this happens, the refracted ray Cc, will be equally
                    inclined to the refracting faces of the prism BA, BE, and will be parallel to
                    the base AB. This will be obvious by considering Cc as an internal ray incident
                    on both sides of the prism, and at equal angles to each, in which case it will
                    suffer equal degrees of refraction, and therefore be equally inclined to the
                    refracting faces.</p>
                <p>If the eye is placed at r to receive the refracted ray cr, it will see the
                    luminous body, such as a candle, from which die ray RC proceeds, in the
                    direction <hi rend="italic">rc,</hi> and the angle which this ray <hi
                    rend="italic">rc</hi> forms with RC, will be the deviation of the ray produced
                    by the refraction of the prism. Let us now suppose the candle to be fixed, and
                    the prism turned round, so that the angle RCA may be increased, it will be found
                    experimentally, and may be easily proved by projection, that the deviation of
                    the ray <hi rend="italic">rc</hi> is <hi rend="italic">least</hi> when the angle
                    RCA is equal to <hi rend="italic">rcE, or</hi> when Cc is parallel to AE, and
                    increases when Cc deviates on either side from this mean position. Now this
                    position may be easily ascertained by placing the eye behind the face BE, and
                    turning the prism till the refracted image of the candle, or other object,
                    becomes stationary. When this takes place, Cc is parallèl to AE or CcA is an
                    equilateral triangle; and it may easily be shewn, by similarity of triangles, or
                    by projection, that <hi rend="italic">the angle of refraction at the first
                    surface is equal to half the angle of the prism, or f</hi> ABE. Hence we obtain
                    the following simple rule for finding the index of refraction, after having
                    measured, with a goniometer or otherwise, the angle of incidence, or the
                    complement of the angle RCA. Divide the sine of the angle of incidence by the
                    sine of half the ingle of the prism, and the quotient will be the index of <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> efraction.</p>
                <p>For the purpose of measuring indices of refraction, we do 10trequire regular
                    prisms of considerable size. Two small aces well ground and tolerably polished,
                    are sufficient for this impose. They need never be arger than the pupil of the
                    eye, and vill answer well enough if they are ∣f the size of a pin’s head. If we
                    wish 0 measure the index of refraction ∣f fluids, we have only to place a ,rop
                    of the fluid at the angular point 1, of two pieces of parallel glass fixed t any
                    angle by a piece of wood or ax BE. Enough of the fluid for ιe purpose will be
                    retained, by ιpillary attraction at the point A, and after measuring ιe angle
                    BAE of the prism, and the angle of incidence at which the image of the candle
                    becomes stationary, the index of refraction will be found as before.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Refraction through Plane Glasses.</hi></p>
                <p>Every person is acquainted with the fact that light which passes through plane
                    glasses, or glasses which have their two surfaces flat and parallel, like MN, in
                    the annexed figure, does not suffer any very perceptible change, either in its
                    general direction, or in the parallelism, convergency, or divergency of its
                    rays. If AB, A'B', for example, be two parallel rays incident on the plate of
                    glass MN, they will suffer equal refractions at B, B', because they are incident
                    at the same angles, and the refracted rays BC, B'C', will therefore be parallel.
                    These parallel rays again falling upon the second surface at C, <hi
                    rend="italic">C'</hi> will suffer equal refractions there, and will emerge
                    parallel in the lines CD, C'D'. Hence we conclude that parallel rays after
                    transmission, at any obliquity, through a plane glass, will emerge parallel. But
                    as the rays DC, D'C', will, to an eye at D and D', be seen in the directions
                    DC«, D'C'α', their absolute directions in space arealtered, and the difference
                    between the real and the visible direction will increase with the obliquity of
                    the rays AB, A'B', and with the thickness of the plate of glass. If we suppose
                    MN to be part of a looking-glass, silvered on its lower side CC', then the
                    refracted rays BC, B'C', will, after reflexion at C, <hi rend="subscript">
                    i</hi> C', in the directions <hi rend="italic">Cc,</hi> C'c', be refracted at c,
                    c', into the parallel directions <hi rend="italic">cd, c'd'.</hi> But the rays
                    AB, A'B', will be reflected, though in a much fainter degree, in the directions
                    Aó, A 7/, so that an eye placed so as to receive these rays, will see the bright
                    image reflected from the silvered surface, in the direction <hi rend="italic"
                    >dc,</hi> and the faint image reflected from the first surface, in the direction
                    6B, at a distance from each other depending on the obliquity of the reflexion,
                    and on the thickness of the plate. A candle, for example, will be seen double at
                    a short distance from the mirror; but a larger object, in order to be seen
                    double, must be view ed at a greater distance. At great obliquities, and when
                    the objects are very luminous, such as gas-burners, &amp;c., other images w ill
                    be seen by reflexions at c, c', and subsequent reflexions from the other side of
                    the plate. If the two faces of the plate are not exactly parallel, the bright
                    and faint images above described, wi]] change their distance, sometimes
                    overlapping each other, and sometimes separating, according to the part of the
                    plate on which they fall, though the angle of incidence may remain the
                    same.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We had once a

                    position of the points of divergency and convergency. Let ABB' be a pencil of
                    rays diverging from A, and incident upon the plane glass MN. The emergent rays
                    CD, C'D', will, after their second refraction at C, C', proceed as if they had

                    now be 6BB'. Hence a plane glass brings the divergent point of diverging rays
                    nearer to it, and increases the angle of divergency. For the same reason, if
                    DZ&gt;D' is a converging beam of light, its point of convergency <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> will be removed to A by the plane glass, or its angle of

                <p>When there is only one refraction, as in the case of standing water, whose
                    surface is BB', and bottom CC', then the very reverse will be the result. A
                    diverging beam ABB' will have its divergent point removed to <hi rend="italic"

                <p>When a ray of light falls upon a curved surface of any kind, the infinitely small
                    part of the surface which it occupies may be considered as coinciding with the
                    tangent to the surface, or with a plane surface touching the curve at the point
                    of incidence. When the surface is spherical, this tangent plane is perpendicular
                    to the radius, or the line drawn from the centre of the sphere to the point of
                    incidence. Hence it is always given when the centre is given.</p>
                <p>Let MN be the section of a sphere of glass, whose index of refraction is 1∙500,
                    as before, RS∕*a ray passing through its centre S, and therefore unrefracted,
                    because it is incident perpendicularly on both surfaces, and RC, RC, other rays
                    parallel to, and equidistant from, RS∕J it is required to find the path of one
                    of these RC, through the sphere. Join SC, which will be perpendicular to the
                    surface at C. From a scale on which RC is three parts, set off’ RC equal to 1,
                    and draw CD parallel to CS, (which is the same as drawing it perpendicular to
                    the elementary surface, or tangent to the sphere at C)∙ Make CD equal to CR, and
                    through D and C draw the line DC∕i meeting the posterior surface of the sphere
                    at <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> and the axis of the sphere at <hi rend="italic"

                    and the two rays will meet at F, which is called the focus of the sphere for
                    parallel rays, or the principal focus of the sphere.</p>
                <p>If we determine the path of the ray RC, and find the foci <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> and F for both surfaces; by using different indices of refraction, we
                    shall find that in every case the distance EF of the principal focus of the
                    sphere is exactly one-half of the distance E∕* of the focus for the first
                    surface, and that FS is to ES as the sine of incidence or the index of
                    refraction is to the difference between twice the sine of incidence and twice
                    the sine of refraction; that is, in glass as 1∙500 is to 3∙000-2∙000, or as
                    1∙500 to 1∙000.</p>
                <p>Hence we have for different refractive bodies the following results :—</p>

                <p>In spheres of diamond and other substances of high refractive power, a refracted
                    ray Cc may fall so obliquely upon the inner surface of the sphere, that it would
                    be totally reflected, and would therefore be carried round the surface of the
                    sphere, without the possibility of making its exit. If the length of the
                    refracted ray Cc should cut off an arch which is an aliquot part of a circle,
                    the ray would describe a regular polygon, being always reflected from the same
                    points; but if it was not an aliquot part of a circle, the points of reflexion
                    would vary in every revolution of the ray.</p>
                <p>The following is the rule for finding the principal focus of a sphere, or its
                    focus for parallel rays:—Divide the index of refraction by twice its excess
                    above unity, and the quotient is the distance of the principal focus from the
                    centre of the sphere.</p>
                <p>When the rays RC, RC, in place <hi rend="italic">of</hi> falling on the sphere in
                    directions parallel to the axis, or to one another, proceed from a near object,
                    and always from a point in the axis USE, their focus may be found by the very
                    same method which we have already given. When the point from which the rays
                    diverge is very distant, the focus of such rays will be a little farther from
                    the sphere than F, and as the radiant point approaches to the sphere, the focus
                    F will recede from it, as will be more fully explained when we treat of the
                    progress of rays through lenses.</p>

                <p>The action of an equally convex lens in refracting the rays of light, is exactly
                    the same as that of a sphere, with this difference only, that the twO surfaces
                    are brought nearer each other, and in consequence of this the ray refracted by
                    the first surface falls upon the second surface, at a different point, and at a
                    different angle, the effect of which is to produce a change in the position of
                    the focus.</p>

                <p>Let LL be a double and equally convex lens of glass, a line <hi rend="italic"
                    >Af</hi> passing through the centre C, or middle point of its greatest
                    thickness, is called its axis. Let <hi rend="italic">parallel rays</hi> AB,
                    A'B', fall upon the first surface, at the points B, B; these will be refracted
                    in directions BD, B'D', which will be determined by the method shewn in fig. 28.
                    Had there been no second surface, these rays would have converged to a focus at
                    <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> but as they meet the second surface of the lens at D
                    and D', they will there be refracted, as shewn in fig. 28, for the sphere, so as
                    take the directions DF, D'F', and have their principal focus at F.</p>
                <p>The following is the rule for finding the principal focus of a glass lens
                    unequally convex :—Multiply the radius of the one surface by the radius of the
                    other, and divide twice this product by the sum of the same radii.</p>
                <p>If the glass lens is equally convex, and has its index of refraction l∙500, the
                    distance CF, or its principal focal distance, will be equal to the radius of any
                    of its surfaces.</p>
                <p>The following is the rule for finding the principal focal distance of a
                    plano-convex lens of glass. When the convex side is exposed to parallel rays,
                    the focal distance, reckoned from the plane side, will be equal to double the
                    radius of the convex surface, diminished by two-thirds of the thickness of the
                    lens. When the plane side of the lens is exposed to parallel rays, the distance
                    of the focus from the convex side will be equal to twice the radius.</p>
                <p>When the rays AB, AB are oblique to the axis, the middle ray AC passing through
                    the centre C, will obviously suffer refraction at B, but as it falls upon the
                    second surface at the same angle, it will be refracted a second time in an
                    oppositedirection, so that it will proceed in a direction <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> parallel to AB. The rays AB, AB will suffer refraction at the points B,
                    B', and also at the points D and D', and it will be found by projection that
                    they meet in a focus F in the axis <hi rend="italic">d f.</hi></p>
                <p>ín the preceding case the parallel rays are supposed to issue from some very
                    distant object; but if the object from which the rays proceed is near or not
                    very distant from the lens, its focus will recede from the lens, in proportion
                    as the object or point of divergence approaches to it. This fact scarcely
                    requires to be proved, for it is manifest that as the radiant point approaches
                    to the lens, the rays fall more and more obliquely on the first surface, and
                    less and lessobliquely on the second, so that the deviation produced by
                    refraction is not sufficient to bring them to a focus so near the lens as the
                    point F, in fig. 30. This will be better understood from fig. 32, where LL is a
                    convex lens, whose focus for parallel rays is F. Let RL, RL be rays diverging
                    from a candle or other body, at R, then, if we trace the refracted rays by the
                    method already given in fig. 27, we shall find that they will meet at a point
                    <hi rend="italic">f</hi> farther from the lens than F, and that if the point R
                    advance to R', the focus /will advance to <hi rend="italic">f',</hi> and so on,
                    the focus/ <hi rend="superscript"> 1,</hi> receding from the lens as R
                    approaches to it. When the distance RC is equal to twice CF, or twice the
                    principal focal distance, the distance of the focus <hi rend="italic">f'</hi>
                    from the lens will be equal to the distance of the radiant point from it, or <hi
                    rend="italic">Cf</hi> ’ will be equal to CR'. When R comes nearer C, <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> goes rapidly away from it, and when R comes to F', which is
                    called the anterior focus, CF' being equal to CF, the rays w ill be parallel, or
                    what is the same thing, the focus <hi rend="italic">f</hi> will have retired to
                    an infinite distance. When R comes nearer to C than F', the rays will diverge,
                    after passing through the lens, as if they came from some point in front of the
                    lens, and this point, or <hi rend="italic">virtual focus,</hi> as it is called,
                    will approach to the lens as R approaches it, in moving from F' towards C. The
                    points R and <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> and R' and <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> are
                    called <hi rend="italic">conjugate foci,</hi> because it may be shewn that rays
                    diverging from <hi rend="italic">f</hi> will be refracted to R, and rays
                    diverging from <hi rend="italic">f'</hi> to R'. It is indeed a general truth in
                    all the phenomena of refraction and reflexion, that if the refracted rays are
                    supposed to be the incident ones, the incident rays will be the refracted ones;
                    for the ray experiences the very same action in an inverse order, by retracing
                    its path.</p>
                <p>The following is the ride for finding the focus <hi rend="italic">f</hi> or the
                    conjugate focal length of a convex lens of glass for diverging rays: Multiply
                    twice the product of the radii of the two surfaces of the lens, by the distance
                    of the radiant point or RC, for a <hi rend="italic">dividend.</hi> Multiply the
                    sum of the two radii by the same distance RC, and from this product subtract
                    twice the product of the radii for a divisor. The quotient of the dividend
                    divided by the divisor will be the focal distance <hi rend="italic">Cf</hi>
                    required.</p>
                <p>When the lens is <hi rend="italic">equally-convex,</hi> multiply the distance of
                    the radiant point RC, by the radius of the surfaces, and divide that product by
                    the difference between the same distance andthe radius, and the quotient will be
                    the focal dis ∙ tance <hi rend="italic">Cf</hi> required.</p>
                <p>If the lens is <hi rend="italic">plano-convex,</hi> divide twice the product of
                    the distance of the radiant point RC, multiplied by the radius of the convex
                    surface, by the difference between that distance and twice the radius, and the
                    quotient will be the distance of the focus from the centre of the lens.</p>
                <p>When converging rays fall upon a convex lens, they are always refracted to a
                    point between the lens and their point of convergence. Let RL, RL, be rays
                    converging to any point <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> behind the lens LL, it -is
                    very evident that refraction must always make them cross the axis RCr of the
                    lens somewhere between <hi rend="italic">r</hi> and the lens, and always between
                    the principal focus F and the lens. The exact point may be found by the methods
                    already given. As the point of convergence <hi rend="italic">r</hi> recedes from
                    the lens, the focus <hi rend="italic">f</hi> will approach to the principal
                    focus F, and when <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is infinitely distant, the rays RL,
                    RL, become parallel, and <hi rend="italic">f</hi> will coincide with F. When <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> approaches to <hi rend="italic">C,f</hi> will also approach
                    to it.</p>
                <p>The focus of a double convex glass lens, when its thickness is small, for
                    converging rays may be found by the following rule: Multiply twice the product
                    of the radii of the two surfaces by the distance <hi rend="italic">rC</hi> of
                    the point of convergence for a <hi rend="italic">dividend.</hi> Multiply the sum
                    of the two radii by the same distance rC, and add to this product twice the
                    product of the radii for a <hi rend="italic">divisor.</hi> The quotient obtained
                    by dividing the above dividend by this divisor, will be the focal distance <hi
                    rend="italic">fC</hi> required.</p>
                <p>When the lens is <hi rend="italic">equally-</hi> convex, multiply the distance rC
                    by the radius of the surfaces, and divide that product by the sum of the same
                    distance and the radius, and the quotient will give the focal distance <hi
                    rend="italic">fC</hi> required.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">plano-convex</hi> lenses we must divide twice the product of
                    the distance rC multiplied by the radius of the convex surface, by the sum of
                    that distance and twice the radius, and the quotient will give the focal
                    distance required.</p>

                    because the very same methods which are applicable to convex and concave
                    surfaces, are applicable also to them. When used by themselves and for ordinary
                    purposes, these lenses are inferior to the common convex and concave lenses, and
                    therefore are seldom met with. We shall therefore content ourselves with giving
                    the rules for finding their foci.</p>
                <p>In a meniscus the focus for parallel rays is obtained by dividing twice the
                    product of the two radii by their difference, and the quotient will give the
                    focal distance.</p>
                <p>In the same kind of lens the focus for diverging rays will be thus found:
                    Multiply twice the distance of the radiant point, by the product of the radii of
                    the two surfaces, for a dividend. Multiply the same distance by the difference
                    between the two radii, and to their product add twice the product <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the two radii for a divisor. The quotient arising from
                    dividing the dividend by the divisor, will be the focal distance of the
                    meniscus. This rule will answer also for converging rays.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">concave-convex</hi> lenses the very same rules will apply,
                    but the rays have a virtual focus in front of the lens, as in concave
                    lenses.</p>
                <p>In treating of the passage of oblique rays through a double convex glass, as
                    shewn in fig. 31, we have stated that there is a point C, called the centre of
                    the lens, through which the ray that passes suffers the same refraction at both
                    surfaces, or emerges parallel to its original direction. In equally double
                    convex lenses, this centre C is accurately in the middle part of the thickness
                    of the lens; but in other forms of lenses it is not. Hence it is necessary to
                    point out the method of finding this centre. In <hi rend="italic">double
                    convex</hi> or <hi rend="italic">concave lenses,</hi> the centre C, see fig. 31,
                    37, and 38, lies within the two surfaces of the lens.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">plano-convex</hi> and <hi rend="italic">plano-concave</hi>
                    lenses, it is coincident with the vertex of the convex or concave surfaces, and
                    in <hi rend="italic">meniscuses</hi> and <hi rend="italic">concave-convex
                    lenses</hi> it lies without the thickness of the lens, and nearest to the
                    surface which has the greatest curvature. Let R, r, figs. 37—40, be the centres
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194561974" xml:id="kp-eb0716-1974-0393"/>of the convex
                    and concave surfaces of the lenses, and REr, fig. 37,38, or RrE, fig.</p>
                <p>39, 40 are their axes. Taking any point A in one surface, draw RA, and parallel
                    to this draw <hi rend="italic">ra,</hi> which will cut the other surface of the
                    lens in <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Join Aα, and continue it till it meets the
                    axis RER in same point E; this point E is called the centre of the lens, because
                    every ray that passes through it will have its incident and emergent parts
                    parallel, such as QA, and <hi rend="italic">qa.</hi> From the similarity of the
                    triangles REA, rEa, and the composition and division of ratios, we have RA∑+∑rα:
                    ra=REzzprE (or Rr): rE, hence rE must be invariable like the other lines, and on
                    whatever point the parallel radii RA, <hi rend="italic">ra,</hi> are drawn, the
                    line Aα must cut the axis Rr in the same point E∙ If we suppose the ray Aα to
                    pass out of the lens in both directions, it will suffer the same quantity of
                    refraction in opposite directions, because the angles of incidence αAR, Arzr,
                    are equal. Hence the incident and emergent parts AQ, <hi rend="italic">αq,</hi>
                    will be parallel.</p>
                <p>When the lens is small in diameter, or of a great focal length, or its thickness
                    inconsiderable from other causes, the path of the ray <hi rend="italic"
                    >QAaq,</hi> may be taken in a straight line passing through the centre E of the
                    lenses. This is evident from the circumstance that the perpendicular distance
                    between the lines AQ, <hi rend="italic">aq</hi> diminishes both with the
                    obliquity of the incident ray, and the thickness of the lens.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On the Refraction of Rays by Cylindrical Lenses.</hi></p>
                <p>Cylindrical lenses may have all the forms of the lenses which we have already
                    described. A perfect cylindrical lens corresponds with a sphere whose section is
                    the same; a plano-convex cylinder has its section similar to a planoconvex lens
                    of the same dimensions; and a meniscus cylinder has one of the cylindrical
                    surfaces convex and another concave.</p>
                <p>In all these cases the curved surfaces are cylindrical; that is, circular in one
                    direction, and rectilineal in another; but we may combine a spherical surface
                    either convex or concave, with a cylindrical surface either convex or concave,
                    and thus produce cylindro-spherical lenses, an ingenious application of which to
                    vision was made by Mr. Airy, for the purpose of remedying a defect in his own
                    eye.</p>
                <p>This class of lenses, therefore, whether entirely cylindrical, or
                    cylindro-spherical, having been found of real use both in matters of science,
                    and for the purposes of vision, it becomes of consequence to give a general
                    account of their properties.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">LLL'L'</hi> be a double convex cylindrical lens, composed
                    of two cylindrical surfaces, one of which is LLL'L'. Then if RRR be three
                    parallel and horizontal rays passing through the thinnest portion of the upper
                    part of the lens, it is obvious that they will be refracted to a focus at F, at
                    the same distance from the lens, as in an ordinary lens. In like manner the rays
                    R'R'R' falling upon the lowest portion of the lens will have their focus at F'.
                    Every intermediate portion of the lens will have a similar focus somewhere in
                    the line FF', and if we suppose all the rays to proceed from a distant object,
                    such as the sun, there will be an image of the sun, or a luminous focus in every
                    point of the line FF', and FF' will be a brilliant line of light.</p>
                <p>This property of a cylindrical lens to form a bright line of light has been
                    ingeniously applied by Captain Kater in the construction of his azimuth compass,
                    which we have described in our article <hi rend="smallcaps">Magnetism,</hi> vol.
                    χifi. p. 765.</p>
                <p>In cylindrical lenses diverging and converging rays will have the same foci as in
                    common and concave lenses of the same curvature; and therefore the rules for
                    finding their foci are applicable also to them.</p>
                <p>Cylindrical lenses have been recently applied by Sir David Brewster for improving
                    the vision of objects that are rectilineal, such as the defective lines in the
                    solar spectrum. When these lines are not visible, or are very imperfectly
                    visible, on account of the imperfections of the telescope, the application of a
                    cylindrical lens, either solid or fluid, renders them more visible when the axis
                    of the cylinder or cylindrical surface is accurately perpendicular to the lines.
                    A prism has a similar effect. Both of them act in filling up the irregularities
                    of the edges of the line by a succession of images of other parts of the line.
                    If we look, for example, at a screw nail, or a twisted or rough rope, through a
                    prism or cylinder, whose length is perpendicular to the screw or rope, the edges
                    of both will be as smooth as if they were polished cylinders.</p>
                <p>A patent was taken out sey eral years ago by a Parisian artist for a transverse
                    cylindrical lens similar to that shewn in fig. 22 0; which differs from the
                    cylindrical lens in fig. 41 in this, that the second cylindrical surface has the
                    axis of the cylinder of which it is a part, perpendicular to the axis of the
                    cylinder of which the first surface is a part. The effect of this combination is
                    <hi rend="italic">exactly</hi> equivalent to a plano-convex glass of the same
                    radii of curvature, and therefore it does not possess any superior properties,
                    as was believed by its inventor.</p>
                <p>If we cross two cylindrical lenses, such as that in fig. 41, at right angles, we
                    shall have all the effect of a double convex lens. Or if we cross two good test
                    tubes filled with water or any other fluid, in the same manner, we shall also
                    obtain a rude imitation of the effect of a spherical lens, which may answer for
                    the common purposes of a microscope.</p>
                <p>The application of a cylindro-spherical lens by Mr. Airy to the purpose of
                    remedying imperfect vision in his own eye deserves to be more particularly
                    noticed. He found that his eye refracted rays to a nearer or shorter focus in a
                    vertical than in a horizontal plane,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This was the case also in Dr. Thomas Young’s eye, but it did
                    not injure his vision. <hi rend="italic">Pl. Pai. Phil.</hi> vol. ii. pp. 578,
                    9.</p></note> so that his eye was completely useless. Hence he concluded that
                    the curvature of his cornea was greater in a vertical than in a horizontal
                    plane, and he ingeniously proposed to correct this defect by cylindrical
                    refraction. As the eye was shortsighted, he required concave surfaces to correct
                    the general defect of a too convex cornea. He therefore had a lens constructed,
                    which was doubly concave, one of the surfaces being spherically concave, and the
                    other cylindrically concave, and of such a curvature as to bring to the same
                    point the vertical and horizontal foci of the cornea. An artist of the name of
                    Fuller, at Ipswich, constructed for Mr. Airy lenses of the proper dimensions,
                    which enabled him to read the smallest print at a considerable distance with his
                    defective eye, as well as he could do with the other. He found that vision was
                    most distinct when the cylindrical surface was turned from the eye, and he
                    placed the lens as near the eye as possible. There is another application of
                    cylindrical lenses which we believe has not hitherto been made. In <pb

                    of natural history, objects which are generally preserved in cylindrical bottles
                    or vessels containing fluids, the objects are always seen distorted, being
                    magnified to the greatest extent in a plane perpendicular to the length or axis
                    of the cylinder, while in a rectangular direction, the object is not magnified
                    at all. In order to see the objects of their true shape, and have them equally
                    magnified in all directions, a cylindrical lens of a suitable focus should be
                    employed, so that the axis of the cylinder may be at right angles to the
                    cylindrical axis of the vessel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III.— <hi rend="italic">On the Formation of
                    Images by Lenses., and on the vision of objects through them.</hi></p>
                <p>In the preceding section we have treated of the formation of images by rays
                    transmitted through small apertures, and have considered the formation ofimages
                    by reflecting surfaces.</p>
                <p>In order to explain the formation of images by convex lenses, whether double, or
                    plano-convex, or meniscuses, let LL be a convex lens, MN an object farther from
                    it than its principal focus. Let MLI. be a cone of divergent rays preceding from
                    Μ, and having their focus at <hi rend="italic">m</hi> behind the lens; and NLL
                    another similar cone from the other extremity N of the object, and having their
                    focus at w. Every other part of the object will send out rays in all directions;
                    but only those which fall upon the circular surface of the lens LL, will be
                    refracted by it, and they will all have their focus between <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> These refracted pencils, however, cannot
                    be shewn in the figure without crossing one another. As every part of the object
                    MN, will therefore send to corresponding points of the image <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn</hi> rays of their own colour, an image of MN resembling it in all respects
                    will be formed at <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> and as the rays from the upper part
                    Μ of the object go to <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> and from the lower part to <hi
                    rend="italic">n,</hi> this image will be an inverted one, and if we draw lines
                    through the centre of the lens from Μ to <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> and N to <hi
                    rend="italic">n,</hi> it will be evident from the similarity of triangles that
                    the size of the image will be to the size of the object, as the distance of the
                    image from the lens is to the distance of the object.</p>
                <p>If we place the eye behind this image <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> we do not see it
                    suspended in the air at <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> but it appears as if it were
                    in front of the lens. That the image, however, is formed at <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn,</hi> may be proved by viewing it on smoke raised at that place, or on a
                    piece of ground glass, or semi-transparent paper; or if we bring the eye in
                    front, we shall see it distinctly painted on any white ground, such as a piece
                    of white paper. We shall suppose it, however, to be seen on smoke by the eye
                    placed behind it at A or B. It will be seen exactly at <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn,</hi> as if it were a real object; and in order to see it distinctly, the
                    eye must view it at the same distance as it views other objects, and it may be
                    viewed as any other object is, through a pair of spectacles or a magnifying
                    glass.</p>
                <p>As all the rays from M, N cross each other at the points <hi rend="italic">m,
                    n</hi> of the image, the very same rays radiate from those points that radiated
                    from M, N, and consequently the very same effect must be produced in the eye as
                    if these rays proceeded from a real object at <hi rend="italic">mn.</hi> Hence
                    by placing another convex lens at a proper distance behind <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn,</hi> a distance greater than its principal focus, we may form another image
                    of this image, in the conjugate focus of the second lens.</p>
                <p>If we wish to form a magnified image of an object by any lens, we have only to
                    place the object nearer the lens, and it follows from the rules for conjugate
                    foci that the image will increase. If MN, for example, is brought nearer LL, the
                    image <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> will recede from the lens, and increase in size.
                    When ML is equal to twice the principal focal distance of the lens, the distance
                    of the image røL, and the size of the image will be the same as that of the
                    object MN. If MN comes still nearer the lens, <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> will
                    recede still farther, and continue to increase in size till it becomes
                    infinitely large and infinitely distant. when this happens, the rays which form
                    it will have become parallel. If during all these changes the eye is withdrawn
                    from the lens so as to be at least six inches behind the place where the image
                    is formed, it will observe the image distinctly before it. But when the rays
                    become parallel, the eye may then be placed immediately behind the lens, and it
                    will see the object distinctly in the anterior principal focus of the lens, and
                    magnified in proportion to the shortness of the focal distance of the lens.</p>
                <p>In the preceding paragraphs, we have described the principles of the <hi
                    rend="italic">camera obscura,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">compound
                    microscope,</hi> and the operation of the <hi rend="italic">single
                    microscope.</hi> When the image <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> is distinctly formed
                    on paper, the lens LL acts as in the <hi rend="italic">camera obscura,</hi>
                    painting all objects before it in their natural colours, in their just
                    proportions, and with all their movements, on a white ground placed behind it.
                    When the image <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> has become greater than the object MN,
                    by the advance of the latter to the lens, the eye views this magnified picture,
                    and the effect is the same as in the <hi rend="italic">compound microscope,</hi>
                    whose object-glass is LL,and whose eye-glass has a focal distance equal to that
                    of the eye. When the image is infinitely distant, and the rays enter the eye
                    parallel, the object being then in the anterior principal focus of the lens LL,
                    and the eye behind it, the lens is then acting as a <hi rend="italic">single
                    microscope.</hi></p>
                <p>When objects are within our reach, such as microscopic objects, or near objects

                    with artificial light, and' thus make dark objects give brighter images; but
                    when this cannot be done, in consequence of the objects being out of our reach,
                    we can increase the brightness of the image by increasing the area or
                    superficies of the lens. If the area of the lens LL, for example, were doubled,
                    it would collect twice the quantity of rays that flow from every point of an
                    object, and concentrate them at the corresponding points of the image <hi
                    rend="italic">mn.</hi></p>
                <p>In order to understand the principle of the <hi rend="italic">telescope</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">single microscope,</hi> we must be acquainted with what is <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194562000" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2000-0395"/> called the <hi
                    rend="italic">apparent magnitudes</hi> of objects. If we hold a sixpence A at
                    the distance of six or eight inches from the eye E, then it will exactly cover
                    or appear equal to a shilling placed at B, a half-crown placed at C, and a crown
                    at D. If we remove the sixpence A, the shilling will just cover the half-crown.
                    If we remove the shilling, the half-crown will just cover the crown. Hence all
                    these coins placed as they are in the figure, are said to have to an eye placed
                    at E the same apparent magnitude, because they are all seen under the same angle
                    DEF, and would all cover the same portion of the sky, or of any distant
                    object.</p>
                <p>If the sixpence A is brought thrice as near the eye E as in fig. 44, its angle of
                    apparent magnitude will nowbc GEF thrice as great as DEF, fig. 43, and it will
                    appear thrice as large as DF. The sixpence has therefore been magnified; and if
                    we interpose a lens between it and the eye, so as to make the rays refracted by
                    the lens parallel, it will appear distinctly <hi rend="italic">magnified,</hi>
                    and the lens which we interpose will be a single microscope.</p>
                <p>Objects within our reach, and capable of being placed where we please, may be
                    therefore magnified to any extent, by placing them very near the eye, and in the
                    anterior focus of a small convex glass, which, by making the diverging rays
                    parallel, render the object as distinctly seen under a great angle, as if it
                    were a large object placed at a distance, and subtending the same angle at the
                    eye.</p>
                <p>But when objects are at a distance, and beyond our reach, such as remote
                    terrestrial objects, and the planets and stars, we can magnify them, or
                    represent them to our eye under a greater angle of apparent magnitude, by a
                    different principle. If the objectis the dial-plate of a clock, at the distance
                    of 12,000 feet, we place a lens whose focal distance ism: feet, in the end of a
                    tube about six feet long, and having directed it to the dial-plate, a distinct
                    inverted image of the dialplate will be formed in the focus of the lens, at a
                    distance of six feet from it, and if we view this image with our eye placed six
                    inches behind it, we shall see the image of the dial-plate distinct and
                    magnified. Now, as the distance of the dial-plate is 12,000 feet, and that of
                    the image only <hi rend="italic">six</hi> feet from the lens, the image will be
                    — <hi rend="superscript"> or</hi> 2000 times smaller in diameter than the
                    object, notin apparent magnitude, but by real measurement; and if we were to
                    take the image and place it beside the dial-plate, and view them both at the
                    distance of 12,000 feet, their apparent magnitudes would, like their real
                    magnitudes, be in the proportion of 2000 to 1. But the image is fortunately
                    within our reach, and we can do with it what we choose. Let us first view it
                    with the naked eye, which, generally speaking, sees objects most distinctly at a
                    distance of six inches, and as we see it at the distance of six inches, it will
                    appear as much greater as it would have done at the distance of 12,000 feet, as
                    12,000 feet is to six inches, or as 24,000 is to 1. Hence it follows, that
                    though the image is diminished in the focus of the lens 2000 times, yet it is
                    magnified from its proximity to the eye 24,000 times, that is, it is

                    distinctly, nearer than 12 inches, would see the dial-plate magnified only six
                    times. But both these persons could put on highly magnifying spectacles, so as
                    to see the image at very short distances, or what is the same thing, to look at
                    the image of the dial-plate through a magnifying glass, which would enable them
                    to see it at the distance of one inch. In this case the magni- 72</p>
                <p>fying effect would be -γ, or 72 times.</p>
                <p>But the instrument which we have now fitted up is precisely a telescope, the
                    large lens being its object-glass, and the small one used by the observer its
                    eye-glass, and hence the magnifying power of such an instrument is always equal
                    to the focal length of the objcct-glass divided by the focal length of the
                    eye-glass. The image formed by such a telescope is inverted, which is of no
                    consequence when we look at the heavenly bodies, and it is therefore called an
                    <hi rend="italic">astronomical telescope</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but in
                    looking at the dial-plate, and at terrestrial objects, the inversion would be
                    disagreeable, and it is therefore usual to make the image erec, by using either
                    a <hi rend="italic">concave</hi> cye-glass, or three or more convex eye-glasses.
                    In the former case it is called the <hi rend="italic">Galilean telescope,</hi>
                    and in the latter a <hi rend="italic">terrestrial telescope.</hi></p>
                <p>When the distance of the object is not very great, or when the focal length of
                    the lens bears a considerable proportion to the distance of the object, the
                    magnifying power of a lens, when the eye views the image formed by the lens at
                    the distance of six inches, is the following. Subtract the focal distance of the
                    lens in feet from the distance between the image and the object, and divide the
                    remainder by the same focal distance. By this quotient divide twice the distance
                    of the object in feet, and the quotient will express the magnifying power, or
                    the number of times that the object has been increased in apparent magnitude by
                    the lens.</p>
                <p>The very same observations apply to images formed by concave mirrors, and hence a
                    single concave mirror becomes the simplest form of the reflecting telescope, the
                    eye viewing the image which it forms. In the case of such images the body or the
                    head of the observer must be placed between the object and the image, so that in
                    order to use a single concave mirror, we must either make the mirror so large
                    that the observer’s head will not obstruct all the light, or we must make the
                    reflexion a little obliquely, or, what is done in practice, we must by means of
                    a small plane mirror or a prism reflect or refract the rays to one side, so as
                    to allow the observer to look at the image formed by the concave mirror, without
                    obstructing the rays in their passage from the object to the mirror, the
                    quantity obstructed by the plane mirror or prism being too small to do any
                    injury. If we view the image through a convex lens, so as to magnify it still
                    more, the mirror and the lens will constitute a <hi rend="italic">reflecting
                    telescope.</hi></p>

                <p>The rules which we have already given for finding the foci of lenses and mirrors,
                    are strictly applicable only to rays that pass near the axis of the lenses and
                    mirrors; and this may be readily proved by the method of finding the refracted
                    and reflecting ray which we have explained and used.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">On Spherical Aberration of
                    Lenses.</hi></p>
                <p>In order to prove and illustrate the preceding truth, we shall suppose parallel
                    rays to be incident on a mass of glass MNOP, in which there is only refraction
                    at its first surface,, and we do this both to avoid the confusion of lines, and
                    because it is perfectly sufficient for the purpose of explanation. Let RS be the
                    axis of the spherical surface MN, passing <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562013"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-2013-0396"/>through S, its centre of curvature; and if we
                    consider it a ray, also, it will go on to F without any refraction. Let RB be a
                    ray falling on the refracting surface at a distance from the axis RS, and
                    parallel to it. From the point of incidence draw BS, which will be perpendicular
                    to the surface at B, and take BG three fourths of BR, BG being to BR as 1 is to
                    1∙500, the index of refraction. From G draw GD parallel to BS, and making BD
                    equal to BR, through the points D and B, draw B∕C for the refracted ray. Do the
                    very same thing for the ray RB ʹ falling on the point B', and parallel to RS,
                    and equidistant from it, and B∕A will be the refracted ray.</p>
                <p>If we now take two rays <hi rend="italic">rb, r'b'</hi> near the axis, and
                    parallel to and equidistant from it, and apply the same method of projection to
                    them, we shall find the refracted rays to be 6F, Z&gt;'F crossing the axis, and
                    converging at a point F, more remote from the refracting surface than <hi
                    rend="italic">f.</hi> If we draw through F a line AEC, perpendicular to the
                    axis, then A and C being the points where the marginal or most remote rays which
                    fall on the surface MN, and F being the focus of those nearest the axis, the
                    distance <hi rend="italic">fF</hi> is called the <hi rend="italic">longitudinal
                    spherical aberration,</hi> and AC the <hi rend="italic">lateral spherical
                    aberration of</hi> the lens.</p>
                <p>These results may be obtained experimentally by covering up with a circle of
                    black paper, all the central parts of the spherical surface, leaving a clear
                    marginal ring corresponding with BB'. If the surface thus limited is exposed to
                    the solar rays, we shall find a pretty distinct picture or image of the sun
                    formed at <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> which, from a cause which we shall soon
                    explain, will be highly coloured at the edges. If we now remove the black circle
                    from the surface MN, and cover the outside surface with black paper, excepting a
                    small opening in the vertex of the lens, where the axis RS cuts it, and expose
                    the lens to the sun’s rays, we shall find the image of the sun distinct at F,
                    and it will be less coloured than the image formed at <hi rend="italic">f</hi>
                    from another cause.</p>
                <p>If we now expose successive rings of the surface MN to the sun’s light, shutting
                    up all the rest of the lens, we shall find that the ring nearest the axis will
                    have its focus near <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> between∕*and F; the second ring,
                    its focus still nearer F; the third, its focus still nearer F; and so on, till
                    the last ring will give its image of the sun close to F. Hence it follows, that
                    there will be distinct images of the sun formed by each ring, and occupying the
                    whole space <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> ∕F; and, therefore, if we expose the
                    whole surface MN to the solar rays, the image of the sun must be extremely
                    confused and indistinct; and if received upon a sheet of white paper placed at
                    AC, it will consist of a bright disc atF, surrounded with a broad halo of light,
                    becoming fainter and fainter towards A and C.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“The effect of aberration,” says Sir John
                    Herschel, “may be very prettily exhibited by covering a large convex lens with a
                    paper screen full of small round holes, regularly disposed, and exposing it to
                    the sun, receiving the converged rays on a white paper behind the lens, which
                    should be first placed very near it, and then gradually withdrawn. The pencils
                    which passed through the holes will form spots on the screen, and their
                    disposition will become more and more unequal over the surface, as the screen is
                    farther removed; those at the circumference becoming crowded together before the
                    central ones. The manner in which the several spots corresponding to central
                    rays blend together into an image at the focus, and those formed by the exterior
                    ones are scattered round it, gives us a very good idea of the variation of
                    density of the rays in the circle of aberration at or near the principal focus;
                    and if the white screen be waved rapidly to and fro in the cone of rays, so as
                    to pass over the focus at each oscillation, the whole cone will be seen as a
                    solid figure in the air, and the place of the circle of least aberration will
                    become evident to the eye, forming altogether a very pleasing and instructive

                <p>As this is true of every spherical surface whatever, it follows, that every image
                    formed by a spherical surface or lens, and every object seen through it, must be
                    indistinct, from the confusion of rays produced by spherical aberration. As this
                    indistinctness increases with the aperture of the lens, or the distance of the
                    marginal rays from the axis, we may remove it to a certain degree by limiting
                    the aperture, or using smaller lenses; but excepting in the case of the sun or
                    any highly luminous body, this diminution of the aperture would injure vision,
                    from the want of light, especially in microscopes and telescopes; and hence it
                    becomes an object of the highest importance in optics, and it is one which has
                    occupied much attention, to discover methods of diminishing or correcting the
                    spherical aberration of lenses.</p>
                <p>Philosophers have, therefore, been led to calculate with accuracy the amount of
                    spherical aberration in lenses of different forms, and having different sides
                    exposed to the incident rays. The following are the results which they have
                    obtained, and they may be readily verified either by experiment, or by tracing
                    the refracted rays through large diagrams of lenses of different shapes.</p>

                <p>As a general rule for all lenses already made, and whose focus it is inconvenient

                <p>The preceding results are calculated on the supposition, that the lens is made of

                    greatly when we use transparent media of higher and lower refractive powers.
                    When the index of refraction, for example, is 1∙6861, which is nearly that of
                    some of the metallic glasses, and of several precious stones, and of sulphuret

                <p>In the case of diamond the aberration must be next to nothing; but in order to
                    obtain this great advantage, its second surface must be very concave, which
                    diminishes greatly its magnifying power. We have no doubt that artificial
                    glasses or other solids will yet be made by art, and that mineral bodies will be
                    discovered which will have such a high refractive power, as to enable opticians
                    to remove almost wholly the spherical aberration of single lenses.</p>
                <p>Hitherto we have spoken only of the aberration of parallel rays, the effect of
                    which is invariably to shorten the focus of the marginal or exterior rays; but
                    when the incident rays converge or diverge, the aberration diminishes, and the
                    focus of the marginal rays continues to be nearer the surface than that of
                    central rays, till the focus of convergence or divergence comes up to <hi

                    will be presently seen, the aberration disappears, and at the second of which,
                    namely, the focus of parallel rays in the convex side, it is infinite. When the
                    focus of convergence or divergence is situated between these points, the effect
                    of aberrafon is to lengthen the focus of marginal rays, and shorten that of
                    central rays, the focal distance of the latter being now shorter than that of
                    the former. These results are true for all curvatures and all indices of

                <p>We have mentioned above, that there is a point in the axis, at which rays which
                    diverge from it, and fall upon a concave surface, will have no spherical
                    aberration. This will be understood from fig. 46, where BB ’ is the first
                    concave surface of a medium, C its centre, RCD its axis, and A a point in the
                    spherical surface, where it meets the axis beyond the centre C. If we take two
                    points R, F, such that RC is equal to the radius AC of the surface multiplied by
                    the index of refraction, or RA to AF as the index of refraction is to unity,
                    then all rays diverging from R, whether marginal or central, and falling upon
                    the concave surface BDB', will be refracted at BB' in directions Br, B'r, which
                    will proceed from the virtual focus F without any spherical aberration. This may
                    be readily proved by the projection of the rays. Hence if upon F as a centre
                    with any radius FE greater than FD, we describe a circle MEN, we shall have the
                    second surface of a concave-convex lens, which will be entirely free of
                    spherical aberration. This is evident, as the rays refracted by the first
                    surface BDB ’ fall perpendicularly on the second surface, and suffer therefore
                    no refraction.</p>
                <p>As there is a <hi rend="italic">concave-convex lens</hi> without aberration, for
                    rays diverging from one point of its axis <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> so there is
                    a <hi rend="italic">meniscus</hi> without aberration for rays converging to a
                    particular point in its axis. Let RB, R ʹ B' be rays converging to a point /in
                    the axis RC∕ ’ of a convex refracting surface BDB', whose centre is C. If we
                    take ∕c, so that it is to the radius CD as the index of refraction is to unity,
                    then it may be shewn by projection or calculation that the refracted rays RB,
                    <hi rend="italic">rb,</hi> whether marginal or central, will be refracted in
                    lines BF, δ∕*having the same focus F without any spherical aberration. Hence if
                    with F as a centre we describe <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562039"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-2039-0398"/> any circle, having its radius FcZ less than FD,
                    we shall have the second or c∩n- ' cave surface of a meniscus, which will have
                    no aberration, because the rays BF, &amp;F will pass through that surface
                    perpendicularly, and suffer no refraction.</p>
                <p>Owing to the injurious effect of spherical aberration on the performance of
                    telescopes and compound microscopes, philosophers have sought to correct the
                    spherical aberration of convex lenses, by the opposite aberration of concave
                    ones. We have already given drawings<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Art. <hi rend="smallcaps">Microscope,</hi> vol. xv∙ pp. 34,
                    35.</p></note> of three doublets without spherical aberration, according to the
                    calculations of Sir John Herschel; and we shall now give an account of the
                    method used by Dr. Blair of correcting the spherical aberration in his compound
                    object-glasses, and as they possess some historical interest, we shall give the
                    same diagrams which he employed. Let AB, fig. 48, represent a convex lens
                    receiving a pencil of diverging rays from the object S, and let D be the focus
                    of marginal and F that of rays in-cidentnear the axis, such as ST. The greatest
                    longitudinal aberration will therefore in this case be DF.. Let GH, fig. 49, be
                    now a concave lens, upon which are incident parallel rays SHRK. Let P be the
                    virtual focus of marginal rays, such as SH, and N the focus of rays near the
                    centre, such as RK, so thatPN will be in this case the longitudinal aberration.
                    The convex lens in fig. 48 is in the position which gives the least spherical
                    aberration, and the concave lens in fig. 49 is in the position which gives the
                    greatest aberration. Hence in order to make the aberrations equal, we must make
                    the focal distance of the convex glass much shorter than that of the concave
                    one, and if it is requisite to have the distance of the points F and N from the
                    convex and concave lenses the same as it is shewn in the figures, the object
                    must then be placed much nearer the convex lens. Hence the image of the near
                    object S is placed at the same distance from the convex lens in fig. 48, or the
                    virtual focus of the concave lens in fig. 49, where it is shewn as refracting
                    parallel or infinitely distant rays.</p>
                <p>WTιen the focal distance KN, therefore, for parallel rays is equal to the
                    distance TF for rays diverging from S, and when the aberration DF and PN are
                    equal, then if the two lenses are combined, as in fig. 50, parallel rays SH, RK
                    falling upon them, will be refracted to the focus S, without any spherical
                    aberration. For if we suppose all the rays from S, which the convexlens, fig∙48,
                    converges to D and F, to be returned back from these points to the lens, they
                    would be refracted accurately to S. But the parallel rays SH, RK, after
                    refraction by the concave lens, ng. 49, in the directions HX, KV, are exactly in
                    the same relative situation as the rays which we have supposed to be returned
                    directly back from F and D are in at their incidence on the convex lens. Hence
                    when these lenses are combined, as in fig. 50, parallel rays falling on the
                    concave lens, and after refraction incident upon the convex lens, will be
                    refracted accurately to S without any spherical aberration.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The difficulty of getting rid of the aberration of spherical surfaces, induced
                    opticians at a very early period to propose the construction of lenses that were
                    not spherical, and that had such forms as to be entirely free of spherical
                    aberration. As the marginal parts of spherical lenses refract the rays which
                    fall upon them too much, the spherical aberration would obviously be removed or
                    diminished, by giving the surface any curvature, in which the marginal parts
                    become <hi rend="italic">less convex.</hi> Now, this is the character of two
                    well known curves, viz. the ellipse and the hyperbola, which, as Descartes
                    discovered, may be employed in the formation of lenses in the following manner
                    :—</p>
                <p>If a lens LL, fig. 51, has the form ofameniscus in which the convex surface LAL
                    is part of a prolate spheroid formed bythe revolution of an ellipse, whose
                    greater axis AD is to its eccentricity or distance between its foci F, <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> as the index of refraction is to unity, and if the other
                    surface LαL is concave, and part of a sphere whose centre is F, the remoter
                    focus of the spheroid, then rays RB, RA, RB parallel to the axis RF of the
                    spheroid or the ellipse will be refracted by the convex spheroidal surface alone
                    to the remoter focus F, and as these rays fall perpendicularly upon the second
                    surface LαL, they will suffer no change whatever by its action, and continue
                    their progress to the focus F.</p>
                <p>The same property belongs to a <hi rend="italic">concave-convex ∖enAAh</hi> whose
                    anterior or concave surface is part of a prolate spheroid of the same dimensions
                    as for the meniscus, and having its convex side of any radius. In this case, all
                    rays R'ô, R'ó parallel to the axis and incident at <hi rend="italic">b, b,</hi>
                    will be made to diverge from the same virtual focus F, and will suffer no change
                    of direction in passing out of the second or convex surface, as they all fall
                    upon it perpendicularly.</p>
                <p>These truths may be proved by the most elementary principles of the conic
                    section, or by drawing a tangent <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> to the elliptical
                    surfaces at B, <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and determining the refracted rays by
                    the method already described.</p>
                <p>Upon the same principles a <hi rend="italic">plano-convex</hi> lens may be
                    constructed without spherical aberration, as shewn in fig. 52, provided its
                    posterior surface <hi rend="italic">LaL</hi> is part of a hyperboloid formed by
                    the revolution of a hyperbola <hi rend="italic">LaL,</hi> whose greater axis is
                    to the distance between the foci as the index of refraction is to unity.

                <p>The following elegant method of determining the figure of a refracting surface
                    which shall refract marginal and central rays to the same focus is due to
                    Huygens. Let R be the focus of di verging rays, and F the focus to which it is
                    required to refract them with accuracy. Take any point A as the vertex of the
                    refracting surface required; the surface must be such thattheincidentand
                    refracted rays RB, BF have such a ratio to each other, that the excess of RB
                    above RA shall be to that of FA above FB, as the index of refraction is to
                    unity. In order to find the curve BAB which possesses this property, take in the
                    axis RF any point D, and let DA be divided at the point C in such a manner that
                    AC is to AD as unity is to the index of refraction, and from R and F as centres,
                    describe the arches of circles BDB', BCB', with the radii RD, FC, their points
                    of intersection B, B' will be in the required curve. In like manner, any other
                    points in the curve may be found, and in order to convert it into a lens, we
                    have only to describe a spherical surface <hi rend="italic">LaL,</hi> round the
                    focus F as a centre, so that the refracted rays BF, B'F may suffer no change by
                    passing through it perpendicularly. The curve BAB gradually approaches to an
                    ellipsoid as the radiant point R becomes more distant from the lens, and when it
                    is infinitely distant, the curve is the section of an ellipsoid, whose further
                    focus is in F.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>Various attempts have been made to execute lenses of other forms than spherical,

                    succeeded to a certain degree in his experiments, yet the art has never been

                <p>It has already been stated under <hi rend="italic">Catoptrics</hi> in this
                    article, that in all reflexions from spherical surfaces it is only for the ray
                    near the axis that the rules for finding their foci are correct, those which
                    fall farther and farther from the axis having their foci nearer the reflecting
                    surface. Hence all the images which are formed by spherical surfaces are
                    indistinct from spherical aberration, like those formed by lenses, with this
                    difference, that the images are notconfused with the different colours which
                    always accompany the refraction of lenses.</p>
                <p>If MN, fig. 54, is a concave mirror, by which parallel rays RR are reflected from

                    reflecting surface. This case takes place when the radiant point is situated
                    between the surface and the principal focus on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >concave</hi> side of the mirror, in which case the focus of marginal rays is
                    <hi rend="italic">farther from</hi> the mirror than that of central rays.</p>
                <p>There are only <hi rend="italic">two</hi> cases in which spherical reflecting
                    surfaces have <hi rend="italic">no</hi> spherical aberration, namely, when
                    diverging rays radiate from the centre of a concave mirror or spherical surface,
                    in which case they are reflected back without aberration to the point from which
                    they came, without any aberration, and when they converge to the centre of a
                    convex mirror or spherical surface, in which case they will be reflected back in
                    lines diverging from the centre or virtual focus behind it without any
                    aberration.</p>
                <p>One of these cases, namely, the first, is not an ideal one, but is actually
                    applicable to practical purposes. For example, if rays diverging from F the
                    centre of curvature, (not the focus) of the reflecting mirror MN, fall upon the
                    mirror, they will be reflected to F, and pass through F towards a lens LL, which
                    will refract them into a parallel beam</p>
                <p>LLRR; if FL is the focal length of the lens, or into a converging beam, so as to
                    illuminate strongly any near object, if FL is greater than the focal length of
                    the lens. This contrivance has been proposed for light-house illumination,
                    where, in addition to the beam FLL radiating directly from F the lens LL,
                    receives also the other beam FMN, both of which it unites in one parallel beam
                    LLRR. In the accurate illumination of objects for the microscope, this
                    contrivance is also applicable; and hence for this purpose a <hi rend="italic"
                    >spherical</hi> mirror is better than a mirror of any other form.</p>
                <p>As we cannot in the case of reflectors diminish their spherical aberration as we
                    did in lenses, by giving a different shape to the two surfaces, it becomes of
                    great importance to form the reflecting surface in such a manner as to remove
                    the spherical aberration altogether. It is evident from the inspection of fig.
                    54, where CB is a perpendicular to the mirror at B, RMC the angle of incidence,
                    and CBF the angle of reflexion, that if the reflecting surface should be such
                    that the line BF drawn to a fixed point, F should always form equal angles with
                    a line CB perpendicular to the mirror at the point of incidence, the parallel
                    rays would all converge to the point F. Now the <hi rend="italic">parabola</hi>
                    is a curve which possesses this property as shewn in fig. 56. Let AEB be a
                    parabola which form a reflecting surface by its revolution round its axis RFE,
                    and let R, R, R be parallel rays incident upon the paraboloidal surface at the
                    points A, E, B. Then if F is the focus of the parabola, and GH a line touching
                    the curve at A, it is a property of the parabola,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="smallcaps">Conic Sections,</hi>

                    HAF, but GAR is the complement of the angle of incidence, and therefore HAF will
                    be the complement of the angle of reflexion, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194562065" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2065-0400"/>consequently AF the reflected
                    ray. As this is true for every ray parallel to the axis RFE, it follows that all
                    parallel rays incident upon the surface of a paraboloidal mirror will be
                    reflected accurately to the focus of the paraboloid.</p>
                <p>It may be shewn, in like manner, that <hi rend="italic">convex paraboloidal
                    reflectors</hi> will reflect parallel rays, so as to make them diverge from the
                    virtual focus of the paraboloid. If, in fig. 56, we continue the line RA to R,
                    and also FA to rC, it follows, from the above reasoning, that R'AH is equal to
                    rαC, and that the reflected ray is Ar, diverging accurately from the focus
                    F.</p>
                <p>When we wish to reflect diverging rays to a focus, without aberration, we must
                    have recourse to another solid of revolution, namely, a prolate spheroidal
                    surface formed by the revolution of an ellipse round its greater axis. In this
                    case, rays diverging from one of its foci will be reflected accurately, without
                    aberration, to the focus F. This will be understood from fig. 57, where R, F are
                    the foci of an ellipsoid, AEB a section of the ellipsoidal surface, and GH a
                    line touching the ellipse at A; then if rays diverging from one of its foci R,
                    fall upon the reflecting surface at A, E, and B, they will be reflected
                    accurately to the focus F, or if they radiate from F, they will be reflected to
                    R. As it is a property of the ellipse,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="smallcaps">Conic Sections, voL</hi> vii. p.

                    equal to HAF, then since GAR is the complement of the angle of incidence, HAF
                    must be the complement of the angle of reflection, and AE the reflected ray. As
                    the same is true of every other point of the ellipsoidal surface, it follows
                    that all rays incident upon it from one focus, will be converged without
                    aberration to the other focus.</p>
                <p>In like manner, it may be shewn, by producing RA to R', and RB to R', that rays
                    falling upon a <hi rend="italic">convex ellipsoidal mirror,</hi> and converging
                    to one focus, will be reflected as if they diverged accurately from the other
                    focus. That is, rays R'AR, R'BR, converging to R, will be reflected in diverging
                    directions Ar, Br, as if they diverged from the focus F, or rays rA, τ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> B converging to F, will be reflected in directions
                    AR', BR', as if they diverged from R as their virtual focus.</p>
                <p>If the concave surface of a mirror is a portion of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >hyperboloid,</hi> a solid generated by the revolution of a hyperbola about its
                    axis, rays converging to one focus will be reflected to the other focus. Let AEB
                    be a section of the hyperboloid, and RAR, RBR ’, rays converging to its focus;
                    these rays will be reflected to its other focus F. Let GH be a tangent to the
                    hyperbola at A, then by a well-known property of the hyperbola,<note

                    to the angle of incidence, and the latter the complement to the angle of
                    reflection, AF will be the reflected ray. For the same reason, if the rays <hi
                    rend="italic">diverge from</hi> the focus F, they will, after reflexion, diverge
                    in the directions AR, BR, as if they came from the other focus R'.</p>
                <p>In a similar manner, it may be shewn, that in a <hi rend="italic">convex
                    hyperboloidal mirror</hi> AEB, rays diverging from one focus R', will be
                    reflected in directions Ar, <hi rend="italic">Br,</hi> as if they diverged from
                    the other focus F.</p>
                <p>The preceding truths are of great practical use in the construction of optical
                    instruments. In all reflecting telescopes, where parallel rays are required to
                    be reflected to a single focus, it is necessary that the figure of the
                    reflecting surface should be that of a paraboloid; and as in the specula of such
                    telescopes the portion of the paraboloid which is requisite, does not differ
                    much from the same portion ofasphe-rical surface that has the same focal length,
                    artists have contrived particular methods by which the marginal parts of the
                    spherical surface shall be worn down in the act of polishing, so as to convert
                    the spherical into a paraboloidal surface.</p>
                <p>In the reflectors of light-houses, where a large surface is required to be used,
                    a copper plate thickly plated with silver is hammered by means of a gauge to as
                    correct a paraboloidal figure as possible, and a lamp being placed in its focus,
                    the light which it radiates is reflected in a beam of considerable
                    brilliancy.</p>
                <p>In the construction of reflecting microscopes, where the image of a small object

                    succeeded in giving to such small specula an accurate ellipsoidal form. Mr.

                <p>When two or more rays of light cross one another at any point, they illuminate
                    any reflecting substance placed in that point with their united light. Hence it
                    follows, that when spherical surfaces converge the rays which fall upon them to
                    different foci, these different foci must form so many illuminated points, if
                    they are received on smoke, on white paper, or on water with any reflecting
                    particles suspended in it. The lines which pass through these luminous foci, or
                    rather the lines formed by the union of a great number of them, are called <hi
                    rend="italic">caustics,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">caustic curves.</hi> As these
                    curves are in reality a visible representation of the phenomena of spherical
                    aberration, they possess considerable interest, as experimental illustrations of
                    that class of facts.</p>
                <p>When diverging rays fall upon a spherical mirror, whose surface exceeds a
                    hemisphere, the caustics formed by reflexion are exceedingly beautiful. Let ACB
                    be the section of such a spherical surface, whose centre is C, and whose
                    principal focus for parallel and central rays is at <hi rend="italic">f</hi> Let
                    a beam of light RAC, diverging from R, be incident on the upper part AC of this

                    RIO; and let the reflected rays 1, 1; 2, 2; 3, 3, &amp;c., be found by making
                    the angle of reflexion which they form with the perpendiculars <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194562078" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2078-0401"/>drawn from 1, <hi

                    angles of incidence which they form with the same perpendiculars. We shall then
                    have the directions, and also the foci and intersections of all the rays. The
                    ray 10,10 does not meet the axis RC at all, but falling on the mirror at the
                    point 3, will there suffer a second reflexion. The ray 9, 9 has its focus
                    exactly at C, the vertex of the mirror, where it will suffer a second reflexion,
                    and so on with all the rest, up to 14, which is the last which will suffer a
                    second reflexion. All the reflected rays, after 9, 9, cross the axis, or have
                    their foci at points gradually approaching to <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> which is
                    the focus of the central ray Rl. As all the rays proceeding from R, but not
                    drawn in the figure, which fall upon the other half CB of the mirror, at points
                    corresponding to Rl, R2, &amp;c., will have their foci in the same points
                    between C and <hi rend="italic">f</hi> there will be along that line a series of
                    foci constituting a line of light becoming more intense towards <hi
                    rend="italic">f.</hi></p>
                <p>But the rays R10, R9, R8, cross each other after reflexion, and before they reach
                    the axis, as shewn in the figure, and hence there will be a beautiful curve of
                    light <hi rend="italic">Af,</hi> called a <hi rend="italic">caustic,</hi> formed
                    by the intersection of these rays. The other half of the mirror CB will form a
                    similar caustic, and the projecting points <hi rend="italic">f</hi> are called
                    the <hi rend="italic">cusps</hi> of these caustics, and C∕their tangent.</p>
                <p>If a small pencil of light, consisting of two contiguous rays,moves from RA
                    towards the position RB, being incident successively at 9, 8, 7, 6, &amp;c., the
                    conjugate focus of this pencil, or that formed by the intersection of the two
                    rays of which it consists, will move along the caustic curve <hi rend="italic"
                    >Af,</hi> while the points where it crosses the axis RC, or its focus formed by
                    its union with a similar pencil similarly incident on the other half of the
                    mirror, will advance from C to <hi rend="italic">f</hi></p>
                <p>If we now consider ACB as a <hi rend="italic">convex</hi> spherical surface, and
                    place the radiant point R as far to the right of the vertex C as it is to the
                    left of it in the figure, and if we project the reflected rays, we shall find
                    that when traced backwards, they will intersect the <hi rend="italic">axis</hi>
                    and each other, in the very same manner as they do in the figure, forming an <hi
                    rend="italic">imaginary</hi> or <hi rend="italic">virtual</hi> caustic, in place
                    of a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> one, the two being in every respect the
                    same.</p>
                <p>If, while the radiant point R remains as in the figure, we suppose the convex
                    surface ASB to receive the incident rays, it will then be found, by projecting
                    the reflected rays, that they will form an imaginary caustic A&lt;pB, less than
                    A/B, and joining it at the points A, B. This difference in size arises from the
                    radiant point being in this case much nearer the convex surface than before.</p>
                <p>Let us now suppose that the radiant point R recedes from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >concave</hi> mirror ACB, the point <hi rend="italic">f</hi> of the <hi
                    rend="italic">cusps</hi> will gradually approach to F, the tangent <hi
                    rend="italic">Cf</hi> diminishing at the same time; and when R is infinitely
                    distant, or the rays parallel, the point <hi rend="italic">f</hi> will coincide
                    with F, the focus of parallel rays. The same will take place in the case of the
                    <hi rend="italic">convex</hi> mirror ACB; but in the case of the convex mirror
                    ASB, the point <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> of the cusps will approach to F', and
                    will coincide with it when R is infinitely distant.</p>
                <p>If, in the case of the <hi rend="italic">concave mirror</hi> ACB, the radiant
                    point R now approaches to the mirror, the cusps <hi rend="italic">f</hi> will
                    approach to the centre E of the mirror, the <hi rend="italic">caustic</hi> curve
                    <hi rend="italic">Af</hi> becoming flatter and flatter, and when R reaches C,
                    there will be no caustic at all, in consequence of all the rays being reflected
                    back to the centre, all their <hi rend="italic">foci</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >intersections</hi> having united in that point.</p>
                <p>In the case of the <hi rend="italic">imaginary</hi> caustic A&lt;pB, when R
                    approaches to S, &lt;p will also approach to S, the caustic approximating in
                    form to the circular arch AS; and when R</p>
                <p>reaches S, &lt;p will also reach S, the caustic disappearing when it has reached
                    that limiting form.</p>
                <p>All that we have said is obviously applicable only to one section of the
                    spherical mirror; but as the same is true of every section whatever, the caustic
                    will not be a curve, but a surface formed by the revolution of the curves A∕B
                    round its axis <hi rend="italic">fC,</hi> all the reflected rays being tangents
                    to this surface.</p>
                <p>We shall now consider the change in the appearance of the caustic, when the
                    radiant point comes within the sphere of which the reflecting surface is a part,
                    and when the mirror becomes a concave polished sphere. The effect thus produced
                    is shewn in fig. 60, RE being less than RS'. In this case a remarkable double
                    caustic will be formed, com posed of a short one of the kind shewn in fig. 59,
                    and another with two long branches, one of which is shewn at 1,2, 3, 4, 5, the
                    dotted line below the axis SE shewing the other halves of the caustic, the long
                    branches converging behind the mirror. Had R been placed nearer S than E, the
                    branches 1,2, 3, &amp;c., would have diverged behind the mirror, having their
                    virtual foci within the mirror. When R is half-way between S and E, the curved
                    branches become parallel lines. when R comes nearer E the branches 1, 2, 3,
                    &amp;c., shorten; the smaller caustics also shorten; they both approach to the
                    centre E, the long branches moving quickest till at E, as we have already seen,
                    all the rays from R are reflected back to the same point, and the caustics all
                    disappear.</p>

                    fixed circle concentric with that of the mirror, and having a radius equal to
                    half of its own. Dr. Smith has shewn that when the radiant point is at S, the
                    caustic is an epicycloid, whose generating circle is two-thirds of the radius of
                    the mirror, and the fixed circle one-third of that radius.<note anchored="true"

                <p>When the radiant point passes the centre E, the caustics shift their place to the
                    opposite side of E, and present the same phenomena as before.</p>
                <p>There is a curious property, however, involved in these phenomena, which we have
                    represented in fig. 61, where the radiant point is supposed to be at F, a very
                    little within the principal focusof a spherical mirror ACB. We have supposed the
                    rays to diverge from a point <hi rend="italic">a little</hi> within the
                    principal focus, because it is only in this case that the rays F 1, F 1, at <hi
                    rend="italic">α little</hi> distance from the axis, maybe reflected in
                    directions 1,1,1,1, exactly parallel. The rays F 2, F 2, falling at a greater
                    distance from the axis, will be made to converge to a focus at <hi rend="italic"
                    >f2,</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:194562091" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2091-0402"/>and
                    rays F 3, F 3, to a focus <hi rend="italic">f</hi> 3, still nearer the mirror.
                    If we now conceive rays flowing from F to fall on the mirror between the rays F
                    1, F1, and the axis FC, these rays will diverge, because they radiate from a
                    point a little within the principal focus, and hence we have one spherical
                    mirror which has, under these circumstances, the paradoxical property of
                    rendering a faint cone of diverging rays parallel, converging, and diverging,
                    after reflexion.</p>
                <p>All that we have said of the caustics formed by the sec- • tions of spherical
                    surfaces, are true of cylindrical surfaces, and by means of surfaces of this
                    kind, the phenomena of caustic curves may be beautifully exhibited. They are
                    indeed often presented to the eye at the bottom of china vessels of a
                    cylindrical form, when exposed to the rays of the sun or to the light of a
                    candle. Owing to the depths of such vessels, the obliquity of the rays prevents
                    the effect from being well seen, but we may take shallow cylindrical vessels, or
                    make deep ones shallow by an artificial bottom of paper or pasteboard, or by
                    filling them nearly with milk, or any other fluid with a white opacity, or with
                    a fine white powder pressed into a smooth surface. In order to shew the
                    caustics, when the radiant point is placed within the cylindrical surface, a
                    piece of card should be made to float upon oil in the cylindrical vessel, and a
                    very minute wick inserted in the card at the points of the axis where we wish
                    the radiant point to be placed. This wick, when lighted, will be the radiant
                    point R in fig. 60, and the caustics will be beautifully formed on the surface
                    of the white card.</p>
                <p>The following method, however, of exhibiting caustic curves, we have found very
                    convenient and instructive, and it has the advantage of allowing the radiant
                    point to come within the cylinder. A piece of steel-spring highly polished, such
                    as a watch-spring, is bent into a concave form, like AB, fig. 62, and is placed
                    vertically with it§ lower edge resting upon a piece of card or white paper. It
                    is then exposed to the solar rays, or those of any artificial light, so that the
                    plane of the card MN passes through the luminous body, and the caustic curves
                    will be seen finely displayed, varying with the distance of the radiant point,
                    and with the reflecting arch AB. By altering too the curvature of the arch and
                    bending it into different known curves, either by applying a portion of its
                    breadth to the required curves delineated upon a piece of wood, and either cut
                    or burned sufficiently deep in the wood to allow the edge of the thin strip of
                    metal to be inserted in it, a great variety of interesting phenomena may be
                    observed. The brightest reflector is a thin strip of polished silver or plated
                    copper. Gold and silver foil will also answer, or a strip of mica. A cylindrical
                    section of a wide glass tube or a bottle, especially if a piece is cut out of
                    them to allow the incident rays to pass to the reflecting surface in the plane
                    nearly of the base of the cylinder, will produce the caustic curves in great
                    perfection. The caustic curves produced by a highly gilt or polished metallic
                    ring, such as the ring of a bell handle, are exceedingly beautiful, the
                    phenomena of a convex and a concave surface being here united.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Caustics formed by Refracting Surfaces.</hi></p>
                <p>It is evident, from what has been said of caustics formed by reflexion or <hi
                    rend="italic">Catacaustics,</hi> that analogous curves must also be formed by
                    spherical refracting surfaces, which has been called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diacaustics.</hi> In order to explain these curves, we shall take the case of
                    diverging rays falling upon a spherical surface, as shewn in fig. 63. where DBDF
                    is the spherical surface, C its centre, R the radiant point, RD, RD two extreme
                    rays touching the sphere, and refracted in the directions D/; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Df,</hi> and RB, RB other rays nearer the axis, and refracted in the directions
                    BF, BF. If we join CD, CD, and drawing the semicircles DEC, DEC make the lines
                    DE, CE' in the same proportion to CD as unity is to the index of refraction, the
                    caustic will begin at EE' and extending in the directions E, F', F will approach
                    to the axis RC till it meets it at the principal focus F.</p>
                <p>The caustics formed by the two refractions of a sphere, or of a cylinder (in a
                    plane perpendicular to its axis) are shewn in fig. 64, where ACB is the
                    spherical section, E its centre, R the radiant point, and RC the ray which
                    touches the spherical surface. This ray will be refracted by the first surface
                    in the direction 6,6, and by the second surface of the sphere at 6, the other
                    rays R5, R4, &amp;c. will be all refracted in the directions indicated by the
                    numerals 5, 4, &amp;c. and their various intersections will form the caustic 6,
                    4, 3, 2, <hi rend="italic">∖,f</hi> each ray crossing the next ray before it
                    cuts the axis,/* being the focus or the point where the rays nearest the axis
                    cut it. The luminous figure bounded by the intersection of the successive rays,
                    is composed of the two bright caustic curves. Within these caustics there is
                    also much light arising from the intersections between the caustics and the
                    axis; but as there are no intersections without the caustics they are bounded by
                    absolute darkness.</p>
                <p>When parallel rays fall upon the spherical section ACB, the caustic commences at
                    the extremity of a diameter perpendicular to the axis of the section, because
                    the extreme ray suffers refraction at that point, and will intersect the nearest
                    a little within it, and they extend, as in fig. 64, to the principal focus of
                    the sphere for rays near the axis. The real caustic will be the surface formed
                    by the revolution of the curves round the axis <hi rend="italic">Εf,</hi> the
                    section of this curve will be a luminous point at <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> but
                    at the posterior surface it will be a luminous circle vividly depicted on the
                    sphere. Μ. Delarive has pointed out a method of determining the index of
                    refraction of solid spheres, or of hollow spheres containing different fluids,
                    by measuring the diameter of this luminous circle, which is smaller in fluids of
                    high than in those of low refractive power. The phenomena of caustics formed by
                    refraction, may be distinctly exhibited by exposing to the rays of die sun, or a
                    strong artificial light, a globe of glass filled with any fluid, or a solid
                    transparent sphere, or the widest part of a round glass decanter. With all these
                    bodies the whole of the luminous figure will be clearly seen. If we use a
                    cylinder full of w,a <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562104"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-2104-0403"/>ter, such as a tumbler or a cylindrical bottle, we
                    shall see the caustic curves formed upon a white surface held parallel to the
                    surface of the fluid, the light falling upon the cylindrical surface in the same
                    plane.</p>
                <p>PART II. ON THE REFRACTION OF COMPOUND TIGHT, OR THE DOCTRINE OF COLOURS AND THE
                    PRISMATIC SPECTRUM.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> the preceding pages we have considered white light,
                    whether emanating directly from the sun or from artificial flames, or consisting
                    of the same rays reflected and modified by other bodies, <hi rend="italic">as α
                    simple element</hi> all the particles of which had the same index of refraction,
                    or suffered the same change of direction when refracted by any transparent body.
                    This, however, is not the nature of light. White light as emitted by the sun or
                    other luminous bodies, is a very <hi rend="italic">compound element,</hi> all
                    the parts of which possess very different properties, and these properties are
                    of a very remarkable and interesting kind. The power which causes the reflexion
                    of light from polished metallic bodies is not capable of decomposing it, unless
                    when it enters the substance of the metal; but the power which produces
                    refraction is peculiarly influential in separating compound white light into its
                    elements. The same decomposition may be effected by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >interference oî</hi> rays of light by <hi rend="italic">absorption,</hi> and by
                    another principle of analysis, which has been called <hi rend="italic"
                    >dissectum.</hi> The two first of these processes of analysis decompose compound
                    light of different degrees of refrangibility; while the two last decompose
                    compound light whose rays have the same refrangibility.</p>

                    light, and the different refrangibility of its rays.</hi></p>
                <p>The constituent parts or colours which compose white light, are seven in number,
                    <hi rend="italic">red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">violet.</hi> These colours have been long observed and studied in
                    the rainbow, and in the refractions produced by lenses and prisms, but till the
                    time of Sir Isaac Newton, no satisfactory explanation had been given of their
                    origin and properties. Descartes had found that colours similar to those of the
                    rainbow were produced by prisms, and he endeavoured to explain them by saying,
                    that the particles of the medium, or matter which transmits light, endeavour to
                    revolve with so great force, that they cannot move in a straight line, whence
                    comes refraction; and that those particles which endeavour to revolve more
                    strongly produce a <hi rend="italic">red</hi> colour, those that endeavour to
                    move a little more strongly, produce <hi rend="italic">yelloιν,</hi> and so on
                    with the other colours. Now this explanation, as Mr. Whewell<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Hist, of
                    Inductive Sciences,</hi> vol. ii. p. 350.</p></note> has justly remarked, though
                    it contains a gratuitous hypothesis respecting the cause of refraction, yet it
                    proves that Descartes considered the different colours as produced by different
                    decrees of refraction. In like manner Grimaldi, as the same mthor has observed,
                    explains colours by saying, “that he colour is brighter where the light is
                    dense; and the ight is denser on the side from which the refraction turns he
                    ray, because the <hi rend="italic">increments of refraction</hi> are greater han
                    the rays that are more inclined;"<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Id. Id. p. 352.</p></note> that is, that the blue ays are
                    more refracted than the red rays. We cannot agree, ιowever, with Mr. Whewell in
                    the opinion, that this expla-ιation of Grimaldi’s might give an explanation of
                    most of he facts, but one much more erroneous than a develop-ðent of Descartes’s
                    views would have been.” It appears α us quite manifest, that both Descartes and
                    Grimaldi had . vague sentiment that the different colours were produced y
                    different degrees of refraction, and that Grimaldi’s is the lost distinctly
                    expressed of the two; but we cannot for a moment agree with the author above
                    quoted, “that Descartes was led very near the same point with Newton.” The
                    sentiments expressed by Descartes and Grimaldi, were mere notions of the moment,
                    which authors often throw out without much thought, and which are employed in
                    future times to pervert the history of science. If these two authors really
                    thought that colours were produced by different degrees of refraction, why did
                    they not, as they did other opinions, submit them to the test of an experiment,
                    which required neither thought nor labour, and the means of making which were in
                    their hands. Sir Isaac Newton was well acquainted with the writings of
                    Descartes, and so much with Descartes’s <hi rend="italic">notions</hi> about
                    colours, that the examination of them was the object which he had in view in
                    purchasing his prisms. He never refers to them as anticipatory of his own
                    discoveries, and we must therefore continue to give Sir Isaac the <hi
                    rend="italic">undivided</hi> merit of the discovery of the unequal
                    refrangibility of light, as well as its experimental establishment.</p>
                <p>We shall now proceed to give our readers some account of this great discovery,
                    and we shall make no apology in doing this in Sir Isaac Newton’s own words,
                    abridging his descriptions where they are redundant, or have become unnecessary.
                    We are induced to do this also, because they exhibit the finest model of
                    experimental research, and should be studied by every person who is desirous of
                    investigating truth with diligence and patience.</p>

                    and refrangibility.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In a very dark chamber, at a
                    round hole F, fig. 65, about one-third of an inch broad, made in the shutter of
                    a window, I placed a glass prism ABC, whereby the beam of the sun’s light, SF,
                    which came in at that hole, might be refracted upwards, toward the opposite wall
                    of the chamber, and there form a coloured image of the sun, represented at PT.
                    The axis of the prism, was, in this and the following experiments, perpendicular
                    to the incident rays. About this axis I turned the prism slowly, and saw the
                    refracted or coloured image of the sun, first to descend, and then to ascend.
                    Between the descent and ascent, when the image seemed stationary, I stopped the
                    prism, and fixed it in that posture, for in that posture the refractions of the
                    light at the two sides of the refracting angles, that is, at the entrance of the
                    rays into the prism, and at their going out of it, are equal to one another.</p>
                <p>Then I let the refracted light fall perpendicularly upon a sheet of white paper,
                    MN, placed at the opposite wall of the chamber, and observed the figure and
                    dimensions of the solar image, PT, formed on the paper by that light. This image
                    was oblong, and not oval, but terminated by two rectilinear and parallel sides,
                    and two semicircular ends. On its side it was bounded pretty distinctly; but on
                    its ends very indistinctly, the light there vanishing by degrees. At <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194562117" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2117-0404"/> the distance of
                    18½ feet from the prism the breadth of the image was about 2⅛ inches, but its
                    length was about 10f inches, and the length of its rectilinear sides about 8
                    inches; and ACB, the refracting angle <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the prism, by
                    which so great a length was made, was 64 degrees. With a less angle the length
                    of the image was less, the breadth remaining the same. It is also to be
                    observed, that the rays went on in straight lines from the prism to the image,
                    and therefore at their going out of the prism had all that inclination to one
                    another from which the length of the image proceeded. This image PT was
                    coloured, and the more eminent colours lay in this order from the bottom at T to
                    the top at P; <hi rend="italic">red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">violet</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> together with all
                    their intermediate degrees in a continual succession perpetually varying.”</p>
                <p>Hence “the light of the sun consists of a mixture of several sorts of coloured
                    rays, some of which at equal incidences are more refracted than others, and
                    therefore are called <hi rend="italic">more refrangible.</hi> The red at T,
                    being nearest to the place Y, where the rays of the sun would go directly if the
                    prism was taken away, is the least refracted of all the rays; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >violet,</hi> are continually more and more refracted, as they are more and more
                    diverted from the course of the direct light. For, when the prism is fixed in
                    the posture above mentioned, so that the place of the image shall be the lowest
                    possible, the figure of the image ought to be round, like the spot at Y, if all
                    the rays that tended to it were equally refracted. Therefore, since it is found
                    that this image is not round, but about five times longer than it is broad, it
                    follows, that all the rays are not equally refracted. This conclusion is farther
                    confirmed by the following experiments.</p>
                <p>In the sunbeam SF, fig. 66, which was propagated into the room through the hole F
                    in the window-shutter EG, at the distance of some feet from the hole, I held the
                    prism ABC in such a posture, that its axis might be perpendicular to that beam:
                    then I looked through the prism upon the hole F, and turning the prism to and
                    fro about its axis to make the image <hi rend="italic">pt</hi> of the hole
                    ascend and descend, when between its two contrary motions it seemed stationary,
                    I stopped the prism; in this situation of the prism, viewing through it the said
                    hole F, I observed the length of its refracted image <hi rend="italic">pt</hi>
                    to be many times greater than its breadth; and that the <hi rend="italic">most
                    refracted</hi> part thereof appeared <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> at <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the <hi rend="italic">least
                    refracted</hi> appeared <hi rend="italic">red</hi> at <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">middle</hi> parts <hi
                    rend="italic">indigo, blue, green, yellow,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >orange,</hi> in order. The same thing happened when I removed the prism out of
                    the sun’s light, and looked through it upon the hole shining by the light of the
                    clouds beyond it. And yet if the refractions of all the rays were equal
                    according to one certain proportion of the sines of incidence and refraction, as
                    is commonly supposed, the refracted image ought to have appeared round. So then
                    by these two experiments, it appears that in equal incidences there is a
                    considerable inequality of refractions.”</p>
                <p>Having discovered this fundamental property of light, he contrived the following
                    experiment to prove it by ocular demonstration.</p>
                <p>“In the middle of two thin boards DE, <hi rend="italic">de,</hi> fig. 67,1 made a
                    round hole in each, at G and <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> a third part of an inch
                    in diameter; and in the window-shutter a much larger hole being made at F, to
                    let into my darkened chamber a large beam of the sun’s light, I placed a prism,
                    ABC, behind the shutter in that beam, to refract it towards the opposite wall;
                    and close behind this prism I fixed one of the boards DE, in such a manner that
                    the middle of the refracted light might pass through the hole made in it at G,
                    and the rest be intercepted by the board. Then, at the distance of about twelve
                    feet from the first board, I fixed the other board ⅛ so that the middle of the
                    refracted light, which came through, the hole in the first board, and fell upon
                    the opposite wall, might pass through the hole <hi rend="italic">g</hi> in this
                    other board <hi rend="italic">dx,</hi> and the rest being intercepted by the
                    board, might paint upon it the coloured spectrum of the sun. And close behind
                    this board I fixed another prism <hi rend="italic">abc,</hi> to refract the
                    light which came through the hole <hi rend="italic">g.</hi> Then I returned
                    speedily to the first prism ABC, and by turning it slowly to and fro about its
                    axis, I caused the image which fell upon the second board <hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi> to move up and down upon that board, that all its parts might pass
                    successively through the hole in that board, and fall upon the prism behind it.
                    And in the mean time I noted the places <hi rend="italic">M, N,</hi> on the
                    opposite wall, to which that light after its refraction in the second prism did
                    pass; and by the difference of the places at <hi rend="italic">M</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">N,</hi> I found that the light, which, being most refracted in the
                    first prism ABC, did go to the blue end of the image, was again more refracted
                    by the second prism <hi rend="italic">abc,</hi> than the light which went to the
                    red end of that image. For when the lower part of the light which fell upon the
                    second board <hi rend="italic">de,</hi> was cast through the hole <hi
                    rend="italic">g,</hi> it went to a lower place Μ on the wall; and when the
                    higher part of that light was cast through the same hole <hi rend="italic"
                    >g,</hi> it went to a higher place N on the wall; and when any intermediate part
                    of the light was cast through that hole, it went to some place in the wall
                    between Μ and N. The unchanged position of the holes in the boards made the
                    incidence of the rays upon the second prism to be the same in all cases. And yet
                    in that common incidence some of the rays were more refracted and others less;
                    and those were more refracted in this prism, which by a greater refraction in
                    the first prism were more turned out of their way; and therefore, for their
                    constancy of being more refracted, are deservedly called <hi rend="italic">more
                    refrangible”</hi></p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The light of the sky, or the light of the sun reflected,
                    from the first surface of bodies, and also the white flames of all combustibles,
                    whether direct or reflected, differ in colour and refrangibility, like the
                    direct light of the sun.</hi></p>
                <p>The truth stated in this proposition was established by Newton, by examining all
                    those lights with a prism when they were faint, or transmitting them through the
                    prism, as in section 1, when they were sufficiently intense.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The light of the sun consists of rays differing in re∙
                    flexibility</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">and those rays that
                    are more refrangible than others are also more r(flexible.</hi></p>
                <p>A prism ABC, fig. 68, whose two angles at its base BC were equal to one another
                    and half right ones, and the third <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562130"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-2130-0405"/>at A a right one, I placed in abeam FM of the
                    sun’s light, let into a dark chamber through a hole F, one-third part of an inch
                    broad; and turning the prism slowly about its axis until the light which went
                    through one of its angles ACB, and was refracted by it to G and H, began to be
                    reflected into the line MN by its base BC, at which till then it went out of the
                    glass;</p>
                <p>I observed that those rays as MH, which had suffered the greatest refraction,
                    were sooner reflected than the rest. To make it evident that the rays which
                    vanished at FI were reflected into the beam MN, I made this beam pass through
                    another prism VXY, and being refracted by it to fall afterwards upon a sheet of
                    white paper <hi rend="italic">pt</hi> placed at some distance behind it, and
                    there by that refraction to paint the usual colours at <hi rend="italic"
                    >pt.</hi> Then causing the first prism to be turned about its axis according to
                    the order of the letters ABC, I observed that when those rays MH, which in this
                    prism had suffered the greatest refraction, and appeared Wwe and <hi
                    rend="italic">violet,</hi> began to be totally reflected, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >blue</hi> and <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> light on the paper which was most
                    refracted in the second prism received a sensible increase at <hi rend="italic"
                    >p,</hi> above that of the red and yellow at <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">:</hi> and afterwards, when the rest of the light, which was <hi
                    rend="italic">green, yellow,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">red,</hi> began to be
                    totally reflected, and vanished at G, the light of those colours at <hi
                    rend="italic">t,</hi> on the paper <hi rend="italic">pt,</hi> received as great
                    an increase as the <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> and <hi rend="italic">blue</hi>
                    had received before. Which puts it past dispute, that those rays became first of
                    all totally reflected at the base BC, which before at equal incidences with the
                    rest upon the base BC had suffered the greatest refraction. I do not here take
                    any notice of any refractions made in the sides AC, AB, of the first prism,
                    because the light enters almost perpendicularly at the first side, and goes out
                    almost perpendicularly at the second; and therefore suffersnone, or so little,
                    that the angles of incidence at the baseBC are not sensibly altered by it;
                    especially if the angles of the prism at the base BC be each about 40°. For the
                    rays FM begin to be totally reflected when the angle CMF is about 50°, and
                    therefore they will dien make a right angle of 90° with AC.</p>
                <p>“It appears also from experiments, that the beam of light MN, reflected by the
                    base of the prism, being augmented first by die more refrangible rays, and
                    afterwards by the less refrangible, is composed of rays differently
                    refrangible.</p>
                <p>The light whose rays are all alike refrangible, I call <hi rend="italic">simple,
                    homogeneous</hi> and <hi rend="italic">similar</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    that whose rays are some more refrangible than others, I call <hi rend="italic"

                    I speak of light and rays as coloured or endowed with colours, I would be
                    understood to speak not philosophically. For the rays, to speak properly, are
                    not coloured, and in them there is nothing else than a certain power and
                    disposition to produce a sensation of this or that colour.”</p>

                    compound light.</hi></p>
                <p>“That the rays which are equally refrangible fall upon ι circle answering to the
                    sun’s apparent disk, will be proved by experiment by and by.</p>
                <p>Let AG, fig. 69, represent the circle which all the most refrangible rays,
                    propagated from the whole disk of the sun, will illuminate and paint upon the
                    opposite wall if they were alone; EL the circle, which all the least refrangible
                    rays would in like manner illuminate if they were alone; BH, CI, DK, the circles
                    which so many intermediate rays would paint upon the wall, if they were singly
                    propagated from the sun in successive order, the rest being intercepted; and
                    conceive that there are other circles without number, which innumerable other
                    intermediate sorts of rays would successively paint upon the wall, if the sun
                    should successively emit every sort apart. And seeing the sun emits all these
                    sorts at once, they must all together illuminate and paint innumerable equal
                    circles; of all which being, according to their degrees of refrangibility,
                    placed in order in a continual series, that oblong spectrum PT is composed,
                    which was described in the first experiment.</p>
                <p>Now, if these circles, whilst their centres keep their distances and positions,
                    could be made less in diameter, their interfering one with another, and
                    consequently the mixture of the heterogeneous rays, would be proportionably
                    diminished. Let the circles AG, BH, CI, &amp;c. remain as before; and let <hi
                    rend="italic">ag, bh, ci,</hi> &amp;c. be so many less circles lying in alike
                    continual series, between two parallel right lines <hi rend="italic">ae,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">gh,</hi> with-the same distance between their centres, and
                    illuminated with the same sorts of rays: that is, the circle <hi rend="italic"
                    >ag</hi> with the same sort by which the corresponding circle AG was
                    illuminated; and the rest of the circles <hi rend="italic">bh, ci, dk, el,</hi>
                    respectively with the same sorts of rays by which the corresponding circles BH,
                    CI, DK, EL, were illuminated. In the figure PT, composed of the great circles,
                    three of those, AG, BH, CI, are so expanded into each other, that three sorts of
                    rays, by which those circles are illuminated, together with innumerable other
                    sorts of intermediate rays, are mixed at OR in the middle of the circle BH. And
                    the like mixture happens throughout almost the whole length of the figure PT.
                    But in the figure <hi rend="italic">pt,</hi> composed of the less circles, the
                    three less circles <hi rend="italic">ag, bh, ci,</hi> which answer to those
                    three greater, do not extend to one another; nor are there anywhere mingled so
                    much as any two of the three sorts of rays by which those circles are
                    illuminated, and which in the figure PT are all of them intermingled at QR. So
                    then, if we would diminish the mixture of the rays, we are to diminish the
                    diameters of the circles. Now these would be diminished if the sun’s diameter,
                    to which they answer, could be made less than it is, or (which comes to the same
                    purpose) if without doors, at great distance from the prism towards the sun,
                    some opaque body were placed with a round hole in the middle of it to intercept
                    all the sun’s light, except so much as coming from the middle of his body could
                    pass through that hole to the prism. For so the circles AG, BH, and the rest,
                    would not any longer answer to the whole disk of the sun, but only to that part
                    of it which could be seen from the prism through that hole; that is, to the
                    apparent magnitude of that hole viewed from the prism. But that these circles
                    may answer more distinctly to that hole, a lens is to be placed by the prism to
                    cast the image of the hole (that is, every one of the circles AG, BH, &amp;c.)
                    distinctly upon the paper at PT; after such a manner, as by a lens placed at a
                    window the pictures of objects abroad arc cast distinctly upon a paper within
                    the room. If this be done, it will not be necessary to place that hole very far
                    off, no, not beyond the window. And therefore, instead of that hole, I used the
                    hole in the window-shutter as follows.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562143" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2143-0406"/>
                <p>In the sun’s light let into my darkened chamber through a small round hole, fig.
                    70, in my window-shutter, at about ten or twelve feet from the window, I placed
                    a lens MN, by which the image of the hole F might be distinctly cast upon a
                    sheet of white paper placed at I. Then immediately behind the lens I placed a
                    prism ABC, by which the tra-jected light might be refracted either upwards or
                    sidewise, and thereby the round image which the lens alone did cast upon the
                    paper at I, might be drawn out into a long one with parallel sides, as
                    represented at <hi rend="italic">pt.</hi> This oblong image I let fall upon
                    another at about the same distance from the prism as the image at I, moving the
                    paper either towards the prism or from it, until I found the just distance where
                    the rectilinear sides of the images <hi rend="italic">pt</hi> become most
                    distinct. For in this case the circular images of the hole, which compose that
                    image, after the manner that the circles <hi rend="italic">ag, bh, ci,</hi>
                    &amp;c. do the figure <hi rend="italic">pt,</hi> were terminated most
                    distinctly, and therefore extended into one another the least that they could,
                    and by consequence the mixture of the heterogeneous rays was now the least of
                    all. The circles <hi rend="italic">ag, blι, ci,</hi> &amp;c. which compose the
                    image <hi rend="italic">pt,</hi> are each equal to the circle at I; and
                    therefore, by diminishing the hole F, or by removing the lens farther from it,
                    may be diminished at pleasure, whilst their centres keep the same distances from
                    each other. Thus, by diminishing the breadth of the image <hi rend="italic"
                    >pt,</hi> the circles of heterogeneal rays that compose it may be separated from
                    each other as much as you please. Yet instead of the circular hole F, it is
                    better to substitute an hole shaped like a parallelogram, with its length
                    parallel to the length of the prism. For if this hole be an inch or two long,
                    and but a tenth or twentieth part of an inch broad, or narrower, the light of
                    the image <hi rend="italic">pt</hi> will be as simple as before, or simpler; and
                    the image being much broader, is therefore fitter to have experiments tried in
                    its light than before.”</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Homogeneal light is refracted regularly without any
                    dilatation, splitting or shattering of the rays</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">and the confused vision of objects seen through refracting bodies
                    by heterogeneous light, arises from the different ref rang ibility of several
                    sorts of rays.</hi></p>
                <p>In the middle of a black paper I made a round hole, about a fifth or a sixth part
                    of an inch in diameter. Upon this part I caused the spectrum of homogeneous
                    light, described in the former proposition, so to fall that some part of the
                    light might pass through the hole in the paper. This transmitted part of the
                    light I refracted with a prism placed behind the paper: and letting the
                    refracted light fall perpendicularly upon a white paper, two or three feet
                    distant from the prism, I found that the spectrum formed on the paper by this
                    light was not oblong, as when it is made in the first experiment, by refracting
                    the sun’s compound light, but was, so far as I could judge by my eye, perfectly
                    circular, the length being nowhere greater than the breadth; which shews that
                    this light is refracted regularly without any dilatation of the rays, and is an
                    ocular demonstration of the mathematical proposition mentioned above.</p>
                <p>In the homogeneous light I placed a paper circle of a quarter of an inch in
                    diameter; and in the sun’s unrefracted, heterogeneous, white light, I placed
                    another paper circle of the same bigness; and going from these papers to the
                    distance of some feet, I viewed both circles through a prism. The circle
                    illuminated by the sun’s heterogeneous light appeared very oblong, as in the
                    second experiment, the length being many times greater than the breadth. But the
                    other circle, illuminated with homogeneous light, appeared circular, and
                    distinctly defined, as when it is viewed by the naked eye; which proves the
                    whole proposition mentioned above.</p>
                <p>In the homogeneous light I placed flies and other minute objects, and viewing
                    them through a prism I saw their parts as distinctly defined as if I had viewed
                    them with the naked eye. The same objects placed in the sun’s unrefracted
                    heterogeneous light, which was white, I viewed also through a prism, and saw
                    them most confusedly defined, so that I could not distinguish their smaller
                    parts from one another. I placed also the letters of a small print one while in
                    the homogeneous light, and then in the heterogeneous; and viewing them through a
                    prism, they appeared in the latter case so confused and indistinct that I could
                    notread them; but in the former, they appeared so distinct that I could read
                    readily, and thought I saw them as distinct as when I viewed them with my naked
                    eye: in both cases, I viewed the same object through the same prism, at the same
                    distance from me, and in the same situation. There was no difference but in the
                    lights by which the objects were illuminated, and which in one case was simple,
                    in the other compound; and therefore the distinct vision in the former case, and
                    confused in the latter, could arise from nothing else than from that difference
                    in the lights. Which proves the whole proposition.</p>
                <p>In these three experiments, it is farther very remarkable, that the colour of
                    homogeneous light was never changed by the refraction. And as these colours were
                    not changed by refraction, so neither were they by reflexions. For all white,
                    grey, red, yellow, green, blue, violet bodies, as <hi rend="italic">paper,
                    ashes, red lead, orpiment, indigo, bice, gold, silver, copper, grass, blue
                    flowers, violets, bubbles of water tinged with various colours, peacock
                    feathers,</hi> the tincture of <hi rend="italic">lignum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nephriticum,</hi> and such like, in red homogeneous light appeared totally red,
                    in blue light totally blue, in green light totally green, and so of other
                    colours. In the homogeneous light of any colour they all appeared totally of
                    that same colour; with this only difference, that some of them reflected that
                    light more strongly, others mure faintly. I never yet found any body which by
                    reflecting homogeneous light could sensibly change its colour.</p>
                <p>From all which it is manifest, that if the sun’s light consisted of but one sort
                    of rays, there would be but one colour in the world, nor would it be possible to
                    produce any new colour by reflexions and refractions; and, by consequence, that
                    the variety of colours depends upon the composition of light.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Every homogeneous ray considered apart is refracted,
                    according to one and the same rule</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >so that its sine of incidence is to its sine of refraction in a given

                    coloured ray has a different ratio belonging to it.</hi></p>
                <p>Sir Isaac Newton has proved this by experiment; and in other experiments he has
                    determined by what numbers these given ratios are expressed. For instance, if an
                    heterogeneous white ray of the sun emerges out of glass into air; or, which is
                    the same thing, if rays of all colours be supposed to succeed one another in the
                    same line AC, fig. 71. and AD their common sine of incidence in glass be divided
                    into <hi rend="italic">fifty</hi> equal parts, then EF and GH, the sines of
                    refraction into air, of the least and most refrangible rays, will be 77 and 78
                    of such parts respectively.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562156" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2156-0407"/>
                <p>And since every colour has several degrees, the sines of refraction of all the
                    degrees of red will have all intermediate degrees of magnitude from 77 to 77⅛;
                    of all the degrees of orange from 77½ to 77g-; of yellow from 77½ to 77½; of
                    green from 77⅜ to 77½; of blue from 77⅛ to 77f; of indigo from 77∣ to 77; and of
                    violet from 77^ to 78.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Whiteness, and all grey colours between white andblack, may
                    be compounded of colours</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">and the
                    whiteness of the sun’s light is compounded of all the primary colours, mixed in
                    a due proportion.</hi></p>
                <p>“Let the spectrum or solar image PT, in fig. 72, fall upon the lens MN, above
                    four inches broad, and about six feet distant from the prism ABC, and so figured
                    that it may cause the coloured light which divergeth from the prism to converge
                    and meet again at its focus G, about six or eight feet distant from the lens,
                    and there to fall perpendicularly upon a white paper DE. And if you move this
                    paper to and fro, you will perceive that near the lens, as at <hi rend="italic"
                    >d e,</hi> the whole solar image (suppose at <hi rend="italic">p t)</hi> will
                    appear upon it intensely coloured after the manner above explained, and that by
                    receding from the lens those colours will perpetually come towards one another,
                    and by mixing more and more, dilute one another continually, until at length the
                    paper come to the focus G, where, by a perfect mixture, they will wholly vanish
                    and be converted into whiteness, the whole light appearing now upon the paper
                    like a little white circle. And afterwards by receding farther from the lens,
                    the rays which before converged will now cross one another in the focus G, and
                    diverge from thence, and thereby make the colours to appear again, but yet in a
                    contrary order; suppose at δ ∈, where the red <hi rend="italic">t</hi> is now
                    above which before was below, and the violet <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is below
                    which before was above.</p>
                <p>Let us now stop the paper at the focus G, where the light appears totally white
                    and circular, and let us consider its whiteness. I say, that this is composed of
                    the converging colours. For if any of those colours be intercepted it the lens,
                    the whiteness will cease and degenerate into hat colour which arises from the
                    composition of the other colours which are not intercepted. And then if the
                    intercepted colours be let pass and fall upon that compound colour, they mix
                    with it, and by their mixture restore the vhiteness. So if the violet, blue, and
                    green be intercepted, the remaining yellow, orange, and red, will compound ιpon
                    the paper, an orange, and then if the intercepted co-ours be let pass they wall
                    fall upon this compounded orange, nd together with it decompound a white. So
                    also if the ed and violet be intercepted, the remaining yellow, green, nd blue,
                    will compound a green upon the paper, and then he red and violet being let pass,
                    will fall upon this green, nd together with it decompound a white. And that in
                    his composition of white the several rays do not suffer ny change in their
                    colorific qualities by acting upon one nother, but are only mixed, and by a
                    mixture of their dours produce <hi rend="italic">white,</hi> may farther appear
                    by these argu-aents.</p>
                <p>If the paper be placed beyond the focus G, suppose at and then the <hi
                    rend="italic">red</hi> colour at the lens be alternately interred, and let pass
                    again, the <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> colour on the paper ill not suffer any
                    change thereby, as it ought to do if the I cveral sorts of rays acted upon one
                    another in the focus G where they cross. Neither will the <hi rend="italic"
                    >red</hi> upon the paper be changed by any alternate stopping, and letting pass
                    the <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> which crosseth it.</p>
                <p>And if the paper be placed at the focus G, and the white round image at G be
                    viewed through the prism at HIK, and by the refraction of that prism be
                    translated to the place <hi rend="italic">r v,</hi> and there appear tinged with
                    various colours, namely, the <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> at <hi rend="italic"
                    >v</hi> and <hi rend="italic">red</hi> at <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and others
                    between, and then the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> colour at the lens be often
                    stopped and let pass by turns, the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> at <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> will accordingly disappear and return as often, but the <hi
                    rend="italic">violet</hi> at <hi rend="italic">v</hi> will not thereby suffer
                    any change. And so by stopping and letting pass alternately the <hi
                    rend="italic">blue</hi> at the lens, the <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> at <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> will accordingly disappear and return, without any change
                    made in the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> at <hi rend="italic">r.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">red</hi> therefore depends on one sort of rays, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">blue</hi> on another sort, which in the focus G, where they are
                    commixed, do not act on one another. And there is the same reason of the other
                    colours.</p>
                <p>I considered farther, that when the <hi rend="italic">most</hi> refrangible rays
                    Pj9, and the <hi rend="italic">least</hi> refrangible ones, TV, are by
                    converging inclined to one another, the paper, if held very oblique to those
                    rays in the focus G, might reflect one sort of them more copiously than the
                    other sort, and by that means the reflected light would be tinged in that focus
                    with the colour of the predominant rays, provided those rays severally retained
                    their colours or colorific qualities in the composition of white made by them in
                    that focus. But if they did not retain them in that white, but became all of
                    them severally endued there with a disposition to strike the sense with the
                    perception of white, then they could never lose their whiteness by such
                    reflexions. I inclined therefore the paper to the rays very obliquely, as in the
                    second experiment of this book, that the most refrangible rays might be more
                    copiously reflected than the rest, and the whiteness at length changed
                    successively into blue, indigo, and violet. Then I inclined it the contrary way,
                    that the most refrangible rays might be more copious in the reflected light than
                    the rest, and the whiteness turned successively to yellow, orange, and red.</p>
                <p>Lastly, I made an instrument XY, in fashion of a comb, whose teeth were about an
                    inch and an half broad, and the intervals of the teeth about two inches wide.
                    Then by interposing successively the teeth of this instrument near the lens, I
                    intercepted part of the colours by the interposed tooth, whilst the rest of them
                    went on through the interval of the teeth to the paper DE, and there painted a
                    round solar image. But the paper I had first placed so, that the image might
                    appear white as often as the comb was taken away; and then the comb being, as
                    was said, interposed, that whiteness by reason of the intercepted part of the
                    colours at the lens did always change into the colour compounded of those
                    colours which were not intercepted, and that colour was by the motion of the
                    comb perpetually varied, so that in the passing of every tooth over the lens all
                    these colours, red, yellow, green, blue, and purple, did always succeed one
                    another. I caused therefore all the teeth to pass successively over the lens,
                    and when the motion was slow, there appeared a perpetual succession of the
                    colours upon the paper: But if I so much accelerated the motion, that the
                    colours by reason of their quick succession could not be distinguished from one
                    another, the appearance of the single colours ceased. There was no <hi

                    >green,</hi> no <hi rend="italic">blue,</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">purple,</hi>
                    to be seen any longer, but from a confusion of them all there arose one uniform
                    <hi rend="italic">white</hi> colour. Of the light which now by the mixture of
                    all the colours appeared <hi rend="italic">white,</hi> there was no part <hi
                    rend="italic">really white.</hi> One part was <hi rend="italic">red,</hi>
                    another <hi rend="italic">yellow,</hi> a third <hi rend="italic">green,</hi> a

                    every part retains its proper colour till it strike the sensorium. If the
                    impressions follow one another slowly, so that they may be severally perceived,
                    there is made a distinct sensation of all the co <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194562169" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2169-0408"/>lours, one after another, in
                    a continual succession. But if the impressions follow one another so quickly
                    that they cannot be severally perceived, there ariseth out of them all one
                    common sensation, which is neither of this colour alone nor of that alone, but
                    hath itself indifferently to them all, and this is a sensation of
                    whiteness.”</p>
                <p>Such is the account which Newton himself has given of the great discovery of the
                    different refrangibility of light.</p>
                <p>In examining the prismatic spectrum it is difficult to discover the terminations
                    or boundaries of the different colours. They pass into one another by insensible
                    shades, and if any person were to lay down their apparent limits by the nicest
                    observations, he would find, what has been very recently discovered, that these
                    limits vary with the state of the atmosphere, and with the altitude of the sun.
                    Sir Isaac Newton, however, did make the attempt, and the following are the
                    results which he obtained, we believe with crown or plate glass. We have added
                    the results obtained long afterwards by Dr. Wollaston<note anchored="true"

                <p>The influence of these discoveries on the progress <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    optical science was very remarkable. They led Sir Isaac to discover that the
                    cause of the imperfections of the refracting telescopes was the different
                    refrangibility of the rays of light. IfLL, for example, is a lens without
                    spherical aberration, upon which parallel rays R, R, R of white light are
                    incident, then it is obvious that the <hi rend="italic">violet,</hi> or most
                    refrangible rays will be most refracted in directions <hi rend="italic">Lv,
                    Lv,</hi> crossing the axis at <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> and there giving a <hi
                    rend="italic">violet</hi> focus of light. In like manner the <hi rend="italic"
                    >red,</hi> or the least refrangible rays, will be refracted in directions Lr,
                    <hi rend="italic">Lr,</hi> crossing the axis at <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and
                    there giving a <hi rend="italic">red</hi> focus of light. In like manner all the
                    other rays will have foci of their own colour between <hi rend="italic">v</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">r.</hi> If we draw the line <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi>
                    meeting the intersection of the extreme violet rays after their convergence with
                    the extreme red rays before their convergence, it will cut the axis at a point
                    <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> The line <hi rend="italic">vr,</hi> is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">longitudinal aberration of refrangibility,</hi> or the <hi
                    rend="italic">longitudinal chromatic aberration,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab</hi> is called the <hi rend="italic">lateral aberration of
                    refrangibility,</hi> or the diameter of the <hi rend="italic">circle of
                    diffusion,</hi> all the coloured rays being diffused over the circle, of which
                    <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> is the diameter. The space <hi rend="italic">v a r
                    b,</hi> is called the sphere of diffusion; and the section of it shewn in the
                    figure may be regarded as a parallelogram, on account of the smallness of the
                    angles <hi rend="italic">rLv, rLv,</hi> which are greatly magnified in the
                    figure. Hence it may be easily shewn, that the longitudinal aberration <hi
                    rend="italic">vr,</hi> is to the lateral aberration <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi>
                    as the focal distance of the lens is to its radius or half its aperture.</p>
                <p>In the circle of diffusion <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> the light becomes very
                    faint towards <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and very
                    intense in the centre <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> so that there is formed at <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> a sort of general focus indistinct and coloured. Every part
                    of an object, therefore, will have its image formed in the foci of such a lens
                    similarly indistinct and similarly coloured, and hence we see the reason why
                    refracting telescopes had such great imperfections, that it was necessary to
                    make them of enormous lengths, in order to obtain a sufficient magnifying
                    power.</p>
                <p>From these causes, Sir Isaac Newton despaired <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    improvement of refracting telescopes, and set himself at an early period of his
                    life to execute reflecting telescopes. His successors, however, Mr. Hall and Mr.
                    Dollond, studied the object of refraction as produced by prisms made of
                    different substances, and found, as woe have already fully stated in our history
                    of Optics, that Sir Isaac Newton was mistaken in supposing that all refracting
                    media gave spectra, or separated the colours of white light in the same
                    proportion as their refractive powers, and that different bodies had different
                    dispersive powers, as well as different refractive ones.<note anchored="true"

                    Powers of Bodies.</hi></p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">dispersion</hi> has been employed to denote the
                    separation of the different rays of white light into that divergent beam which
                    constitutes the prismatic spectrum, the differently coloured rays having been
                    dispersed or scattered by their different refrangibility. Sir Isaac Newton
                    believed that all bodies whatever, whether <hi rend="italic">wcder^</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">crown, or plate, ox flint glass,</hi> dispersed light in an equal
                    degree, provided the mean refraction, that is, the refraction of the mean or
                    middle ray of the spectrum (the green ray, viz.), of these bodies was equal, or,
                    in other words, that the dispersion, or the angle formed by the extreme red and
                    the extreme violet ray was in different bodies proportional to the mean
                    refraction.</p>
                <p>As Sir Isaac Newton submitted to experiment a number of fluid substances, in the
                    form of prisms, it is perhaps one of the most remarkable oversights^in the
                    history of science, that he did not think of comparing the length of the spectra
                    which they formed; and it is equally strange that for more than a century he and
                    all his successors should never have thought of forming the spectrum from any
                    other luminous body less in diameter than the sun, or even from any luminous
                    line of small breadth.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See page 406, col. 1.</p></note> The consequence of these oversights was,
                    that the most important discoveries relative to light, and to optical
                    instruments, were reserved for another age.</p>
                <p>In our <hi rend="italic">History of Optics,</hi> and in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Achromatic Glasses,</hi> we have given a detailed history of
                    the successive labours of Hall, Dollond, Euler, and others, by which the
                    achromatic telescope was invented and perfected.</p>
                <p>If we perfonn the experiment shewn in fig. 65, with two prisms, the one of <hi
                    rend="italic">flint,</hi> and the other of <hi rend="italic">crown</hi> glass,
                    and measure in each the length of the spectrum PT, or rather the angles which
                    the violet and the red rays PA, TA, make with each other, and the angle which
                    the mean <hi rend="italic">green</hi> ray forms with the direction of the
                    coloured rays SY, this last angle will be the mean refraction of the prism, and
                    the first the angular dispersion. We shall then find, that while in crown glass
                    the quotient obtained by dividing the greater by the lesser angle, or the part
                    of the mean refraction to which the dispersion is equal, will be seventeen
                    hundredths, (-⅛⅞), "bile in flint glass it will be thirty hundredths, (; <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi><hi rend="subscript"> e</hi><hi rend="superscript">
                    0</hi><hi rend="subscript"> δ</hi>), this number varying with the nature of the
                    glass.</p>
                <p>This result may be exhibited to the eye, by placing behind a prism of crown glass
                    C, another of flint glass F, of such an angle as not to produce any deviation by
                    refraction, the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562182" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2182-0409"

                    glass</hi> prism</p>
                <p>C, being compensated by an equal and opposite deviation produced by the <hi
                    rend="italic">flint glass</hi> prism F; that is, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">green</hi> ray By will emerge parallel to the incident ray
                    R A. When this has been effected it will be seen that there is still a spectrum
                    <hi rend="italic">rv,</hi> which will colour the edges of any object which is
                    viewed through the prism, and in which will have the same position as if they
                    had been produced by a small flint glass prism placedin the same manner as the
                    flint glass prism F.</p>
                <p>If we now take two prisms, one of <hi rend="italic">crown,</hi> and the other of
                    <hi rend="italic">flint</hi> glass, of such angles, that all objects seen
                    through them are colourless, or that a ray of light By, when refracted by them,
                    as in fig. 74, shall be white, it will be found that the white pencil Bw will be
                    refracted towards the base of the crown glass prism, the flint glass having
                    corrected the colour produced by the crown glass one, but still left a
                    considerable balance of refraction produced by the latter.</p>
                <p>Hence it is manifest that the <hi rend="italic">colours</hi> produced by a convex
                    lens of <hi rend="italic">crown</hi> glass, as shewn in fig. 73, may be
                    corrected by a concave lens of <hi rend="italic">flint</hi> glass, while the
                    rays produced by the unbalanced refraction of the convex glass are still
                    converged to a focus. Such a combination of lenses is called an <hi
                    rend="italic">achromatic object-glass,</hi> and a telescope in which such an
                    object-glass is used is called an <hi rend="italic">achromatic
                    telescope.</hi></p>
                <p>Nothing is easier than to determine by experiment, when we have obtained good
                    glass for the construction of these lenses, the proper radii to which they
                    should be ground, in order to correct the aberration of colour; but it may be
                    readily shewn, and the reader may easily prove it by the methods already
                    described, that <hi rend="italic">the aberration of colour produced by a convex
                    lens of croicn glass will be corrected by α concave lens of flint glass,
                    provided the focal lengths of the two lenses are proportional to their
                    dispersive power.</hi> Thus, in fig. 75, if LL is a convex lens of crown glass,
                    whose focus for green rays is at <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> and for violet and
                    red rays at <hi rend="italic">v</hi> and <hi rend="italic">τ,</hi> and if F is
                    the virtual focus of a concave lens <hi rend="italic">ll</hi> of flint glass,
                    for the mean green ray, then parallel rays AAA will be refracted to a single
                    focus at RV, where the vio let and red rays willbe united, provided the focal
                    length of <hi rend="italic">ll,</hi> viz., EF, is to E <hi rend="italic">f,</hi>
                    the focal length of LL as 0∙068, the dispersive power <hi rend="italic"
                    >oiflint</hi> glass, is to 0∙033, the dispersive power of <hi rend="italic"
                    >crown</hi> glass.</p>
                <p>The dispersive powers of various glasses, and of some fluids, had been measured
                    with considerable care, in reference to the improvement of the telescope, but no
                    attempt was made to investigate it as a branch of physics, exhibiting new and
                    interesting properties of transparent bodies. Dr. Wollaston set the example of
                    beginning this inquiry, and he determined in a very general manner the
                    dispersive qualities of thirty-three substances, which he arranged in the order
                    of their dispersive powers, without giving any numerical estimate of their
                    value. In this state of the subject, Sir David Brewster, by a new method of
                    measuring dispersive powers, which presented considerable facility of
                    observation, made a very extensive series of experiments on the subject, which,
                    in a physical point of view, presented several curious results. In laying the
                    following table of his observations before our readers, we must warn them that
                    they were made, often with the most imperfect specimens of the minerals and
                    fluid substances, from the difficulty of getting any other, and that they were
                    intended only to indicate the general properties of bodies in dispersing light.
                    The want of fixed points in the spectrum, in reference to which the measures
                    could be taken, rendered it necessary to use the extreme points, which varied
                    with the intensity of the light employed, and with the absorbing action of the
                    bodies themselves, when they happened to be coloured or imperfectly transparent.
                    The discovery of the fixed lines, and their use in measuring dispersive powers,
                    introduced by Fraunhofer, has given a new impetus to this subject, and wnen it
                    is practicable to obtain good prisms of the substance under examination, no
                    other method will or should be adopted.</p>

                <p>The followingmeasures of the dispersive powers of several varieties of glass were
                    taken by Sir John Herschel, by a method which gave him nearly the extreme rays
                    of the spectrum, namely, by viewing the spectrum through a dark blue glass,
                    which stops the <hi rend="italic">green, yellow,</hi> and most refrangible <hi
                    rend="italic">red</hi> rays, and therefore allows the extreme rays of the
                    spectrum to be seen,—rays which the eye does not recognise in any of the
                    ordinary lights which are used in optical instruments. If we condense the sun’s
                    light, as we have done, in order to render visible rays at the extremities of
                    the spectrum, that have not been recognised, we should obtain dispersive powers
                    still higher than those given by Sir John Herschel. By determining, however, the
                    extremities of the spectrum seen by the ordinary light of the sky, it would be
                    easy to accommodate all measures of dispersive power taken in such a light to
                    those taken in the light used by Sir John Herschel, or in the more condensed and
                    consequently elongated spectrum to which we have referred. In order that the
                    measures in the following tables may be correct, it is necessary that they
                    should all have been taken when the sun had the same altitude, because it is
                    quite certain that the violet part of the spectrum diminishes in length very
                    rapidly as the sun approaches the horizon, and some change also takes place at
                    the red extremity.</p>

                <p>Sir John Herschel justly remarks, that it ought not to excite surprise that the
                    dispersions deduced by this method should considerably exceed all former
                    estimates.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>In the preceding table of dispersive powers we have given two columnsof numerical
                    results, the first column containingi the part of the whole refraction, or angle
                    of deviation to which the angle of dispersion is equal, and the other the
                    dispersive power itself. The first column is obviously not a measure of the
                    dispersive power, because if the dispersion in that column is <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> θth part of a low
                    refraction in one body, and the 20th part of a high refraction in another body
                    of great refractive poxver, the dispersive power of the latter must be smaller
                    than that of the former, in the inverse ratio of the index of refraction of the
                    two bodies minus unity. Hence the numbers in the second column, the dispersive
                    powers, are obtained by dividing the first column by the index of refraction
                    minus one.</p>
                <p>If we wish to have the intrinsic or <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi> dispersive
                    powers of bodies, in reference to the action of their ultimate molecules on the
                    theory of emission, and on the supposition, as Sir John Herschel has remarked,

                <p>These results present us with several views of consider-ιble interest. The salts
                    of barytes have, in reference to heir density, the least dispersive power of all
                    bodies, and he next in order are the gems, including even diamond, vhich
                    occupies so different a place in our table of absolute efractive powers. The
                    inflammable bodies, with the ex-eption of diamond, stand at the head of the
                    table, <hi rend="italic">oil of</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >assia</hi> having by far the greater absolute dispersive power f any body yet
                    examined. That this is owing to the hy-rogen which it contains is very probable,
                    and has almost cen proved by an experiment by Sir John Herschel, who eprived a
                    portion of this oil of most of its hydrogen by ιaking a stream of chlorine pass
                    through it till it refused ) act any farther. By this means he converted the oil
                    ιto a viscous mass, the dispersive power of which was di-tinished one-half,
                    while its refractive power had hardly ιffered any change. This result leads us
                    to conclude that <hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">drogen</hi> has the
                    greatest intrinsic dispersive power of all ιdies. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fluorine</hi> seems to be the element which has nearly e lowest refractive
                    power.</p>
                <p>One of the most interesting results exhibited in the ge-I ;ral Table of
                    dispersive powers, relates to the dispersive ∣∣wers of doubly refracting
                    substances. Dr. wollaston d measured the dispersive power of the ordinary ray in
                    lcareous spar, so far at least as to ascertain that it stood ove water, and
                    plate and crown-glass. Sir David Brewshad been led to measure the dispersion of
                    the extraordi-y ray, and found it to be much lower than that of water.: was
                    hence induced to examine the dispersive powers of &lt; er doubly refracting
                    crystals, and was thus led to the res t which we have stated.<note

                    Coloured Spaces in the Spectrum, and the existence of a secondary
                    Spectrum.</hi></p>
                <p>We are indebted, we believe, to Μ. Clairaut for the discovery of the
                    irrationality of the coloured spaces in the spectrum. He found that when the
                    flint-glass of an achromatic object glass had its aberration of colour as
                    completely corrected as possible, that is, when the extreme red and violet rays
                    were accurately united in the same focus, still there remained a portion of
                    incorrected colour, which was of a purple or claret colour on one side of the
                    focus, and of a green colour on the other. If prisms had been used in place of
                    lenses, and the sun’s light transmitted through them in the usual manner, there
                    would have been a small reci-dual spectrum, or <hi rend="italic">secondary
                    spectrum</hi> as it has been called, consisting of purple and green light. The
                    Abbé Boscovich afterwards observed the same fact, but considered it so
                    extraordinary that he suspected some latent cause of error, and submitted his
                    experiments to the most rigid scrutiny. He at last admitted the irrationality of
                    the coloured spaces in the spectrum as a demonstrated truth, and has shewn how
                    three of the colours of the spectrum may be corrected or united in the same
                    focus in achromatic telescopes. The late Professor Robison obtained similar
                    results, and gave the name of <hi rend="italic">outstanding</hi> colours to
                    those which were not united, and form the secondary spectrum.</p>
                <p>This subject was more fully investigated by Dr. Blair, in his interesting paper
                    on the unequal refrangibility of light,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Edin. Trans,</hi> vol. iii. p.
                    3.</p></note> and he has shewn that the proportions of the coloured spaces vary
                    with the substance of the opposing prisms, ⅛o that a complete correction of
                    colour cannot possibly be effected by two media of different dispersive powers.
                    Hence Dr. Blair was led to examine the nature of the dispersive action of
                    different media, and by the most ingenious devices succeeded in producing fluid
                    object-glasses in which the <hi rend="italic">aberration of colour was
                    completely corrected.</hi> The telescopes which he made on this principle were
                    so extraordinary, that Professor Robison assures us that one of them, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">fifteen</hi> inches in focul length, <hi rend="italic">equalled
                    in all respects, i; it did not surpass, the best of Dollond’s</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">forty-two</hi> inches long.</p>
                <p>Under these circumstances, the scientific world was surprised at the following
                    statement published by Dr. Wollaston in the <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans,</hi>
                    for 1803. “Since the proportions of these colours <hi rend="italic">have
                    been</hi> supposed by Dr. Blair to vary according to the medium by which they
                    are produced, I have compared with this appearance, the coloured images caused
                    by prismatic vessels containing substances supposed by him to differ most in
                    this respect, such as strong but colourless nitric acid, rectified oil of
                    turpentine, very pale oil of sassafras, Canada balsam, also nearly colourless.
                    With each of these, I have found the same arrangement of these four colours, and
                    in similar positions of the prisms, as nearly as I could judge, the same
                    proportions of them.” Dr. Blair was surprised that Dr. Wollaston should have
                    used such a coarse method of determining a point that required delicate
                    observations, especially with the substances above mentioned; and he remarked to
                    the writer of this article, that if Dr. Wollaston would only make use of lenses,
                    he would see his mistake after a single observation.</p>
                <p>There is no doubt, however, that the secondary spectrum can be made very visible
                    by prisms, and if we use a prism of oil of cassia to correct the colour produced
                    by another of sulphuric acid, we shall have a striking ocular proof of the
                    existence of a large secondary spectrum.</p>
                <p>The phenomena of a secondary spectrum will be understood from fig. 76, where RR
                    is a ray passing through an aperture in the window-shutter SS, and refracted by
                    a prism P in the direction PM, so as to form the spectrum AB on the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194562221" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2221-0412"/> wall, PA being
                    the extreme violet ray, PM the mean ray, and PB the extreme red. The spectrum
                    will consist of four palpable colours, <hi rend="italic">red, green, blue, and
                    violet,</hi> and if the prism is one <hi rend="italic">(A crown-glass,</hi> the
                    mean ray PMN which bisects the spectrum will be at the boundary of the blue and
                    green spaces. If we were to take a prism of flint-glass with a much less
                    refracting angle, and form a spectrum CD of the same length as AB, and at the
                    same distance from the prism, the line <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> which marks the
                    boundary of the blue and green spaces will no longer be the mean ray of the
                    spectrum, but will be decidedly nearer the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> extremity
                    D. The least refrangible half of the spectrum has therefore been more
                    contracted, and the most refrangible half more expanded than in the crown-glass
                    spectrum. If we now take a prism of sulphate of barytes or fluor spar, capable
                    of forming a third spectrum EF of the same length as the other two, the boundary
                    of the blue and green spaces will now be at <hi rend="italic">μν</hi> nearer the
                    violet than the red extremity of the spectrum, and the least refrangible half of
                    this spectrum will be more <hi rend="italic">expanded</hi> and the most
                    refrangible half more <hi rend="italic">contracted,</hi> than in the crown-glass
                    spectrum.</p>
                <p>“If a spectrum,” says Sir David Brewster,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Treatise οη Sew Philosophical
                    Instruments,</hi> 1813, ρ. 316.</p></note> “formed by flint-glass, had its
                    coloured spaces exactly of the same dimensions with those of an equal spectrum
                    formed by crown-glass, any object such as a window-bar lying parallel to the
                    common section of the refracting planes of the two prisms should appear
                    perfectly colourless when seen through the combined prisms. But if the coloured
                    spaces in the two spectra are not proportional, as shewn in fig. 76, but are <hi
                    rend="italic">irrational,</hi> then the window-bar cannot be wholly free from
                    colour, for though the extreme red and violet rays of both the spectra are
                    united, yet the intermediate colours are not rendered coincident. In the
                    spectrum AB, formed by the crown-glass, the first green ray MN, which is here
                    the mean ray, is obviously more refracted than the first green ray <hi
                    rend="italic">mn,</hi> in the spectrum CD formed by the flint-glass, and
                    therefore the flint-glass wall not be able to refract the green ray, so as to
                    unite it with the red and violet. Hence the green ray will, as it were, be left
                    behind, while the red and violet rays are rendered coincident. Thus, in fig. 76,
                    if a prism <hi rend="italic">p</hi> of flint glass is placed behind a
                    crown-glass prism P, so as exactly to correct its dispersion, the spectrum AB
                    will be reduced to a secondary spectrum <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> the upper
                    half of which is <hi rend="italic">green,</hi> which is left behind, and the
                    lower half is of a <hi rend="italic">claret</hi> colour, formed by the union of
                    the red and violet rays. If the bar of a window had been examined through the
                    combined prisms P, <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> the upper side of it would have
                    been tinged with green, and the lower side of it with a claret-coloured
                    fringe.</p>
                <p>By comparing, in a similar manner, the spectrum EF, formed by fluor spar, with
                    the spectrum AB, formed by crown glass, it will be found, that the fluor spar
                    having a greater action than the crown glass upon the green ray, will carry it
                    beyond the place of the united red and violet, and will form a secondary
                    spectrum <hi rend="italic">er,</hi> the lower half of which is <hi rend="italic"
                    >green,</hi> and the upper half of a <hi rend="italic">claret</hi> colour,
                    arising from the union of the red and violet light. If the bar of a window were
                    viewed through the combined prisms of crown-glass and rock crystal, it would be
                    tinged with green on its lower side, and with a claret-coloured fringe on its
                    upper side.</p>
                <p>When a horizontal window-bar, therefore, is seen through any two prisms which
                    correct each other’s dispersion, without uniting all the colours, the green
                    fringe will always be on the same side of the bar with the vertex of the prism
                    which has the least action upon the green light, or which <hi rend="italic"
                    >contracts</hi> the red and green rays, and <hi rend="italic">expands</hi> the
                    blue and violet ones; that is, if the vertex of the flint glass prism is
                    pointing downwards, the uncorrected green fringe will be on the lower side of
                    the bar. By observing, therefore, the position of the green fringe, we can
                    immediately ascertain which of the two prisms has the greatest action upon the
                    green light.</p>
                <p>These theoretical deductions from the assumed inequality of the coloured spaces
                    are completely established by observation.</p>
                <p>The following Table contains the result of a numerous series of observations made
                    by Sir David Brewster on the secondary spectra of different bodies, the
                    substances being arranged inversely according to their action upon green light.
                    The bodies at the top of the Table form spectra, in which the red and green
                    spaces are most contracted, and the blue and violet ones most expanded. The
                    relative position of some of the substances, particularly the essential oils, is
                    quite empirical; but by a reference to the original experiments, it will be seen
                    whether or not the relative action of any two bodies has been determined.</p>

                <p>Finding it impossible to obtain any highly dispersing medium which should refract
                    the rays of the spectrum in the same manner as crown glass, Dr. Blair thought of
                    employing this very imperfection in obtaining a perfect correction of colour. As
                    the green rays removed the outstanding ones, or were not united in the same
                    focus with the red and violet, he considered that if an achromatic <hi
                    rend="italic">concave</hi> lens should refract the outstanding green more
                    strongly than the united red and violet, while an achromatic <hi rend="italic"
                    >convex</hi> lens should also refract the outstanding green more strongly than
                    the united red and violet, then two such achromatic lenses combined might unite
                    the outstanding greenwith the red andviolet,and thus effect a perfect union of
                    all the colours. Hence he took the combination shewn in fig. 77, for a concave
                    lens, composed of a concave lens <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> of crown glass, and
                    a convex lens <hi rend="italic">cd</hi> of a fluid which had its dispersive
                    power of such a character as to unite the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">violet</hi> rays as stated in the figures, and leave the green
                    outstanding and <hi rend="italic">most re· fraxted</hi> He then made an
                    achromatic <hi rend="italic">convex</hi> lens, fig. 78, composed of a convex
                    lens <hi rend="italic">hg</hi> of an essential oil, the same as that in <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ,</hi> which disperses the rays in a lesser degree, and of a
                    concave lens <hi rend="italic">fehy</hi> of an essential oil which disperses the
                    rays in a much greater degree. This compound lens has its convexity such as to
                    unite at a convenient distance, rays which diverge from the violet focus of the
                    compound concave lens shewn in fig. 77, and therefore its focal length must be
                    much shorter than the other, like the flint lens in a common achromatic. But
                    though the focal lengths of the two compound lenses are thus different, yet, the
                    distance or deviation of the outstanding green, from the united red and violet,
                    is equal in both.</p>
                <p>When these ' two compound lenses are placed in contact, as shewn in fig. 79, it
                    is manifest that the equal and opposite deviations of the green ray will balance
                    each other, and that this ray will therefore be united with the red and violet,
                    and thus form a pencil exempt from secondary colours. The plates of glass shewn
                    by dotted lines at <hi rend="italic">er, cd,</hi> though necessary when the two
                    compound lenses are separate, as in fig. 77, 79, are of course removed, since
                    the two fluids which they separate, as fig. 78, are the same. Hence the compound
                    object-glass, consists of a concave lens of crown glass <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab,</hi> of a meniscus <hi rend="italic">er,</hi> of a fluid, and a convex
                    glass of another fluid, enclosed in two glasses like watch-fiasses. Dr. Blair
                    found it best n practice to make all the glasses concave meniscuses in place of
                    having all the concavity in one lens <hi rend="italic">ab.</hi></p>
                <p>In continuing his experiments, Dr. Blair happened to try the muriatic acid mixed
                    with a metallic solution; he found it best to make his compound convex lens, as
                    shewn in fig. 7 8, of crown glass, and that fluid which enabled him to correct
                    the colour of the compound concave in fig. 77, and likewise to correct the
                    aberration of figure by a concave which lengthens only by one-third the focal
                    distance of the convex.</p>
                <p>When he was trying a compound concave formed only of crown glass and muriatic
                    acid, he observed that this fluid produced an inverted secondary spectrum, and
                    gave a primary spectrum, in which the green rays were among the most
                    refrangible, and hence he was conducted to the idea of forming a compound lens
                    consisting merely of a single concave lens of muriatic acid placed between a
                    plano-convex and a meniscus of crown glass. In this lens, which he actually
                    constructed and used, he observes <hi rend="italic">that the rays of different
                    colours were bent from their rectilineal course with, the same equality and
                    regularity as in reflexion.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In such telescopes, Dr. Blair found that when the focal length of the
                    object-glass was <hi rend="italic">nine inches,</hi> the aperture might be
                    increased as far as <hi rend="italic">three</hi> inches; and in order to
                    distinguish such instruments where the aberration is removed from <hi
                    rend="italic">achromatic</hi> ones in which it is only partially removed, he
                    proposes the use of the term <hi rend="italic">aplanatic.</hi><note

                    tertiary spectrum, and the method of , [correcting the aberration of colour by
                    prisms and lenses of the same kind of glass.</hi></p>
                <p>The existence of the <hi rend="italic">tertiary</hi> spectrum was discovered
                    experimentally by Sir David Brewster, who deduced it also from the constant
                    ratio of the sines. It is produced when the dispersion of a prism of any
                    substance is corrected by another prism of the same substance with a different
                    refracting angle. An irrationality takes place in the coloured spaces, which
                    prevents the correction of colour from being complete. The residuary spectrum
                    was therefore called the <hi rend="italic">tertiary</hi> spectrum merely to
                    distinguish it from the <hi rend="italic">secondary</hi> one, which is produced
                    by the specific quality in the refracting media, which act in opposition to each
                    other.</p>
                <p>In examining the phenomena of this new spectrum, Sir David Brewster was led to a
                    very paradoxical method of exhibiting it.</p>
                <p>Having formed a prism of oil of cassia, with a large refracting angle, and
                    viewing through it the broadest horizontal bar of a window, so that the edges of
                    the bar were free of all colours, he inclined the prism so as to make the bar
                    exhibit at its edges the prismatic colours, as shewn in fig. 81, where the edges
                    δM and eN had spectra 6αM, <hi rend="italic">efS,</hi> consisting of the usual
                    <hi rend="italic">red</hi> and <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi> rays, while the
                    edges eM,Z&gt;N had spectra ec∕M, ⅛N composed of the usual blue and violet rays.
                    These spectra increased from <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> towards Μ and N, and at the nodes <hi rend="italic">b, e,</hi> where the
                    spectra would have vanished, had each face of the prism received the rays
                    symmetrically, the <hi rend="italic">tertiary spectrum</hi> was clearly

                <p>In order to produce refraction without colour by two prisms of the same kind of
                    glass, they may be combined, as in fig. 82, where a ray of light R incident on
                    the first prism AB is refracted to the axis MF at F. The prism AB has a smaller
                    refracting angle than CD, and is placed in an oblique position, so that its
                    dispersion is increased in a greater ratio <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562247"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-2247-0414"/>than its refraction, for the purpose of correcting
                    the dispersion of CD without balancing its refraction; the prism CD having a
                    position in which its refraction and dispersion are a minimum.</p>
                <p>The ray R will therefore converge colourless, and meet the axis at F.</p>
                <p>If the prisms have the same refracting angle, and are placed in the position
                    shewn in fig. 83, the ray R will emerge colourless in the direction <hi
                    rend="italic">r.</hi> This combination of prisms,as well as that in fig. 82, has
                    the property of expanding all objects viewed through them, in a vertical plane
                    passing through their sections BACD, that is, of <hi rend="italic">magnifying
                    them in one plane.</hi> Hence, if we place another similar pair of prisms
                    horizontally, this pair also will magnify objects in a horizontal plane, and by
                    combining these two pair of prisms, we obtain an instrument which will expand or
                    magnify objects in all directions.</p>
                <p>This instrument was first constructed by Sir David Brewster in 1812, under the
                    name of a <hi rend="italic">teinoscope,</hi> for altering the proportions of
                    objects in plans and drawings, by expanding them differently in rectangular
                    directions;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    acquainted with this method of magnifying objects by prisms. Mr. Archibald Blair
                    a few years ago put into Sir David Brewster’s hands an instrument of this kind,
                    composed of four prisms which had been executed by his father, but the date of
                    its construction he had no means of discovering. There cannot, therefore, be the
                    shadow of a doubt that both the principles and the invention of an instrument
                    for magnifying objects by means of prisms, were known and published in Scotland
                    long before the celebrated Μ. Amici of Modena brought forward a contrivance of
                    the same kind. That Μ. Amici’s invention was an independent one will not be
                    questioned.</p>
                <p>As we conceive that a telescope of this kind may have many useful applications,
                    we have given in the annexed figure a sketch of the instrument as actually
                    fitted up for use. It consists of two prisms, AB, AC of the same kind of glass,
                    and having a small refracting angle.</p>
                <p>Their common line of junction at A is horizontal, and their planes of refraction
                    vertical. Other two similar prisms DE, EF, are placed transversely, their common
                    line of junction at E being vertical, and their planes of refraction horizontal.
                    An object Μ, therefore, seen through the prisms in the direction OM, by an eye
                    placed at 0, will be magnified three, four, or five times, or more according to
                    the inclination and angles of the prisms. It is expanded or stretched out in a
                    horizontal plane by the two first prisms ED, EF, and then expanded and stretched
                    out in a vertical plane by the other two prisms, AB, CD.</p>
                <p>If we use homogeneous light, we may construct the instrument with only two
                    prisms, as there is no necessity for correcting the colour with a second prism.
                    For solar observations, the two prisms will constitute a telescope, a darkening
                    glass being used as in other instruments. It will be thus equally useful for
                    viewing the lines in the spectrum, where homogeneous light is necessarily used;
                    and by placing two, three, or four instruments in the same tube, we may obtain
                    any magnifying power we desire. The writer of this article is at present
                    occupied with the construction of one of these instruments with rock salt
                    prisms. The length of the instrument which we have drawn is only <hi

                <p>Although the discovery of the principle, and the actual construction of <hi
                    rend="italic">achromatic</hi> and <hi rend="italic">aplanatic</hi> telescopes
                    had directed the attention of many observers to the nature of the prismatic
                    spectrum, yet, with the exception of its varying length in different bodies, and
                    the continuity of its coloured spaces, no attempt was made to question the
                    general account of its phenomena given by Sir Isaac Newton.</p>
                <p>Owing to his having used the diameter of the sun as the body from which his
                    spectrum was formed, and to the difficulty of procuring in his day good prisms
                    of glass, Sir Isaac never obtained any thing like pure homogeneous light, and
                    was therefore unable to determine the exact boundaries of the coloured spaces.
                    Had the spectrum been observed in the same manner on the planet Mercury and on
                    Satum, the spectrum produced by the same prism would have been very different.
                    On Mercury the rays would have been less pure and homogeneous than that observed
                    on our earth, and the mean refrangible rays of a different colour; while on
                    Satum the colour would have been more pure and homogeneous.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Discoveries of Dr. Wollaston.</hi></p>
                <p>The first person, in so far as we know, who proposed to form the spectrum by
                    using <hi rend="italic">a very narrow pencil of light</hi> in place of the sun,
                    was Dr. Wollaston, to whom we owe many most valuable observations on the
                    subject.</p>
                <p>“I cannot,” says he, “conclude these observations on dispersion, without
                    remarking, that the colours into which a beam of white light is separable by
                    refraction, appears to me tobeneither seven, as they usually are seen in the
                    rainbow, nor reducible by any means (that I can find) to three, as some persons
                    have conceived; but that by employingaverynarrowpen-cil of light,<note

                    primary divisions of the prismatic spectrum may be seen with a degree of
                    distinctness, that I believe has not been described nor observed before.

                    rend="smallcaps">ō’q</hi> of an inch broad, and received by the eye at the
                    distance of ten or twelve feet through a prism of flint glass, <hi rend="italic"
                    >free from veins,</hi> held near the eye, the beam is seen to be separated into
                    the four following colours only, <hi rend="italic">red, yellowish green,
                    blue,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">violet,</hi> in the proportions represented in
                    the figure.</p>
                <p>“The line A that bounds the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> side of the spectrum is
                    somewhat confused, which seems in part owing to the want of power in the eye to
                    converge red light. The line B, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562260"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-2260-0415"/>between red and green in a certain position of the
                    prism, is perfectly distinct; so also are D, and E, the two limits of violet.
                    But C, the limit of green and blue, is not so clearly marked as the rest; and
                    there are also, on each side of this limit, other distinct dark lines, <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> and <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> either of which, in an
                    imperfect experiment, might be mistaken for the boundary of these colours.</p>
                <p>“The position of the prism in which the colours are most clearly divided, is when
                    the incident light makes about equal angles with two of its sides. I then found
                    that the spaces AB,BC,CD,DE, occupied by them, were nearly as the numbers 16,
                    23, 36, 25.” Dr. Wollaston adds, that when the inclination of the prism is
                    altered so as to increase the dispersion of the colours, the proportions of them
                    to each other are then also changed, so that the spaces AC and CE, instead of
                    being as before 39 and 61. may be found altered as far as 42 and 58.</p>
                <p>The lines which Dr. Wollaston has described in the preceding observations, are
                    called <hi rend="italic">fixed lines in the spectrum,</hi> and may be
                    considered, as we shall presently have reason to see, as one of the most
                    valuable observations which have been made on this subject. He owed the
                    discovery solely to his having used a <hi rend="italic">narrower</hi> line of
                    light, and had he employed a still narrower and brighter line, he would have
                    seen many more lines.</p>
                <p>In considering Dr Wollaston’s observations, and comparing the results with those
                    of Sir Isaac Newton, we must carefully attend to the circumstance, that he used
                    <hi rend="italic">a beam of day-liqht,</hi> not one of sun-light, and as this
                    beam emanated from the blue sky, and was light which had been greatly-modified
                    by the action of the atmosphere, as we shall soon show, his estimate of the
                    number and nature of the coloured spaces, does not in the least affect or
                    invalidate the observations of preceding authors. The sun’s light used by Newton
                    had lost many of its rays, by the absorptive action of the atmosphere, before it
                    fell upon Dr. Wollaston’s prism. In consequence of taking it for granted that
                    Dr. Wollaston was analysing the same kind of light that Sir Iasac Newton
                    analysed, both he and Dr Young were misled in the nterpretation of the
                    phenomena. Speaking of the obser-ations of Newton and his followers, Dr. Young
                    says, ‘ The observations were however imperfect, and the ana-ogy was wholly
                    imaginary. Dr Wollaston has determin’d the division of the coloured image or
                    spectrum, in a auch more accurate manner than had been done before: y looking
                    through a prism, at a narrow line of light, he reduces a more effectual
                    separation of the colours, than an be obtained by the common method of throwing
                    the m’s image on a wall. The spectrum formed in this maner consists of four
                    colours only, <hi rend="italic">red, green, blue,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >vio-h</hi> which occupy spaces in the proportion of 16, 23, 36, and 5,
                    respectively, making together 100 for the whole length; ιe red being nearly
                    one-sixth, the green and the violet i ich about one-fourth, and the blue more
                    than one-third of i ιe length. The colours differ scarcely at all in quality i
                    ithin their respective limit≡, but they vary in brightness; the greatest
                    intensity of light being in that part of the green hich is nearest to the red. A
                    narrow line of <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi> is generally visible at the limit
                    of the red and green; but its breadth scarcely exceeds that of the aperture by
                    which the light is admitted, and Dr. Wollaston attributes it to the ixture of
                    the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> with the <hi rend="italic">green</hi> light.<note

                    distribution of the spectrum Dr. Wollaston has found to be the same whatever
                    refracting substance may have been employed for its formation; and he attributes
                    the difference, which has sometimes been observed in the proportion, to

                    without any mixture of yellow. “In consequence,” says he, “of Dr. Wollaston’s

                    compared with these observations, it became necessary to modify the supposition

                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Discoveries of Fraunhofer.</hi></p>
                <p>Without knowing any thing of the discovery of fixed lines in the sky light by Dr.
                    Wollaston, Μ. Fraunhofer,a celebrated practical optician at Benedictbaiem near
                    Munich, made a series of the most beautiful discoveries respecting the spectrum,
                    which he published in 1814 and 1815. By making use of prisms of uniform density,
                    and entirely free of veins, and by excluding all extraneous light, and stopping
                    the rays which formed the coloured spaces which he was not examining, he made
                    the important discovery that the <hi rend="italic">solar</hi> spectrum was
                    covered with a great number of black lines of different thicknesses parallel to
                    each other, and perpendicular to the length of the spectrum.</p>
                <p>All kinds of prisms, fluid or solid, provided they were good, exhibited the same
                    lines, and Fraunhofer found, that these lines had a fixed position in the
                    spectrum, and that they varied with the length of the spectrum, the distance
                    between any two affording a precise measure of the action of the prism on the
                    rays in which these two lines were placed. These lines are darker than the rest
                    of the spectrum, and some of them appear entirely black. The largest lines could
                    scarcely be seen if the aperture exceeded <hi rend="italic">a minute,</hi> and
                    the finest lines also disappeared entirely when the aperture was 40". The
                    aperture used by Fraunhofer was 36" high, and 15" wide, that is, at a distance
                    of 24 feet from the aperture. It was nearly one-fiftieth of an inch wide, and
                    2.88 inches high. The prism was made of flint-glass, had a refracting angle of
                    nearly 60°, and was placed before the object-glass of the telescope, so that the
                    angles of incidence and emergence were equal, or the angle of refraction a <hi
                    rend="italic">minimum.</hi> This apparatus is shewn in fig. 1, Plate CCCLXXXI,
                    where the prism is seen in front of the objectglass of the telescope of a
                    repeating theodolite resting on a horizontal plane with a steel axis round which
                    it moves. The box on which the axis turns is firmly united with the
                    telescope.</p>
                <p>When the prism was turned round, so as to increase the angle of incidence, the
                    lines disappeared, and the same took place when the angle of incidence was
                    diminished. But the lines reappeared at a greater incidence by shortening, and
                    at a smaller incidence by lengthening the telescope.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">solar prismatic spectrum,</hi> as seen by Fraunhofer, is
                    represented in fig. 2 of Plate CCCLXXXI which has been abridged, and many of the
                    lines necessarily omitted, Fraunhofer himself, having been obliged to leave them
                    out of his map. At the line A the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> space nearly
                    terminates, and the Holet space at I; but when the fight of an illuminated cloud
                    fell upon the aperture in the prism, the spectrum appeared to terminate on one
                    side at B, and on the other between G <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562273"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-2273-0416"/>and II. At A there is a distinct and well defined
                    line, the boundary of the red space being a little beyond it. “At <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> there is a mass of lines, forming together a band darker
                    than the adjacent parts. The line at B is very distinct, and of a considerable
                    thickness. From B to C may be reckoned nine very delicate and well defined
                    lines. The line at C is broad, and black like D. Between C and D are found
                    nearly 30 very fine lines, which, however, with the exception of two, cannot be
                    perceived but with a high magnifying power, and with prisms of great dispersion;
                    they are besides well defined. The same is the case with the lines between B and
                    C. The line D consists of two strong lines separated by a bright one. Between D
                    and E we recognise about 84 lines of different sizes. That at E consists of
                    several lines, of which the middle one is the strongest. From E to <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> there are nearly 24 lines. At <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    there are three very strong ones, two of which are separated by a fine and clear
                    line. They are among the strongest in the spectrum. The space <hi rend="italic"
                    >bF</hi> contains nearly 52 lines, of which F is very strong. Between F and G
                    there are about 185 lines of different sizes. At G many lines are accumulated,
                    several of which are remarkable for their size. From G to H there are nearly 190
                    different lines. The two bands at H are of a very singular nature. They are both
                    nearly equal, and are formed of several lines, in the middle of which there is
                    one very strong and deep. From H to I they likewise occur in great numbers,
                    Hence it follows that, in the space BH, there are 574 lines. The relative
                    distances of the strongest lines were measured with the theodolite, and placed
                    in the figure from observation. The faintest lines only were inserted from
                    estimation by the eye.” The lines in the solar spectrum which we have thus
                    minutely described after Fraunhofer, are not seen in the spectra formed by any
                    white flame, or white light, whether it is generated, by ordinary combustion, or
                    produced by the application of intense heat to a solid body. In the flame of a
                    lamp, however, Fraunhofer discovered that there is a double yellow line
                    occupying <hi rend="italic">exactly</hi> the same place as the double line D,
                    the two black lines of D corresponding with the two luminous ones of the double
                    yellow line in lamp light. Hence it follows that ordinary <hi rend="italic"
                    >white</hi> light, produced in the manner already mentioned, has 590 rays of a
                    definite refrangibility which do not exist in solar light, and hence the black
                    lines have been called <hi rend="italic">defective rays</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">lines.</hi></p>
                <p>“Various experiments,” says Fraunhofer, “and changes to which I have submitted
                    these lines, convince me that they have their origin in the nature of the light
                    of the sun, and that they cannot be attributed to illusive observations, cr any
                    other secondary cause.”</p>
                <p>By means of the apparatus shewn in fig.l, Plate CCCLXXX1, Fraunhofer determined
                    in a very accurate manner the distances between the principal fixed lines<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The reader will be desirous
                    of knowing, which of these principal lines were discovered by Dr. Wollaston. The
                    following attempt to do this is given by Sir David Brewster in his Report on
                    Optics, published in the Proceedings of the British Association, vol. i. p. 320,
                    note 2. In the spectrum formed by a narrow beam of day-light, Dr. Wollaston had
                    previously to the year 1802, discovered <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> lines,
                    which he has designated by the letters A, B,∕, C, <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> D,
                    E, the firstline A being, according to his observations, the extreme boundary of
                    the red rays, and the last line E the extreme boundary of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >violet</hi> rays. The correspondence of these lines with those of Fraunhofer, I
                    have with some difficulty ascertained to be as follows—</p><p>A, B, <hi
                    rend="italic">f,</hi> C, <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> D, E Wollaston.</p><p>B, D,
                    δ, F, G, H. Fraunhofer.</p><p>There is no single line in Fraunhofer’s drawing in
                    the spectrum, (nor is there any in the real spectrum) coincident with the line
                    Oof Wollaston; and indeed he himself describes it as not being “so clearly
                    marked as the rest.” I have found, however, that this line C corresponds to <hi

                    and F, which, owing to the absorption of the atmosphere, are particularly
                    visible in the light of the sky near the horizon. In order to have seen the
                    lines B and II of Fraunhofer, especially the last, Dr. Wollaston’s “beam of
                    day-light” must have come from a part of the sky very near the sun’s
                    disc.</p></note> B, C, D, E, F, G, H, taking those which divided the spectrum
                    most conveniently. The line <hi rend="italic">b</hi> for example, would have
                    been better than E for its magnitude and distinctness, but it doesnot divide the
                    space DF so equally. He repeated these observations with different kinds of
                    flint and crown glass of several fluids, and obtained the results given in the

                <p>These valuable data were deduced from measures taken <hi rend="italic">six</hi>
                    times for each substance; but as the theodolite was only twenty-four feet
                    distant from the window of his dark room, it became necessary to apply a
                    correction to the angle of deviation <hi rend="italic">μ,</hi> arising from the
                    distance 4∙25 inches of the centre of the prism from the axis of the theodolite.
                    This correction would have been very great for twenty-four feet, and therefore
                    Fraunhofer, to avoid the uncertainty which <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562286"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-2286-0417"/>arises from a great correction, determined the
                    angle <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> for the yellow ray of the light of a lamp which
                    has the same refrangibility as D. When the lamp was placed at the distance of
                    692 feet, the correction of <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> for crown glass and water
                    was only 40". Hence for the smaller arcs, which were really measured, the
                    corrections were very small, being only 2" <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 5 for
                    BC, 6"∙5 for CD, and 8" for DE. All the angular distances, therefore, in the
                    preceding table have had this correction applied to them.</p>
                <p>Μ. Fraunhofer then proceeded to determine the index of refraction <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> for the different fixed lines, and calling σ the <hi
                    rend="subscript"> t</hi> angle of incidence, <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi> the angle
                    of emergence, <hi rend="italic">ψ</hi> the angle of the prism, and <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> the index of refraction he obtained,</p>
                <p>4(sin. p + cos. ψ sin. σ) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + (sin. <hi
                    rend="italic">ψsin. &lt;r)~</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi> sin.φ )</p>
                <p>When the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of emergence, or the angle of
                    deviation a <hi rend="italic">minimum,</hi> and if <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> is
                    the angle of deviation, or that which the emergent ray forms with the incident
                    ray, we have sin.⅜(<hi rend="subscript"> μ</hi> +ψ) <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">≡</hi> 5-·, -.</p>
                <p>sin. ⅜ <hi rend="italic">ψ</hi></p>
                <p>When the dispersive power of the body under examination is very great, the value
                    of the index of refraction <hi rend="italic">m</hi> given by this last formula
                    will not be rigorously correct, as the equality of the angles of incidence and
                    emergence can only take place for one ray. Fraunhofer, therefore, measured the
                    distances BC, CD, or when the distance of the two lines B and C, C and D was the
                    smallest, which takes place when the ray or line which bisects these spaces has
                    its angle of incidence and emergence equal. When the substances have a less
                    dispersive power, or the prisms a smaller angle, the same care is not necessary
                    to obtain this degree of accuracy. If we then call Ezra the index of refraction
                    for the ray E, we have <hi rend="smallcaps">E,</hi><hi rend="subscript
                    smallcaps"> λ</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">-</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">

                    rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">∕</hi> and for the ray F, sin.⅜(μ +

                <p>In this way Fraunhofer obtained the following indices of refraction for the

                <p>Before he proceeded to employ these results to the construction of achromatic
                    telescopes, Fraunhofer endeavoured to determine by exact measurement the
                    illuminating power of the spectrum at different points. In order to do this, he
                    constructed an apparatus represented in figs. 3 and 4, Plate CCCLXXXI. To an
                    eye-glass E, made on purpose for the telescope of the theodolite, he applied a
                    small plane metallic mirror«, the edge of which being well defined, cut the
                    field of the telescope in the middle, as shewn in the figure. It was placed at
                    an angle of 45° to the axis of the object-glass A, and in its focus. The
                    eye-glass E is pulled out till the edge of the small speculum <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> is distinctly seen. At the side of the eye-glass, and in a direction at
                    right angles to the edge of the speculum <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> or to the
                    axis of the telescope, he fixed a tube 6cB, cut at the point <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> in the direction of its length, and in this opening he placed a narrow'
                    and a shorter tube MN, whose section is seen at <hi rend="italic">b,</hi>
                    crossing the larger tube cB at right angles. A small flame, supplied with oil
                    from an external vessel, was placed in the tube MN, so as to be in the axis of
                    the tube cB. At the point of the narrow tube <hi rend="italic">I</hi> or MN,
                    where it was cut by the axis of the tube cB, was a small round aperture for
                    allowing the light of the flame to fall upon the speculum <hi rend="italic"
                    >a.</hi> Hence it follows that the eye at E will see in half of the field the
                    speculum <hi rend="italic">a</hi> illuminated by the flame, and in the other
                    half the colours of the spectrum formed by a prism placed, as formerly
                    described, before the object-glass A. By making the tube MN and the flame
                    approach the speculum, we increase its degree of illumination, and can therefore
                    make it equal to the illumination of the part of the spectrum which we wish to
                    determine. In this Avay he obtained for each coloured space in the spectrum a
                    certain distance of the flame from the speculum, which afforded a measure of the
                    intensity of illumination, the squares of the distances being inversely as the
                    intensities.</p>
                <p>“Though at first sight,” says Fraunhofer, “it appears difficult to compare the
                    light of two different colours, yet it becomes easy by a little practice. The
                    intensity of the light of the mirror approaches more to that of any colour in
                    the spectrum, if at the same position of the eye-glass its vertical margin is
                    less distinct. If the mirror is adjacent to a part of the spectrum more or less
                    illuminated, the edge of the mirror becomes, in both cases, more distinct;
                    because, in the first case, the mirror appears to be placed in the shadow, and
                    in the second case, it is the colour of the spectrum that is found there. The
                    experiment with the mirror is a little difficult and uncertain, if we perceive
                    clearly the lines of the spectrum, because the brightest and the darkest lines
                    touch one another almost in every colour. On this account the aperture in the
                    window-shutter is made so broad, that only the strongest lines are just visible,
                    and the fine ones not at all. In place of the mirror outside of the shutter by
                    which the light entered, I put a white plane surface illumi <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194562299" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2299-0418"/>nated by the sun, because by
                    any imperfection of the mirror the light is irregularly dispersed, which renders
                    the observations more dubious.</p>
                <p>“In order to vary the experiments, I at one time enlarged the round aperture
                    before the flame, and at other times I contracted itI placed also at the end <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> of the wide tube a piece of ground glass, through which the
                    mirror received its light. In this case I measured the distances of the flame
                    from the ground glass. To avoid all illusion, the aperture before the eye-glass
                    ought to be small, and to be at the place where the principal rays, or the axes
                    of the rays coming from the edge of the field, cut the axis of the telescope, λλ
                    ith the prism of flint glass, No. 13, having an angle of 26° 24' 5, I obtained
                    the following results. Though the experiments were made in clear weather, and at
                    noon, I sometimes perceived, in the course of the observations, a slight change
                    in the density of the light which the prism received. The differences in the
                    four sets of experiments may have been partly owing to this change, and the
                    flame may also have changed its intensity in the course of the observations. If
                    we call the intensity of the light at the brightest part of the spectrum 1, we
                    shall then have,”—</p>

                <p>The important results embodied in the preceding table, completely overturn the
                    opinion of Dr. Wollaston respecting the proportionality of the different
                    colours, and establish beyond all question the <hi rend="italic"
                    >irrationality</hi> of the coloured spaces. In the very first combination, for
                    example, <hi rend="italic">edflint</hi><hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lass</hi> and <hi rend="italic">water,</hi> the ratio of the dispersion of the
                    rays in the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> space BC, is as 1 to 2∙56, whereas in the
                    <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> space GH, it is as high as one to 3 ’ 726. In the
                    combination of <hi rend="italic">flint glass</hi> and <hi rend="italic">oil of
                    turpentine,</hi> we have a case where the irrationality is very trifling, and
                    what Fraunhofer has not observed, the irrationality is nothing between the <hi
                    rend="italic">orange</hi> and <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> spaces, and almost
                    nothing between the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >indigo,</hi> but very considerable between the <hi rend="italic">green</hi> and
                    all the other spaces, and a maximum between the green and the violet. The
                    differences of the ratios, too, are <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> or
                    diminishing in the two first or least refrangible spaces, <hi rend="italic"
                    >positive</hi> in all the rest, the <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> differences
                    nearly balancing the <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> ones; whereas, with very
                    trifling exceptions, the ratios increase towards the most refrangible extremity
                    of the spectrum.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that in the construction of achromatic object-glasses of flint and
                    crown glass, there must always be a considerable portion of outstanding colours
                    or <hi rend="italic">aberrations,</hi> as Fraunhofer calls it. Hence in place of
                    making the focal lengths of the two lenses in the exact ratio of their
                    dispersive powers, we must alter the ratio so as to make the outstanding colours
                    a minimum for the distinct vision of objects. But in order to do this, we must
                    take into account the intensity of illumination in the coloured spaces; for it
                    is obvious that a given irrationality in the yellow spaces, will, from the
                    intensity of its illumination, be much more regarded than a similar
                    irrationality in the violet space. As the outstanding rays, therefore, will be
                    injurious to distinct vision in proportion to their intensity, the distinctness
                    will be a maximum, as Fraunhofer has shewn, when the ratio of dispersion <hi

                    No. 13, is as 1 to 2O12; but Fraunhofer found that in an object-glass,
                    consisting of these two kinds of glass, the distinctness was a maximum when the
                    ratio was as 1 to l ’ 98.</p>
                <p>To the Chevalier Fraunhofer we owe also the discovery of fixed lines in the light
                    of the planets and fixed stars. As the light of our sun is defective in so many
                    rays, it was to be expected that the light of all the planets which he
                    illuminates, would be equally defective in the same rays. In the brighter
                    colours of the <hi rend="italic">Moon’s</hi> spectrum, we find the same fixed
                    lines as in the sun’s light, and in the same place. The spectra from the light
                    of <hi rend="italic">Mars</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Venus</hi> contained the
                    lines D, E, <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and F, of solar light, and precisely in
                    the same place. In the spectrum of <hi rend="italic">Sirius</hi> he was unable
                    to perceive fixed lines in the <hi rend="italic">orange</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">yellow</hi> colours, but in the <hi rend="italic">green</hi> he
                    saw a very strong streak, and in the <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> other two very
                    strong ones, having no resemblance to any of the lines in the solar spectrum.
                    <hi rend="italic">Castor</hi> gives a spectrum resembling that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sirius.</hi> The streak in the green was so intense, that
                    notwithstanding the weakness of the light, yet he ascertained by measurement
                    that it occupied the same place as the green streak in Sirius. He distinguished
                    also the two streaks in the blue, but he could not ascertain their place. In the
                    spectrum of <hi rend="italic">Pollux</hi> he found many weak and fixed lines,
                    which resembled those of <hi rend="italic">Venus.</hi> The line D he saw
                    distinctly, and occupying the same place as in the pure light. In the spectrum
                    of <hi rend="italic">Capella,</hi> he saw the lines D and <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> as in solar light. The spectrum of <hi rend="italic">Betalgeus</hi>
                    contains numerous fixed lines, which in a favourable atmosphere are sharply
                    defined. There were lines like the solar ones D and <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> In
                    the spectrum from <hi rend="italic">Procyon,</hi> some lines were perceived with
                    difficulty, but they were not sufficiently distinct to be measured. In the
                    orange space, however, he saw a line at D.</p>

                    that the highest temperature existed in the <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi> space.
                    Sir W∙ Herschel, however, found that the heating power increased from the <hi
                    rend="italic">violet</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> space, and that the
                    thermometer continued to rise when placed beyond the visible red extremity of
                    the spectrum. He therefore drew the conclusion that there were invisible rays in
                    the light of the sun which had the potver of producing heat, and which had a
                    less degree of refrangibility than red light. Sir W. Herschel attempted, in
                    vain, to determine the index of refraction of the extreme invisible ray which
                    possesses the power of heating; but he ascertained that at a point
                    one-and-a-half inches distant from the extreme red ray, the invisible rays
                    exerted a considerable heating power, even though the thermometer was placed at
                    the distance of fifty two inches from the prism.</p>

                    acquaint us with the kind of glass of which his prism was made. He obtained the
                    following results, which confinn those of Sir William Herschel.</p>

                <p>From our author’s own account of the method of making these experiments, we place
                    no confidence in the principal result respecting the invisible rays. <hi

                    says he, “it was not necessary to darken the room; and as I wished to accumulate
                    as large a portion of solar heat as possible, <hi rend="italic">1 placed the
                    prism in an open window”</hi> As the whole interest of these experiments was
                    concentrated in the determination of <hi rend="italic">invisible</hi> heating
                    rays, Sir Henry had a great deal to do with light, as the whole question turned
                    upon an exact appreciation of the <hi rend="italic">termination of the
                    spectrum.</hi> In a dark room the spectrum is much longer than in open day, and
                    we have reason to believe from experiment, that Sir Henry Englefield’s spectrum
                    did not visibly extend beyond the line C of Fraunhofer, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194562325" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2325-0420"/>so that his maximum
                    temperature of 79° was actually found in the red rays.</p>
                <p>With the view of throwing light upon this subject, Sir David Brewster has
                    endeavoured to ascertain the visible extent of the spectrum by various methods
                    of condensing the light, and absorbing by coloured media, the luminous parts of
                    the spectrum. By these means he has traced the visible spectrum, and the fixed
                    lines in it as far beyond the line A as the distance of the group of lines« is
                    from A, and has seen it indistinctly to a distance as great as AB beyond A.
                    Hence there cannot be the least doubt that the experiments beyond the visible
                    red were actually made when the thermometer was placed in the red space. He does
                    not, however, conclude from this that there are no invisible rays beyond the
                    red; but merely that the experiments of Herschel and Englefield were made in a
                    part of the spectrum where rays of light actually exist. On the contrary, our
                    author concludes that there are rays of heat of all degrees of refrangibility,
                    and consequently consisting of waves of all degrees of breadth and velocity.
                    When produced by a slight vibratory movement, the waves of heat are broad and
                    slow; as the temperature rises they become narrower and quicker in their motion.
                    When their velocity is such as to equal that of the extreme red ray, they become
                    faintly visible, and the other colours are successively produced by quicker
                    motion, till white light is radiated. This seems to be the process by which
                    incombustible bodies are gradually raised from the deepest red to the brightest
                    white; and if we examine, by means of a prism, the changes which take place in
                    the gradually increasing light, we shall find that the different rays of the
                    spectrum are successively added to the red light.<note anchored="true"

                <p>by Sir David Brewster, accounts in a very satisfactory manner for all the
                    phenomena. He conceives that transparent bodies have the same power of absorbing
                    or stopping certain rays of the thermometric spectrum, as Dr. Robison called it,
                    in the same manner as <hi rend="italic">coloured</hi> bodies have the power of
                    stopping certain rays of the luminous spectrum. These last bodies necessarily
                    became coloured by stopping certain rays; but as the eye is not sensible to heat
                    in thesame manneras tolight, the absorptive powerof transparent bodies for heat
                    can only be proved by the thermometer. He considers <hi rend="italic">water</hi>
                    as the type of bodies which are uniformly transparent for heat, as its maximum
                    of heat coincides with its maximum of light. A prism of crown glass, on the
                    contrary, is less uniformly transparent for heat; and its maximum of heat is in
                    the red space, because it has absorbed much of the heat in the yellow space. In
                    like manner flint glass has absorbed more of the heating rays in the red than
                    the crown glass, and hence its maximum is about the extremity of the red, or
                    beyond the end of the spectrum as commonly seen. In coloured media the maximum
                    ordinate of their luminous spectrum, shifts along the whole prismatic spectrum;
                    sometimes there are <hi rend="italic">two</hi> or <hi rend="italic">more
                    maxima</hi> of light, and sometimes narrow and wide spaces entirely defective in
                    light. Hence Sir David Brewster<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Professor Powell’s <hi rend="italic">Report,</hi> p. 293,
                    294.</p></note> supposes that there are defective spaces, and lines in the
                    thermometric spectrum.</p>
                <p>This view of the subject suggests a new mode of investigating the phenomena of
                    the heating rays. If we take a prism of coloured glass to investigate the dark
                    spaces and lines produced by absorbing media, we shall only have a very
                    imperfect approximation to the true result; that is, we never could have
                    absolutely dark spaces in the spectrum, as long as all the rays that went to the
                    formation of the spectrum, passed through <hi rend="italic">all the different
                    thicknesses of the prism.</hi> The thinnest parts of the prism allow all the
                    rays to pass, and consequently illuminate the whole spectrum, so that the
                    actions of various thicknesses of the media are confounded, and the real
                    absorptive action at a given thickness concealed. In like manner in the spectrum
                    of heat, the heating rays which pass through the thin parts of the prism, will
                    throw heat into every part of the spectrum; and hence the experiments should be
                    made with the frustums of prisms, where the difference of thickness is small,
                    and the want of area made up by an increased height of the prism. The best way,
                    however, of making the experiments, would be to use a compound prism constructed
                    as in the annexed figure, where AB, MN, is the section of a compound prism

                    of Jena exposed muriate of silver in various parts of the spectrum, and also
                    beyond its apparent limits. He found that the action was least of all in the red
                    rays, greater in the yellow, greater still in the blue and violet, and greatest
                    of all beyond the <hi rend="italic">visible</hi> violet rays. Dr. Wollaston and
                    Μ. Beckman obtained a similar result, apparently without knowing what had been
                    done by Ritter. In repeating the experiments of Scheele with white muriate of
                    silver, “he found that the blackness extended not only through the space
                    occupied by the violet, but to an equal degree, and to about an equal distance,
                    beyond the visible spectrum; and that by narrowing the pencil of light <hi

                    usually perceived, but to <hi rend="italic">invisible</hi> rays that accompany
                    them; and that if we include two kinds that are invisible, we may distinguish
                    upon the whole <hi rend="italic">six</hi> species of rays into which a sunbeam
                    is divided by refraction.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The phrase <hi rend="italic">almost entirely</hi> beyond the violet, used by Dr.
                    Wollaston, cannot be considered as indicating the existence of invisible rays,
                    even if we did not know from the experiments of Fraunhofer and others, that the
                    visible violet space extends greatly beyond the place where both Ritter and
                    Wollaston found the muriate of silver to be blackened. The existence of
                    invisible rays, therefore, however probable, cannot be regarded as a scientific
                    fact.</p>
                <p>The chemical action of the least refrangible rays upon gum guiacum was discovered
                    by Dr. Wollaston. Having washed a card with a solution of this gum in alcohol,
                    he found that it acquired a <hi rend="italic">green</hi> colour from the
                    concentrated violet and blue rays. No change of colour was effected by heat; but
                    in the red rays the tinged card lost its <hi rend="italic">green</hi> and
                    recovered its original colour. When the tinged card was placed in carbonic acid
                    gas, the violet rays could not make it green; but when made green as before, it
                    was speedily restored to its original yellow colour by the red rays. As Dr.
                    Wollaston found that the back of a heated silver spoon restored the green colour
                    as well as the red rays, we cannot attach any definite meaning to these
                    experiments.</p>
                <p>MM. Gay Lussac and Thenard discovered a very energetic chemical action of the
                    solar rays. On exposing to a pencil of solar light, a mixture of hydrogen gas
                    and caloric, in equal volumes, a detonation of the mixed gases took place, and
                    hydrochloric and (muriatic acid) was formed.</p>
                <p>Μ. Berard repeated the experiments with muriate of silver, and with the preceding
                    mixture of gases which he placed in the different coloured spaces of the
                    spectrum, and he found that the chemical action was in every case more powerful
                    towards the violet extremity and a little beyond it. Μ. Berard likewise
                    concentrated the least refrangible half of the spectrum by means of a lens, and
                    then the most refrangible half. The latter, though the most intense, produced no
                    effect upon the muriate of silver, but the former blackened it in less than ten
                    minutes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    rend="italic">Phil Trans.</hi> 1826, part ii. p. 136.</p></note> found that the
                    chemical rays passed as freely through blue glass coloured with cobalt, as
                    through colourless glass. Having dipped a piece of paper in a solution of
                    muriate of silver, and cut it into two parts, one of them was placed under a
                    blue glass, and the other under a white glass at the same instant. The one did
                    not become black more than the other, and there was no difference in the
                    intensity of their colour.</p>
                <p>Dr. Thomas Young made a very interesting experiment with the view of determining
                    if the invisible chemical rays interfered with the luminous ones. He produced
                    the Newlonian rings with a thin plate of air, and having formed an image of them
                    by means of the solar microscope, he threw this image upon paper dipped in a
                    solution of nitrate of silver, and placed it at the distance of about nine
                    inches from the microscope. “In the course of an hour,” says he, “portions of
                    three dark rings were very distinctly visible, much smaller than the brightest
                    rings of the coloured image, and coinciding very nearly, in their dimensions,
                    with the rings of violet light that appeared upon the interposition of violet
                    glass. I thought the dark rings were a little smaller than the violet rings, but
                    the difference was not sufficiently great to be accurately ascertained. It might
                    be as much as one-thirtieth, or one-forticth of the diameter, but not
                    greater.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    decisive experiment was afterwards performed by Μ. Arago, who formed a set of
                    fringes, by the interference of two solar pencils, proceeding from a common
                    origin, and having kept them very steadily for a long time upon the same part of
                    a piece of paper rubbed with muriate of silver, a series of black lines were
                    traced upon leaving their intervals, smaller than those of the dark and bright
                    fringes formed by violet light.</p>

                    Herschel a very interesting experiment on the chemical action of the violet

                    in the dark, a slight flocky sediment only being formed after long standing. But
                    if a fresh mixture, or an old one cleared by subsidence of this sediment, is
                    exposed to the sun’s rays, it instantly becomes milky, and a <hi rend="italic"

                    exposed to the sun’s rays, an infinite number of bubbles of carbonic acid are
                    disengaged, and the solution is like a syrup undergoing strong fermentation.</p>

                    teresting and apparently accurate experiments have concurred to indicate the
                    existence of this property of light, yet recent inquiries have thrown a
                    considerable doubt upon the conclusions which have been drawn from them. Dr.
                    Morich ni, a Roman physician, first succeeded in 1813, in magne: ising small
                    needles, by making a focus of the violet rays, collected by alens, pass
                    repeatedly from the middle to one and of a needle, without touching the other
                    half. By continuing this process for an hour, the needle had acquired distinct
                    polarity. This experiment was repeated successfully by the Marquis of Ridolfi
                    and Μ. Carpa; and Sir FI. Davy and Professor Playfair, and other English
                    philosophers, witnessed the successful performance of this experiment. Professor
                    Configliachi at Rome, with the benefit of an Italian sun, Μ. Berard of
                    Montpellier, and Μ. Dhombrc Firmas at Alais, failed in obtaining similar effects
                    from the violet rays, and hence the doctrine of the magnetic efficacy of blue
                    light was exploded both by the French and Italian philosophers.</p>
                <p>In 1825 Mrs. Somerville repeated, in a different way, the experiments of
                    Morichini. She took a slender sewing needle an inch long, quite devoid of
                    magnetism, and having covered half of it with paper, she fixed it to the ρannel
                    of the wall with wax, so that its uncovered half should receive the violet rays
                    of a spectrum formed by an equianglar prism of flint glass, whose refracting
                    faces were each 1∙4 by 14 inches, and which was placed about five feet from the
                    wall. The needle was placed in a vertical plane nearly perpendicular to the
                    magnetic meridian, and inclined to the horizon, and as the sun advanced to the
                    meridian, the needle was moved parallel to itself to keep it in the sun’s rays.
                    In less than two hours, when the sun had just passed the meridian, the exposed
                    half of the needle attracted the south and repelled the north pole of the
                    magnetic needle. A second experiment on the same day confirmed this result, and
                    similar effects were obtained by varying the circumstances of the
                    experiment.</p>
                <p>In the blue and green rays, the needles were magnet-tised but less frequently,
                    and always after a longer exposure, but the magnetism was always as strong as in
                    the violet. The indigo rays were nearly as efficacious as the violet. Pieces of
                    clock and watch spring were also magnetised after longer exposure, and magnetic
                    ncedlcs had their magnetism increased by the same means. When the violet rays
                    were concentrated with a lens, the magnetism was sooner conveyed to the ncedle.
                    When the halves of the needles and the pieces of spring were enveloped in violet
                    and green silk, they became magnetic also. Mrs. Somerville does not seem to have
                    tried as a check upon these results, the action of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >red</hi> rays of the spectrum. The blue glass, we are persuaded, transmitted
                    many of the red rays, and this experiment should have been made by using the
                    common sulphate of copper, which does not transmit, with a proper thickness, any
                    of the less refrangible rays.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In the same year, Professor Christie of Woolwich, made a series of elaborate
                    experiments on the action of the compound rays of the sun on a magnetised
                    needle, and also on needles of copper and glass. The needles were caused to
                    vibrate by the force of torsion in the white light of the sun, and he invariably
                    found that the arc of vibration was more rapidly diminished in the sun’s light
                    than in the shade. Professor Christie regards these facts as proving
                    incontestibly the existence of a magnetic influence in the solar rays, and
                    tending to restore the credit of Morichini’s experiments. He intended to make
                    his needles vibrate under the separated rays of the sun, and had an apparatus
                    prepared for the purpose; but we are not aware of his having either made these
                    experiments or published any account of them.<note anchored="true"

                    rough or without lustre, were magnetised by the action of the white light of the

                    polished, or had polished lines in the direction of their lengths, he could not
                    succeed in magnetising them.</p>
                <p>A less equivocal method of proving the magnetic influence of white light
                    presented itself to Professor Barlocci. An armed natural loadstone capable of
                    carrying a weight of l½ Roman pounds (a Roman lb. is equal to 339479 grammes)
                    after <hi rend="italic">three</hi><hi rend="italic">hours</hi> exposure to the
                    strong light of the sun, was able to carry 2 oz. or one-sixth of a lb. more, and
                    after an exposure of 24 hours its force was almost <hi rend="italic"
                    >doubled</hi> A second loadstone of nearly the same power was put into a dark
                    place of the same temperature as that of the solar rays, but acquired no
                    additional strength. A stronger magnet, which carried 5 lbs. 5 oz. and 2
                    deniers, was exposed to the light of a cloudy and humid atmosphere, and where it
                    snowed; but it acquired no additional power; while, during the two subsequent
                    days under a clear sky, its energy was more than doubled. The effect was not
                    increased by a lengthened exposure.</p>
                <p>Among the most active labourers in this department of science, we must rank Μ.
                    Zantedeschi of Pavia.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Journal of Science,</hi> No. V. N.S. 1830, p.
                    76.</p></note> He had early obtained results similar to those of Morichini, and
                    about the end of 1825, he had remarked, that suspended wire ncedlcs, devoid of
                    all magnetism, and having one of their ends exposed to the white light of the
                    sun under a glass receiver, turned that extremity to the north in the plane of
                    the magnetic meridian. In repeating the experiment of Barlocci with artificial
                    magnets, Μ. Zantedeschi found that a horse-shoe magnet, carrying 13⅜ ounces,
                    carried 3⅛ oz. more after three days exposure to the sun, and by continued
                    exposure, was able to carry 31 oz. He found also that the strength of oxidated
                    magnets was increased by solar light, and that it diminished in those that were
                    not oxidated. A loadstone, for example, not oxidated, lost 2½ oz. of its
                    strength by three hours exposure to solar light, whilst another oxidated and
                    similarly exposed, gained as much and even more strength. When the first was
                    polished like a mirror, its strength suffered no change by a prolonged exposure
                    to the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562364" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2364-0423"/>sun. He
                    likewise found that when a loadstone, whether oxidated or not, had its <hi
                    rend="italic">north pole</hi> exposed to the sun, it <hi rend="italic">acquired
                    strength,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">lost strength</hi> when its south pole was
                    exposed. In more than sixty experiments, the increase of strength varied from 1
                    to 2, and to 3⅜ oz. whereas the corresponding diminution was from 3½ to 5, and
                    to 5½ oz. In these experiments our author confesses that he often encountered
                    anomalies of which he could not detect the cause.</p>
                <p>In repeating the experiments of Professor Christie, Μ. Zantedeschi obtained
                    analogous results. Having placed a magnetic needle a foot long <hi rend="italic"
                    >in the shade,</hi> he drew its place of rest through an arch of 90°, and it
                    performed in 30" four oscillations, the last of which had a semi-amplitude
                    of70°. When exposed <hi rend="italic">to the solar rays,</hi> it performed in
                    the same time, and under the very same circumstances, four oscillations, the
                    last of which had only a semi-amplitude of 60°.</p>
                <p>A great degree of doubt has been east upon the conclusiveness of all these
                    researches, by a series of well-managed experiments made recently by MM. Riess
                    and Moser. The following experiments were made after the manner ofMori-chini.
                    The needles were made of soft steel; their mass was very small, and they
                    presented a considerable surface to the action of the light. The prism was
                    placed in the position of minimum deviation, which corresponds to the greatest
                    intensity of the light of the spectrum, the needles were placed on a graduated
                    circle, three or four feet from the prism. The lens used had an aperture of 1∙2
                    inches, and a focal length of 2∙3 inches, and by it the focus of the violet rays
                    was made to traverse one-half of the needle 200 times, excepting on the 10th
                    July and the 12th August, when it was done only 100 times, and on the 25th July,
                    when it was done 525 times. The following were the results which they obtained,
                    shewing no change in the number of oscillations.</p>

                <p>As <hi rend="italic">reflected</hi> light was not used in Morichini’s
                    experiments, which our author wished to verify, they employed the <hi

                    the needles <hi rend="italic">α, b, c,</hi> they fixed the spectrum by means of
                    a heliostate. They remark that the needle had been exposed 17½ hours to the
                    action of the sun without becoming magnetic, whereas Morichini succeeded in
                    magnetising his needles in from fifteen to thirty minutes.</p>
                <p>These gentlemen repeated also in a similar manner the experiments of Baumgartner,

                    any of the results which he had obtained. They tried also the action of
                    polarised light, but without any better success.<note anchored="true"

                    VII— <hi rend="italic">Pecent Discoveries respecting the Spectrum.</hi></p>
                <p>The analysis of white or compound light by the prism was made and perfected by
                    Sir Isaac Newton; but though the prism could not decompose them, he committed a
                    mistake in concluding that the colours of the spectrum were simple and
                    homogeneous; “that to the same degree of refrangibility ever belonged the same
                    colour, and to the same colour ever belonged the same degree of refrangibility.”
                    Now, though it is quite true that the <hi rend="italic">green</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">orange</hi> colours of the spectrum cannot be decomposed <hi
                    rend="italic">by the prism</hi> into more simple ones, the one into <hi
                    rend="italic">blue</hi> and <hi rend="italic">yellow,</hi> and the other into
                    <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi> and <hi rend="italic">red,</hi> yet they can be
                    decomposed by other means. This opinion respecting the compound nature of the
                    colours of the spectrum, and the inability of the prism to analyse them, was
                    first maintained by Sir David Brewster,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Transactions,</hi> vol. ix. p.
                    48.</p></note> who, with the view of placing it beyond a doubt, undertook a
                    series of experiments, in which he examined the effects produced on the solar
                    spectrum by viewing it through a great number of coloured media, and reflecting
                    it from coloured. By these experiments, he not only established the accuracy of
                    his first opinion, that the <hi rend="italic">green</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >orange</hi> colours of the spectrum were compound, the one consisting of <hi
                    rend="italic">blue</hi> and <hi rend="italic">yellow,</hi> and the other of <hi
                    rend="italic">red</hi> and <hi rend="italic">yellow,</hi> but was led to the
                    more general result, that the whole spectrum was compound, consisting of three
                    equal and superposed spectra of <hi rend="italic">red, yellow,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">blue</hi> light.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    The following are the general results which he obtained</p>
                <p>“1. White light consists of <hi rend="italic">three</hi> simple colours, <hi
                    rend="italic">red, yellow,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">blue,</hi> by the mixture
                    of which all other colours are formed.</p>
                <p>“2. The solar spectrum, whether formed by prisms of transparent bodies, or by
                    gratings or grooves in metallic and transparent surfaces, consists of <hi
                    rend="italic">three</hi> spectra of <hi rend="italic">equal length beginning and
                    terminating at the same points,</hi> viz. a <hi rend="italic">red</hi> spectrum,
                    a <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi> spectrum, and a <hi rend="italic">blue</hi>
                    spectrum.</p>
                <p>“3. All the colours in the solar spectrum are <hi rend="italic">compound</hi>
                    colours, each of them consisting of <hi rend="italic">red, yellow,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">blue</hi> light in different proportions.</p>
                <p>“4. A certain quantity of <hi rend="italic">white light,</hi> incapable of being
                    decomposed by the prism, in consequence of all its component rays having the
                    same refrangibility, exists at every <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562377"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-2377-0424"/>point of the spectrum, and may, at some points be
                    exhibited in an insulated state.</p>
                <p>“This remarkable structure of the spectrum will be better understood from figs.
                    88, 89, 90, which represent the three separate spectra, which are shewn in their
                    combined state in fig. 91∙</p>
                <p>“In all these figures, the point Μ corresponds with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >red,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">least refrangible</hi> extremity of the
                    spectrum, and N with the <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> or <hi rend="italic">most
                    refrangible</hi> extremity; and the ordinates <hi rend="italic">ax, bx, ex,</hi>
                    of the different curves MRN, MYN, MBN, represent the intensity of the <hi
                    rend="italic">red, yellow,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> ray at any point
                    <hi rend="italic">x</hi> of the spectrum.</p>
                <p>“If the distance Ma? in all these spectra be equal, then, in the combination of
                    them shewn in fig. 91, the ordinates <hi rend="italic">ax, bx, ex,</hi> will
                    indicate the nature and intensity of the colour at any pointa? of the red
                    spectrum. Thus, let</p>
                <p>“The ordinate for <hi rend="italic">red</hi> light íia?=30, <hi rend="italic"
                    >yellow bx=16, blue ex—</hi> 2, aa?+6a? + ca?=48 rays, then the point a? will be
                    illuminated with 48 rays of light, viz., 30 of red, 16 of yellow, and 2 of blue
                    light.</p>
                <p>“Now, as there must be certain quantities of red and yellow light which will form
                    white, when combined with two blue rays, let us assume these, and suppose that
                    white light, whose intensity is 10, will be formed by 3 red, 5 yellow, and 2
                    blue rays; hence it follows that the point a? is illuminated by</p>
                <p>“Red rays, 27</p>
                <p>Yellow rays, 11</p>
                <p>White light, 10</p>
                <p>48 rays, or, what is the same thing, the light at a? will be <hi rend="italic"
                    >orange,</hi> rendered brighter by a mixture <hi rend="italic">of</hi> white
                    light. The <hi rend="italic">two</hi> blue rays, therefore, which enter into the
                    composition of the light at a?, will not communicate any blue tinge to the
                    prevailing colour.</p>
                <p>“If the point a? is taken nearer Μ, and if, at that point, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >blue</hi> rays are more numerous in proportion to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >yellow</hi> than 2 to 5, that is, if they are as 3 to 5, then there will be one
                    blue ray more than what is necessary to make white light with the two yellow and
                    the three red rays, and this blue ray will give a blue tinge to that part of the
                    spectrum, or will modify the peculiar colour of <hi rend="italic">pure red</hi>
                    light. In like manner, the <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> extremity of the spectrum
                    may have its peculiar colour modified by an excess of <hi rend="italic">red</hi>
                    rays, so as to convert it into <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> light.”</p>
                <p>It would occupy too much space to bring forward the body of evidence which
                    supports these views, and we must therefore refer our readers to the original
                    memoir. We shall endeavour, however, in a few words, to prove the general
                    principle of the compound character of the prismatic colours, by facts stated by
                    persons who observed them, without any reference to this opinion. Sir Isaac
                    Newton and Fraunho for, and many persons besides, have, from long observation of
                    the solar spectrum, concluded that there is a <hi rend="italic">homogeneous
                    unmixed yellow,</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">homogeneous unmixed orange</hi>
                    space in the spectrum. Newton makes the <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi> space 40,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">orange</hi> 27, or 67 in all; while Fraunhofer makes
                    theyeZ- <hi rend="italic">low</hi> space 27, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >orange</hi> space 27, or 54 parts of aspectrum whose length is 360 parts. Now,
                    Dr. Wollaston declares that a beam of daylight is refracted by the prism into
                    <hi rend="italic">five colours</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">only,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">red, yellowish green, blue,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >violet,</hi> and he defines their limits with his usual accuracy. Dr. Young,
                    who repeated the same experiments with that exactness which was peculiar to him,
                    declares that the spectrum formed in Dr. Wollaston’s manner, consists of <hi
                    rend="italic">four colours</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">only,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >red, green, blue,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">violet,</hi> “the colours
                    differing scarcely at all in quality within their respective limits.” Now both
                    these accurate observers have rejected the <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">σrαnge</hi> spaces almost entirely, with the exception of the
                    narrow line of yellow light formerly mentioned, thus running counter to all the
                    observations of Newton and Fraunhofer. The cause ofsuch a difference is this:
                    The lightanalysed by Wollaston was the <hi rend="italic">blue light of the
                    sky,</hi> which had been deprived by absorption of many of its rays, having the
                    same refrangibility as those which fell upon the prism. Dr. Young’s <hi
                    rend="italic">green</hi> space was Sir Isaac Newton’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >yellow</hi> space, deprived of most of its <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi> rays,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> space adjoining the green was Newton’s <hi
                    rend="italic">orange</hi> space, deprived by the absorption of the atmosphere,
                    of almost all its yellow rays; and the sharp yellow line noticed by Dr. Young,
                    and regarded by Dr. Wollaston as a mixture of red and green light, as if these
                    spaces had overlapped a little, is part of the <hi rend="italic">orange</hi>
                    space of Fraunhofer and Newton, deprived of its <hi rend="italic">red</hi> rays.
                    This <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi> band can be produced artificially upon all
                    kinds of white light, and by the absorption of various media. Hence it is
                    obvious, that by comparing the light reflected and modified by the <hi
                    rend="italic">blue sky</hi> with the direct <hi rend="italic">light of the
                    sun,</hi> we may obtain irrefragable proof of the compound nature of the yellow
                    and orange spaces. That red light exists at the most refrangible extremity, is
                    obvious from its <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> colour; and that <hi
                    rend="italic">blue</hi> light exists at the <hi rend="italic">red</hi>
                    extremity, may be proved by the following observation of Sir W. Herschel.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Phil-Trans.</hi> 1800, vol. xc. p. 255.</p></note> He had occasion to view the
                    prismatic spectrum, when reflected from clear turned brass, and he observes,
                    “The colour of the brass <hi rend="italic">makes the red rays appear like
                    orange,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">the orange colour is likewise different from
                    what it aught to be”</hi> Here then, yellow light was seen at the very red end
                    of this spectrum, and it was seen in consequence <hi rend="italic">of blue</hi>
                    light having been absorbed by the brass, because <hi rend="italic">blue</hi>
                    light mixed with the <hi rend="italic">orange,</hi> observed by Sir W. Herschel,
                    would alone recompose the original red. Here, then, there is aproof that <hi
                    rend="italic">blue</hi> light, and <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi> light, and red
                    light, all exist in the same place, at the least refrangible end of the
                    spectrum. Effects similar to these may be produced by various coloured media,
                    such as chemical solutions, or the coloured juices of plants; and by such means
                    Sir David Brewster has succeeded <hi rend="italic">in insulating white light in
                    the spectrum, incapable of being decomposed by the prism.</hi> In a more recent
                    memoir, “On the connexion between the phenomena of the absorption of light and
                    those of thin plates,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Id. Id.</hi> 1837.</p></note> he has shewn that a
                    separation of rays of different colours but equal refrangibility, is effected by
                    the continued production of periodical colours by a number of thin plates acting
                    successively upon the same pencil.</p>
                <p>The existence of fixed lines in the spectrum, as discovered by Fraunhofer, was a
                    fact unexampled in science. Various coloured bodies were known to absorb
                    particular parts of the spectrum, and their peculiar colour was the necessary
                    consequence of this absorption. Some of them, such as smalt blue glass, produced
                    at a certain thickness several dark bands in the spectrum, but these bands

                    refrangible side of B, a part of the spectrum over which it exercises no general
                    absorptive action. This band lies in the space Bα of Fraunhofer’s map, so that

                    largest possible refracting angle, he formed a spectrum with the light of a lamp
                    transmitted through a small thickness of the gas, whose colour was a very pale
                    straw yellow, and he was surprised to observe the spectrum crossed with hundreds
                    of lines or bands, much more distinctly pronounced than those of the solar
                    spectrum. In the violet and blue spaces the lines were sharpest and darkest;
                    they were fainter in the green, and almost imperceptible in the yellow and red
                    spaces. By an increase in the thickness of the gas, the lines were better
                    developed in the yellow and red spaces, and became broader in the blue and
                    violet, a general absorption or extinction of the light advancing from the
                    violet extremity, while a specific absorption was going on, on each scale of the
                    lines or bands. It was not easy to obtain a sufficient thickness of gas to bring
                    out the lines at the red extremity, but our author found that heat produced the
                    same effect as an increase of thickness, and by greatly heating a tube half an
                    inch wide, and full of gas, he was able to exhibit the lines and bands to the
                    very extremity of the red space.</p>
                <p>“The power of heat alone,” says our author, “to render a gas which is almost
                    colourless as red as blood, without decomposing it, is in itself a most singular
                    result, and my surprise was greatly increased when I afterwards succeeded in
                    rendering the same pale nitrous acid gas so absolutely black by heat, that not a
                    ray of the brightest summer’s sun was capable of penetrating it. In making this
                    experiment the tubes frequently exploded, but by using a mask of mica and thick
                    gloves, and placing the tubes in cylinders of tinned iron, with narrow slits to
                    admit the light, there is little danger of any serious accident.”</p>
                <p>It is a remarkable fact that the liquified gas in the very same tube, produces
                    none of the fixed lines, and exercises no other action on the spectrum than any
                    ordinary fluid of the same orange colour.</p>
                <p>As the points of maximum absorption in coloured bodies were distinctly coincident
                    with some of the principal lines in the solar spectrum, our author suspected
                    that the same might be true with regard to the nitrous gas lines, and he
                    therefore formed the solar and the gaseous spectrum with light passing through
                    the same aperture, so that the lines in the one stood opposite to those in the
                    other, and their coincidence became a matter of simple observation. He then
                    superimposed the two spectra, when both were formed by solar light, and thus
                    exhibited at once the two series of lines and bands, with all their coincidences
                    and deviations. This phenomenon is one of the most splendid in physical
                    optics.</p>
                <p>“The general coincidence,” continues our author, “thus cognizable by the eye,
                    requires to be more particularly explained. Though some of the larger lines in
                    the gaseous spectrum coincide with some of the larger ones in the solar
                    spectrum, yet, in many cases, faint and narrow lines in the one coincided with
                    strong and broad lines in the other; and there were some strong gaseous lines,
                    and even broad bands, to which I could discover no counterpart in Fraunhofer’s
                    map of the spectrum, which at this stage of my inquiry was the standard to which
                    I appealed. This discrepancy at first embarrassed me, and as I observed it in
                    parts of the spectrum where Fraunhofer had drawn every line which he had seen
                    with his finest instruments, I abandoned all hopes of being able to establish
                    the general principle of their identity. I was therefore obliged either to
                    renounce this principle as one contradicted, or rather not confirmed by
                    observation, or to consider Fraunhofer’s delineations as in fault, and to enter
                    upon the Herculean task of making a better map of the spectrum.</p>
                <p>“After a little practice in the observation of the solar spectrum, I discovered
                    most of the lines which I had in vain sought for in Fraunhofer’s map, as the
                    counterpart of those in the gaseous spectrum. I saw well marked groups, of which
                    he had only given one of the lines, and shaded bands, and well defined lines,
                    which his method of observation had not permitted him to discover.</p>
                <p>“After I had laid down all the principal features in the spectrum, I was able to
                    examine the two classes of lines <hi rend="italic">pari passu.</hi> The action
                    of the gas upon invisible lines in the spectrum rendered them visible by
                    slightly enlarging them, and this enlargement of a solar line indicated the
                    existence of a corresponding line in the gaseous spectrum.</p>
                <p>“By this double process, and by methods of observation which I believe have never
                    before been used in optical researches, I have been able to execute three
                    different maps of the spectrum: <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> a map of the lines
                    in the solar spectrum; <hi rend="italic">secondly,</hi> a map of the same
                    spectrum, exhibiting at the same time the action of nitrous acid gas upon solar
                    light, previously deprived of a number of its definite rays; and, <hi
                    rend="italic">thirdly,</hi> a map shewing the action of the gas upon a
                    continuous and uninterrupted spectrum of artificial white light. The general
                    scale of these delineations is <hi rend="italic">four</hi> times greater than
                    that of Fraunhofer, but some portions of them are drawn on a scale <hi
                    rend="italic">twelve</hi> times greater, which became necessary from the
                    impossibility of representing in narrower limits the numerous lines and bands
                    which I have discovered. The length of Fraunhofer’s spectrum is 15½ inches;
                    mine, upon the same scale, is nearly 17 inches. The length of the general
                    spectrum, which I have delineated, is about <hi rend="italic">five</hi> feet
                    eight inches, and the length of a spectrum, corresponding to the scale on which
                    I have delineated parts of it, is <hi rend="italic">seventeen</hi> feet.</p>
                <p>“Fraunhofer has laid down in his map 354 lines, but in the delineations which I
                    have executed, the spectrum is divided into more than 2000 visible and easily
                    recognised portions, separated from each other by lines more or less marked,
                    according as we use the simple solar spectrum, or the solar and gaseous spectra
                    combined, or the gaseous spectrum itself, in which any breadth can be given to
                    the dark spaces.”</p>
                <p>In this minute examination of the spectrum, our author was led to the discovery
                    of a system of lines and bands, particularly in the red and green spaces, which
                    at other times wholly disappeared; but by a diligent comparison of these
                    observations, he found that these <hi rend="italic">lines and bands depended on
                    the proximity of the sun to the horizon, and were produced by the absorptive
                    action of the eartlds atmosphere.</hi> Sir David Brewster is about to publish
                    his map of the lines of the spectrum, as produced by the light of the sun
                    itself, and another map of the spectrum, as modified by the action of the
                    earth’s atmosphere. He has, however, made the following general observations on
                    the subject, in reference to the fixed lines of Fraunhofer :—“The atmosphere,”
                    he remarks, “acts very powerfully round the line D, and in the space immediately
                    on the least refrangible side of it. It developes a beautiful line in the middle
                    of the double line D, and by enlarging a group of small lines on the red side of
                    D, it creates a band almost as dark as the triple line D itself. It widens
                    generally all the lines, but especially the darkest one, which I call <hi
                    rend="italic">m,</hi> between C and D. It developes a band on the least
                    refrangible side of <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> and it acts especially upon
                    several lines, and developes a separate band <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562403"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-2403-0426"/>on the most refrangible side of C. The lines A, B,
                    and C are greatly widened, and lines and bands are particularly developed
                    between A and B, and generally throughout all the red space.</p>
                <p>“Most of the lines thus widened by the atmosphere are faint lines previously
                    existing in the spectrum, and I have no doubt that they would be seen in the
                    spectrum of the lime ball light condensed by a polyzonal lens, and acted upon by
                    thirty miles of atmosphere.</p>
                <p>“The absorptive action of the atmosphere shews itself in a less precise manner in
                    the production of dark bands, whose limits are not distinctly defined. A very
                    remarkable narrow one, corresponding to one produced by the nitrous acid gas, is
                    situated on the most refrangible side of C. Another very broad one lies on the
                    most refrangible side of D, close to a sharp and broad band of yellow light,
                    displayed by the general absorption of the corresponding part of the
                    superimposed blue spectrum. There is also an imperfectly defined atmospheric
                    action, corresponding to a group of lines where Dr. Wollaston placed his line
                    C.</p>
                <p>“This general description of the atmospheric lines, while it indicates the
                    remarkable fact, that the same absorptive elements which exist in nitrous acid
                    gas, exist also in the atmospheres of the sun and of the earth, leads us to
                    anticipate very interesting results from the examination of the spectra of the
                    planets. Fraunhofer had observed in the spectra of Venus and Mars some of the
                    principal lines of the solar spectrum. This, indeed, is a necessary consequence
                    of their being illuminated by the sun, for no change which the light of that
                    luminary can undergo is capable of replacing the rays which it has lost. But
                    while we must find in the spectra of the planets and their satellites, all the
                    defective lines in the solar spectrum, we may confidently look for others
                    arising from the double transit of the sun’s light through the atmospheres which
                    surround them.”</p>
                <p>FART V. ON PERIODICAL COLOURS.</p>
                <p>The phenomena of periodical, or recurrent colours, as Dr. Young has very
                    appropriately called them, are among the most interesting in optics, and have
                    been treated of by him with great ability, under our article on <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Chromatics,</hi> though not in that popular and descriptive
                    manner, which is required in a work like this. We shall therefore endeavour to
                    give as perspicuous an account as we can of this interesting portion of physical
                    optics.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I— <hi rend="italic">On the Interference of
                    Light.</hi></p>
                <p>The discovery of the interference of light in its simplest form, is due to
                    Grimaldi, as we have already seen. He admitted the sun’s light into a dark room,
                    through two small and equal apertures of a circular form. Two cones of diverging
                    light were thus formed, and by receiving them on a screen, held beyond the place
                    where the cones intersected each other, two overlapping luminous circles were
                    seen on the screen. A partially illuminated penumbra surrounded each of these
                    cones, and at the place where the rays from each aperture met, the screen was,
                    generally speaking, more strongly illuminated by the union of the two lights;
                    but the boundaries of thepenumbral portions which overlap are much darker than
                    the corresponding portions of the penumbra which do not overlap, as if the one
                    light had at this part put out the other. Upon intercepting the light from one
                    of the apertures, this dark part became brighter, and upon restoring the light
                    it again became darker. The result, therefore, was here unambiguous, and
                    justified the observation of Grimaldi, “that an illuminated surface may be
                    rendered darker by the addition of light.”</p>
                <p>Dr. Hooke made a similar experiment, and observed the darkness produced at the
                    overlapping part of the two cones; but this result, remarkable as it was, seems
                    to have excited no interest during nearly a century and a half, till Dr. Young,
                    who was unacquainted with the experiment of Grimaldi, obtained the same result
                    in a different manner, and* thus laid the foundation of the most interesting
                    department of physical optics. The following is the experiment which he gave as
                    <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">An Experimental Demonstration of the

                    small hole in a window shutter, and covered it with a piece of thick paper,
                    which I perforated with a fine needle. For greater convenience of observation I
                    placed a small looking-glass without the window shutter in such a position as to
                    reflect the sun’s light in a direction nearly horizontal upon the opposite wall,
                    and to cause the cone of diverging light to pass over a table on which were
                    several little screens of card paper. I brought into a sunbeam a slip of card
                    about +,th of an inch in breadth, and observed its shadow either on the wall, or
                    on other cards held at different distances. Beside the fringe of colour on each
                    side of the shadow, the shadow itself was' divided by similar parallel fringes
                    of smaller dimensions, differing in number according to the distance at which
                    the shadow was observed, but leaving the middle of the shadow always white. Now
                    these fringes were the joint effects of the portions of light passing on each
                    side of the slip of card, and inflected or rather diffracted into the shadow.
                    For a little screen being placed either before the card, or a few inches behind
                    it, so as either to throw the edge of its shadow on the margin of the card, or
                    to receive on its own margin the extremity of the shadow of the card, all the
                    fringes which had before been observed in the shadow on the wall, immediately
                    disappeared, although the light inflected on the other side was allowed to
                    retain its course, and although this light must have undergone any modification
                    that the proximity of the other edge of the slip of card might have been capable
                    of occasioning. . . . N,or was it for want of a sufficient intensity of light
                    that one of the two portions was incapable of producing the fringes alone; for
                    when they were both uninterrupted the lines appeared, even if the intensity was
                    reduced to one-tenth or one-twentieth.”</p>
                <p>Although this experiment is a very decisive one, yet Μ. Fresnel made one still
                    more instructive and general, and free from any of the objections that might
                    have been urged against that of Dr.</p>
                <p>Young. He took two plane mirrors Μ, N, which were inclined at a very great angle,
                    a little less than 180°, and having allowed a beam of light Rα, Ró, proceeding
                    from a luminous point R such us the focus of a small lens, he received the
                    reflected rays on a piece of paper PQ. If the light was homogeneous, there was
                    seen upon the paper a succession of bright and dark bands alternating. These
                    bands are parallel to the line of intersection of the two mirrors, and they are
                    placed symmetrically on both sides of a plane passing through the line of
                    intersection of the mirrors, and through apoint A bisecting the distance of the
                    pointsD, E, the virtuahpoints of divergence of the two reflected pencils <hi
                    rend="italic">aG, bG.</hi> That these parallel bands are produced by the mutual
                    interference of the two beamsjs at once proved by intercepting one of them, by
                    covering one of the mirrors, when the whole series disappears. It is found also
                    by measuring distances of the same bands from the line of intersection of the
                    mirrors, and when the paper PQ, is placed at different distances from the
                    mirrors, that their different <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562416"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-2416-0427"/>points lie in hyperbolas whose foci are D, E, and
                    common centre A.</p>
                <p>A still more simple and elegant method of exhibiting the phenomena of
                    interference, has been given by Professor Lloyd of Dublin, which any person may
                    repeat with a single piece of plate glass. Having placed horizontally a piece of
                    black glass QP, with his eye behind it at QM, he viewed by very oblique
                    reflexion, when the angle of incidence was nearly 90°, a horizontal narrow
                    aperture placed at A, a distance of three feet from the reflector QP. The proper
                    degree of obliquity was easily found by bringing the reflected image of the
                    aperture A to coincide very nearly with the direct image, in which case the
                    direction of the reflected plane BPQ, bisected the distance AA'. When the ray
                    AM, which fell directly upon the eye at Μ, interfered with the reflected rays
                    CM, which reached it by a longer path, they produced a system of fringes or
                    bands, which were distinctly visible when received upon an eye-piece placed at a
                    short distance from the reflector. This system of bands was exactly similar to
                    one-half of the system seen in Fresnel’s experiment. With compound white light
                    the first band was a <hi rend="italic">bright</hi> one and <hi rend="italic"
                    >colourless.</hi> This was followed by a very sharply defined black band; then
                    came a coloured, and so on alternately, seven alternations being easily counted,
                    and the breadth of the bands being, as near as the eye could judge, the same
                    throughout the series, and increasing with the obliquity of the reflected beam.
                    “The first dark band was of <hi rend="italic">intense blackness,</hi> but the
                    darkness of the succeeding bands were less intense, as they were of higher
                    orders, and after three or four orders they were completely obliterated by the
                    closing in of the bright bands. At the same time the coloration of the bright
                    bands increased with the order of the band, until after six or seven
                    alternations, the colours of different orders became superimposed, and the bands
                    were thus lost in a diffused light of nearly uniform intensity.”<note

                    xvii.</p></note> “These bands,” continues Professor Lloyd, “are most perfectly
                    defined when the eye-piece is close to the reflector. Their breadth and
                    coloration increased with the distance of the eye-piece, but remained of a
                    finite and very sensible magnitude, when the latter was brought into actual
                    contact with the edge, a circumstance which distinguished them altogether from
                    the diffracted fringes formed on the boundary of the shadow.”</p>
                <p>When homogeneous light is used, the bands are alternately bright and dark, and
                    varying in magnitude with the refrangibility of the light, as will be afterwards
                    more fully explained. If the light of the sun is used, the bands may be
                    distinctly seen upon a white screen placed atMQ,. That they are produced by
                    interference may be easily proved, either by stopping the direct ray AM, or the
                    reflected ones CM, when the whole system of bands disappears.</p>
                <p>The leading phenomena of interference may be likewise exhibited by transmitting
                    the light emanating from a luminous point through the two faces of a prism, the
                    inclination of which is about 180°. The pencil or ray passing through one of the
                    faces, will be slightly inclined to the ray passing through the other, at a
                    small angle, and will interfere with it at their point of concourse, and produce
                    the usual fringes. This form of the experiment is described by Sir Isaac Newton,
                    who considered the fringes as produced by inflexion.</p>
                <p>In all the preceding experiments two pencils of light issuing from the same
                    pointer luminous origin, are made again to meet, the one having arrived at the
                    point of concourse by a different and a longer path. Now it is obvious from the
                    experiments, that when the two portions of light thus intervening reach the spot
                    where they interfere by paths exactly equal, they form a bright fringe, having
                    the intensity of its light greater than that of either portion. It is also
                    evident that other bright fringes are produced, when their paths differ in
                    length; and if we suppose <hi rend="italic">d</hi> to be the difference of paths
                    by which the second bright fringe is produced, similar bright fringes will be
                    produced when the differences in the lengths of the paths arc <hi rend="italic"
                    >2d, ‘3d, 4d, 5d, 6d, &amp;C.</hi> But it is manifest from the preceding
                    experiments, that if the two portions of light interfere at intermediate points,
                    or when the difference in the length of their paths is ½√,∙ d <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> + ½i∕,∙ 2√+½&lt;∕,∙ 3rZ+½&lt;∕; 4√+½J, &amp;c. the
                    two interfering portions <hi rend="italic">destroy each other</hi> and produce
                    blackness, as appears from the dark fringes lying between the bright ones. Here,
                    then, we have a remarkable property of light established by direct experiment,
                    and well fitted to guide us in our inquiries into the physical cause of the
                    various phenomena of light. We shall find the same beautiful property shewing
                    itself under various aspects in a succession of interesting phenomena, which we
                    shall now proceed to describe.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II— <hi rend="italic">On the Colours of Thin
                    Plates.</hi></p>
                <p>The colours of thin plates were first observed by Mr. Boyle, who remarks that all
                    chemical essential oils, as also good spirits of wine, by shaking till they rise
                    in bubbles, appear of various colours, which immediately vanish when the bubles
                    burst, so that a colourless liquor may be immediately made to exhibit a variety
                    of colours, and lose them in a moment, without any change in its essential
                    principles. Mr. Boyle also noticed these colours in soap bubbles and in
                    turpentine, and he succeeded in blowing glass sufficiently thin to exhibit them.
                    In 1666 Lord Brereton observed similar colours produced by the thin plates which
                    are formed on the surface of glass by the action of the weather. In the year
                    1672 Dr. Hooke exhibited to the Royal Society a soap bubble with all its
                    colours, in fulfilment of a promise which he had made at a previous meeting, “to
                    exhibit something which had neither refraction nor reflexion, and yet was
                    diaphanous.” “By means of a glass pipe he blew several small bubbles out of a
                    mixture of soap and water, when it was observable that at first they appeared
                    white and clear, but that after some time the film growing thinner, there
                    appeared upon it all the colours of the rainbow, first a pale yellow, then
                    orange, red, purple, blue, green, with the same series of colours repeated.” Dr.
                    Hooke made considerable progress in the investigation of this class of
                    phenomena, and made experiments with thin plates of Muscovy glass, (Mica). He
                    found that a faint yellow plate of this substance laid upon a blue one
                    constituted a very dark purple; and Sir Isaac Newton, in a private letter to Dr.
                    Hooke, a copy of which is now before us,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Bated Cambridge, February 5, 1G75-6.</p></note> acknowledges
                    that Hooke had observed previous to him, “the dilatation of the coloured rings
                    by the obliquation of the eye, and the apparition of a black spot at the contact
                    of two convex lenses, and at the top of a water bubble.”</p>
                <p>Sir Isaac Newton, whose investigations we shall presently give in his own words,
                    made great progress in discovering the law of the phenomena, and it is a curious
                    fact not to be overlooked by physical inquirers, that his theory of the
                    phenomena, elaborated with the utmost care and generalising an extensive series
                    of facts, is now exploded, while the theoretical views of Dr. Hooke are almost
                    universally admitted.</p>
                <p>Mr. Melville of Edinburgh proposed to make a permanent soap bubble by freezing,
                    but we believe the experiment <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562429"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-2429-0428"/>has never yet succeeded. Dr. Joseph Reade has
                    however been more fortunate in making what may be called a permanent soap
                    bubble, for illustrating the colours of thin plates, which we saw him exhibit at
                    the meeting of the Physical Section of the British Association at Liverpool in
                    1837. The following is his own account of the method of making it: “Having put
                    two ounces of distilled water into an eight-ounce phial, and having added about
                    the size of a large pea of Castile soap, I placed the bottle in a saucepan of
                    boiling water on the fire; the bottle was speedily filled with a dense volume of
                    vapour, which expelled all the air. I now corked it, and after cooling and thus
                    condensing the vapour, had perhaps as perfect a vacuum as could be formed, even
                    by the best air-pump. I now held the bottle laterally between my hands, and by
                    means of a circular and brisk motion formed a circular film, on which by resting
                    the bottle on an inclined plane, were formed after a short time, all the
                    parallel bands or series of colours in the following order: 1. a white or
                    silvery segment at top; 2. a snuff-coloured brown, inclined at bottom to a deep
                    red; 3. blue; 4. yellow; 5. red; 6. blue; 7∙ green; 8. red; 9∙ green; 10. red;
                    11. green. (As in fig. A.)</p>
                <p>“After some time a black segment was seen to form at the top of the white, and
                    continually to increase in size. (See fig. B.) After a few minutes the parallel
                    bands increased in breadth, and running into one another, only three or four
                    distinct bands were seen. Nothing can exceed the beauty of these colours, equal
                    to those of the rainbow, or the plumage of the tropics: whilst writing this
                    description, I have these bands in a bottle before me, feasting my eyes on their
                    beauty. In a few minutes more this black segment or aqueous film occupies,
                    perhaps, half the circular film, and the lower half becomes white tinged with
                    orange. (See fig. C.)</p>
                <p>“If we now incline the bottle towards the experimenter’s breast, the saponaceous
                    atoms producing·these colours, are seen to float in the region of the black or
                    aqueous; when placed again on the inclined plane, they fall to the bottom of the
                    film. In some time more the entire filrn becomes black, and all the colours
                    disappear.</p>
                <p>“Having now placed the bottle in a basin of boiling water, the evaporation was
                    increased, and the black film soon became clothed with saponaceous atoms, which
                    being variously condensed, produced all the colours of the clouds when the sun
                    is setting on a summer’s evening. On again placing the bottle on the inclined
                    plane, the parallel bands were again formed by the attraction of cohesion, and
                    the colours afterwards gave place to the black film. I held the bottle laterally
                    between my hands, and by means of a circular motion washed it, and thus clothed
                    it with saponaceous atoms, which went through the same process on placing the
                    bottle on the inclined plane. By means of washing the film every morning, I
                    preserved it for more than three weeks.”</p>
                <p>The colours of thin plates are often exhibited in nature in the most beautiful
                    manner. On the surface of little pools of mossy water, and especially in the
                    proximity of springs containing iron, we observe thin bright films generally
                    whitish and often yellow and reddish. Between the plates of a mass of mica, and
                    sulphate of lime, and talc, we observe thousands of open spaces where the rings
                    are sometimes circular, consisting only of the first tint above blackness, viz.,
                    the white of the first order, sometimes two, three, of more colours according to
                    their size, while at other times the rings or fringes are extremely numerous and
                    often irregular. These colours are all produced by thin plates of air or of
                    vacuity in these fissile minerals, and the colours may be all changed by
                    admitting water or fluids of different refractive powers. In some specimens of
                    Labrador felspar, Sir David Brewster has found crystallised cavities so thin or
                    with so little depth, as to give the most splendid colours of thin plates, and
                    to afford one of the finest subjects of popular display in the microscope.<note

                    produced by heat on highly polished steel, are all the colours of a thin plate

                    of grates.</p>
                <p>When glass is exposed to the action of the weather, its surface acquiresathin
                    film, which atfirst can only be rendered visible by examining the faint
                    lightreflected from itwhenitis in contact with a fluid of nearly the same
                    refractive power. It forms most rapidly on the panes of glass in stable windows,
                    but it is seen in the highest perfection in the specimens of decomposed glass
                    found among the remains of Roman buildings. The <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    glass is to a certain depth entirely decomposed into thin films of extreme
                    beauty, reflecting the most brilliant colours to the eye, and transmitting tints
                    of the most exquisite brilliancy, and far surpassing any of the colours produced
                    by art.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    extreme tenuity.</p>
                <p>When we breathe upon glass at a proper temperature, and examine with a magnifier
                    the margin of the film while evaporating, or when we observe the evaporation of
                    different volatile fluids, we shall perceive many interesting examples of the
                    colour of thin plates.</p>
                <p>One of the finest exhibitions of this kind with which we are acquainted, is that
                    which is produced by the ammonio-sulphate of copper, and which was observed by
                    Sir David Brewster. A solution of the ammonio-sulphate of copper in water, is
                    spread upon a clear plate of glass or any other surface. In the course of an
                    hour or two, a similarly coloured film is formed upon its surface, exhibiting
                    the colours of thin plates from the white of the first order upwards. When the
                    solution is strong, or the stratum of fluid deep, the thickness of the film
                    increases, and the colours rise to higher orders, of a beautiful green and pink
                    colour. When the colours are such as we would wish to preserve, an aperture must
                    be made in the film, and by inclining the plate the fluid must be allowed to run
                    out slowly, leaving the film on the surface of the glass. This film will become
                    hard and permanent after the aqueous part of it has been evaporated. The fringes
                    of colour take the shape of the mass of fluid, or of the piece of glass whose
                    surface is covered with it.</p>
                <p>One of the most extraordinary examples of the colours of thin plates, or rather
                    of the blackness that immediately precedes these colours, and one which almost
                    requires the evidence of ocular demonstration to credit, is the existence of
                    filaments, or of a down of quartz so exceedingly minute as to be incapable of
                    reflecting light. The very remarkable specimen of quartz in which this was
                    discovered by Sir David Brewster belongs to the cabinet of the Duchess of
                    Gordon. The original crystal was 2½ inches in diameter, and of a light smoky
                    colour, but impervious to light except in small pieces. Mr. Sanderson, lapidary
                    in Edinburgh, had broken up the crystal for the purposes of his profession, but
                    the apparent foulness of the fracture induced him to lay it aside. The following
                    is an account given by Sir David Brewster, of the principal fracture.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562442" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2442-0429"/>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> κ</hi> At first sight, the absolute blackness of the
                    separated surfaces seemed to me as it did to every one, to be owing to a thin
                    film of opaque and minutely divided matter that had insinuated itself into a
                    fissure of the crystal; but this opinion was immediately overturned when I
                    observed that both surfaces were equally and uniformly black, and that they were
                    also perfectly transparent by transmitted light.</p>
                <p>“Although I had now no doubt that the phenomenon was entirely of an optical
                    nature, and that the blackness of the surfaces arose from their being composed
                    of short and slender filaments of quartz, whose diameter was so exceedingly
                    small that they were incapable of reflecting a single ray of the strongest
                    light, yet it became desirable to establish this curious fact by experimental
                    evidence.</p>
                <p>“Having found that no detergent substances either removed or diminished the
                    superficial blackness, I subjected the fragment to the action of cold and hot
                    acids; but the surface continued unaltered by these operations. I now immersed
                    the fragment in oil of anise seed, which approaches to quartz in its refractive
                    power, and upon examining the light reflected at the separating surfaces of the
                    oil and the quartz, I found that the blackness disappeared, and that the
                    fragment, whether seen by reflected or transmitted light, comported itself like
                    any other piece of quartz of the same translucency. Upon removing the oil from
                    the surfaces, it resumed its original blackness, and the filamentous or velvety
                    nature of the surface was rendered evident to the eye by the slight change of
                    tint which was produced by pressing the filaments to one side.</p>
                <p>“As the preceding experiments are sufficient to prove that the size of the minute
                    filaments was less than the thickness of a thin plate of quartz which lost the
                    power of reflecting light, it became interesting to obtain an approximate
                    measure of their magnitude. The thinnest substance ever observed, is the aqueous
                    films of the soap bubble previous to its bursting. Newton, however, remarked
                    that the films still reflected a faint image of the candle or of the sun. Hence
                    its thickness must have corresponded nearly with what Newton calls the <hi
                    rend="italic">beginning of black,</hi> which appeal’s in water at a thickness of
                    the 750,000th part of an inch. The tint, however, of the quartz surface is of a
                    much deeper character, and cannot exceed the <hi rend="italic">very black
                    of</hi> Newton’s scale which corresponds in <hi rend="italic">quartz</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">one-third of the one-millionth part of an inch,</hi> or to <hi
                    rend="italic">one-fourth</hi> of the thinnest part of the soap bubble.</p>
                <p>“If the two surfaces of quartz had separated by filaments of a larger size, the
                    colour of the filamentous surface might have been <hi rend="italic">red,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">blue,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">yellow,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">green</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but though such a structure
                    would have been more dazzling to the eye, it yet would have been less wonderful
                    than the one which has now been described.”</p>
                <p>The colours of thin plates may also be exhibited by pressing together two glass
                    prisms that have moderate refracting angles. Various coloured fringes or
                    portions of coloured rings will be seen by viewing the light reflected from the
                    surfaces in contact, and in a much fainter degree, by examining the transmitted
                    light. The same phenomena may be seen with unusual brilliancy, by taking a thick
                    piece of glass, and having made a scratch on one side of it with a file, apply a
                    heated wire to the scratch, so as to produce a crack in the glass, which may be
                    extended at pleasure by a second and third application of the hot wire. If we
                    now examine the surface of this crack in different directions, we shall see it
                    covered with coloured fringes, which may be made to vary in breadth and
                    position, by opening or closing the crack with the force of the hand.</p>
                <p>When we wish to examine and measure the coloured rings with care, the method used
                    first by Hooke, and subsequently by Newton, should be adopted. Two convex lenses
                    of very long focal length are placed the one above the other, so as to touch at
                    their vertex; or a plano-convex lens may have its plane side AB laid upon the
                    convex side CD, fig. 97, of another lens. Sir Isaac Newton used for the
                    uppermost lens a plano-convex one, whose focal length was fourteen feet, and for
                    the lowermost a double convex lens, whose focal length was fifty feet. These
                    lenses must then be held together, and pressed if necessary by three clamp
                    screws, as shewn in fig. 95. The following is the general account of the
                    phenomenon given by Sir Isaac Newton, though somewhat abridged:—</p>
                <p>“Next to the pellucid central spot made by the contact <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    the glasses, succeeded <hi rend="italic">blue, white, yellow,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">red.</hi> The blue was so little in quantity, that I could not
                    distinguish any violet in it, but the <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">red</hi> were as copious as the <hi rend="italic">τvhite,</hi>
                    though four or five times more than the <hi rend="italic">blue.</hi> The next
                    order of colours round those in the <hi rend="italic">second,</hi> was <hi
                    rend="italic">violet, blue, green, yellow,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">red,</hi>
                    all of them copious and vivid except the green. The <hi rend="italic">third</hi>
                    order was <hi rend="italic">purple, blue, green, yellow,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">red,</hi> the green being more vivid than in the last order. The
                    <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> order was only <hi rend="italic">green</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">red,</hi> the green being copious and lively, being bluish on
                    one side, and yellowish on the other. The red was very imperfect: the succeeding
                    rings or orders of colours were very faint; and after three or four orders, they
                    ended in perfect whiteness. The form of the whole system of rings, when the
                    lenses were most compressed, so as to produce the black spot in the centre, as

                <p>In order to find the interval between the glasses, or the thickness of the plate
                    of included air (or space) at which each colour was produced, Sir Isaac measured
                    the diameter of the first six rings at their brightest part, and found their
                    squares to be in the arithmetical progression of the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9,
                    &amp;c., and the intervals between the glasses are obviously in the same
                    progression, one of the surfaces being plane, and the other spherical. He then
                    measured the diameter of the rings at their darkest points, and found their
                    squares to be in the arithmetical progression of the even numbers, 2, 4, 6, 8,
                    10, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In order to find the absolute thickness of the plate of air or space at which
                    these different rings were produced, he measured the diameter of the fifth ring
                    at its darkest point as produced by the different object-glasses.</p>

                <p>From the results given in the preceding table, Sir Isaac Newton has deduced the
                    following rule :—“That the thickness of the air is proportional to the secant of
                    an angle, whose sine is a certain mean proportional between the sines of
                    incidence and refraction; and that mean proportional, so far as, by these
                    measures, I can determine it, is the first of an 106 arithmetical mean
                    proportionals between these sines counted from the higher sine, that is, from
                    the sine of refraction when the refraction is made out of the glass into the
                    plate of air, or from the sine of incidence when the refraction is made out of
                    the plate of air into the glass.”</p>
                <p>Sir Isaac next proceeds to describe the rings formed by the light transmitted
                    through the two glasses. In this system of transmitted rings, the order of the
                    colours was <hi rend="italic">yellowish red</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">black, violet, blue, white, yellow, red</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">violet, blue, green, yellow, red.</hi> The colours in
                    these rings are very faint at a perpendicular incidence, but become brighter as
                    the incidence increases.</p>
                <p>In fig. 97 Sir Isaac has represented the different colours reflected and
                    transmitted, AB and CD being the surfaces of the glasses which touch at E, and
                    the lines uniting them representing their distances in arithmetical progression.
                    The words above the straight line AB arc the colours of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >reflected</hi> rings, and those below the circular arch CD those of the
                    transmitted rings.</p>
                <p>When water was introduced between the lenses, the colours became fainter, and the
                    rings less, and Sir Isaac found that the intervals were inversely as the indices
                    of refraction in water and air.</p>
                <p>The rings were always larger in the homogeneous <hi rend="italic">red</hi> light
                    of the spectrum than in the <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> light, in the ratio of
                    14½ to 9, and he concluded from more detailed observations that the thicknesses
                    of the air between the glasses when the rays were successively formed by the
                    limits of the seven different colours, <hi rend="italic">red, orange, yellow,
                    green, blue, indigo,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">violet,</hi> are to one another
                    as the cube roots of the squares of the eight lengths of a cord which sound the
                    notes in an eighth, <hi rend="italic">sol, la, fa, sol, la, mi, fa, sol,</hi>
                    that is, in the cube roots of the squares of the numbers 1, ∣, £, ∣, f, ∣, <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ¾, ½ or 1; 0-924; 0∙885; 0∙825; 0-763; 0∙71l; 0-681;
                    0-6.30, that is, if 1 be the interior diameter of any such red ring formed by
                    the extreme red rays, the cube root of § will be the interior diameter of a ring
                    at the boundary of the red and orange, and so on.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It has been noticed by Μ. L∣e Blanc, that if
                    the two extreme terms of the preceding numbers, or any other two equidistant
                    from th extremes be multiplied together, their product will always be equal to
                    ⅛</p></note></p>
                <p>The colours of thin plates of fluid or solid bodies are not so easily studied as
                    those of air, from the difficulty of procuring, and working with, such
                    evanescent films. Sir Isaac Newton, however, studied them in soap bubbles which,
                    as soon as they were blown, he covered with a clear glass. In this way he
                    observed the colours to emerge like so many concentric rings surrounding the
                    summit of the bubble. As the bubble became thinner, and the subsidence and
                    evaporation of the water, the rings dilated slowly, till they covered the whole
                    bubble, descending in order to the bottom of it, till where they vanished
                    successively. After all the colours were emerged at the top, there grew in the
                    centre of the rings a small round black spot, which continually dilated itself
                    till it became sometimes more than a-half or three quarters of an inch in
                    breadth before the bubble broke. Some light was still reflected from the water
                    at this spot, and Sir Isaac saw within it several smaller round spots much
                    blacker and <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562468" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2468-0431"
                    />darker than the rest, but still capable, like the larger one, of reflecting
                    faintly an image of the sun.</p>
                <p>By observing how much the colours at the same places of the bubble, or at divers
                    places of equal thicknesses, were varied by the several obliquities of the
                    rings, Sir Isaac obtained the following thicknesses of the water requisite to
                    exhibit one and the same colour at several obliquities :—</p>

                <p>These results harmonise entirely with the rule already given for thin plates of
                    air.</p>
                <p>When the system of rings seen by reflection was examined by a prism, and perhaps
                    only eight rings visible, Sir Isaac counted sometimes more than forty on the
                    side of the system to which the refraction was made, though he reckoned by
                    estimation more than a hundred. Soap bubbles also, before they exhibited any
                    colours to the naked eye, have appeared through a prism girded about with many
                    parallel and horizontal rings, to produce which effect it was necessary to hold
                    the prism parallel, or very nearly parallel to the horizon, and to dispose it so
                    that the rings might be refracted upwards.</p>
                <p>Sir Isaac then proceeds to a very important part of the subject, namely, to
                    explain the composition of the colours of thin plates, a topic of great interest
                    and extensive application: “Let there be taken,” says he, “on any right line
                    from the point Y, fig. 98, the lengths YA, YB, YC, YD,</p>
                <p>&amp;c. in the proportion of the numbers, 6300, 6814, 7114, 8255,8855,9243,1000;
                    and at the points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, &amp;c. let perpendiculars Aα, Bß, Cγ,
                    &amp;c. be erected by whose intervals the extent of the several colours set
                    underneath against them is to be represented. Then divide the line Aα in such
                    proportions as the Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>set at the points of division denote, and through these divisions from Y draw
                    lines IL, 2K, 3L, 5Μ, 6N.</p>
                <p>Now, if A2 be supposed to represent the thickness of any thin transparent body,
                    of which the internal violet is most copiously reflected on the first ring, then
                    HKwill represent its thickness, at which the outermost red is most copiously
                    reflected in the same series. Also A6 and HN will denote the thicknesses at
                    which those extreme colours are most copiously reflected in the second series,
                    and A10 and HQ, the thicknesses at which they are most copiously reflected in
                    the third series, and so on. And the thickness at which any of the intermediate
                    colours are reflected most copiously, will be defined by the distance of the
                    line AH from the intermediate parts of the lines 2 K, 6 N, 10 Q, &amp;c. against
                    which the names of those colours are written below.</p>
                <p>But, farther, to define the latitude of these colours in each ring or series, let
                    A 1 be the least thickness and A 3 the greatest thickness, at which the extreme
                    violet in the first series is reflected, and let HI, and HL, be the like limits
                    for the extreme red, and let the intermediate colours be limited by the
                    intermediate parts of the lines 1 I, 3 L, against which the names of those
                    colours are written, and so on. But yet with this caution, that the reflections
                    be supposed strongest at the intermediate spaces, 2 K, 6 N, 10 Q, &amp;c. and
                    from thence to decrease gradually towards these limits, 1 I, 3 L, 5 Μ, 7 O,
                    &amp;c. on either side; where you must not conceive them to be precisely
                    limited, but to decay indefinitely. And whereas I have assigned the same
                    latitude to every series; I did it, because although the colours in the first
                    series seem to be a little broader than the rest, by reason of a stronger
                    reflexion there, yet that inequality is so insensible as scarcely to be
                    determined by observation.</p>
                <p>Now, according to this description, conceiving that the rays, originally of
                    several colours, are by turns reflected at the spaces 1 I L 3, 5 Μ 0 7, 9P R 11,
                    &amp;c. and transmitted at the spaces AHI 1, 3LM5, 7 OP 9, &amp;c. it is easy to
                    know what colour must in the open air be exhibited at any thickness of a
                    transparent thin body. For, if a ruler be applied parallel to AH, at that
                    distance from it by which the thickness of the body is represented, the
                    alternate spaces 1 IL 3, 5 MO 7, &amp;c. which it crosseth, will denote the
                    reflected original colours, of which the colour exhibited in the open air is
                    compounded. Thus, if the constitution of the green in the third series of
                    colours be desired, apply the ruler as you see at π <hi rend="italic">p σ
                    φ,</hi> and by its passing through some of the blue at τr, and yellow at <hi
                    rend="italic">σ,</hi> as well as through the green at <hi rend="italic">p,</hi>
                    you may conclude that the green exhibited at that thickness of the body is
                    principally consituted of original green, but not without a mixture of some blue
                    and yellow.</p>
                <p>By this means you may know how the colours from the centre of the outward rings
                    ought to succeed in order as they were described. For, if you move the ruler
                    gradually from AH through all distances, having passed over the first space
                    which denotes little or no reflexion to be made by the thinnest substances, it
                    will first arrive at 1 the violet, and then very quickly at the blue and green,
                    which, together with that violet compound blue, and then at the yellow and red,
                    by whose farther addition that blue is converted into whiteness, which whiteness
                    continues during the transit of the edge of the ruler from I to 3, and after
                    that by the successive deficiency of its component colours, turns first to
                    compound yellow, and then to red, and last of all the red ceaseth at L. Then
                    begin the colours of the second series, which succeed in order during the
                    transit of the edge of the ruler from 5 to 0, and are more lively than before,
                    because more expanded and severed. And for the same reason, instead of the
                    former white there intercedes between the blue and yellow a mixture of orange,
                    yellow, green, blue, and indigo, all which together ought <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194562481" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2481-0432"/>to exhibit a dilute and
                    imperfect green. So the colours of the third series all succeed in order; first,
                    the violet, which 'a little interferes with the red of the second order, and is
                    thereby inclined to a reddish purple; then the blue and green, which are less
                    mixed with other colours, and consequently more lively than before, especially
                    the green: Then follows the yellow, some of which towards the green is distinct
                    and good, but that part of it towards the succeeding red, as also that red, is
                    mixed with the violet and blue of the fourth series, whereby various degrees of
                    red, very much inclining to purple, are compounded. This violet and blue, which
                    should succeed this red, being mixed with, and hidden in it, there succeeds a
                    green. And this at first is much inclined to blue, but soon becomes a good
                    green, the only unmixed and lively colour in this fourth series. For as it
                    verges towards the yellow, it begins to interfere with the colours of the fifth
                    series, by whose mixture the succeeding yellow and red are very much diluted and
                    made dirty, especially the yellow, which, being the weaker colour, is scarce
                    able to shew itself. After this the several series interfere more and more, and
                    their colours become more and more intermixed, till, after three or four more
                    revolutions, (in which the red and blue predominate by turns) all sorts of
                    colours are in all places pretty equally blended, and compound an even
                    whiteness.</p>
                <p>And since the rays endued with one colour are transmitted, where those of another
                    colour are reflected, the reason of the colours made by the transmitted light is
                    from hence evident.</p>
                <p>If not only the order and species of these colours, but also the precise
                    thickness of the plate, or thin body at which they are exhibited, be desired in
                    parts of an inch, that may be also obtained by the assistance of the preceding
                    observations. For according to these observations, the thickness of the thinned
                    air, which between two glasses exhibited the most luminous parts of the
                    first</p>

                    <hi rend="superscript"> nc</hi> h∙ Suppose the light reflected most copiously at
                    these thicknesses be the bright citrine yellow, or confine of yellow and orange,
                    and these thicknesses will be F λ, F <hi rend="italic">μ,</hi> F <hi
                    rend="italic">ξ,</hi> F o, F τ. And this being known, it is easy to determine
                    what thickness of air is represented by G <hi rend="italic">φ,</hi> or by any
                    other distance of the ruler from AH.</p>
                <p>But farther, since the thickness of air was to the thickness of water, which
                    between the same glasses exhibited the same colour, as 4 to 3, and the colours
                    of thin bodies are not varied by varying the ambient medium; the thickness of a
                    bubble of water, exhibiting any colour, will be of the thickness of air
                    producing the same colour. And so according to the same observations, the
                    thickness of a plate of glass, whose refraction of the mean refrangible ray, is
                    measured by the proportion of the sines 31 to 20, may be ğy of the thickness of
                    air producing the same colours; and the like of other mediums. <hi rend="italic"
                    >I</hi> do not affirm that this proportion of 20 to 31 holds in all the rays;
                    for the sines of other sorts of rays have other proportions. But the differences
                    of these proportions are so little that I do not here consider them. On these
                    grounds I have composed the following table, wherein the thickness of air,
                    water, and glass, at which each colour is most intense and specific, is
                    expressed in parts of an inch divided into ten hundred thousand equal parts.</p>

                    distinctly by making the shadow of an opaque body pass over the upper surface.

                    this subject. In viewing the reflected rings through a rhomb of Iceland spar,
                    having its principal section parallel or perpendicular to the plane of
                    incidence, he observed, that the intensity of light in one of the images, varied
                    with the angle of incidence, and that this image vanished at an incidence of 35°
                    the maximum polarising angle for glass. He discovered the very same property in
                    the transmitted rings. This eminent philosopher has also shewn, that when the
                    reflected and the transmitted systems of rings are superposed, they completely
                    neutralise each other, forming white light; and hence he concluded, that their
                    colours were complementary, and the intensities of their illumination exactly
                    the same.</p>
                <p>Μ. Arago next examined the system of rings when formed between a lens and a
                    metallic reflector. When he observed them with the rhomb of spar above
                    mentioned, one of the images vanished as formerly at 35° of incidence, the <hi
                    rend="italic">angle of</hi><hi rend="italic">maximum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >polarisation of glass</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but <hi rend="italic"
                    >above</hi> and <hi rend="italic">below</hi> that angle Μ. Arago observed the
                    most singular phenomena. At incidences <hi rend="italic">below</hi> 35°, the two
                    imagesformed by the doubly refracting rhomb differed only in intensity, the
                    colours and the diameters of the rings being exactly the same in both. <hi
                    rend="italic">Above</hi> the polarising angle, however, the rings in the two
                    images were of complementary colours, the orders of colours in the one beginning
                    from a black centre, and in the other from a white centre. Μ. Arago also
                    observed that the rings of the same order of colours in the two images had
                    different sizes. When a plate of any substance of intermediate density between
                    the two substances between which it was contained was used, similar phenomena
                    were produced. When the surface of the metallic reflector was slightly
                    tarnished, Μ. Arago observed a second system of rings with complementary
                    colours, arising from the light irregularly scattered at the metallic surface,
                    as they could be seen in every position of the eye.</p>
                <p>Without knowing of these discoveries of Μ. Arago, Mr. Airy,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Cambridge
                    Transactions,</hi> 1832—The following note upon this paper we confess ourselves
                    unable to understand, “I have carefully verified,” says Mr. Airy, “this
                    assertion, (that it is indifferent whether the light is polarised before or
                    after reflexion) because I think that it leads to important theoretical
                    conclusions. If polarisation were a <hi rend="italic">modification</hi> of light
                    (as Dr. Brewster and others have supposed,) it might be conceived that
                    polarisation before incidence, might destroy its power of producing rings at a
                    certain angle, or might change the tints; but when the reflexion is performed,
                    and the rings are actually visible to the eye with a dark centre, it seems quite
                    inconceivable that any <hi rend="italic">modification</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >physical change</hi> in the light should make that centre appear white. The
                    satisfactory explanation is, that polarisation is <hi rend="italic"
                    >^resolution</hi> of the vibrations into two sets at right angles to each other,
                    performed in such a manner that the two sets can in general be separately
                    exhibited, and that in this instance only one is transmitted to the eye.” The
                    authors criticised in the preceding extract, viz. Mains, Young, Biot, Herschel,
                    and we believe MM. Arago and Fresnel, all considered polarisation as a
                    modification of common light, arid if a <hi rend="italic">modification</hi>
                    certainly a <hi rend="italic">physical change</hi> without any reference to
                    theory. In every point of view, indeed, the term is philosophical and
                    unexceptionable. If polarisation is a <hi rend="italic">resolution,</hi> as Mr.
                    Airy affirms, of vibrations <hi rend="italic">in an infinite number of
                    planes,</hi> into <hi rend="italic">two sets at right angles to each other,</hi>
                    which we do not question, thisiscertainly a pretty considerable modification and
                    a very remarkable physical change. As we have nothing to do with theories in
                    describing phenomena we must continue to use the terms which have been regarded
                    as appropriate by our contemporaries.</p></note> about twenty years afterwards,
                    published similar results respecting the modification of the rings above and
                    below the maximum polarising angle; and Professor Lloyd has ingen
                    iouslyobservèd, that an analogous result “may be obtained by combining (as in
                    Fresnel’s experiment, fig. 92,) a metallic reflector with one of glass. The
                    light being polarised perpendicularly to the plane of reflexion, the central
                    band will be white, when the angle of incidence is below the polarising angle of
                    the glass; at the polarising angle, the interference bars will vanish
                    altogether; and beyond that incidence they will reappear with a <hi
                    rend="italic">dark</hi> centre in place of a white one. This method of
                    observation would seem to be peculiarly adapted to the investigation of the
                    change of phase produced by metallic reflexion at various incidences.”<note

                <p>A consideration of Fresnel’s expressions, which had led Mr. Airy to make his
                    experiments with a metallic surface, led him also to expect that when the rings
                    were formed between two transparent surfaces of different refractive powers, and
                    when the light was polarised perpendicularly to the plane of incidence, the
                    rings should be <hi rend="italic">black centred</hi> at incidences below the
                    maximum polarising angle of the least refractive surface, or greater than that
                    of the highest refractive surface, and should be wÄîïe-ccntred, when the angle
                    of incidence was between these angles. By forming the rings between plate glass
                    and diamond, Mr. Airy found his anticipations correct. In the course of these
                    experiments Mr. Airy observed that the rings' did not disappear at che
                    polarising angle of diamond, but that the first black ring contracted as the
                    incidence was gradually increased, and at last took the place of the central
                    white spot. Hence he concluded that there is still some light reflected at the
                    maximum polarising angle of diamond, and that this body has no angle of complete
                    polarisation. See page 376, col. 2.</p>

                    Inflexion of Light.</hi></p>
                <p>Μ. Grimaldi, to whom we owe the discovery of the interference of light, likewise
                    made some important experiments on what is called the diffraction or inflexion
                    of light. Having admitted a ray of solar light into a dark room, through a small
                    hole AB, he placed in the conical beam AB CD an opaque body EF. The shadow of
                    this body was not bounded by the straight lines AEH, BFG, nor by the penumbra IL
                    formed by the lines BEI, AFL, but was enlarged to MN, and was much greater than
                    it should have been, if formed by rays passing in straight lines past the edges
                    of the body. Without the shadow of the body there were three fringes of coloured
                    light, the broadest and most luminous of which, next to the shadow X, fig. 100,
                    was MNO. There was no colour in the middle at Μ, but it was <hi rend="italic"
                    >blue</hi> at the side NN, and <hi rend="italic">red</hi> at the other side 00.
                    The second fringe <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562507"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-2507-0434"/><hi/> was narrower than MNO. It was colourless in
                    the middle at P, faintly blue at QQ., and faintly red at RR. The third fringe ST
                    V resembled the other two, but was the narrowest and the faintest in its
                    colours. They were bent round the edges of the body, as shewn in fig. 101.</p>
                <p>Grimaldi likewise discovered fringes within the shadow, which were best seen when
                    the body was long, the light great, and its distance from the aperture
                    considerable. These internal fringes increased with the breadth of the body, and
                    they became narrower when they increased in number. They were bent round the
                    angles of the body, as shewn in fig. 102,where ADBC is the shadow, and <hi
                    rend="italic">a, b, c, d</hi> the internal fringes. Short lucid streaks were
                    seen proceeding, as it were, from the angle D, and returning to it, as shewn in
                    the figure.</p>
                <p>What Dr. Young has called the <hi rend="italic">crested fringes</hi> of Grimaldi,
                    are shewn in figure 103. These fringes are formed by any body that has a
                    rectangular termination. At the line which bisects the right angle there is a
                    white central fringe, bounded by hyperbolic curves, whose asymptotes are the
                    diagonal line, and on each side of this are two or three other bands, disposed
                    in hyperbolic curves, which are convex to the diagonal, and converging in some
                    degree, as they recede from the angular point.</p>
                <p>In repeating the experiments of Grimaldi, Sir Isaac Newton admitted the sun’s
                    light through a small hole in apiece of lead the forty-second part of an inch in
                    diameter; he found the breadth of the shadow of a human hair, which was the
                    280th of an inch in diameter, to be as follows:—-</p>

                <p>Upon comparing the breadths of the fringes without the shadow, and their

                    other, he concluded that the light of the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> fringe
                    passed by the edge of the knife at a distance greater than the 100th part of an
                    inch; the light of the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> at a greater distance than
                    that of the first; and the light of the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> fringe at a
                    greater distance than that of the second.</p>
                <p>Sir Isaac then stuck into a board the points of two knives with straight edges,
                    so that their edges formed an angle of 1° 47' 26", and from the observations
                    which he made on the light which passed between them, he concluded <hi
                    rend="italic">that the light which forms the fringes is not the same light at
                    all distances of the paper from the knives,</hi> obviously considering each
                    fringe as produced like caustic curves, by the intersection of the inflected
                    rays. When the fringes formed by these inclined knife edges were received on
                    paper held ata great distance, the fringes formed by the one knife edge were
                    bent into the shadow of the other knife, and formed cubical hyperbolas, whose
                    asymptotes were for one set the knife edge which produced the fringes, and a
                    line perpendicular to the line bisecting the angle formed by the knives.</p>
                <p>Although many attempts were made during the last century to complete the
                    unfinished labours of Newton on this subject, yet no decided discovery was made
                    till the time of Dr. Thomas Young. This distinguished natural philosopher, in
                    endeavouring to explain the origin of the fringes which surrounded the shadow of
                    the margin of a small circular aperture, conceived that the light nearest its
                    centre was least inflected, and that nearest its edges most; and that another
                    portion of light reflected from the margin of the aperture, and coinciding
                    either exactly or nearly with the direct light, after a circuitous path, would
                    interfere with that light, and produce colour. In November 1803 he confirmed
                    this supposition to a certain extent, in so far as the production of the colours
                    by interference was concerned, by his discovery of the interference of light, as
                    already described.</p>
                <p>The fringesformed by inflexion, as observed by Dr. Young, are shewn in fig. 104,
                    where AB CD is the shadow of the inflecting body with its <hi rend="italic"
                    >internal fringes,</hi> which he considered as produced by the light passing on
                    each side of the inflecting body, and bent into the shadow, so as to interfere
                    in the manner already described. This he clearly proved to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194562520" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2520-0435"/>be the case; but he was less
                    successful in explaining the external fringes between AC and GH, and between BD
                    and EF. He ascribed them to the interference of rays <hi rend="italic">reβected
                    from the margin</hi> of the inflecting body, with rays which passed by it
                    directly.</p>
                <p>Dr. Young examined the <hi rend="italic">crested fringes of</hi> Grimaldi in the
                    same manner as he did the internal fringes ABCD. He found that when a screen was
                    placed within a few inches of the inflecting angle of the body, so as to receive
                    only one of the edges of the shadow, all the crested fringes disappeared; but if
                    the rectangular point of the screen was opposed to the point of the shadow, so
                    as barely to receive the angle of the shadow, or its extremity, the fringes were
                    in no way affected.</p>
                <p>Μ. Fresnel in France, and M.Fraunhofer at Munich, were simultaneously occupied in
                    studying the inflexion of light, and each of them published the results of their
                    labours, without any knowledge apparently that the other had been similarly
                    occupied, We shall begin by giving an account of Fresnel’s experiments.</p>
                <p>In place of a small hole, Μ. Fresnel adopted the ingenious idea of substituting a
                    lens of short focal length, which collected the solar rays into its focus, from
                    which they diverged as from a small luminous aperture. When bodies were placed
                    in this bright light, they gave distinct fringes, die magnitude of which he was
                    able to measure at various distances behind the inflecting body, and at various
                    distances of the inflecting body from the lens, simply by viewing the fringes
                    with an eye-glass furnished with a micrometer, instead of rendering them dull by
                    receiving them upon paper. In this manner he measured their breadths within the
                    one or two-hundredth part of a millimeter. He traced the external fringes up to
                    their very origin, and by the aid of a lens of a short focus, he saw the <hi
                    rend="italic">third</hi> fringe at the distance of less than the one-hundredth
                    part of a millimeter from the edge of the inflecting body. Μ. Fresnel made also
                    the important discovery that the phenomena varied with the distance of the
                    inflecting body from the radiating or luminous point, as will be seen from the
                    following measures :—</p>

                <p>from which it appears that the rays experience a less degree of inflexion in
                    proportion to the distance of the inflecting body from the radiant point.</p>
                <p>When the inflecting body was kept at a fixed distance from the lens, Μ. Fresnel
                    measured the inflexion of the same fringe at different distances behind the
                    inflecting body, and the result of these measurements was, <hi rend="italic"
                    >that the successive positions of the same fringe did not lie in a straight
                    line, but formed a curve, whose concavity is turned towards the inflecting
                    body.</hi> The successive positions of the same fringe in all the orders of
                    colours he found to be hyperbolas, having the radiating point and the edge of
                    the inflecting body for their common foci. In some of these curves the maximum
                    deviation from a straight line was the twenty-fifth part of an inch, or nearly
                    fifty times greater than the error of observation.</p>
                <p>In explaining the exterior fringes, M.Fresnel agreed with Dr. Young in supposing
                    that rays reflected from the margin of the inflecting body interfered with the
                    direct rays; but he was afterwards led, both by theory and experiment, to
                    renounce this opinion.</p>
                <p>He found that the fringes were absolutely independent of the curvature of the
                    margin of the inflecting body, and that in cases where the margin was made
                    extremely narrow or sharp, the small quantity of light which it could reflect
                    would be incapable of producing, by its interference with the direct light, such
                    bright fringes as arc actually observed. To assure himself of this, he took two
                    plates of steel, the edge of each of which was rounded in one half of its
                    length, and sharp in the remaining half; he placed the rounded portion of one
                    edge opposite the sharp portion of the other, and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi> Hence, if the position of the fringes depended on the form of the
                    surface, the effect would thus be doubled, and the fringes appear broken in the
                    middle. They were on the contrary perfectly straight throughout their whole
                    length.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    therefore obliged to suppose, and the supposition he found to be perfectly
                    conformable to the undulatory theory, that rays that pass at a sensible distance
                    deviate from their primitive direction, and interfere with those which pass
                    directly by the edge of the body.</p>
                <p>In order to settle this question, Μ. Fresnel compared the results of Dr. Young’s
                    hypothesis with those of his own, and he found that the breadth of any fringe of
                    homogeneous light should be on the two hypotheses as 2 to 1∙872β, and having
                    measured the diameter of such a fringe, he found his own hypothesis more
                    consistent with observation than Dr. Young’s.</p>
                <p>In order to exhibit to the eye the hyperbolic form of the fringes, we have given
                    a representation of them in fig. A, where LL is a lens ofshort focus, by which
                    the rays of the sun entering a dark chamber, are refracted to a focus F, from
                    which they again diverge, forming the cone <hi rend="smallcaps">Ftmtz.</hi> Or
                    the lens may be fixed in a large diaphragm DD', which may stand on the table
                    before the window at which the sun’s light enters. By means of a coloured glass
                    VV' placed on either side of the diaphragm, or on either side of F, the light
                    may be rendered homogeneous. If we now place a screen of any kind, EC, at some
                    distance from F, having its edge somewhat smaller, and free of dust, and receive
                    its shadow GT ’ upon a sheet of paper, or any white ground, TT', or on a glass
                    plate roughened with emery, we shall obtain the section of the fringes formed by
                    diffraction. The line FEG, which is the geometrical shadow, is not the real
                    shadow. On the side of it towards GT', the paper will not appear <hi
                    rend="italic">black,</hi> but illuminated with a visible shade, which goes on
                    decreasing nearly uniformly for a considerable distance. On the other side of EG
                    there are several fringes or alternations of light and darkness. <hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">Xλ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∖</hi><hi rend="italic">o first</hi> fringe B parallel to the shadow is <hi

                    a second <hi rend="italic">bright</hi> fringe B', which is followed by the <hi
                    rend="italic">secondblackfringe</hi> S ’. These alternations continue to a great
                    distance from G, so that even the sixteenth or seventeenth order may be
                    observed, the bright fringes becoming less coloured, and the black ones more
                    luminous, till they are no longer visible.</p>
                <p>By varying the distance of the paper TT ’ from the screen EC, or of the screen
                    from the focus F, the same fringes are produced with certain variations
                    depending on their distances, the fringes being propagatedin hyperbolas, as
                    shewn in the figure. The fringes are <hi rend="italic">largest</hi> in <hi

                <p>When the diverging light passes through a small circular aperture, very beautiful
                    phenomena are observed, which were studied about the same time by Μ. Fresnel and
                    Sir John Herschel.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sir
                    John Herschel’s experiment was made on the 12th July 1819, but was not published
                    till 1825.</p></note> Μ. Fresnel had deduced the phenomena from theory, and
                    subsequently confirmed his deductions by experiment. The following is Sir John
                    Herschel’s<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Treatise on Light,</hi> sect. 729, 730.</p></note> account of the
                    phenomena:—“Suppose,” says he, “we place a sheet of lead, having a small
                    pin-hole pierced through it, in the diverging cone of rays from the image of the
                    sun, formed by a lens of short focus, and in the line joining the centres of the
                    hole and focus prolonged, place a convex lens or eyeglass, behind which the eye
                    is applied. The image of the hole will be seen through the lens as a brilliant
                    spot, encircled by rings of colours of great vividness, which contract and
                    dilate, and undergo a singular and beautiful alternation of tints, as the
                    distance of the hole from the luminous point, on the one hand, or on the
                    eye-glass, on the other, is changed. When the latter distance is considerable,
                    the centrai spot is white, and the rings follow nearly the order of the colours
                    of thin plates. Thus, when the diameter of the hole was about 1-30th of an inch,
                    its distance (a) from the luminous point about six feet six inches, and its
                    distance (ô) from the eye-lens twenty-four inches, the series of colours was
                    observed to be,</p>
                <p>“1st order. White, pale yellow, yellow, orange, dull red.</p>
                <p>“2d order. Violet, blue (broad and pure), whitish, greenish yellow, fine yellow,
                    orange red, very full and brilliant.</p>
                <p>“3d order. Purple, indigo blue, greenish blue, pure brilliant green, yellow
                    green, red.</p>
                <p>“4th order. Good green, but rather sombre and bluish, bluish white, red.</p>
                <p>“5th order. Dull green, faint bluish white, faint red.</p>
                <p>“6th order. Very faint green, very faint red.</p>
                <p>“7th order. A trace of green and red.</p>
                <p>“When the eye-lens and hole are brought nearer together, the central white spot
                    contracts into a point and vanishes, and the rings gradually close in upon it in
                    succession, so that the centre assumes in succession the most surprisingly vivid
                    and intense hues. Meanwhile the rings surrounding it undergo great and abrupt
                    changes in their tints. The following were the tints observed in an experiment
                    made some years ago, (July 12, 1819), the distance between the eye-glass and
                    luminous point(α + ½) remaining constant, and the hole being gradually brought
                    nearer to the former :—</p>

                <p>“The series of tints exhibited by the central spot is evidently, so far as it
                    goes, that of the reflected rings in the colours of thin plates; the surrounding
                    colours are very capricious, and appear subject to no law.”</p>
                <p>We owe also to Sir John Herschel the following beautiful experiment with two
                    equal apertures placed near each other. The rings are formed about each as in
                    the case of <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562546" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2546-0437"
                    />oneaperture, but these are accompanied with a set of straight parallel
                    fringes, bisecting the interval between their centres, and perpendicular to the
                    line joining their centres. Two other sets of similar fringes appear in the form
                    of a St. Andrew’s cross, forming equal angles with the first set, as shewn in
                    Plate CCCLXXXI. fig. 5. When the apertures are unequal, as in fig. 6, these
                    fringes assume the form of hyperbolas, having the aperture in their common
                    focus. By varying the number and shape of the apertures, the phenomena became
                    exceedingly beautiful.</p>
                <p>Μ. Poisson deduced from theory that the centre of the shadow of a small circular
                    opaque disc, exposed to light emanating from a single luminous point, would be
                    precisely as much illuminated by the diffracted light as it would be by the
                    direct light, if the disc were removed. By using a small disc of metal, cemented
                    to a clear and homogeneous plate of glass, Μ. Arago confirmed this very
                    remarkable result.</p>
                <p>We owe to Μ. Arago a series of beautiful discoveries respecting the influence of
                    transparent screens in the phenomena of inflexion. When a thick piece of glass
                    was used as a screen on one side of the inflecting body, the rings wholly
                    disappear, as if the screen were opaque. If the screen is very thin, like a film
                    of sulphate of lime or mica, the fringes still remain visible, but shift their
                    places, and are moved from the side where the screen is interposed.</p>
                <p>If we make this experiment on the fringes produced by two apertures, we have only
                    to cover one of the apertures with the screen. The same effect, however, will be
                    produced, if we cover both apertures with screens of different thicknesses. In
                    this case the fringes will shift their places from the thicker plate, without
                    suffering any other change.</p>
                <p>This beautiful property has been most ingeniously employed by MM. Arago and
                    Fresnel, in measuring the refractive powers of different gases. For as the
                    displacement of the coloured fringes depends on the refractive power, as well as
                    thickness of the plate, its refractive power may be computed from the
                    displacement. In the same manner, if one of the interfering rays are made to
                    pass through tubes filled with different gases, while the other does not, the
                    displacement produced by the gas will give a measure of the refractive power of
                    the gaseous medium.</p>
                <p>We come now to give some account of the experiments of Joseph Fraunhofer, made
                    with instruments of extreme accuracy, and furnishing data of the highest
                    importance in physical optics.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The apparatus employed by Fraunhofer was a repeating theodolite, whose vernier
                    read off to 4 <hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi>. In the centre of the circle, but
                    above it, this instrument carries a flat circular plate six inches in diameter,
                    having its axis coincident with that of the theodolite, and graduated separately
                    to 10". In the middle of this disc is placed a metallic screen, in which the
                    necessary apertures are made, and which is in the axis of the theodolite. The
                    divisions of this disc serve to measure if necessary the angle of incidence of
                    the rays. A telescope, having an object-glass of twenty lines in aperture, and
                    16 ’ 9 inches in focal length, is placed three-and-a-half inches from the centre
                    of this disc. This telescope is placed firmly on the alidade of the divided
                    circle, whose diameter is twelve inches, and the whole is counterpoised. The
                    axis of the telescope is exactly parallel to the horizon, as well as to the
                    plane of this circle. The magnifying power which he employed was from thirty to
                    fifty times. The instrument did not communicate with the floor of the room, from
                    which it was wholly insulated. The heliostate was placed in the prolongation of
                    the optical axis, at a distance of 38 feet 7⅛ inches from the centre of the
                    theodolite. In order to make the heliostate follow the sun in his hourly motion,
                    the observer could move the screw of the mirror by means of a long rod of iron,
                    which extends from the heliostate to the theodolite, and with this apparatus he
                    could also vary at pleasure the intensity of the solar light. The opening of the
                    heliostate is vertical, being two inclies high, and commonly from the 50th to
                    the lOOth of an inch.</p>
                <p>By means of an achromatic microscope, magnifying 110 times, Fraunhofer measured
                    the aperture in the metallic screen, which he did to the fifty-thousandth, and
                    sometimes to the hundred-thousandth part of an inch, provided the body was very
                    fine at its edge.</p>
                <p>Fraunhofer’s first observations were made with a single slit, which was placed
                    before the object-glass of the telescope, which had been previously directed to
                    the aperture in the heliostate, so that the aperture was bisected by the wire of
                    the micrometer. He then saw the fringes shewn in fig. 7, Plate CCCLXXXI.

                    and losing themselves in a band of light, which is spread over a great space.
                    All these spectra on both sides of K are perfectly equal, and consequently
                    symmetrical. Both the colours and the spectra shade into one another
                    imperceptibly. The following table contains the average of the distances L <hi

                <p>From these observations, Μ. Fraunhofer deduces the following conclusions:</p>

                <p>By observing whether the micrometer were appeared or disappeared in the different
                    spectra, Fraunhofer ascertained that the spectra nearest KK, are not composed of
                    homogeneous<pb break="no" facs="nls:194562559" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2559-0438"/>
                    light, but that it becomes more and more homogeneous at greater distances from
                    the axis.</p>
                <p>Our author next proceeds to describe the phenomena observed when the two edges
                    which form the narrow aperture, <hi rend="italic">are</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ai</hi><hi rend="italic">different distances</hi> from the object -glass. When
                    the effective width of the aperture thus formed, is from the 25th to the 50th of
                    an inch, the spectra are the same as those before described; but when the
                    opening becomes less, the spectra on one side of the axis become wider,
                    horizontally than those on the other side. When the apparent aperture was
                    extremely narrow, the spectra on one was two or three times wider than those on
                    the other. By continuing to close the distant edges, the longest spectra begin
                    to disappear successively, so that the fifth spectrum for example, fills almost
                    suddenly the whole field of the telescope, till it ceases to be visible, then
                    the fourth spectrum presents the same phenomena, then the third, and so on.
                    During these changes the spectra on the other side remain unchanged, but when
                    all the former have vanished, <hi rend="italic">they also disappear in their
                    turn, not successively, but all at once,</hi> which happens when no light passes
                    between the edges. The large spectra are always on the side of the screen, which
                    is nearest the object-glass.</p>
                <p>When the apertures, both in the heliostate, and in front of the object-glass,
                    were small circular ones, a system of rings are produced, absolutely the same as
                    those of thin plates, with this difference only, that the centre is <hi
                    rend="italic">u∙hite</hi> in place of <hi rend="italic">black.</hi> The rays
                    increase in size as the apertures diminish. By varying the apertures he obtained
                    the following results:</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">That the diameter of the coloured rings are in the inverse
                    ratio of the diameter of the apertures.</hi><hi rend="italic">2. That the
                    distances of the extreme rings (of any given refrangibility) from the centre
                    form an arithmetical progression, whose difference is smaller than the first
                    term.</hi></p>

                <p>The most important and interesting of Fraunhofer’s researches, are those which
                    relate to the spectra produced by gratings, consisting of a number of parallel
                    wires placed parallel also to the narrow linear aperture in the heliostate. He
                    formed these gratings of fine wires stretched across a rectangular frame; the
                    two shorter ends of the frame consisted of two fine screws made with the same
                    die, and having 260 threads in an inch. By placing a wire in each thread he
                    ensured their exact parallelism. The diameter of each wire was 0∙002021 of a
                    French inch, and the edge of each wire was distant from the adjacent edge
                    0O03862 of an inch. The aperture of the heliostate was two inches long, and the
                    100th of an inch wide, and the frame of wires was placed before the
                    object-glass, so that no other light could be admitted but through them.
                    Fraunhofer was astonished at the phenomena which he saw. He saw the colourless
                    line of light A, Plate CCCLXXXI, fig. 8, in the aperture of the hcliostate,
                    exactly as if no wires had been interposed, and at some distance from it on both
                    sides <hi rend="italic">a great number of coloured spectra exactly similar to
                    those produced by a good prism.</hi> They were larger in proportion to their
                    distance from the central bright line, and they diminished in intensity in the
                    same proportion. A part of these spectra are shewn in figure 8, where A is the
                    aperture of the heliostate, absolutely without colours. On each side of A the
                    spectra are perfectly symmetrical. When the apparatus is well made, the
                    space</p>
                <p>AH <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> is absolutely black. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >first</hi> spectrum occupies the space H <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>, C <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi>; H <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> being the usual
                    limit of the violet, and C <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> that of the red.
                    Between H <hi rend="superscript"> π</hi> and C <hi rend="superscript"> π</hi>,
                    there is a second spectrum twice as long as the first; the order of the colours
                    being the same, but their intensity a little less. The third spectrum occupies
                    the space between C “and F <hi rend="superscript"> ιv</hi>, but a part of its
                    violet rays are mixed with the red of the <hi rend="italic">second</hi>
                    spectrum, and also a part of the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> rays of the <hi
                    rend="italic">third</hi> with the <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> rays of the <hi
                    rend="italic">fourth</hi> spectrum. The <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> spectrum
                    is seen between F <hi rend="superscript"> ιv</hi> and D <hi rend="superscript">
                    ιv</hi>, its <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> extremity losing itself in the <hi
                    rend="italic">third,</hi> and its <hi rend="italic">red</hi> extremity in the
                    <hi rend="italic">fifth</hi> spectrum. Many other spectra succeed these, and
                    when the apparatus is good, <hi rend="italic">thirteen vαa,g</hi> be easily
                    reckoned on each side of A.</p>
                <p>But what is the most interesting fact, when the apparatus is good, and the
                    adjustments correct,—the <hi rend="italic">fixed dark lines in the
                    prismatic</hi> spectrum are seen at C <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>, D <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi>, these lines being the same as those similarly marked
                    in Plate CCCLXXXI, fig. 1. It is remarkable, however, that A is not seen, a fact
                    which Μ. Fraunhofer neither notices nor explains. The lines both great and
                    small, are absolutely the same, both in this and the prismatic spectrum, though

                <p>Ιhe preceding results having been obtained with angles so small that the arcs and
                    their sines and tangents are nearly in the same proportion, Μ. Fraunhofer began
                    a new series of experiments with the view of obtaining spectra, in which the
                    angles should be larger and by which he might determine whether it was the arcs
                    or their sines or tangents which had the proportions assigned by the
                    experiments.</p>
                <p>This inquiry rendered it necessary to obtain much finer gratings than those he
                    had used. He therefore coated a plate of glass with two or three folds of gold
                    leaf in order to have the interstices filled up, and by a peculiar arrangement
                    he traced upon the glass parallel lines in which <hi rend="italic">ε</hi> was
                    =0.00114 of an inch. When the lines were drawn closer, no gold remained upon the
                    glass. With this system the spectra were larger, and the fixed lines distinctly
                    seen, but they did not answer his purpose. He therefore thought of spun glass
                    which answered as well as wires; and having covered a plate of glass with a thin
                    coat of fat, so thin that it could scarcely be seen, he traced.parallel lines
                    upon it, the intervals of which were only half the size of those on the gold
                    leaf. The spectra produced by this system of lines gave the fixed lines very
                    distinctly, so that their distances from the axis could be accurately measured;
                    but he could not succeed in tracing either upon a layer of fat Or black varnish
                    lines closer than this. He at last succeeded in his object of tracing a finer
                    system of lines by using a diamond, with which, by the aid of a machine, he
                    traced lines so fine upon the surface of glass, that they could not be seen by
                    the most powerful compound microscope. In this way he obtained a set of several
                    thousand lines in which e=0.0001223 of an inch, and which are at distances so
                    very equal, that the fixed lines in the first and second spectrum are clearly
                    seen.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Μ. Fraunhofer
                    remarks that it requires much good fortune even with t=0∙0001223 to find a
                    diamond point which shall trace <hi rend="italic">several thousands of</hi> such
                    lines without being altered, and he had succeeded only in obtaining one system.
                    It is only by trial that an useful diamond point can be obtained. As every line
                    requires to be drawn singly with great care, the labour of drawing two thousand
                    is enormous. Fraunhofer has drawn lines so close that there are 32,000 of them
                    in a Paris inch. By etching the first and last line of the system somewhat
                    stronger than the rest, our author, by a microscopic apparatus, measured the
                    distance between these two lines, the etching machine itself reading the lines
                    which are etched. In this way knowing the number of lines, viz. 3G01, and the
                    distance between the firstand last, he obtained t or the distance between the
                    middle of any two lines.</p></note></p>

                <p>all the observations made with both the systems of lines are represented by the
                    expression</p>
                <p>Siu</p>
                <p>That is with rays falling vertically, the sines of the angle of deviation of any
                    fixed line or ray of definite refrangibility from the axis in the different
                    spectra which succeed others, are as the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
                <p>The last of these systems of lines has the remarkable property of having all the
                    spectra on one side of the axis twice as luminous as those on the other.
                    Fraunhofer supposed that one of the sides of each line had been sharper than the
                    other, and confirmed this opinion by tracing lines on a layer of fat, so that
                    one line was less sharp than the other, and it produced the same inequality in
                    the intensity of the light of the spectra on each side of the axis.</p>
                <p>If the ray does not fall vertically upon the system of grooves or lines, but is
                    inclined to it in a plane which intersects the parallel lines vertically, the
                    same effect is produced as if the distance between the middle of the lines or
                    <hi rend="italic">e</hi> were diminished in the ratio of the radius to the
                    cosine of the angle of incidence. Hence <hi rend="italic">the distance of the
                    spectra from the axis increases as the cosine of the angle of incidence.</hi> If
                    σ therefore is the angle of incidence, then we have sin ≡ — <hi
                    rend="superscript"> V</hi> ——. This, however, is only true ♯ cos. σ</p>
                <p>when the system of lines is coarse and σ not very large· But in fine systems of
                    lines it is otherwise, the spectra on both sides of the axis are no longer
                    symmetrical, and in the system where e=0.0001223, when σ is = 55° wehave the
                    deviation of D' on one side of the axis is = 15 <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi>?
                    16', and on the other side of the same axis 30° 33'.</p>
                <p>Hitherto we have treated of spectra formed by the light transmitted through the
                    gratings, or through plates of glass with systems of lines etched upon one of
                    its surfaces. But Μ. Fraunhofer examined also the spectra produced by <hi
                    rend="italic">reflexion</hi> from the etched surfaces of the glass plates. For
                    this purpose, he coated the surface of the glass with a black resinous varnish
                    of the same refractive power as the glass. Then when light reflected from the
                    system <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562585" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2585-0440"/>of
                    lines fell on the object-glass of the "telescope, the very same phenomena
                    appeared as when the light passed through the same system of lines at the same
                    angle of inclination, spectra not symmetrical being seen. The intensity of the
                    spectra was still such that the distances of the various lines can be actermined
                    with great accuracy.</p>
                <p>Μ. Fraunhofer has noticed it as very remarkable that under a certain angle of
                    incidence a <hi rend="italic">portion of a spectrum</hi> produced by reflexion,
                    consists of entirely polarised light. This angle of incidence varies greatly for
                    the different spectra, and even still very perceptibly for the different colours
                    of one and the same spectrum. Thus with the glass system of lines where
                    ε=0.0001223, the ray E <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> in the green part of the
                    first spectrum is polarised when σ=49°, but the same green part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">second</hi> spectrum on the same side of the axis is only
                    polarised when σ=40°, and the green part of the first spectrum lying on the
                    opposite side of the axis, is not polarised till σ=69° ∙ In this last case the
                    remaining colours of the spectrum are imperfectly polarised. This was less the
                    case in the second spectrum above mentioned where the colour still remained
                    polarised when the angle of incidence was perceptibly altered. In the spectrum
                    where the green light was polarised at 69°, the light was at no angle of
                    incidence so completely polarised as in the first spectrum at 49° ∙ With a
                    system of lines in which ε is larger than the one above mentioned, the green
                    rays in the spectra already referred to, are polarised at totally different
                    angles of incidence.</p>
                <p>A very singular consequence arises from the formula deduced from theory by Μ.
                    Fraunhofer, and representing his experiments. If the distance e between the
                    lines is less than the length of an undulation, and the light falls vertically
                    on the grating, so that σ=o, it follows that <hi rend="italic">no coloured ray
                    remains visible,</hi> however the light may fall, and only the <hi rend="italic"
                    >τvhite</hi> light becomes visible in the axis. Hence all scratches or
                    inequalities on polished surfaces can produce no spectra, or no disturbance in
                    the light which the surface refracts or reflects, and consequently no
                    imperfection in the images which they form. Μ. Fraunhofer likewise draws the
                    conclusion “that it would be impossible by any means to render such inequalities
                    (those less than ω) visible,” and that a microscopic object, the diameter of
                    which is <hi rend="italic">-ω,</hi> and consists of two parts, cannot be
                    recognised as consisting of two parts. “This,” he adds, “shews us the limits
                    which are set to vision through microscopes.” This result, if clearly
                    established, would be a very remarkable one.</p>
                <p>It is very obvious, that if the distances of the etched lines or the wires in
                    gratings are unequal, the <hi rend="italic">larger</hi> distances e will give
                    <hi rend="italic">smaller</hi> spectra, and the <hi rend="italic">sìnaller</hi>
                    distances ε <hi rend="italic">larger</hi> spectra, which will be mixed with each
                    other. Fraunhofer, however, conceived it would be interesting to know what would
                    happen if the intervals ε were <hi rend="italic">regularly unequal,</hi> that
                    is, if the unequality in the distances were regularly repeated in equal parts.
                    With this view he etched parallel lines in various ways, regularly unequal upon
                    plates of glass covered with gold leaf. If the distances between the lines are
                    expressed by e ’, e' ’, <hi rend="italic">e'"</hi> and if one of the equal
                    parts, which consists of unequal e’s is expressed by ε'+ e' ’ +ε"' p <hi

                <p>The phenomena of spectra thus produced are chiefly remarkable on account of their
                    different intensity. With some systems of lines of this kind, <hi rend="italic"
                    >several spectra or parts of them may be wholly wanting,</hi> or have so slight
                    an intensity that they are not easily observed, whilst the succeeding ones again
                    become very intense. Owing to this cause, the fixed lines in these spectra may
                    be observed. In the usual systems consisting of equal spaces«, the lines C <hi
                    rend="superscript"> xn</hi>, F <hi rend="superscript"> xil</hi> or the fixed
                    lines C, F, in the twelfth spectrum can be seen; but with a regularly unequal
                    system of lines, where every division consists of three shades <hi rend="italic"
                    >ε</hi> different among themselves, and are as 25: 33: 42, the lines C <hi
                    rend="superscript"> xπ</hi>, D <hi rend="superscript"> xll</hi>, E <hi
                    rend="superscript"> xil</hi>, and F <hi rend="superscript"> xπ</hi> are seen
                    with such distinctness that their distances from the axis can be accurately
                    measured. The reason of this is, that with such systems of lines, the tenth and
                    the eleventh spectra are almost wholly wanting. With this system of lines,
                    indeed, Fraunhofer saw E <hi rend="superscript"> xxiv</hi> or the line E in the
                    24th spectrum so distinctly that its distance could be measured.</p>
                <p>Μ. Fraunhofer, by means of concentric circular lines etched upon glass at equal
                    distances, and by making the aperture in the heliostate circular, has produced
                    circular spectra with circular fixed lines. Their distances from the axis are in
                    the same proportion as in the spectra produced by parallel lines.</p>
                <p>When the gratingsand systems of lines are immersed in fluids, the same phenomena
                    are produced, but the distances of all the spectra from the axis are diminished
                    in the inverse ratio of the indices of refraction.</p>
                <p>Fraunhofer has given also some fine drawings of a beautiful class of phenomena
                    produced by the diffraction of light passing through round and quadrangular
                    apertures either singly or arranged regularly. When a plate of brass perforated
                    with two equal apertures 0∙02227 of an inch in diameter, and 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 03831 distant, is placed in front of the object
                    glass, and the aperture of the heliostate round, the extraordinary appearance
                    shewn in fig. 9, plateCCCLXXXH, was seen. It consisted of 65 elliptical spectra
                    distributed in concentric rings, the outermost of which contains 28 spectra, the
                    next 20, the next 12, and the central one five. When the circular apertures are
                    arranged so as to correspond with the four angles of a square, the effect
                    produced is similar to fig. 10.</p>
                <p>One of the most splendid figures of this kind is produced by crossing two
                    gratings with the wires at right angles to each other, a circular image is
                    covered with narrow spectra radiating from the centre, but occupying only parts
                    of different radii. The spectra are rectangular of about a line wide, and from
                    five lines to five inches long. The violet end of each is towards the centre. In
                    some places the spectra touch and overlap each other, but the greater number are
                    insulated.</p>

                    variety of beautiful phenomena, all of which are capable of being explained by
                    the undulatory theory.</p>
                <p>As the various phenomena of diffraction observed by Arago, Fresnel, Young,
                    Fraunhofer, and Schwerd, are susceptible of being explained by the undulatory
                    theory, even facts of the same class, and having a similar origin, cannot
                    possess much interest in our inquiries into the physical causes to which they
                    must be ultimately referred.</p>
                <p>We shall now proceed, however, to give an account of a new series of facts
                    discovered by Sir David Brewster, of which the undulatory theory is not capable
                    in its present form of giving the least explanation, and we must therefore<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194562598" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2598-0441"/> consider such
                    facts as peculiarly calculated to throw light on the physical cause of the
                    phenomena.</p>
                <p>In all the phenomena of gratings and systems of lines observed by Fraunhofer, the
                    central image of the luminous aperture in the heliostate is white, a result that
                    might have been expected, as that light is reflected from the original surface
                    of the glass, and cannot interfere with any other light. “If the lines,” says
                    Fraunhofer, “were so thick that one touched another, and consequently had no
                    space between them, no light could be regularly reflected from the etched
                    surface, and would, as from every other polished surface, be dispersed. Were the
                    intermediate spaces equally wide as the lines, the etched surface could only
                    regularly reflect half as much light as an equal surface of glass that was not
                    etched, therefore the quantity of regularly reflected light from an etched
                    surface of glass, is in proportion to the quantity of light which is reflected
                    from a surface of glass of the same size not etched, or as the width of the
                    spaces between any two neighbouring lines is to the width of these lines.”<note

                <p>These conclusions however irresistible they seem to be, are very far from having
                    any foundation. For upon examining a series of several systems of lines or
                    grooves cut on steel for him by the late Sir John Barton, Sir David Brewster
                    observed, that' in several of them the central image hitherto described as <hi
                    rend="italic">white</hi> or colourless, had a distinct colour which was the same
                    in every part of the system. In one of the systems on which there were 1000
                    lines in an inch, the central image had its tint a <hi rend="italic">greenish
                    blue</hi> at a perpendicular incidence, which suffered no change by turning
                    round the plate, nor by reflecting the light from different parts of the system.
                    He found the same colours on various other systems of lines, and upon examining
                    them at different angles of incidence, he found that the tints varied with’ the
                    incidence, being a maximum at a vertical incidence, diminishing as the incidence
                    increased, and disappearing at an angle of 90°. The following were the general
                    results with the grooves on steel :—</p>

                <p>These colours are obviously analogous to those of the reflected rings in thin
                    plates, though with a white centre, but they <hi rend="italic">have not the same
                    composition.</hi> By turning the system of lines round in azimuth, the same
                    colours are seen at the same angles of incidence, and they suffer no change
                    either by varying the distance of the luminous aperture, or the distance of the
                    eye of the observer.</p>
                <p>Desirous of seeing what effect would be produced, when the original surface of
                    the steel was almost wholly removed, Sir John Barton executed for our author a
                    specimen with 2000 grooves in an inch, in which this was nearly effected.
                    Unfortunately, however, the diamond point which he used broke before he had
                    executed any considerable space, and the experiments, therefore, with so small a
                    portion, were less complete than could have been desired.</p>
                <p>The specimen, however, gave four orders of colours, which were developed at
                    greater angles of incidence than in the preceding table. The following were the

                <p>The property established by the preceding experiment is certainly one of a very
                    remarkable kind. That a pure and highly polished metallic surface, which
                    reflects light perfectly white, should actually decompose it when the surface is
                    reduced to narrow lines, is inconsistent with every doctrine respecting light.
                    Here there are no rays to interfere, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562611"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-2611-0442"/>no doubly refracted pencils, and in short, none of
                    the ordinary conditions on which the decomposition of light depends. That the
                    colour does not arise from light that has entered a certain way into the body
                    interfering with that which is regularly reflected, is obvious from the fact,
                    that in two specimens of 2000 grooves in an inch, impressed on <hi rend="italic"
                    >black</hi> wax, the new colours were very distinct, the vertical tint being a
                    greenish yellow of the second order, in one specimen, and a gamboge yellow in
                    the other, in addition to one complete order of colours at greater
                    incidences.</p>
                <p>The following experiments, intended to shew the effect of a variable refracting
                    power in the reflecting surface, are calculated to give us some insight into the
                    nature of this new property of light. In the following table Sir David Brewster
                    has described the changes produced upon the colours, by placing different fluids
                    on the reflecting surface :—</p>

                    the most interesting results in this table is the part in which the colours are
                    entirely developed by the fluids applied to the surface; and hence if we had
                    transparent fluids of much higher refractive powers, the colours would be
                    produced when the intervals were much larger.</p>
                <p>Similar phenomena were developed when the grooves were impressed on the fusible
                    metal, on tin, and on isinglass. In those on isinglass, the new colours were
                    seen also in the transmitted central image, and were extremely brilliant; but
                    they were not decidedly complementary to those in the reflected image. The
                    following were the colours of the reflected and transmitted image in isinglass,
                    beginning from 90° of incidence :—</p>

                <p>Our author was now desirous of observing what took place in the prismatic images,
                    when the colours appeared in the principal or central image.</p>
                <p>Let AB, fig. 107, be the reflected image of a long rectangular aperture from the

                <p>First spectrum <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> rays
                    are obliterated at <hi rend="italic">m</hi> at an incidence of 74°, and the <hi

                    the intermediate colours, blue, green, being obliterated at intermediate points
                    between <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> and at angles of
                    incidence intermediate between 74° and 66°. In the</p>

                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562624" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2624-0443"/>
                <p>Another similar succession of obliterated tints takes place on all the prismatic
                    images at a lesser incidence, as shown at <hi rend="italic">μv, μ'v',</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> being obliterated at μ, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >red</hi> at <hi rend="italic">V,</hi> and the intermediate colours at
                    intermediate points. In this second succession the line <hi rend="italic"
                    >μv</hi> begins and ends at the same angle of incidence, as the line <hi
                    rend="italic">m"n"</hi> in the third prismatic image <hi rend="italic">a"b</hi>
                    ’; and the line <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">v</hi> ’ on the
                    second prismatic image corresponds with <hi rend="italic">m</hi> ’ <hi
                    rend="italic">"η"</hi> ’ on the fourth prismatic image.</p>
                <p>This singular obliteration of the colours is shown more clearly in fig. 108,
                    where <hi rend="italic">τmun</hi> is a part of one of the prismatic images, <hi
                    rend="italic">rr</hi> the red space, <hi rend="italic">gg</hi> the green space,
                    <hi rend="italic">bb</hi> the blue, and <hi rend="italic">vv</hi> the violet
                    space. The line of obliteration <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> begins at <hi
                    rend="italic">m,</hi> the extreme violet being obliterated there, so that the
                    curve of illumination <hi rend="italic">abm,</hi> fig. 109, is just affected at
                    one extremity <hi rend="italic">m.</hi> The line advances into the spectrum, and
                    at the point corresponding to <hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">fig.</hi> 109, a portion of the blue and
                    violet is obliterated, as shown by the notch in the curve; at <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> a portion of the green and blue; at <hi rend="italic">h</hi> a portion
                    of the red and green, and at <hi rend="italic">n</hi> the extreme red.</p>
                <p>A similar obliteration of tints takes place on the ordinary image AB.</p>
                <p>The first obliteration, viz. that of the violet, takes place at <hi rend="italic"
                    >ο,</hi> fig. 107, and that of the red at <hi rend="italic">p</hi>; while the
                    intermediate colours disappear at intermediate points. This first space of
                    obliteration has no corresponding one at the same incidence in any of the
                    prismatic images.</p>
                <p>The second obliteration of the violet in AB takes place at ç, and that of the red
                    at r, and this corresponds in incidence with the obliterations <hi rend="italic"
                    >m!n</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">&gt; m</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">n</hi> ’ on the
                    second prismatic image.</p>
                <p>The third obliteration of the violet takes place at <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> and
                    that of the red at <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and this corresponds in incidence
                    with the four obliterations on the second and fourth prismatic images, viz. <hi
                    rend="italic">μν, μ'ν', m"</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">n"</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic"
                    >, m"</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">n"</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">.</hi></p>
                <p>In all these phenomena the points <hi rend="italic">m, n, μ, ν, See.</hi> are
                    only the points of minimum intensity, or of maximum obliteration; for the tints
                    never entirely disappear, and those obliterated at each line <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn</hi> form an oblique spectrum containing all the prismatic colours.</p>
                <p>The analysis of these curious and apparently complicated phenomena becomes very
                    simple when they are examined under homogeneous illumination. The effect
                    produced in red light is represented in fig. 110, where AB is the image of the
                    rectangular aperture reflected from the faces <hi rend="italic">n</hi> of the
                    steel, and the four images on each side of it correspond with the prismatic
                    images. All these nine images, however, consist of homogeneous red light, which
                    is obliterated at the fifteen shaded rectangles, which are the minima of the new
                    series of periodical colours which cross both the ordinary and the prismatic
                    images. The centres <hi rend="italic">p, r, t,</hi><hi rend="italic">η,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">V,</hi> &amp;c. of these rectangles correspond with the points
                    marked with the same letters in fig. 107; and if we had drawn the same figure
                    for violet light, the centres of the rectangles would have corresponded with o,
                    <hi rend="italic">q, s, m, μ,</hi> &amp;c. in fig. 107∙ The rectangles should
                    have been shaded off to represent the phenomena accurately, but the only object
                    of the figure is to shew to the eye the position and relations of the minima of
                    the periods.</p>
                <p>If it should be practicable to remove a still greater portion of the faces <hi
                    rend="italic">n,</hi> the first minimum <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> fig. 110,
                    would commence at a greater angle of incidence; and other two rows of minima,
                    namely, rows of five and six, would be found extending to the fifth and sixth
                    prismatic images. The arrangement and succession of these is easily deducible
                    from fig. 110, where the law of the phenomenon is obvious to the eye.</p>
                <p>The following table contains the angles of incidence reckoned from the
                    perpendicular at which these minima occur in the extreme rays.</p>

                <p>When the steel with 1000 groovesis exposed to common light, and the incident ray
                    is very near the perpendicular, the 5th, 6 th, 7th, and 8th prismatic images are
                    combined into a mass of whitish light, terminated externally by a black space.
                    As the angle of incidence increases, the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th images are
                    combined into this mass, then the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th images, and so on; the

                <p>In order to study this subject under a more general aspect, I was desirous of

                    powers. It was <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562637" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2637-0444"
                    />obviously impossible to procure systems of lines upon transparent bodies in
                    which the grooves should have exactly the same distance and magnitude; but I
                    conceived it practicable to impress upon different substances the very grooves
                    which produced the preceding phenomena, and I succeeded in impressing the system
                    of 1000 grooves upon tin, realgar, and isinglass.</p>

                <p>In these experiments the tin gave nearly the same results as the steel; but in
                    the realgar and the isinglass similar tints were produced at a less angle of
                    incidence than in the steel. The minima of the periods were exhibited very
                    finely on the isinglass, and were produced at smaller angles of incidence.</p>
                <p>In a specimen with 1000 grooves upon isinglass, the third pink, or that seen upon
                    steel at 36°, was the highest; but after drying, the pink descended to yellow,
                    and subsequently to green.</p>
                <p>If the isinglass is removed from the steel when it is still soft, the edges of
                    the grooves get rounded and lose their sharpness, and only one prismatic image
                    is seen on each side of the ordinary image, as in mother-of-pearl.</p>
                <p>The mass of white light is finely seen in the impressions taken upon tin, but
                    never appears upon isinglass.</p>
                <p>The prismatic colours seen on mother-of-pearl are exactly of the same kind as the
                    prismatic images of grooved surfaces, with this difference, that a single
                    prismatic image only is seen on each side of the common colourless image. The
                    following account of these colours has been given by Sir David Brewster, who
                    first analysed them, and discovered their communicability to wax, the fusible
                    metals, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Mother-of-pearl, which constitutes the interior lining of the shell of the pearl
                    oyster, and of various other shells, has' been long employed in the arts for the
                    purposes of use and of ornament. Every one must have observed the play of
                    prismatic tints, from which this substance derives much of its value as an
                    ornament; but the nature and origin of these tints were never made the subject
                    of investigation, till Sir David Brewster took up the subject, and published the
                    results of his observations in the <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans, for</hi>
                    1814.</p>
                <p>In order to study well the properties of this substance, we must select a
                    regularly formed piece or plate of mother-of-pearl, which is known by the
                    uniformity of its colour in day-light, and scarcely exhibits in that light any
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the prismatic tints. Let this plate be now ground flat
                    On both sides, (but not polished), upon a hone ora piece of slate, or upon a bit
                    of glass, with the powder of schistus, or with fine emery. When this is done,
                    hold the plate close to the eye, and view in it by reflexion the flame of a
                    candle, or of an argand lamp, or the flame of two or thffĕe candles, so placed
                    as to appear like one, and we shall see a dull and reddish image, free from all
                    prismatic colours, its dulness arising from the imperfect polish of the surface.
                    On one side of, or above or below, this image, will be seen a brighter image
                    with the colours of the spectrum, nearly as if it had been formed by a
                    prism.</p>
                <p>When the plate of mother-of-pearl is turned round in its own plane, the prismatic
                    image will follow the motion of the plate, and revolve round the common image,
                    the <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> rays being nearest the common image, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">red</hi> rays farthest from it. If the plate is so placed that the
                    prismatic image is in the plane of reflexion, and between the common image and
                    the observer, it will be found that the distance between the two images
                    increases with the angle of incidence, being about 2° 7 ’ at an incidence not
                    far from the perpendicular, and 9° 14' at a very great obliquity. This distance
                    between the images varies more rapidly when the plate is turned round 180° in
                    azimuth, so that the common image is between the prismatic image and the
                    observer; but in this case we cannot measure the angle accurately much beyond
                    60°, when it is nearly 4° 30'.</p>
                <p>Beyond the prismatic image, and in the same line with it and the common image,
                    will be observed a mass of coloured light, nearly as far beyond the prismatic
                    image as the prismatic image is from the common image. The distance of this
                    patch of coloured light varies according to a different law from that of the

                    the plate is polished, and have an origin quite different from those of the
                    prismatic image.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                <p>Hitherto we have considered the phenomena only when the surface has that degree
                    of polish which accompanies smooth grinding. If a greater degree of polish,
                    however, is communicated to the plate, the common image becomes more brilliant,
                    and <hi rend="italic">a new prismatic image starts up, diametrically opposite to
                    the first prismatic image, and at the same distance from the common image.</hi>
                    This second prismatic image resembles in every respect the first. Its brilliancy
                    increases with the polish, and when this polish is very high, the second
                    prismatic image is nearly as bright as <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562650"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-2650-0445"/>the first, which has its brilliancy a little
                    impaired by polishing. This second image is never accompanied, like the first,
                    by a mass of coloured light. If the polish of the surface is removed by
                    grinding, the second prismatic image vanishes, and the first resumes its
                    primitive brilliancy.</p>
                <p>When the preceding experiments are repeated on the opposite surface of the plate
                    of mother-of-pearl, the same phenomena are observed, but in a <hi rend="italic"
                    >reverse</hi> order, the first prismatic image and the mass of coloured light
                    being now seen on the opposite side of the plate.</p>
                <p>In examining the light transmitted through the mother-of-pearl, we shall perceive
                    analogous phenomena. A coloured image will be seen on each side of the common
                    image, having the same angular distance from it as those seen by reflexion, and
                    resembling them in every particular; the blue light being nearest the common
                    image, and the red light farthest from it. These two images, however, are
                    generally fainter than those seen by reflexion. When the second prismatic image
                    is extinguished by removing the polish, it is then the most brilliant when seen
                    by transmission; and, in general, the image which is brightest by reflexion is
                    faintest by transmission, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi></p>
                <p>In measuring the angular distances of the prismatic image from the common image
                    seen by reflexion, Sir David Brewster had occasion to fix the mother-of-pearl to
                    a goniometer by means of a cement made of rosin and bees’ wax. Upon removing it
                    from the cement, by insinuating the edge of a knife, and making it spring off,
                    the plate of mother-of-pearl left a clean impression of its own surface; and he
                    was surprised to observe, that the cement had actually received the property of
                    producing the colours which were exhibited by the mother-of-pearl. This was at
                    first attributed by our author, and others who saw the experiments, to a very
                    thin film of mother-of-pearl detached from the plate, and left upon the cement;
                    but subsequent experiments convinced him that the mother-of-pearl communicated
                    to the cement its own properties.</p>
                <p>In order to shew this remarkable property to advantage, the plate of
                    mother-of-pearl should be fixed to a handle like a seal, and its surface
                    carefully cleaned. The sealing-wax should be black, and the impression taken by
                    an impulse of the plate against the black sealing-wax, when rendered as fluid as
                    possible by heat.</p>
                <p>The properties of mother-of-pearl may also be communicated in this way to <hi
                    rend="italic">balsam of tolu, gum-arabic, gold leaf</hi> placed upon wax, <hi
                    rend="italic">tinfoil,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">fusible metal</hi> composed of
                    bismuth and mercury, and to <hi rend="italic">lead,</hi> by hard pressure, or
                    the blow of a hammer. When the impression is first made upon the <hi
                    rend="italic">fusible metah</hi> the play of colours is singularly fine; but the
                    metallic surface soon loses its polish, and the colours gradually decay.</p>
                <p>If dissolved <hi rend="italic">isinglass</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >gum-arabic,</hi> &amp;c., are placed upon the plate of mother-of-pearl, and
                    allowed to harden upon it, they will exhibit in the most splendid manner the
                    colours of the substance; or if we indurate these gums between two plates of
                    mother <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> of-pearl, we shall have transparent films,
                    exhibiting on both sides the play of the prismatic tints.</p>
                <p>In order to show that in these cases no part of the mother-of-pearl is left on
                    the surface, Sir David Brewster plunged a piece of wax, with the impression,
                    into nitric acid, which would instantly have destroyed the carbonate of lime, of
                    which the mother-of-pearl is chiefly composed, but it had no effect on the
                    colorific property of the surface. In soft cements, made of bees’ wax and rosin,
                    the slightest degree of heat destroys the superficial configuration, by which
                    the colour is produced. In <hi rend="italic">sealing-wax, isinglass,
                    gum-arabic,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">realgar,</hi> a much greater heat is
                    necessary to destroy it; but in <hi rend="italic">tinfoil</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">lead,</hi> its destruction can only be effected by the temperature
                    at which they cease to become solid.</p>
                <p>If we now examine the prismatic images <hi rend="italic">reβected</hi> from the
                    wax which has received the impression from an unpolished piece of
                    mother-of-pearl, we shall find that the single prismatic image which is thus
                    produced is on the <hi rend="italic">right hand</hi> of the common image,
                    whereas it is on the <hi rend="italic">left hand</hi> of the common image in the
                    mother-of-pearl itself.</p>
                <p>At different angles of incidence, the two coloured images formed by the wax,
                    follow the same laws as those produced by the mother-of-pearl; but the piass of
                    <hi rend="italic">green</hi> and <hi rend="italic">crimson</hi> tints never
                    appears in the impressions taken from mother-of-pearl, because they are produced
                    by light which has penetrated the mother-of-pearl, and has after refraction been
                    reflected from one or more thin plates which lie between the strata of which the
                    mother-of-pearl is composed.</p>
                <p>In communicating to <hi rend="italic">isinglass</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >gum-arabic</hi> the superficial structure of mother-of-pearl, their
                    transparency enables us to observe the phenomena of the transmitted colours. The
                    two prismatic images „were both visible—the primary one being remarkably
                    brilliant, and the second one scarcely perceptible; but when the light was
                    transmitted through the gum, the primary image was nearly extinct, while the
                    secondary one was unusually brilliant and highly coloured, far surpassing in
                    splendour those which are formed by transmission through the mother-of-pearl
                    itself. When both the surfaces of isinglass or gum-arabic have received the
                    superficial structure of mother-of-pearl, four images are seen. The <hi
                    rend="italic">transmitted</hi> colours are more brilliant in <hi rend="italic"
                    >gum-arabic</hi> than in <hi rend="italic">balsam of tolu,</hi> as the latter
                    reflects more light; but the prismatic images have the same degree of colour or
                    dispersion when formed by <hi rend="italic">isinglass</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >gum-arabic,</hi> as when they are formed upon <hi rend="italic">metallic</hi>
                    surfaces.</p>
                <p>From these facts it is obvious that the principal phenomena of mother-of-pearl
                    have their origin in a particular configuration of its surface. By the use of
                    the microscope Sir David Brewster discovered in every specimen of
                    mother-of-pearl that gave the prismatic images, a grooved structure upon its
                    surface, resembling the delicate texture of the skin at the tip of an infant’s
                    finger, or the lines which mark out islands and coasts upon a map.</p>
                <p>In many specimens of mother-of-pearl, the grooves are parallel, but they are
                    often arranged in all possible directions like the veins of agate, and in this
                    case the common reflected image is surrounded with a number of prismatic images
                    sometimes arranged in a circular or oval form, more or less regular. Sometimes
                    the spaces between the grooves, or rather the edges of the strata of the shell,
                    can be seen by the naked eye, or by a magnifying power of six or eight times, in
                    which case the prismatic images are less highly coloured, having whitish light
                    in their centre, and are placed close to the common image. At other parts of the
                    same plate, more than 3000 grooves may be counted in an inch, and in some places
                    they cannot be detected by ordinary magnifying powers. When the spaces between
                    the grooves are wide, a new groove often begins, and there is often a sudden
                    change from a series of wide grooves to a series of close ones. When the
                    mother-of-pearl is scratched, the bottom and sides of the scratches are grooved
                    exactly like the parts that are polished.</p>
                <p>The direction of the grooves is always at right angles to the line joining the
                    common image and the prismatic image. Had the grooved structure appeared only
                    upon its external surface, the phenomena and the’ communicable colours would
                    have disappeared when the surface was ground down; but the surprising part of
                    the phenomenon is, that if we grind down the external surface with the finest
                    powders, and polish it to the utmost degree, we never can grind out the grooved
                    structure, and replace it by a flat surface. The edges of the shell break off by
                    the action of the finest powders, so that the termination of one stratum cannot
                    pass into the subjacent stratum without being separated by a distinct line or
                    edge, formed by the fracture of its thin marginal parts. As all the strata have
                    thus a prismatic termination, the mass of green and crimson light is reflect <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194562663" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2663-0446"/> ed from near the
                    edge of the surface upon which the superincumbent stratum lies.</p>
                <p>- Sir John Herschel discovered in very thin plates of mo- ∙ther-of-pearl a pair
                    of nebulous prismatic images more distant from the central image than the two
                    prismatic ones above described, and also a pair of fainter nebulous images, the
                    line joining which is perpendicular to the line joining the first pair. He saw
                    them by looking through thin pieces between the 70th and 300th of an inch thick.
                    They are produced by a veined structure, in which there were 3700 veins in an
                    inch. They cross the common grooves at all angles, and are parallel to the plane
                    passing through the centres of the two systems of the coloured rings.</p>
                <p>The spurious discs of stars first noticed by Sir William Herschel, have been
                    justly considered as arising from diffraction, and have been described as
                    supplementary facts to those discovered by Fraunhofer, in Sir John Herschel’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Light</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript"> 5</hi> and we believe every thing distinctly known on the
                    subjec^, is due to the latter. A good telescope with a small power, shews fixed
                    stars as a bright mass of light with some extraneous rays. A magnifying power of
                    from 200 to 400, in favourable weather, exhibits the star as a well defined disc
                    surrounded by several alternately dark and bright equidistant rings slightly
                    coloured at their margin. These rings are best seen in refracting telescopes,
                    with which the central dise is larger than in reflectors.</p>
                <p>In applying apertures of various figures to the mirrors and object-glasses of
                    telescopes, Sir John Herschel obtained the following results:</p>
                <p>With the largest circular diaphragm, either near to, or distant from the spectrum
                    or object-glass, the dise and rings increase inversely as the diameter of the
                    aperture. When the aperture was only one inch in a telescope of seven feet in
                    focal length, the disc of the star was well defined and surrounded with one ring
                    only faintly tinged with <hi rend="italic">white,</hi> faint <hi rend="italic"
                    >red, black,</hi> very faint <hi rend="italic">blue, white,</hi> extremely faint
                    <hi rend="italic">red,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">black,</hi> reckoning from the
                    centre. With a half inch aperture, the rings were invisible, the disc greatly
                    enlarged, the light shading off to the circumference like some comets. This is
                    shewn in fig. 11, Plate CCCLXXXIL</p>
                <p>With annular apertures the phenomena were highly beau- 'tiful. When the outside
                    of the annulus was three inches and the inside one and a quarter, <hi
                    rend="italic">Capella</hi> appeared as in fig. 12, and the double star <hi
                    rend="italic">Castor</hi> as in fig. 13. When the breadth of the annular
                    aperture is diminished, the disc and the breadth of the rings also diminish,
                    while the number of visible rings increases. The appearance of Capella with
                    annular apertures of 5 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 inches exterior, 5 <hi

                    2∙2 exterior, of 2∙0 interior, is represented in figs. 14, 15, and 16. In the
                    last figure the disc was reduced to a point, and the rings were so numerous and
                    close that they could scarcely be counted. When the breadth of this annulus was
                    reduced one-half, the rings were invisible.</p>
                <p>When two annuli, as shewn in the annexed figure,were used, large halos or rings
                    were seen by Sir John Herschel, as infig.17, plateCCCLXXXI.</p>
                <p>With an aperture of the shape of an equilateral triangle, or the opening between
                    two concentrie equilateral triangles, the figure was that shewn in fig. 18, in
                    which the small central disc was extremely bright, and the field of the
                    telescope black.</p>
                <p>When the preceding figure is seen with the telescope out of focus, it changes
                    into fig. 19.</p>
                <p>When three circular apertures are placed at the angles of an equilateral
                    triangle, the effect shewn in fig. 20, is produced.</p>
                <p>When three equal and similar annular apertures were arranged in the same manner,
                    the effect was as in fig. 12. When this was thrown out of foeus, it had the
                    appearance in fig. 21; when brought better into focus, it changed into fig. 22;
                    and when in focus, into fig. 12.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    polished but besides the light which it refracts or reflects regularly, scatters
                    every way irregularly a faint light by means of which the polished surface, when
                    illuminated in a dark room by a beam of the sun’s light, may be easily seen in
                    all positions of the eye. There are certain phenomena of this scattered light,
                    which, when I first observed them, seemed very strange and surprising to me. The
                    sun shining into my darkened chamber through a hole in the shutter AB, one-third
                    of an inch wide, I let the intromitted beam of light RR fall perpendicularly
                    upon a glass speculum Μ, ground concave on one side, and convex on the other, to
                    a sphere of five feet and eleven inches radius, and quick-silvered over on the
                    convex side. And holding a white opake chart, or a quire of paper, at the centre
                    of the sphere to which the speculmn was ground, that is, at the distance of
                    about five feet and eleven inches from the speculum, in such a manner that the
                    beam of light might pass through a little hole made in the middle of the chart
                    to the speculum, and thence be reflected back to the same hole: I observed upon
                    the chart four or five concentric irises or rings of colours like rainbows,
                    after the manner that those in the fourth and following observations of the
                    first part of this third book encompassed the black spot, but yet larger and
                    fainter than those. If the distance of the chart f rom the speculum was much
                    greater or much less than that of six feet, the rings became dilute and
                    vanished,</p>
                <p>The colours of these rainbows succeeded one another from the centre outerwards,
                    in the same form and order with those transmitted through the two object
                    glasses.</p>
                <p>Measuring the diameters of these rings upon the chart, I found them also in the
                    same proportion to one another with the rings between the two object glasses.
                    For the diameters of the four first of the bright rings measured between the
                    brightest parts of their orbits at the distance of six feet from the speculum,
                    were 1{⅛, 2f, 2j½, 3∣ inches, whose squares are in arithmetical progression of
                    the numbers 1,2, 3, 4. If the white circular spot in the middle be reckoned
                    amongst the rings, and its central light, where it seems to be most luminous, be
                    put equipollent to an infinitely little ring; the squares of the diameter of the
                    rings will be in the progression 0,1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. I measured also the
                    diameters of the dark circles between these luminous ones, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194562676" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2676-0447"/>and found their squares in
                    the progression of the numbers <hi rend="smallcaps">⅜, 1⅛; 3⅜j</hi> &amp;c. The
                    diameters of the first four at the distance of six feet from the speculum, being
                    1-, ⅞, 2⅛, 2½, 4∕ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> inches. If the distance of the
                    chart from the speculum was increased or diminished, the diameters of the
                    circles were increased or diminished proportionally.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> When the beam of the sun’s light was reflected
                    back from the speculum, not directly to the hole in the window, but to a place a
                    little distant from it, the common centre of that spot, and of all the rings of
                    colours fell in the middle way between the beam of the incident light, and the
                    beam of the reflected light, and by consequence in the centre of the spherical
                    concavity of the speculum, whenever the chart on which the rings of colours fell
                    was placed at that centre. And as the beam of reflected light, by inclining the
                    speculum, receded more and more from the beam of incident light, and from the
                    common centre of the coloured rings between them these rings grew bigger and
                    bigger, and so also did the white round spot, and new rings of colours emerged
                    successively out of their common centre, and the white spot became a white ring
                    encompassing them; and the incident and reflected beams of light always fell
                    upon the opposite parts of this white ring, illuminating its perimeter like two
                    mock suns in the opposite parts of an iris. * *</p>
                <p>“The colours of the now rings were in a contrary order to those of the former,
                    and arose after this manner. The white round spot of light in the middle of the
                    rings continued white to the centre, till the distance of the incident and
                    reflected beams at the chart was about ½ parts of an inch, and then it began to
                    grow dark in the middle. And when that distance was about 1 ⅞ of an inch, the
                    white spot was become a ring encompassing a dark second spot which in the middle
                    inclined to violet and indigo. * *</p>
                <p>“When the distance between the incident and reflected beams of light became a
                    little bigger, there emerged out of the middle of the dark spot after the indigo
                    a blue, and then out of that blue a pale green, and soon after a yellow and red.
                    * *</p>
                <p>“When the distance of the two beams of light at the chart was a little more
                    increased, there emerged out of the middle in order after the red, a purple, a
                    blue, a green, a yellow, and a red inclining much to purple.” By the successive
                    development of these colours, rings are formed within the white circle till they
                    become very dilute and vanished while the white ring, and one or two on each
                    side of it, continued visible; and these also vanished when the distance between
                    the two beams of light was still more increased.</p>
                <p>“These are the phenomena,” says Sir Isaac, “of thick convexo-concave plates of
                    glass, which are everywhere of the same thickness. There are yet other phenomena
                    when these plates are a little thicker on one side than on the other, and others
                    when the plates are more or less concave than convex, or plano-convex, or double
                    convex. For in all these eases the plates make rings of colours, but after
                    various manners.”</p>

                    the most simple for exhibiting these colours, is to place the eye immediately
                    behind a small flame, from a minute wick fed with oil or wax, so that we can
                    examine them even at a perpendicular incidence. The colours of thick plates may
                    be seen even with a common candle held before the eye at the distance of ten or
                    twelve feet from a common pane of crown glass in a window that has accumulated a
                    little fine dust upon its surface, or that has on its surface a deposition of
                    fine moisture. Under these circumstances they are so very bright, that they may
                    be seen even when the pane of glass is clean.</p>

                <p>In 1815, Sir David Brewster published in the Edinburgh Transactions<note

                    “An account of a new species of coloured fringes produced by the reflection of
                    light between two plates of parallel glass of equal thickness.”</p>
                <p>In these experiments he cut the plates of glass AB, CD, fig. 112, out of the same
                    piece, and having placed between them a bit of soft bees’ wax, he pressed them
                    together till they were at the distance of nearly the tenth of an inch, and
                    slightly inclined to each other as in the figure, till one or more of the
                    reflected images of a circular luminous disc seen in the direction VR by an eye
                    at V, were reflected from the bright and direct image formed by transmitted
                    light. When this was done the reflected image was crossed with about fifteen or
                    sixteen beautiful parallel fringes. The three central fringes consist of
                    blackish and whitish stripes, and the exterior ones of brilliant stripes of red
                    and green light; and the central fringes have the same appearance in relation to
                    the external fringes, as the internal have to the external rings formed by thin
                    plates. If the two plates of glass are turned round in a plane at right angles
                    to the incident ray, the reflected images will move round the bright image, and
                    the parallel fringes will always preserve a direction at right angles to a line
                    joining the centres of the bright and reflected images. Hence it follows, <hi
                    rend="italic">that the direction of the fringes is always parallel to the common
                    section of the four reflecting surfaces, which exercise an action upon the
                    incident light.</hi></p>
                <p>The position of the plates remaining as before, let the inclination of the
                    plates, or, what is the same thing, the distance of the bright and the reflected
                    image, be varied by a gentle motion of one of the plates, <hi rend="italic">the
                    coloured fringes will be found to increase in breadth as the inclination of the
                    plates is diminished, and to diminish as the inclination of the plates is
                    increased.</hi></p>
                <p>If the light of the circular object, instead of falling perpendicularly upon the
                    plates, is incident at different obliquities, so that the plane of incidence is
                    <hi rend="italic">at right angles to the common section of the plates,</hi> no
                    fringes are visible across any of the images. But if the plane of incidence is
                    <hi rend="italic">parallel to the common section of the plates,</hi> the
                    reflected images increase in brightness with the obliquity of incidence, and the
                    coloured fringes become more vivid. When <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562689"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-2689-0448"/>the angle of incidence increases from 0° to 90°,
                    the images that have suffered the greatest number of reflections are crossed by
                    other fringes, inclined to them at a small angle. At an angle of about 44°, the
                    image formed by four reflexions is covered with interfering fringes; but it is
                    not till the angle of incidence is greater, that this is distinctly seen on the
                    image formed by two reflexions.</p>
                <p>Hitherto he had observed no fringes upon the first or bright image, which is
                    composed of light that has not suffered reflexion from the second plate of
                    glass. By concealing, however, the bright light of the first image, so as to
                    perceive the image formed by a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> reflexion, within
                    the first plate, and by viewing this image through a small aperture, which he
                    found of great service in giving distinctness to all the phenomena, he observed
                    fringes across the first image, far surpassing in precision of outline, and in
                    richness of colouring, every analogous phenomenon which he had seen. When these
                    fringes were concealed, he also observed other fringes on the image immediately
                    behind them, and formed by a <hi rend="italic">third</hi> reflexion, from the
                    interior of the first plate. He concealed the second image, upon which the
                    fringes were extremely bright, and very faint stripes were seen upon the one
                    immediately behind it.</p>
                <p>In examining these phenomena a little more attentively, he observed that the size
                    of the fringes in the first image varied with the distance of the eye from the
                    plates, while those on the second and fourth image diminished with that
                    distance.</p>
                <p>In pursuing, this inquiry, our author found <hi rend="italic">that the production
                    of the fringes depends upon the action of all the four surfaces of the two
                    plates of parallel glass</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">and that
                    the</hi><hi rend="italic">magnitudes</hi><hi rend="italic">of the fringes are
                    inversely as the thickness of the plates that produce them at a given
                    inclination.</hi></p>
                <p>When the eye is placed between the plates and the luminous object, so as to see
                    the <hi rend="italic">first, third, fifth, seventh,</hi> &amp;c. reflected
                    images, the coloured fringes are also seen, and have the same character as those
                    already described.</p>
                <p>All these phenomena are seen without any variation when polarised light is used
                    in place of common light.</p>
                <p>In order to explain the changes which the light undergoes in its passage through
                    the plates of glass, let AB, CD, fig. 113, be a section of two plates at right
                    angles to the common section of their surfaces, and let RS be a ray of light
                    incident nearly in a vertical direction. This ray, after passing through the
                    first plate AB, will suffer a small refraction at P and Q, and emerge in the
                    direction Q,V parallel to RS. At the point P, in the second plate CD, the ray TP
                    will be reflected to <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> again reflected to <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> and, after suffering a refraction at <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> will ςmerge in the direction <hi
                    rend="italic">cd,</hi> forming with RV an angle equal to twice the inclination
                    of the plates. A portion of the reflected ray P <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> will
                    enter the first plate at <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and having suffered reflexion
                    and refraction at /3, the reflected portion <hi rend="italic">βγ</hi> will reach
                    the eye at <hi rend="italic">θ.</hi> The ray P <hi rend="italic">a b c</hi> will
                    likewise suffer a reflection at <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >e,</hi> and will reach the eye at <hi rend="italic">g.</hi> In like manner, a
                    part of the ray PQ. will be reflected at Q, and move in the direction <hi
                    rend="italic">Q,r st uv,</hi> and another part of it in the direction <hi
                    rend="italic">swxyz,</hi> and these rays will suffer several other reflexions;
                    but the images which they form will be so faint, that the eye will not be
                    capable of perceiving them. When the observer, therefore, looks at a luminous
                    body, in the direction SR, through the glass plates, he will perceive two
                    images, one of which is a bright image, seen by the transmitted light Q,V, and
                    the other is a faint image, seen principally by the reflected light P <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">c d</hi> and
                    composed of several images, formed by the pencils <hi rend="italic">cd, uv, e θ,
                    z</hi> 3⅛∙, and <hi rend="italic">e g.</hi> The bright image is not crossed by
                    coloured fringes, but the fringes appear distinctly upon the other image; and
                    the light by which these fringes are formed, has suffered two reflexions from
                    the exterior surfaces, and two refractions at the interior surfaces of the
                    plates.”</p>
                <p>Dr. Thomas Young, in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Chromatics</hi> in this

                    analysis of them, that they are well fitted for illustrating the laws of this
                    class of phenomena, and may be readily explained by interference.<note

                <p>When two or three plates are combined, as in the form of concave and convex
                    lenses, and are combined as in the double and triple achromatic object-glass, a
                    series of beautiful sys-temsof rings are developed. The method of observing
                    these rings, and by which Sir David Brewster discovered them, is shewn ⅛ fig.
                    114, where ABCD is the section of the objectglass, including a meniscus of air.
                    A small flame S, is placed about four or five inches from the object-glass, and
                    a small screen G, is interposed between the flame and the eye atE, which is kept
                    as close to S as possible. The distance of the object-glass is then varied, till
                    the inverted greenish coloured flame reflected interiorly from the concave
                    surface A 1 B, seems to cover the whole area of the object-glass. When this
                    takes place, the rings may, by a slight change in the position of the
                    object-glass, or by screening the image formed by the reflection from A and B,
                    be seen in the distinctest manner over the expanded but enfeebled image formed
                    by a second reflexion from the same surface.</p>
                <p>When the flame is small, and the eye sees it projected against the centre of the
                    object-glass, the rings form a concentric system, as shewn in fig. 23, Plate
                    CCCLXXXIII, approaching closer and closer to each other, towards the
                    circumference of the lens. Two of these rings <hi rend="italic">mrnmm, η, n, n,
                    η,</hi> were distinguished from the rest by their darkness, and by the whiteness
                    of the light between them; and they are the bounding lines of four systems of
                    fringes, into which the general system subdivides itself by oblique reflection;
                    in order to see this change, incline the object-glass so that the point A is
                    farther from the eye than B, and so that the eye may receive the obliquely
                    reflected rays from every point of the surface A and B. At a slight deviation
                    from the perpendicular, the rings become smaller and closer on the side A, and
                    larger and more separated on the side B. At greater incidences the inner ring
                    <hi rend="italic">aa, fig.</hi> 23, contracts into an irregular crescent <hi
                    rend="italic">aa,</hi> fig. 24. The second and third rings <hi rend="italic"
                    >bbcc,</hi> fig. 23, do the same, as shewn at <hi rend="italic">bbee,</hi> fig.
                    24; and at a greater incidence the dark ring <hi rend="italic">nn,</hi> fig. 23,
                    assumes a similar form <hi rend="italic">nnnn,</hi> fig. 24, and forms the
                    boundary of the <hi rend="italic">remote central system, ncbaaben.</hi> In like
                    manner the lower part of the ring <hi rend="italic">nn, fig.</hi> 23, has
                    enclosed a smaller but similar system of rings, which are shewn at <hi
                    rend="italic">η'η'η'd,</hi> and may be called the <hi rend="italic">near central
                    system,.</hi> While these changes are going on, the rings without <hi
                    rend="italic">nn,</hi> fig. 23, are undergoing analogous, though opposite,
                    inflexions. The outermost, <hi rend="italic">ddd,</hi> fig. 23, divides itself
                    into two unequal portions, which run out into the circumference at the points
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562702" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2702-0449"/><hi
                    rend="italic">ădddd,</hi> fig. 24. Then the next ring, viz. the dark one, <hi
                    rend="italic">m, rn, in, m,</hi> forming the boundary of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >remote external system, m, m, m,</hi> A, and of the <hi rend="italic">near
                    central system m', m', m',</hi> B. The four groups of rings thus developed,
                    assume at greater incidences the character shewn in fig. 25, but they are not
                    seen all at once; and in tracing their form it is necessary to cause the image
                    on which they are produced to be reflected successively from different parts of
                    the lens. The rings are so closely packed together, at a distance from the white
                    centres <hi rend="italic">x'x,</hi> to which they are all related, that it is
                    extremely difficult to perceive them in the present object-glass. At a still
                    greater angle of incidence, the rays close in upon the centres <hi rend="italic"
                    >x' x,</hi> and become exceedingly close and nearer as the points <hi
                    rend="italic">x'x</hi> approach to the circumference of the lens, and the rays
                    become brighter from the increase of the light at greater obliquities.</p>
                <p>In some double object-glasses the rays can only be seen by looking through the
                    convex crown glass lens. In one object-glass the four bounding fringes at <hi
                    rend="italic">xx,</hi> fig. 25, united and formed a black cross, as shewn in
                    fig. 26. From a series of experiments Sir David Brewster has found that in the
                    object-glass shewn in fig. 113, the action of the two surfaces 1, 2 of the
                    convex lens AB, and the inner surface 3 of the concave one CD, are necessary to
                    the production of these fringes, and hence he concludes that the rings arise
                    from the interference of two pencils of light, one of which has suffered <hi
                    rend="italic">three</hi> reflections within the convex lens AB, and has passed
                    <hi rend="italic">four</hi> times through its thickness, with another pencil
                    which has suffered <hi rend="italic">two</hi> reflexions within the convex lens,
                    and <hi rend="italic">one</hi> reflexion from the inner surface of the concave
                    lens, and has passed <hi rend="italic">four</hi> times through the thickness of
                    the convex lens, and <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> through the thickness of the

                <p>Mr. W. Nicholson observed the colours of thick plates in the glasses employed for
                    the sights of sextants, and he considered them analogous to those of thin
                    plates. They have been ascribed, however, by Dr. Young,<note anchored="true"

                <p>Mr. Knox of Belfast<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Ρhil. Trans.</hi> 1815, p. 161.</p></note> has described some
                    interesting phenomena already briefly noticed by Dr. Young, in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Chromatics.</hi> Having formed a system of the rings of thin
                    plates, by placing a convex lens on a piece of silvered glass, he observed the
                    common system of reflected rings, and also the transmitted system reflected to
                    his eye by the silvered glass. This is shewn in fig.27, Plate CCCLXXXIII. where
                    A and B are the two systems; but he was surprised to observe between them a
                    system of parallel fringes CD EF, passing through the intersection of the two
                    circular systems. These fringes were equal in number to the number of the rings
                    in A and B. They were equidistant, reached the edge of the lens on both sides,
                    and were formed at right angles to the direction of the light, and to a line
                    forming the centres of the systems A and B.</p>
                <p>Our author then tried the effect of combining two primary systems of reflected
                    rings in the same manner. With this view he placed a double-convex lens about
                    thirty-six inches in focal length, on a piece of plate glass, with its under
                    side painted black, and upon the lens he placed a piece of plate glass. By these
                    means two sets of primary rings were produced, whose relative positions could be
                    altered at pleasure. By using the shadow of a black card, he found that, instead
                    of parallel fringes, as in fig. 27, he had a new species of rings of a circular
                    form, from two to three times the diameter of the primary rings from which they
                    originated. These rings passed, as before, through the intersections of the
                    primary ones; and the ring which divided the two classes passed through a point,
                    whose distance from the centre of each primary set were in proportion to their
                    longest diameters.</p>
                <p>These rings, which Mr. Knox calls <hi rend="italic">intersectionary</hi> ones,
                    may be made to vary infinitely in their dimensions, according as the diameters
                    of the primary sets differ more or less, being least where that difference is
                    greatest, and increasing in size as the two primary sets approach to equality,
                    until at last they become straight lines, when the two primary sets are equal.
                    The dimensions of the intersectionary rings will also, as Mr. Knox remarks, <hi
                    rend="italic">ceteris paribus,</hi> diminish as the two primary sets approach,
                    and increase as they recede from one another.</p>
                <p>As these intersectionary rings are almost always accompanied by a second, and
                    sometimes by a third set of equal or unequal dimensions, Mr. Knox supposes that
                    they may be produced by primary sets, combined with either transmitted or
                    reflected sets, provided the two between which they are formed are of unequal
                    dimensions.</p>
                <p>Considering the intersectionary fringes as diagonals to the angles at which they
                    were formed, Mr. Knox conjectured that if he could form rectilineal fringes by
                    flat plates, and combine them at different angles, he would produce a third or
                    diagonal set placed between the other two. He accordingly took a pair of slips
                    of glass, and by applying two of their ends together, and using some friction,
                    and a considerable degree of pressure, he formed a fine set of rectilineal
                    fringes. By applying a third slip of glass longitudinally to the upper one of
                    the first two, he formed a similar set of rectilineal fringes at right angles to
                    the first; and he immediately observed the diagonal fringes, which he had
                    anticipated, appear in the angle between the two primary sets, as shewn in fig.
                    28, where B and C are the primary fringes, and D the intersectionary set,
                    divided into two classes, as shewn by the dotted line. By forming the second set
                    of fringes at different angles with the first, the central band of the
                    intersectionary fringes always bisected the angle. It is a curious circumstance,
                    that though the diagonal fringes are formed by the crossing of the two primary
                    sets, yet they never appear at the opposite angle A, nor could they be made to
                    appear in any angle formed by primary fringes, unless these fringes were so
                    disposed as to have their red sides turned towards each other.</p>
                <p>Dr. Young has given an explanation of these curious phenomena in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Chromatics,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    reader.</p>
                <p>Mr. Henry Fox Talbot upon superposing two films of blown glass and viewing
                    through them a homogeneous yellow flame, and even the light of the sky, observed
                    bright and dark stripes, or coloured bands and fringes, which were not produced
                    by either of them separately. These phenomena, as Sir John Herschel remarks, are
                    obviously referable to the same principle as the fringes discovered by Sir David
                    Brewster, “the interference taking place here between rays respectively twice
                    reflected within the upper lamina, and once reflected at the upper surface of
                    the lower lamina, or else between rays, one of which is thrice reflected in the

                    the Colours of Fibres formed by Reflexion and Transmission.</hi></p>
                <p>Every person must have observed the fine thread or line of the spider’s web
                    glittering with the brightest colours, when the light of the sun is reflected
                    from it to the eye. By examining these colours attentively, they are found to
                    vary with the angle of incidence. The only attempt that we know of to explain
                    this phenomenon, that deserves notice, is that of Sir John Herschel :—“These
                    colours,” says he, “may arise either from a similar cause, (namely, that which
                    produces colour in a single scratch or fissure, or the interference of light
                    reflected from its opposite edges,) or from the thread itself as spun by the
                    animal, consisting of several agglutinated together, and thus presenting not a
                    cylindrical but a furrowed surface.” That the structure thus assumed would
                    produce colours cannot be doubted, but they would be the colours of grooved
                    surfaces such as we have already described, which we conceive to be exceedingly
                    different from those of the spider’s line«</p>
                <p>It appears from a preceding section, that when a reflecting surface has its
                    breadth reduced to an extreme degree of narrowness, whether it be a metallic or
                    a transparent one, it is no longer capable of reflecting white light, but
                    decomposes it in the manner already described, the coloured bands being
                    transverse to the direction of the reflecting line. Sir David Brewster has
                    therefore applied this new property of ιeffecting surfaces to account for the
                    colour of the spider’s line, which presents analogous phenomena, and which from
                    its extreme minuteness, must necessarily decompose white light. If this is not
                    the true cause of the phenomenon, it will not be easy to obtain any rational
                    explanation from the doctrine ofinterference, without taking for granted the
                    existence of a structure of a very peculiar kind.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On the Colours of Fibres by transmitted Light.</hi></p>
                <p>If we take a number of fibres of wool, and fix them in parallel directions, as in
                    Fraunhofer’s gratings, they would of course produce parallel spectra or coloured
                    bands similar to those already described. If we take a mass of the same wool, in
                    which the fibres have every possible direction, they will then exhibit spectra
                    or fringes lying in every possible direction, or circular ones. As both these
                    results would be equally obtained, if the fibres were cut down into particles as
                    long as they are broad, we should have parallel fringes -when the particles arc
                    arranged in straight lines, and circular ones when the particles are scattered
                    like dust upon a plate of glass in all directions. Hence fibres of minute
                    particles will produce circular fringes, which increase in diameter as the
                    particles are smaller in diameter.</p>
                <p>When we therefore look at a candle placed at a little dis- <hi rend="superscript"
                    > ,</hi> tance, through wool, or cotton, or vapour lying upon glass, or diluted
                    blood, or milk, or the seed and farina of plants, &amp;c. &amp;c., we observe
                    round the image of the candle a light area terminating in a <hi rend="italic"
                    >dark reddish</hi> margin. This is followed by a ring of <hi rend="italic"
                    >bluish green</hi> light, and then a <hi rend="italic">red</hi> ring, and when
                    the fibres or particles have an uniform size, the green and red rings are
                    frequently repeated. It is to Dr. Young that we owe the discovery that the
                    diameter of these rings is always the same when the size of the particles or
                    fibres is uniform and equal, and that they vary inversely as the size of the
                    fibres or particles. On this principle he constructed his <hi rend="italic"
                    >eriometer</hi> for measuring the diameter of minute particles and fibres, such
                    as <hi rend="italic">wool,</hi> &amp;c. It is composed of a plate of brass, or
                    copper, or even card, with an aperture in the centre about the fortieth of an
                    inch in diameter, and surrounded by a circle of perforations about half an inch
                    in diameter, the number of perforations in the circle being about ten or twelve,
                    and as minute as possible. When the instrument is constructed on such a small
                    scale, the eye requires the aid of a lens. The wool, or plate of particles, are
                    then attached to the end of a slider, and when the light of an argand lamp, or
                    two or three candles placed in a line, so as to unite their flames, is
                    transmitted through the wool or particles, the slider is drawn out till the
                    first <hi rend="italic">dark red</hi> coloured circle coincides with the circle
                    of particles, and the index then shews on the scale upon the slider the number
                    which indicates the size of the fibres or particles. The basis of this scale,
                    rather an imperfect one, Dr. Young took from Dr. Wollaston’s measure of the
                    magnitude of the seeds of the <hi rend="italic">puffball</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Lycoperdon bovista,</hi> which he found to be the 8500ths of an
                    inch in diameter. Dr. Young found the rings formed by these minute seeds to be
                    three-and-a-half on the scale of his instrument, and hence he assumes the <hi
                    rend="italic">thirty thousandth</hi> part of an inch, (more accurately the
                    29750th), as the value of an unit on his scale. The following results were
                    obtained by Dr. Young :—</p>

                    pounds of wool that are worth 100 guineas. In the case of good Lioneza wool for
                    example, whose number is 25, we shall have 25 × 25 —325 =300 for 100 guineas, or
                    seven shillings per pound.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>In experiments of this kind it would be better to express the magnitude of the
                    first ring in parts of the radius, or by the angle which the whole ring subtends
                    at the eye. Those who have any of Mr. Barton’s scales, with the number of lines
                    in an inch marked, can easily compare the diameter of the first ring produced
                    either by fibres or particles, with the distance of the red spaces in the two
                    first prismatic images; and by the rule of proportion he will find the magnitude
                    of the fibres or particles.</p>

                <p>The phenomena of colour observed by Μ. Mazeas, when he pressed between two

                    surfaces, warming them at the same time in order to disperse the suet. He then
                    rubbed them violently together in a circular manner, and was surprised at
                    looking at a candle through them to see it surrounded with two or three
                    concentric rings, very broad, and with very lively and delicate colours, namely,
                    a red inclining to yellow, and a <hi rend="italic">green</hi> like that of an
                    emerald. By continuing the friction, the rings assumed the colours of <hi

                    when he looked through the glasses on bodies directly opposed to the sun.</p>

                <p> Dr. Thomas Young, apparently without knowing of the experiments of Mazeas,
                    though they are fully detailed by Priestley, has described the very same colours
                    under the name of the <hi rend="italic">colours of mixed plates,</hi> and the
                    merit of discovery of these colours has been ascribed to him by almost all modem
                    writers. The method of producing the colours by suet, as given above by Mazeas,
                    is exceedingly simple, while many persons have failed in repeating the
                    experiments described by Dr. Young. It is to Dr. Young, however, that we owe the
                    higher obligation of having discovered the general principle to which these
                    colours must be referred, though he has not examined the phenomena with that
                    attention which they merited. The following is the account which Dr. Young has
                    given of the colours of mixed plates.</p>
                <p>“I first noticed the colours of mixed plates, in looking at a candle through two
                    pieces of plate glass, with a little moisture between them. I observed an
                    appearance of fringes resembling the common colours of thin plates; and, upon
                    looking for the fringes by reflection, I found that these new fringes were
                    always in the same direction as the other fringes, but many times larger. By
                    examining the glasses with a magnifier, I perceived that wherever these fringes
                    were visible, the moisture was intermixed with portions of air, producing an
                    appearance similar to dew. I then supposed that the origin of the colours was
                    the same as that of the colours of halos; but, on a more minute examination, I
                    found that the magnitude of the portions of air and water wasbyno means uniform,
                    and that the explanation was therefore inadmissible. It was, however, easy to
                    find two portions of light sufficient for the production of these fringes; for
                    the light transmitted through the water, moving in it with a velocity different
                    from that of the light passing through the interstices filled only with air, the
                    two portions would interfere with each other, and produce effects of colour
                    according to the general law. The ratio of the velocities, in water and in air,
                    is that of 3 to 4; the fringes ought therefore to appear where the thickness is
                    6 times as great as that which corresponds to the same colour in the common case
                    of thin plates; and, upon making the experiment with a plain glass and a lens
                    slightly convex, I found the sixth dark circle actually of the same diameter as
                    the first in the new fringes. The colours are also very easily produced, when
                    butter or tallow is substituted for water; and the rings then become smaller, on
                    account of the greater refractive density of the oils; but, when water is added,
                    so as to fill up the interstices of the oil, the rings are very much enlarged;
                    for here the difference only of the velocities in water and in oil is to be
                    considered, and this is much smaller than the difference between air and water.
                    It appears to be necessary for the production of these colours, that the glasses
                    he held nearly in a right line between the eye and the common termination of a
                    dark and luminous object; the portion of the rings, seen on the dark ground, is
                    then more distinct than the remaining portion; and, instead of being
                    continuations of the rings, they exhibit every where opposite colours, so as to
                    resemble the colours of common thin plates seen by reflection, and not by
                    transmission. In order to understand this circumstance, we must consider that
                    where a dark object as A is placed behind the glasses, the whole of the light
                    which comes to the eye, is either refracted through the edges of the drops, (as
                    the rays B, C,) or reflected from the internal surface (as D, E,) while the
                    light which passes through those parts of the glasses which are on the side
                    opposite to the dark object, consists of rays refracted as before through the
                    edges, (as F, G,) or simply passing through the fluid, (as II, I.) The
                    respective combinations of these portions of light exhibit a series of colours
                    of different orders, since the internal reflection modifies the interference of
                    the rays on the dark side of the object, in the same manner as in the common
                    colours of thin plates seen by reflection. When no dark object is near, both
                    these series of colours are produced at once; and since they are always of an
                    opposite nature at any given thickness of a plate, they neutralize each other,
                    and constitute white light.</p>
                <p>In applying the general law of interference to these colours, as well as to those
                    of thin plates already known, it is impossible to avoid a supposition which is a
                    part of the undulatory theory, that is, that the velocity of light is the
                    greater, the rarer the medium; and there is also a condition annexed to this
                    explanation of the colours of mixed plates, as well as to that of the colours of
                    simple thin plates, which involves another part of the same theory; that is, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194562741" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2741-0452"/> that where one of
                    the portions of light has been reflected at the surface of a rarer medium, it
                    must be supposed to be retarded one half of the appropriate interval; for
                    instance, in the central black spot of a soap bubble, where the actual lengths
                    of the paths very nearly coincide, but the effect is the same as if one of the
                    portions had been so retarded as to destroy the other. From considering the
                    nature of this circumstance, I ventured to predict, that if the two reflections
                    were of the same kind, made at the surfaces of a thin plate of a density
                    intermediate between the densities of the mediums containing it, the effect
                    would be reversed, and the central spot, instead of black would become white;
                    and I have now the pleasure of stating, that I have fully verified this
                    conclusion by interposing a drop of oil of sassafras between a prism of
                    flint-glass and a lens of crown-glass; the central spot seen by reflected light
                    was white, and surrounded by a dark ring. It was however necessary to use some
                    force, in order to produce a contact sufficiently intimate; and the white spot
                    differed, even at last, in the same degree from perfect whiteness, as the black
                    spot usually does from perfect blackness. There are also some irregularities
                    attending the phenomena exhibited in this manner by different refracting
                    substances, especially when the reflexion is total, which deserves farther
                    investigation.”</p>
                <p>We are not aware that these interesting experiments of Mazeas and Dr. Young, have
                    been repeated by any modern writer, our treatises on optics containing merely an
                    abstract of Dr. Young’s results. The subject has, however, been recently taken
                    up by Sir David Brewster, who had found that the <hi rend="italic">colours of
                    mixed plates,</hi> in place of being merely the result of an experiment, was a
                    <hi rend="italic">natural phenomenon</hi> of a very interesting kind, which
                    frequently presented itself in the examination of minerals. He was therefore led
                    to attach a greater interest to the phenomena which they present. As the
                    paper<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This paper will
                    probably appear in the <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans.</hi> for 1838, part
                    i.</p></note> which contains the results of his inquiries has not been
                    published, we can only give a brief notice of them.</p>
                <p>In order to produce these colours so as to be permanent, he found that the froth
                    of albumen, (the white of an egg beat up into froth) ground circularly as it
                    were between two thick plates of glass pressed firmly together, when the
                    circular motion is stopped, exhibits the colours very splendidly. The glasses
                    may then be held together by wax or by screws. If we desire to have a circular
                    system of rings, we must use a convex lens in place of one of the plates.
                    Whipped cream answers also very well; but paste that has become very smooth by
                    age he found preferable to any other substance which he employed. When the
                    experiment is successfully made, the colours are extremely splendid, the flame
                    of a candle or other luminous body being of a bright colour complementary to
                    that of the coloured light which surrounds it.</p>
                <p>Upon looking with a microscope at the albumen or paste thus pressed into a film,
                    it is found to resemble accurately the strata of cavities containing the new
                    fluids, and sometimes water, as in <hi rend="italic">sulphate of lime,</hi>
                    &amp;c·, the paste being sometimes found in separate ramified patches of all
                    shapes surrounded with air, while on some occasions numerous air cavities are
                    included in the paste.</p>
                <p>Although Dr. Young was correct in ascribing the colours of mixed plates to the
                    interference of rays moving with different velocities in passing through the two
                    contiguous media, yet his analysis of the phenomena is imperfect, and his
                    determination of the interfering pencils incorrect. In his 39th lecture he
                    ascribes “the colours seen in the dark part beyond the object, to the light
                    scattered irregularly from the surfaces of the fluid,”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">.Elements &lt;&gt;f Natural
                    Philosophy,</hi> vol. i. p. 470.</p></note> and in his description of fig. 115,
                    above quoted, he specifies as the interfering portions which produce the
                    colours, viz. <hi rend="italic">rays reflected</hi> from the internal surface of
                    the cavities, with <hi rend="italic">rays refracted</hi> through the edges of
                    the drops; and <hi rend="italic">rays refracted</hi> through the edge with rays
                    <hi rend="italic">simply passing</hi> through the fluid. That the colours of
                    mixed plates are not produced either by refracted or reflected pencils, is at
                    once proved by the fact, that the same colours may be produced when the most
                    refracting medium is terminated by a fine edge, and is itself a plate with
                    perfectly parallel surfaces, so that there is no edge to reflect light, and no
                    inclined faces to refract it. Having obtained this result, Sir David Brewster
                    viewed the subject in another aspect, and has shewn that the phenomenon is
                    entirely one of inflexion caused by the edge of a transparent inflecting body
                    sufficiently thin to produce colours by the interference of the retarded light
                    passing through the body close to its edge, with the light passing within the
                    body close to its edge. The same pencils which interfere in the common case of a
                    diffracting body interfere in the present case; but the pencils that pass
                    through the transparent plate are modified by the retardation which they
                    experience, so as to produce the phenomena of colours. The oppositely coloured
                    pencils in mixed plates form part of the system of diffracted fringes, the
                    colour seen upon the luminous body occupying the shadow of the diffracting edge,
                    and the opposite colour seen around or beside the candle occupying the first
                    fringe on each side of the shadow. The colours in the fringe on the left hand of
                    the shadow of the diffracting edge, are seen by the eye on the right hand side
                    of the candle, and those in the fringe on the right hand of the shadow are seen
                    by the eye on the left hand side of the candle.</p>
                <p>All the preceding phenomena may be produced by breaking down a thin transparent
                    plate into minute portions, and when these portions are made to float in a
                    fluid, or are placed between two plates of glass containing a fluid of nearly
                    the same refractive power as the solid portions. The solid portions will thus
                    act like much thinner plates placed in air, and we shall observe the identical
                    phenomena which take place with the cavities in paste or albumen. When we
                    examine with the microscope a very narrow portion of the solid substance bounded
                    by lines nearly parallel, we perceive the phenomena of mixed plates under a new
                    aspect. The space between the shadow of the two edges is filled up with a bright
                    band of the colour which occupies the two first external fringes, and as the
                    innermost fringe of each edge overlap each other, the colour has double the
                    intensity. The same phenomenon is often seen in the parallel ramifications, or
                    in the long cavities produced by the paste or albumen when the last act of
                    friction was to move one of the plates of glass in a straight line.</p>
                <p>The phenomena of mixed plates have been discovered by Sir David Brewster in <hi
                    rend="italic">sulphate of lime,</hi> in which there are shallow crystallised
                    cavities in great numbers forming regular strata in the mineral. These cavities
                    are filled with water, and in this case the diffracting edge is the edge of the
                    cavity, and the light which passes through the water has its velocity greater
                    than that which passes through the solid mineral.</p>
                <p>In one remarkable circulai· stratum of cavities, all the cavities in the centre
                    were the deepest, and gradually diminished in depth towards the circumference,
                    till the microscope could scarcely resolve them. The highest orders of colours
                    were therefore in the middle of the stratum, and they gradually descended to a
                    white of the first order, at the circumference of the circular stratum.</p>
                <p>An interesting experiment lately published by Henry Fox Talbot, Esq.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Lord. and
                    Ed. Phil. Mag.</hi> May 1837, p∙ 364.</p></note> is a phenomenon of mixed
                    plates, in which the densest of the plates is too thick to produce the colours
                    at its edge in common light. “Make,” says he, “a circular hole in a piece of
                    card, of the size of the pupil <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562754"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-2754-0453"/>of the eye. Cover one half of this opening with an
                    extremely thin film of glass (probably mica would answer the purpose as well or
                    better.) Then view through this aperture a perfect spectrum formed by a prism of
                    moderate dispersive power, and the spectrum will appear covered throughout its
                    length with parallel obscure bands resembling the absorptions produced by iodine
                    vapour. The cause of this phenomenon probably is, that one half of the light
                    which passes through the glass film has its undulations thereby retarded by a
                    certain quantity.”</p>
                <p>This ]&gt;henomenon, which we have observed under various modifications, arises
                    from the diffraction of the light passing on each side of and very close to the
                    edge of the film; for if we cover this edge even with a fine wire, we obstruct
                    the diffracted fringes modified by the retardation of the denser plate, and the
                    phenomenon vanishes. Hence in order to see the fringes in perfection, we must
                    make tire aperture no wider than to include the space on each side of the edge
                    of the film within which the light passes that is concerned in the phenomenon.
                    As the light here used is perfectly homogeneous, the bands are alternately
                    coloured and obscure.</p>
                <p>Sir David Brewster has observed the fringes described by Mr. Talbot with thick
                    plates having fine edges, and immersed in fluids, and even with plates of glass
                    the 15th part of an inch thick, by looking through their edge upon a highly
                    dispersed spectrum formed by a large refracting angle of a prism, and magnified
                    by a powerful telescope. The perfection of the edge of the film, and an equality
                    of thickness, are essential to the production of the fringes in their most
                    interesting form. Sir David Brewster obtained them by looking through plates of
                    sulphate of lime, where there were not properly speaking plates of different
                    refractive powers, but where the plate suddenly became thicker, as shewn in the
                    annexed figure, where AB, EC is the plate of sulphate of lime, which becomes
                    thicker at E. When the eye looks through it at the spectrum in the direction ED,
                    it sees the fringes which have the same magnitude as if the plate ADB were
                    removed, and the eye looked only through the plate CE, in which case it is
                    clearly a phenomenon of mixed plates.</p>
                <p>When these dark lines were produced in great perfection, they had a sort of
                    granular structure resembling fine screws at their edges, and sometimes
                    appearing to enclose minute specks of light. Several other remarkable phenomena
                    accompanying these fringes were communicated by the author to the British
                    Association at Liverpool, and will appear in the next volume of the

                <p>PART. VI.—ON THE DOUBLE REFRACTION OF LIGHT.</p>
                <p>In the preceding part of this article we have supposed that when light is
                    transmitted vertically through the surfaces or through the mass of transparent
                    bodies, or when it passes obliquely and is refracted by the same bodies, it
                    leaves the surface or emerges from the body in a single pencil, either perfectly
                    white, or decomposed into a diverging beam of coloured light. This supposition
                    is perfectly correct, under certain circumstances, for gaseous and fluid bodies,
                    for glass slowly and equally cooled, and for a numerous class of crystallized
                    bodies, whose primitive form is either the <hi rend="italic">cube,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">regular octahedron,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >rhomboidal</hi><hi rend="italic">dedceahedron.</hi> When these bodies have the
                    same temperature and density throughout their mass, and are not exposed to any
                    pressure, a pencil of light will be transmitted through them <hi rend="italic"
                    >single,</hi> according to the laws already explained.</p>
                <p>When a pencil of light falls upon all other bodies, such as artificial crystals,
                    or salts on crystallized minerals, which have not the above primitive forms;
                    upon animal substances, such as bone, horn, shell, hair, crystalline lenses of
                    animal and elastic integuments; upon vegetable bodies, such as particular
                    leaves, stalks and seeds; upon artificial bodies such as gums, resins, jellies,
                    and solid bodies that have a variable density, during the transient passage of
                    heat, or from rapid cooling, or unequal temperature and pressure :— when a
                    pencil of light falls upon such bodies, it will be refracted into two distinct
                    pencils, more or less inclined to each other according to the mechanical
                    condition of the body, or to the direction in which the pencil passes through
                    it. In some minerals and artificial crystals, this refraction of the two pencils
                    is very great, and, generally speaking, is in such crystals, easily observed and
                    measured; but in some cases it is not visible unless by transmitting the light
                    through prisms of the body with large refracting angles; and in very many cases,
                    the existence of two pencils is inferred only from certain other properties,
                    which always accompany the property of giving double pencils. This separation of
                    a single pencil into two, is called <hi rend="italic">double refraction,</hi>
                    and the bodies which have such a property are called <hi rend="italic">doubly
                    refracting crystals</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bodies.</hi></p>
                <p>In many regular crystals there is <hi rend="italic">one line</hi> through which,
                    if a single pencil of light is transmitted, it does not experience double
                    refraction. This line is called the <hi rend="italic">axis of the crystal,</hi>
                    or the <hi rend="italic">axis of double refraction,</hi> and such crystals are
                    denominated crystals with one axis of double refraction. In other crystals there
                    are two lines through which, if the single pencil of light is transmitted, it
                    does not experience double refraction. Such crystals are denominated crystals
                    with two axes of double refraction. We shall treat of these two classes in
                    separate sections.</p>

                    Refraction in Crystals with one Axis.</hi></p>
                <p>As Bartholinus discovered the property of double refraction in the mineral called
                    <hi rend="italic">Iceland spar, calcareous spar,</hi> or by chemists, <hi

                    fitted for exhibiting the phenomena, owing to its perfect transparency, and the
                    great separation of the two pencils, This mineral consists, according to
                    Stromeyer, of 56*15 parts of lime, and 43∙7 of carbonic acid. It crystallises in
                    the form of an obtuse rhombohedron, as shewn in fig. 117, where ABCB, ABCB,
                    &amp;c. are the faces of the rhombohedron, and AA ’, the axis of the
                    rhombohedron, on the two joining its two obtuse angles.</p>
                <p>The following are the dimensions of the crystal, as given by Malus, who observes
                    that the first angle, from which all the rest are derived, is within <hi

                <p>As Iceland spar cleaves equally in planes parallel to all its six faces, it is
                    easy to cut out of any mass of it an accurate rhombohedron in which all the
                    three sides AB, A' B , A"B", are equal; but for the purposes of experiment it is
                    sufficient to have a piece with two smooth and parallel faces formed by
                    cleavage, or ground and polished parallel to the cleavage planes.</p>
                <p>Let AX be such a piece of Iceland spar, and ABDC its upper surface. If we place
                    its lower surface upon a piece of paper having a black line MN, drawn upon it,
                    and if we place the eye above the upper surface, we shall see the line MN
                    distinctly doubled; or if it should appear single, the two images will separate,
                    by turning the spar a little round, and thelinewill appear double as at MN, and
                    <hi rend="italic">mn.</hi> The one line will be found to coincide with the
                    other, when MN is parallel to AD, the short diagonal of the rhomboidal face
                    ABDC, and the lines will appear most separated, when MN is parallel, as in the
                    figure, to the long diagonal BC. If a black spot is used in place of a line
                    placed at O, it will appear double in every position, and in turning the crystal
                    round, the other image E will seem to revolve round 0.</p>
                <p>The best way, however, of shewing the double refraction of the Iceland spar, is
                    to make a ray of light Rr, fall upon the crystal at <hi rend="italic">r.</hi>
                    This ray will be refracted into two pencils or rays, rO, rE, and these will be
                    again refracted at the second surface of the spar in directions Ee, Oo, parallel
                    to the original ray Rr. If we measure the angles of refraction of the fixed ray
                    Oo, corresponding to several angles of incidence from 0° to 90°, we shall find
                    that these angles are always to one another in the constant ratio of 1 to 1*654,
                    and that the refracted ray rO is always in the plane of incidence. It follows,
                    therefore, that this ray is refracted as in water and glass, according to the
                    ordinary law of refraction discovered by Snellius. Hence it is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">ordinary ray.</hi> But if we make the same experiments on the
                    other ray rE, we shall find that at an incidence of 0°, in place of passing on
                    unreif acted, it is actually refracted 6° 12'; that at other incidences its
                    angles of refraction are not regulated by the law of Sncllius, and that the ray
                    rE is not in the plane of incidence. We conclude, therefore, that the ray rE is
                    refracted according to some new or extraordinary law which remains to be
                    investigated, and hence the ray rE is called the <hi rend="italic">extraordinary
                    ray.</hi></p>
                <p>If we grind down the two solid obtuse angles A, A', fig. 116, so that the ground
                    surfaces are perpendicular to the axis A A', and if we polish their surfaces,
                    and transmit a ray perpendicularly through them, so as to be parallel to the
                    axis AA, we shall find that there is only one refracted ray, and hence there is
                    no double refraction along the axis. Now this line AA' is not a <hi
                    rend="italic">fixed axis</hi> like that of the earth; it is merely a <hi
                    rend="italic">fixed direction</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for every line
                    parallel to AA' enjoys the property of an axis, as there is no double refraction
                    in lines parallel to A A'.</p>
                <p>In order to obtain an accurate idea of the law of extraordinary refraction, or
                    that by which the extraordinary ray <hi rend="italic">rE</hi> is regulated, let
                    ns take a rhomb, such as that shewn in fig. 117, and grind it into an accurate
                    sphere, and then polish it. Let ACBD be such a sphere, AB being its axis of
                    double refraction, corresponding with AA' in fig. 117, and let 0 be its centre.
                    If we now bend a piece of sheet lead or sheet copper into an arch ADB, and
                    making a small hole in it opposite to A, and another opposite to B, cement a
                    handle to it about D, it will enable us, in the following manner, to detect the
                    general law of extraordinary refraction. The use of the two holes in this
                    experiment is to ensure that the light admitted through one of them, and
                    emerging at the other, shall pass through the centre 0 of the sphere. Let one of
                    the holes be now placed in the surface of the sphere at A, and the eye at the
                    other hole at B, the hole will appear single, shewing that the double refraction
                    is there nothing. Let the hole be shifted gradually from A to C, and the other
                    hole will move from B to D. In the different positions from A to C, it will be
                    seen that the hole begins to become double on leaving A, and that the distance
                    of the two images of it gradually increases from A to C, where it becomes a
                    maximum. The same result will be obtained by making the hole move from A to D,
                    or in any quadrant of the sphere passing through the poles A and B. The very
                    same result will be obtained if the hole moves from B to C, or from B to D. If
                    we now make one of the holes move along the equator COD, we shall find that by
                    placing the eye at the other hole, the distance of the images will be exactly
                    the same, or the double refraction the same in every part of the equator. Hence
                    the general law of double refraction in crystals with one axis, is a very simple
                    one: it is nothing at the poles; it increases gradually from the poles to the
                    equator, where it is a maximum; it is the same in the same parallels of
                    latitude; and the preceding experiments will also shew that the line joining the
                    centres of the two images is in the plane of the meridian.</p>
                <p>Let the index of extraordinary refraction be now measured at the pole A, where it
                    is the same as the ordinary index, and at the equator C, and it will be found to
                    be 1∙654, or rn, in the former case, and 1∙488, or rn', in the latter. Now
                    Huygens was led by a theory which has been explained under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Chromatics,</hi> to the following law, which he verifiedby experiment, and
                    which has been confirmed by the experiments of Wollaston, Malus, and other
                    philosophers. Upon the axis AB of the sphere, fig. 118, describe an ellipse Ac,

                    >negative</hi> doubly refracting crystals.</p>
                <p>The preceding law of double refraction was believed by Malus to be universal, and
                    applicable to all crystals that had this property. Μ. Biot, however, discovered
                    that in quartz or rock crystal the extraordinary ray had its index of refraction
                    <hi rend="italic">m'</hi> greater than the ordinary index <hi rend="italic"
                    >m.</hi> This mineral crystallises in six-sided prisms, as shewn in the annexed
                    figure, terminated by six-sided pyramids, A and B. If we grind down and polish
                    the summits A and B of a large crystal, perpendicular to the axis AB, and if we
                    determine the index of refraction when the rays pass along AB, we shall find it
                    to be as Malus found it, l∙5484, and without any double refraction, and 1∙5544
                    in a direction perpendicular to the axis.</p>
                <p>If we now grind the crystal into a sphere ACBD, fig. 121, and if we perform the
                    very same experiments with it as we did with Iceland spar, we shall obtain
                    analogous results. The double refraction will be found to increase from the
                    poles A, B, to the equator CD, and to be the same in every part of the equator,
                    and in each parallel of latitude; the only differences between it and calcareous
                    spar being that the double refraction is less, and that the index of refraction
                    of the extraordinary ray is always <hi rend="italic">greater</hi> than that of
                    the ordinary ray.</p>
                <p>The extraordinary refraction of quartz will, therefore, as Μ. Biot has shewn, be
                    represented by a prolate spheroid generated by the revolution of the ellipse
                    AcB¢Z, whose greater axis AB is to the lesser <hi rend="italic">cd</hi> as — <hi

                    equally inclined to IKL, perpendicular to the surface at thepointofincidenceK;
                    then if KM is the refracted ray, corresponding to a ray IK, incident
                    perpendicularly, the other rays VK, SK, will be refracted in directions KT, KX,
                    so that TM is equal to XM.</p>
                <p>Although the determination of the extraordinarily refracted ray is very simple,
                    when the crystal is supposed to be spherical, yet the formula becomes
                    complicated when we suppose the ray incident in any given direction upon a
                    natural surface of Iceland spar. Malus has investigated such a formula, but our

                    crystal, formed by the surface upon which the ray is incident. Let the ray RC
                    fall upon its centre, and let BCK be the intersection of the plane of incidence
                    with the face of the crystal. Let EMH be a part of the oblate spheroid within
                    the crystal or below its surface, the axis of the spheroid passing through and
                    having any inclination to the surface. Then draw in the plane KCR a line CO
                    perpendicular to RC, and having drawn Ο K perpendicular to OC, or parallel to

                <p>From a very extensive series of experiments on the double refraction of
                    crystallised bodies, Sir David Brewster was led to the general law, that all
                    crystals whose primitive form has only <hi rend="italic">one axis</hi> of
                    figure, or one pre-eminent line, round which the matter of the crystals is
                    symmetrically arranged, had also <hi rend="italic">one axis</hi> of double
                    refraction, and that their axis of figure was likewise the axis of double
                    refraction.</p>
                <p>The following are the primitive forms which possess this geometrical and optical

                    Refraction in Crystals with two axes.</hi></p>
                <p>When Μ. Malus published his theory of double refraction, and even so late as
                    1816, all crystals were believed to have only one <hi rend="italic">axis</hi> of
                    double refraction, one of the rays being refracted by the ordinary law, and the
                    other by the extraordinary law, above explained. During the examination of an
                    extensive class of minerals and artificial salts, Sir David Brewster was led to
                    the discovery of crystals with <hi rend="italic">two axes of double
                    refraction.</hi></p>
                <p>The general character of the phenomena presented by such crystals will be
                    understood from fig. 129, where we may suppose, as before, the crystal to have
                    the form of a sphere.</p>
                <p>In place of there being one line along which there is no double refraction, there
                    are two such as PO∕), P'Ojt∕, in which the incident pencil is not divided into
                    two. The double refraction increases on each side of these axes, from P, to C
                    and A, and from P ʹ to D and A. The double refraction increases in the very same
                    manner from <hi rend="italic">p</hi> to C and B, and from <hi rend="italic"
                    >p'</hi> to D and B, according to a law which will afterwards be explained.</p>
                <p>In continuing his investigations, Sir David Brewster found crystals in which the
                    axes POp, P'O∕&gt;' formed all possible angles with each other from 0° up to
                    90°, and he was led also to the important result, that these two axes were not
                    real axes of double refraction like those in uniaxal crystals, but were only <hi
                    rend="italic">resultant axes,</hi> as he called them, or <hi rend="italic">axes
                    of compensation.</hi> The grounds on which he formed this opinion were, that
                    these lines PO∕&gt;, P'O∕∕ had no relation whatever to any fixed or
                    permanentlines in theprimitiveform of the crystals, like the axes of uniaxal
                    crystals, and that the double refraction did not altogether vanish along these
                    lines, as in Iceland spar and other minerals with no axis. He was led to these
                    results, not by measuring the double refraction itself, but by the phenomena
                    which will be presently explained. At this time it was the opinion of our
                    author, and afterwards that of Μ. Biot and other distinguished philosophers,
                    that in <hi rend="italic">biaxal</hi> as in uniaxal crystals, one of the rays
                    was refracted according to the ordinary law of Snellius, and the other according
                    to an extraordinary law, and hence the investigation of the extraordinary law
                    occupied the attention of our author.</p>
                <p>In commencing this inquiry, he assumed as the two real axes of double refraction,
                    the line AB bisecting the angle formed by the apparent or resultant axes PO∕),
                    P'O∕∕, and another line at right angles to it, viz. either the line CD, or the
                    line perpendicular to it passing through 0.</p>
                <p>If the principal axis AB is <hi rend="italic">positive,</hi> then if we assume 0
                    as the second axis, it must be taken <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> also; but
                    if CD is assumed as the second axis, it must be taken <hi rend="italic"
                    >negative.</hi> Now, it is obvious that if we take AB as a <hi rend="italic"
                    >positive,</hi> and CD as a <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> axis, the double
                    refraction in the direction AB is the maximum double refraction of the axis CD,
                    because the effect of the axis AB is here nothing. In like manner, the double
                    refraction along CD is a measure of the maximum double refraction of the axis
                    AB. Hence we can easily ascertain the relative intensities of the doubly
                    refracting force of each axis AB and CD. Having done this, the next step was to
                    compute the double refraction at the point P produced by the positive axis AB
                    acting alone as a single axis, and also the double refraction produced at the
                    same point P, by the negative axis CD. When this was done, the two double
                    refractions were found to be equal and opposite, and hence they compensated each
                    other, and produced an axis P∕), in which there was no double refraction, and
                    which was the resultant of the actions of AB and CD.</p>
                <p>In this way, and by experiments which will be related in a subsequent chapter,
                    our author was led to the following method of finding the general law of
                    extraordinary refraction in biaxal crystals.</p>
                <p>Make <hi rend="italic">b</hi> = axis of revolution of the two spheroids. <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> α' = the other axis of the spheroid.</p>
                <p>/3, <hi rend="italic">f ≈</hi> the inclination of the incident ray to the axes of
                    the crystal.</p>
                <p>+ = the angle of the doubly refracting forces emanating from each axis.</p>
                <p>£ = half the difference of the angle at the base of the parallelogram of
                    forces.</p>
                <p>Then, as the velocity of the ray is inversely as the variable radius of the
                    spheroid, — will be the square of the velocity of the ordinary ray, and -ι the
                    square of the minimum velocity of the extraordinary ray, in virtue of the
                    separate action of each axis, AB and CD. Hence the difference between the
                    squares of the velocities of the ordinary and extraordinary rays will be</p>

                    passing through the</hi><hi rend="italic">vag</hi><hi rend="italic">and the
                    respective axes.</hi></p>
                <p>When the two axes are of equal intensity, and of the same character, the
                    preceding law gives the very same results as the law of Huygens does for one
                    axis placed at right angles to the other two.</p>
                <p>From these views it follows as a necessary consequence,, a consequence first
                    deduced from them by Μ. Biot, that the difference of the squares of the
                    velocities of <hi rend="underline">the</hi> two rays are proportional to the
                    product of the sines of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562832"

                <p>Μ. Fresnel was led by theoretical considerations to suppose that in crystals with
                    two axes, the law of double refraction was still more complicated; and he soon
                    confirmed the accuracy of his views by direct experiment, and was thus able to
                    establish a general law which embraced all crystals with one axis.</p>
                <p>Our limits will not allow us to do more than give the following brief abstract of
                    his labours, which we owe to Μ. Pouillet.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In <hi rend="italic">biaxal crystals,</hi> when the ray is in the section

                    expression of the velocity in this case, and it is on this account that the term
                    <hi rend="italic">ordinary velocity</hi> is applied to all those which are given

                <p>When the ray on the contrary, is in the section perpendicular to AB, the sum of

                <p>In every case the difference of the squares of the velocities is expressed by the

                <p>That is to say, the two ordinary and extraordinary rays having a common

                    the product of the sines of the angles which each of them makes with the two
                    axes. “This remark, adds Μ. Pouillet, had been made by Sir David Brewster and Μ.
                    Biot before Fresnel had pointed out the simple law which embraces the phenomena

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III.— <hi rend="italic">On Crystals with three
                    Axes of Double Refraction.</hi></p>
                <p>Having determined the primitive form to which those crystals belong which have
                    <hi rend="italic">one</hi> and <hi rend="italic">two</hi> axes of double
                    refraction, Sir David Brewster found that all those crystals which have no
                    resultant axes, or, properly speaking, no double refraction, belonged to that
                    class of primitive forms which have three rectangular axes of form, namely, the
                    <hi rend="italic">cube,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">regular octahedrons</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">rhomboidal</hi><hi rend="italic">dodecahedron,</hi> or to
                    the <hi rend="italic">tessular</hi> system of Mohs. Since, however, every real
                    axis of double refraction, coincides with a prominent line in the primitive form
                    of the crystal, he conceived that those crystals which had no apparent double
                    refraction had actually <hi rend="italic">three equal rectangular axes,</hi> the
                    effect of which was to compensate each other at every point of the crystal, or,
                    in other words, to have an infinite number of resultant axes.</p>
                <p>In confirmation of these views, our author found various indications of positive
                    and negative doubly refracting structures in <hi rend="italic">alum,
                    diamond,</hi> &amp;c., as if these equal axes had not exactly compensated each
                    other, either from the three not being perfectly equal, or from their not being
                    placed accurately at right angles to each other.</p>
                <p>The following is a list, which might be considerably extended, of the primitive
                    forms of the crystals that have no double refraction.</p>

                <p>There are some crystals, such as <hi rend="italic">arseniate of iron, amphigene,
                    analcime, boracite, aplome,</hi> all of which have double refraction, and
                    therefore cannot belong to the tessular system. <hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi>
                    IV.— <hi rend="italic">On Crystals with Planes of Double Refraction.</hi></p>
                <p>In all the crystals to which we have hitherto referred, the double refraction is
                    related to one or more axes; but Sir David Brewster has found, that in <hi
                    rend="italic">analcime,</hi> a mineral ranked in the tessular system, there are
                    several planes or sections of the crystal in which there is no double
                    refraction, the double refraction increasing with the distance from these
                    planes, according to a law which will be afterwards mentioned. When the ray is
                    incident in any direction that does not lie in one of these planes, it is
                    separated into two images by double refraction. This is the only substance which
                    is known to possess this remarkable property.</p>
                <p>PART VII. ON THE POLARISATION OE LIGHT.</p>
                <p>The light emitted from the sun, from a candle, or from any self-luminous body,
                    before it has suffered reflection from, or refraction by, any body, is called
                    <hi rend="italic">common light.</hi> If we allow a beam of such light to fall
                    upon any refracting or reflecting body, whether transparent or metallic, or to
                    pass by any diffracting body, it will suffer precisely the same changes, whether
                    its upper, its under, its right or its left side, or any other side of the beam,
                    is turned towards the refracting, reflecting, or diffracting body. Hence it
                    follows, that this beam of light has the same properties in all its sides.</p>
                <p>Now this is not true of all light. If the preceding beam of common light is
                    reflected at a particular angle, from transparent bodies, or passes obliquely
                    through a number of refracting surfaces, or is transmitted through certain
                    crystals, or suffers total reflexion from the second surfaces of transparent
                    bodies, or from the surface of metals ;—in all these cases it has suffered such
                    a change, that it no longer has the same properties in all its sides, but, on
                    the contrary, exhibits distinct and remarkable properties in its different
                    sides, or, what is the same thing, has <hi rend="italic">polarity.</hi> This
                    beam of common light is therefore said to <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">π polarised.</hi> The different kinds of polarisation which may
                    thus be impressed upon common light are three, viz. <hi rend="italic">plane
                    polarisation, circular polarisation, And elliptical polarisation</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> or the whole of these three kinds of polarisation may be
                    included in the general name of <hi rend="italic">elliptical polarisation,</hi>
                    which becomes <hi rend="italic">circular</hi> when the two axes of the ellipsis
                    are equal, and <hi rend="italic">rectilineal</hi> or <hi rend="italic"

                    proceed to explain the phenomena of these three kinds of polarisation, in their
                    order.</p>
                <p>c∏AΓ. I. ON PLANE POLAKISATION.</p>
                <p>There are four ways by which common light may be <hi rend="italic">plane
                    polarised.</hi></p>
                <p>1. By double refraction.</p>
                <p>2. By one reflection from transparent bodies.</p>
                <p>3. By several refractions through transparent surfaces.</p>
                <p>4. By the absorption or dispersion of part of the light.</p>
                <p>These various processes exhibit many interesting phenomena and laws, which we
                    shall proceed to explain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">On the Polarisation of
                    Light by Double Refraction.</hi></p>
                <p>The polarisation of light by the double refraction of Iceland spar was discovered
                    by Huygens. Upon examining the two pencils Oo, E <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> fig.
                    118, formed by double refraction, he found that they had different properties on
                    different sides, and that both of them differed from common light as well as
                    from one another. He discovered this difference in the following manner.</p>
                <p>Having taken two pieces of Iceland spar, he placed them symmetrically, as in fig.
                    130, with all the faces of the one parallel to all the faces of the other, A <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> X, A' G X ʹ being the principal sections of two rhombs. A
                    ray of common light R <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> incident upon the first crystal
                    at <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> is divided into two pencils <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> C, <hi rend="italic">r</hi> D, 0 being the ordinary and E the
                    extraordinary ray, as formerly explained. Now the ordinary ray D G , falling
                    upon the second crystal at G, and the extraordinary one CF at F, should have
                    been each subdivided, by double refraction, into two pencils, by that crystal;
                    but they are not, the <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> ray D G being <hi
                    rend="italic">only</hi> refracted <hi rend="italic">ordinarily,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> ray C F <hi rend="italic">only
                    extraordinarily,</hi> as seen in the figure, where these rays F H, GK, emerge
                    singly at II and K, the one an <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> and the other an
                    <hi rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> ray. If the upper rhomb remains fixed while
                    the under one is turned round 90°, so that its principal section is
                    perpendicular to that of the upper one, as shown in fig. 131, the same phenomena
                    will take place, with this difference only, that the ray D G refracted <hi
                    rend="italic">ordinarily</hi> by the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> crystal, is
                    refracted <hi rend="italic">extraordinarily</hi> by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >second,</hi> and the ray C F, refracted <hi rend="italic">extraordinarily</hi>
                    by the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> crystal, is refracted <hi rend="italic"
                    >ordinarily</hi> by the <hi rend="italic">second.</hi></p>
                <p>Hence it is manifest, that the ray of common light R <hi rend="italic">τ,</hi>
                    and the two doubly refracted pencils C F, D G, have all <pb break="no"

                    R <hi rend="italic">r</hi> were to fall upon the second rhomb, it would be
                    divided into two pencils; whereas C F and D G refuse to be so divided, and are
                    each refracted in different ways by the second crystal.</p>
                <p>Now, in <hi rend="italic">every other position of</hi> the four rhombs, between
                    the two where their principal sections are <hi rend="italic">parallel,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">perpendicular</hi> to one another, the two pencils C F, D G
                    are divided into two pencils, and <hi rend="italic">four</hi> separate pencils

                    second rhomb has just begun to move out of its position of parallelism to the
                    first, two extremely faint images begin to appear between the other two; and at
                    22½° of azimuth they will appear as at C. At 45° of azimuth their intensity will
                    be equal, as at D; at 67½ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> the two most distant
                    ones will have become the faintest; and at 90° the four imageswill be reduced to
                    two, this being the position shown in fig. 130. By continuing to turn the second
                    rhomb, other two faint images start up, which at 112½° appear as at G; at 135°
                    the four images are equally bright, as at H; at 157½° the two outermost are the
                    faintest; and at 180° they all coalesce into one bright image, as at K, having
                    twice the brightness of either of those at A or F, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >four</hi> times the brightness of any one of the four at D or H.</p>
                <p>In making the preceding experiment, it will be seen that two of the images
                    gradually increase in brightness, while other two gradually diminish. Malus

                <p>When the incident ray is not perpendicular to the surface of the first rhomb, the
                    intensities of the pencils are functions of the angles of incidence and the
                    angle which the ray forms with the principal sections.</p>
                <p>All the phenomena above described may be produced by combining any two <hi
                    rend="italic">positive</hi> and any two <hi rend="italic">negative</hi>
                    crystals; but if a positive is combined with a negative crystal, the same
                    effects will be produced when the principal sections are at right angles to each
                    other, as when they are parallel in the other cases.</p>
                <p>The difference between common and polarised light, as evinced by the phenomena of
                    double refraction, is, that the former may always be divided into two pencils by
                    a doubly-refracting crystal, whereas the latter is not capable ofbeing so
                    divided under certain circumstances.</p>
                <p>As the four polarised pencils, when united, as at K, fig. 132, produce a pencil
                    of common light, or rather a pencil which cannot be distinguished from common
                    light, itis highly probable that the Iceland spar, in converting common into
                    polarised light, byrefractingit into two pencils,has notcom-municated to it any
                    new property, but has merely separated it into its two elements, just as a prism
                    separates a pencil of white light into its seven elementary colours by
                    refraction, these colours again forming white light by their reunion.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II— <hi rend="italic">On the Polarisation of
                    Light by Fefiectiorι,</hi></p>
                <p>We have already stated, in the history of Optics, the manner in which the
                    celebrated French philosopher Malus discovered the polarisation of light by
                    reflection. Upon repeating his experiments with a variety of opaque and
                    transparent bodies, not metallic, such as glass, water, &amp;c. he found that,
                    <hi rend="italic">zvhen light was reflected at a particular angle from such
                    bodies, it was polarised exactly like one of the pencils formed by double
                    rfraction,</hi> the pencil polarised by reflection having all its properties
                    identically the same with that of the doubly-refracting crystal. Like the
                    latter, it was no longer capable of being divided into <hi rend="italic"
                    >two</hi> pencils by a rhomb of Iceland spar; and as, in the polarisation of
                    light by the double refraction of one crystal, that property depends on the
                    angle formed between the principal sections of the two crystals, as shown in
                    figs. 130 and 131, so, in the present case, the polarisation depends on the
                    angle formed between <hi rend="italic">the plane of reflection</hi> and that of
                    the principal section of the crystal which polarises the light. In all such
                    phenomena, indeed, as Malus remarks, the <hi rend="italic">plane of
                    reflection</hi> replaces the plane of the principal section of the crystal.</p>
                <p>If we receive the ray polarised by reflection from water at an angle of52° 45',
                    upon any crystal having double refraction, it will notbedividedinto two pencils
                    when the plane of reflection is parallel to the principal section, as if it had
                    been a pencil of common light; but it will be refracted entirely, according to
                    the ordinary law, as if the crystal had lost the power of double refraction. If,
                    on the other <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562884" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2884-0463"
                    />hand, the principal section of the crystal is perpendicular to the plane of
                    reflection, the reflected ray will be refracted wholly, according to the law of
                    extraordinary refraction. In all intermediate positions it will be divided into
                    two rays, according to the same law, and in the same proportions, as if it had
                    acquired its new character by the influence of double refraction.</p>
                <p>In order to analyse this phenomenon completely, he placed the principal section
                    of a crystal vertically; and after having divided a ray into two by it, he made
                    these two rays fall on the surface of <hi rend="italic">water,</hi> at an angle
                    of 52° 45'. The ordinary ray was partially reflected, like common light, but <hi

                    rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> ray was partially reflected, and <hi
                    rend="italic">the ordinary ray was wholly refracted.</hi></p>
                <p>Malus found the phenomena to be the same for all other transparent bodies,
                    whether solid or fluid; but the angle at which light experienced this
                    modification was in general greater in bodies which refracted light most. Below
                    and above this limit the rays were more or less modified.</p>
                <p>This property of reflected light takes place at a different angle for pencils
                    reflected at the <hi rend="italic">second surfaces</hi> of bodies, and the sine
                    of the angle at the first surface is to the sine of the angle at the second, as
                    the sine of incidence is to the sine of refraction. Hence, in parallel plates,
                    either of glass or other bodies, the two pencils which are reflected in the same
                    directions from both surfaces have equally received this new property, and the
                    light which has received it is said to have been <hi rend="italic">polarised by

                <p>Malus next proceeded to study the phenomena when the light R, polarised by one
                    plate of glass A, was reflected from a second plate C, fig. 133, the ray RA
                    being incident on the first plate, and the polarised ray AC on the second plate
                    at an angle of 56°, the polarising angle of glass. In the case shown in the
                    figure, the plane of reflection ACE, in the plate C, is at right angles to the
                    plane of reflection RAC from the first plate, and in this case the reflected
                    pencil GE wholly vanished, all the reflected and polarised light AC having
                    penetrated the glass at C. If we now turn round the plate C from this point, or
                    <hi rend="italic">zero,</hi> into different azimuths, so that it is always
                    equally inclined to the polarised ray, a small portion of the ray AC will be
                    reflected from C, and this portion will increase till it becomes a maximum, when
                    the plane ACE is parallel to RAC, or in the azimuth of 90°. By continuing to
                    *urn the plate C, the reflected ray CE will gradually diminish, and when C has
                    reached the azimuth of 180° its plane of reflection will be perpendicular to
                    that of A, and the reflected ray CE will wholly disappear. In advancing from
                    180° to 270°, CE will again reach its maximum, and at 360°, when it has returned
                    to its position, as in the figure, it will again return to its minimum.</p>
                <p>While the reflected pencil CE passes from its <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi>
                    intensity at 0° and 180°, to its maximum at 90° and 270°, Malus supposes the
                    intensity to vary as the square of the cosine of the angle of azimuth, or of any
                    even power of the cosine. Calling <hi rend="italic">a</hi> the angle of azimuth
                    which the plane of the second reflection makes with a plane perpendicular to
                    RAC, I the maximum intensity of the reflected pencil, and P the intensity
                    corresponding to any azimuth <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> then P = I cos. <hi

                    >a</hi> = 0°, cos. <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = 1, cos. <hi rend="superscript">

                    and consequently P=I, or the reflected pencil is a maximum. When <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> = 90°, cos. <hi rend="italic">a</hi> =0, cos. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi> = 0, cos. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 4</hi> « = 0, and F = 0, that is, the reflected pencil
                    wholly disappears.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, from the arrangement of glasses in fig. 132, that, if the light R
                    proceeds from the sky, an observer with his eye placed at E will see a black
                    spot in the part of the sky from which the light R comes, as the whole of the
                    light penetrates the plate C. If the light R comes from a house, the house will
                    disappear if it is at a considerable distance; and by turning round C, the house
                    will have its greatest brightness when the two planes of reflection are
                    parallel. If, in the position when the house was invisible, we breathe upon the
                    plate C, the house will suddenly become visible, and will again disappear when
                    the breath Jias evaporated. If we now place the plate C at an angle of 52° 45'
                    to the ray AC, the house will be seen; but if we again breathe upon CC, the
                    house will disappear. The cause of these phenomena is, that by breathing upon C
                    we make the reflecting surface an aqueous one, which refuses to reflect light at
                    an angle of 52° 45', but reflects it at 56°.</p>
                <p>If we place beside each other two sets of reflectors arranged, in the manner
                    shown in the figure, C being inclined in the one set 56° to A, and in the other
                    set 52° 45', and the plates C, C being near each other, we may, by breathing
                    upon each at the same time, exhibit the paradoxical phenomenon of reviving and
                    extinguishing a luminous image by the same breath, or we may appear to breathe
                    at the same time light and darkness.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>After determining the angle at which different bodies polarised light, Malus
                    concluded that “this angle followed neither the order of refractive powers nor

                    of the other modes of action, which they exercised over light.<note

                <p>In repeating the experiments of Malus, Sir David Brewster measured the polarising
                    angles of a greater number of bodies, but experienced many difficulties in
                    connecting them together by a simple law. In some substances the light was not
                    completely polarised at any angle. In others purple and blue light was left at
                    the polarising angles; and in various specimens of glass, different parts of the
                    same surface gave different polarising angles. The first of these phenomena he
                    ascribed to the circumstance that the differently coloured rays of white light
                    were polarised at different angles; and the second he found to arise from
                    changes that had taken place on the surfaces of glass by partial decomposition,
                    owing to the action of the atmosphere. By rejecting those substances where the
                    action of the surface was thus masked or disturbed, he was led to the following
                    general law, that <hi rend="italic">the index of refraction of any body is the
                    tangent of its angle of polarisation.</hi></p>

                <p>Upon repeating these experiments with homogeneous light, our author also found
                    that the angle of polarisation varied with the refrangibility of the light, and
                    that the tangent of the polarising angle was equal to the index of refraction of
                    the light employed.</p>
                <p>Hence we are able to explain why, at the maximum polarising angle, a portion of
                    unpolarised light must always remain, and why this portion increases with the
                    refractive and dispersive power of the body. This will be understood from the

                <p>So recently as 1830, Dr. A. Seebeck of Berlin has published a series of very
                    accurate and valuable experiments made by an instrument constructed for the
                    purpose, which, if any doubts had existed about the accuracy of the preceding
                    law, were sufficient to remove them. Dr. Seebeck’s principal object seems to
                    have been to obtain accurate measures of the polarising angle of different
                    glasses, when the surfaces were newly polished, in order to reconcile the law to
                    that class of bodies in which the deviations had been found to arise from some
                    chemical or mechanical changes produced upon their surface. The following table

                <p>This truth is a necessary consequence of the general law, and was also deduced
                    from direct experiment. If the uppermost of the two media is a parallel plate,
                    such as water lying upon a horizontal surface, &amp;c. the separating surface of
                    the two media cannot, at any angle of incidence upon the first surface,
                    completely polarise the incident light, unless the sine of the angle whose
                    tangent is wι</p>
                <p>—, is, when multiplied by <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> less than unity. Thus, in the
                    case of water and glass, the polarising angle is 68° 47', but no ray incident
                    upon the water, even at 90°, can fall at such an oblique incidence upon the
                    glass as 48° 47'. For sin. 48° 47' <hi rend="italic">× m</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi> (or the angle of refraction at an incidence of 90°), is —
                    1∙0048. When the upper medium has a higher refractive power than the lower, and
                    lies in a parallel plate upon it, the same law is applicable, with this
                    difference, that the ray is now polarised at the <hi rend="italic">second
                    surface</hi> of the denser medium, and the angle of polarisation is that whose
                    cotangent is equal to the index of refraction of the separating surfaces.</p>
                <p>In the preceding observations, we have considered only the light which is
                    incident at the polarising angle. It becomes interesting to inquire, what is the
                    condition of the light which is incident at angles above and below the
                    polarising angle. Malus, Arago, Biot, Fresnel, and other distinguished
                    philosophers, considered the light thus reflected as consisting of two pencils,
                    one of which preserved its state of common light, while the other pencil was
                    polarised in the plane of incidence. In the year 1815, however, Sir David
                    Brewster was led, by direct experiments, to a very different opinion, namely,
                    that the pencil of light which was supposed to have preserved its character of
                    common light had <hi rend="italic">suffered a physical change in its</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">condition,</hi><hi rend="italic">or had acquired in various
                    degrees a character approaching to complete polarisation.</hi> He found, for
                    example, that a pencil of light reflected from glass, either at 62° 30' or 50°
                    20', was so far polarised, that it was wholly polarised by a second reflection
                    at either of these angles; whereas, had the unpolarised part been common light,
                    it could not have been polarised at any angle but 56° 45'. In like manner, he
                    found that <hi rend="italic">three</hi> reflections at 65° 33' or 46° 30', and
                    <hi rend="italic">four</hi> at 67° 33' or 43° 5P, polarised the whole pencil;
                    and in general he found <hi rend="italic">that a ray of light partly polarised
                    by reflection at any angle, will be more and more polarised by every successive
                    reflection in the same plane till its polarisation is complete, whether the
                    reflections are made at angles all above or all below the polarising
                    angle.</hi></p>
                <p>These views were not acceded to by philosophers, though founded on direct
                    experiment; and, so late as 1825, Sir John Herschel, in discussing the question,
                    gives his decision in favour of the opinion held by the French
                    philosophers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Treatise
                    on Light, sect. 86C, 8C7.</p></note> Sir David Brewster was therefore induced to
                    repeat and extend his experiments, and succeeded in establishing his original
                    view of the subject on an impregnable basis. A brief account of these
                    experiments will form the subject of the next section.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">On the Motion of the Plane of Polarisation by
                    Reflection.</hi></p>
                <p>MM. Fresnel and Arago, and Sir David Brewster, were engaged about the same time
                    in inquiries upon this subject. If we suppose a pencil of polarised light
                    polarised in a plane inclined 45° to a vertical line, and if we reflect it at
                    different angles from a transparent surface in which the plane of reflection is
                    perpendicular to the horizon, the plane of polarisation will be gradually
                    reduced from 45° to 40°, 35°, 30°, 25°, &amp;c. as we diminish the angle of
                    incidence from 90° till we reach the polarising angle, when the plane of
                    polarisation will be inclined 0°, or will be brought into the plane of
                    reflection. At angles less than the polarising angle the plane continues to turn
                    in the same direction, till at 0° it is again inclined 45° to a vertical plane,
                    or to the plane of reflection, having performed a revolution of 90°, the first
                    45° during the change of incidence from 90° to 56 <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi>
                    45', and the other 45° from 56° 45' to 0°.</p>
                <p>Μ. Fresnel represented these changes by the following law; <hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi> being the angle of incidence, <hi rend="italic">i'</hi> the angle of

                <p>It is a curious circumstance, that at an incidence of 45° the deviation produced

                    the angle of rotation, when the plane of the polarised ray is <hi

                    rend="underline">~</hi> 45°, is equal to the angle of refraction, while the new
                    inclination of the plane of polarisation to the plane of reflection, or p, is

                    Μ; but at 70° the same plane is inclined only 21°, and at 56° it is inclined 0°.
                    At 40° it is inclined 23° in another direction; at 23° about 38°, and at 0° it
                    is inclined 45°.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">On the partial Polarisation of Light, and the Law of its
                    Intensity.</hi></p>
                <p>In order to apply these results, Sir David Brewster conceives common light to be
                    composed of two pencils A, B, fig. 136, having their planes of polarisation <hi
                    rend="italic">ab,</hi><hi rend="italic">cd</hi> at right angles to each other,
                    and of equal intensity. Two such pencils united comports itself under all
                    circumstances exactly like common light. We are as much entitled to consider a
                    beam of common light as composed in this manner, as we are to regard white light
                    as composed of seven differently refrangible rays. The prism analyses the one,
                    and doubly-refracting crystals, and the action of transparent surfaces, analyse
                    the other, and common light is recomposed by the two oppositely polarised
                    pencils, as much as white light is recomposed by the union of the seven coloured
                    rays. Considering common light in this manner, Sir David Brewster was led to
                    obtain a complete explanation of the phenomena of polarisation produced by
                    reflexion and refraction.</p>
                <p>A beam of common light will be represented as at AB, composed of the two beams A,
                    B, <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cd</hi> being the planes of
                    polarisation of each of them. In order, however, to analyse the action of a
                    reflecting surface in changing the physical condition of the beam of common
                    light, we shall represent it as in fig. 136, where the planes of polarisation
                    <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi><hi rend="italic">cd</hi> are each inclined 45° to the
                    plane of incidence MN. These two beams arc obtained from a rhomb of Iceland
                    spar, upon one of whose surfaces is placed an aperture of the size of A or B,
                    and the rhomb is turned round till its principal section is inclined 45° to the
                    plane of incidence <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562936"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-2936-0467"/>MN. In this position the double beam or pencil A,
                    B will turn its planes of polarisation as in fig 136.</p>
                <p>At an incidence of 90°, or as near it as possible, no change is produced in the
                    pencils A, B, the angle <hi rend="italic">aec</hi> being still 90°. At an
                    incidence of 80 <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi> the angle <hi rend="italic"
                    >aec</hi> is reduced from <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> 90° to 66*; at 70° it
                    has been reduced to 40°; and at 56°, the maximum polarising angle, it has been
                    reduced to 0°, or the planes of polarization <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cd</hi> being now parallel, or, what is the same thing, the whole
                    of the reflected pencil being polarised in the plane of incidence. Below the
                    polarising angle, the planes <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi><hi rend="italic">cd</hi>
                    continuing to turn in the same direction, are again inclined to each other. At
                    40° they are inclined 50°; at 23° they are inclined 38°; and at 0°, ora
                    perpendicular incidence, they are again brought back to their primitive
                    inclination of 90°, or the state of common light. The two curves in the figure
                    show the progressive change which takes place in the planes of polarisation,
                    these planes being a tangent to the curve at the incidence which corresponds to
                    any particular part of it.</p>
                <p>“Such,” says Sir David Brewster,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Phil. Trans. 1830, p. 71,</p></note> “being the action of
                    the reflecting forces upon A and B taken separately, let us now consider them as
                    superposed and forming natural light. At 90° and 0° of incidence, the reflecting
                    force produces no change in the inclination of their axes or planes of
                    polarisation; but at 56° in the case of glass, and 67° 43' in the case of
                    diamond, the axes of all the particles are brought into a state of parallelism
                    with the plane of reflection; and consequently when the image which they form is
                    viewed by the rhomb of calcareous spar, they will all pass into the ordinary
                    image, and thus prove that they are wholly polarised in the plane of
                    reflection.</p>
                <p>“Hence we see that the total polarisation of the reflected pencil at an angle
                    whose tangent is the index of refraction, is effected by turning round the
                    planes of polarisation of one half of the light from right to left, and of the
                    other half from left to right, each through an angle of 45°. Let us now consider
                    what takes place at those angles where the pencil is only partially polarised.
                    At 80°, for example, the angle of the planes <hi rend="italic">a b, c d</hi> is
                    66°, that is, each plane of polarisation has been turned round in opposite
                    directions from an inclination of 45° to one of 33° with the plaue of
                    reflection. The light has therefore suffered a physical change of a very marked
                    kind, constituting now neither natural nor polarised light. It is not natural
                    light, because its planes of polarisation are not rectangular; it is not
                    polarised light, because they are not parallel. It is a pencil of light having
                    the physical character of one half of its rays being polarised at an angle of
                    66° to the other half. It will now be asked how a pencil thus characterised can
                    exhibit the properties of a partially polarised pencil, that is, of a pencil
                    part of whose light is polarised in the plane of reflection, while the rest
                    retains its condition of natural light. This will be understood by placing the
                    analysing rhomb, with its principal section, in the plane of reflection, and
                    viewing through it the images A and B at 80° of incidence. As the axis of A is
                    inclined 33 <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> to MN or the section of the rhomb,
                    the ordinary image of it will be much brighter than the extraordinary image, the
                    intensity of each being in the ratio of cos. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">φ</hi> to sin. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >&lt;p,</hi> p being the angle of inclination, or 33°, in the present case. In
                    like manner, the ordinary image of B will be in the same ratio brighter than its
                    extraordinary image, that is, by considering A and B in a state of
                    superposition, the extraordinary image of a pencil of light reflected at 80°
                    will be fainter than the ordinary image in the ratio of sin. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> 33° to cos. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> 33°. But
                    this inequality in the intensity of the two pencils is precisely what would be
                    produced by a compound pencil, part of which is polarised in the plane of
                    reflection, and part of which is common light.</p>
                <p>When Malus, therefore, and his successors analysed the pencil reflected at 80°,
                    they could not do otherwise than conclude that it was partially polarised,
                    consisting partly of light polarised in the plane of reflection, and partly of
                    natural light. The action of successive reflections, however, afforded a more
                    precise means of analysis, in so far as it proved that the portion of what was
                    deemed natural light had in reality suffered a physical change, which
                    approximated it to the state of polarised light; and we now see that the portion
                    of what was called polarised light was only what may be called apparently
                    polarised; for though it disappears, like polarised light, from the
                    extraordinary image of the analysing prism, yet there is nota single particle of
                    it polarised in the plane of reflection.</p>
                <p>“These resultslead to conclusions of general importance. The quantity of light
                    which disappears from the extraordinary image, is obviously the quantity of
                    light which is really or apparently polarised at a given angle of incidence; and
                    if we admit the truth of the law of repartition discovered by Malus, and
                    represented by P <hi rend="subscript"> oo</hi> = Po cos. <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> p, and Poe = Po sin. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >φ,</hi> and as we can determine p for substances of every refractive power, and
                    for all angles of incidence, we may consider as established the mathematical law
                    which determines the intensity of the polarised pencil, whatever be the nature
                    of the body which reflects it, whatever be the angle at which it is incident,
                    whatever be the number of reflections which it suffers, and whether these
                    reflections are all made from one substance, or partly from one substance and
                    partly from another.</p>
                <p>“Let us suppose that a beam of common light composed of two portions A, B (fig.
                    138) polarised + 45° and — 45° to the plane of reflection, is incident on a
                    plate of glass at such an angle that the reflected pencil composed of C and D
                    has its planes of polarisation inclined at an angle <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> to
                    the plane MN. When a rhomb of calcareous spar has its principal section in the
                    plane MN, it will divide the image C into an extraordinary pencil E and an
                    ordinary one F; and the same will take place with D, G being its extraor dinary,
                    and FI its ordinary image. If we represent the whole of the reflected pencil, or
                    C + D, by 1, then C = <hi rend="superscript"> jl</hi> D = ½, E + F — 1, and G +
                    H — 1. But since the planes of polarisation of C and D are each inclined p
                    degrees to the principal section of the rhomb, the intensity of the light of the
                    doubly-refracted pencils will be as sin. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">&lt;f&gt;</hi>: cos. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">φ</hi>; that is, the intensity of E will be <hi rend="italic"
                    >j</hi> sin. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">&lt;p,</hi> and
                    that of F, ½ cos. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">φ.</hi> Hence
                    it follows that the difference of these pencils, or ½ sin. <hi

                    extraordinary image E into the ordinary one F; that is, the quantity of light
                    apparently polarised in the plane of reflection MN. But as the same is true of
                    the pencil D, we have 2 (½ sin.- <hi rend="italic">φ</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>“As the preceding formula is deduced from principles which have been either
                    established by experiment or confirmed by it, it may be expected to harmonize
                    with the results of observation. At all the limits where the pencil is either
                    wholly polarised or not polarised at all, it of course corresponds with
                    experiment; but though, in so far as I know, there have been no absolute
                    measures taken of the quantity of polarised light at different incidences, yet
                    we are fortunately in possession of a set of experiments by Μ. Arago, who has
                    ascertained the angles above and below the polarising angle at which glass and
                    water polarise the same proportion of light. In no case has he measured the
                    absolute quantity of the polarised rays; but the comparison of the values of Q
                    at those angles at which he found them in equal proportions, will afford a -test
                    of the accuracy of the formula. This comparison is shown in the following table,
                    in which column 1 contains the angles at which the reflecting surface polarises
                    equal proportions of light; column 2 the values ofp, or the inclination of the
                    planes of polarisation; and column 3 the intensities of the polarised light
                    computed from the formula.</p>

                    which does not differ widely from the maximum polarising angle, or 55°, which Μ.

                <p>“It is scarcely necessary to inform the reader, that when a pencil of light
                    reflected at 58° 2' is said to be polarized by another reflection at 67° 2', it
                    only means, that this is the angle at which complete polarisation takes place in
                    diminishing the angle gradually from 90° to 67° 2', and that even this angle of
                    67° 2' will vary with the intensity of the original pencil, with the opening of
                    the pupil, and with the sensibility of the retina. But when it shall be
                    determined experimentally at what value of <hi rend="italic">&lt;p,</hi> or
                    rather at what value of Q, the light entirely disappears from the extraordinary
                    image, we shall be able, by inverting the formula, to ascertain the exact number
                    of reflections by which a given pencil of light shall be wholly polarised.</p>
                <p>“As the value of Q depends on the relation of <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">i',</hi> that is, on the index of refraction, and as this index
                    varies for the different colours of the spectrum, it is obvious that Q will have
                    different values for these different colours. The consequence of this must be,
                    that in bodies of high dispersive powers, the unpolarised light which remains in
                    the extraordinary image, and also the light which forms the ordinary image, must
                    be coloured at all incidences; the colours being most distinct near the maximum
                    polarising angle. This necessary result of the formula was found to be
                    experimentally true in oil of cassia, and various highly dispersive bodies. In
                    realgar, for example, <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> is = 0 at an angle of 69° 0' for
                    blue light, at 68° 37' for green light, and at 66° 49' for red light. Hence
                    there can be no angle of complete polarisation for white light, which was also
                    found to be the case by experiment; and as Q must at different angles of
                    incidence have different values for the different rays, the unpolarised light
                    must be composed of a certain portion of each different colour, which may be
                    easily determined by the formula.</p>
                <p>“Such are the laws which regulate the polarisation of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194562975" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2975-0470"/>light by reflection from the
                    first surfaces of bodies that are not metallic. The very same laws are
                    applicable to their second surfaces, provided that the incident light has not
                    suffered previous or subsequent refraction from the first surface. The sine of
                    the angle at which <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> or Q has a certain value by
                    reflection from the second surface, is to the sine of the angle at which they
                    have the same value at the first surface, as unity is to the index of
                    refraction. Hence <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> and Q may be determined by the
                    preceding formulae after any number of reflections, even if some of the
                    reflections are made from the first surface of one body and the second surface
                    of another.”</p>

                    Light by Refraction.</hi></p>
                <p>We have already seen that the polarisation of light by refraction was discovered
                    by independent observations by Malus, Biot, and Brewster; but the priority of
                    discovery belongs to Malus, who, from various observations, arrived at the
                    following conclusion: “When a ray of light falls upon a plate of glass at an
                    angle of 54° 35', all the light which it reflects is polarised in one direction.
                    The light which traverses the glass is composed, 1s&lt;, of a quantity of light
                    polarised in a direction opposite to that which is reflected, and proportional
                    to it; and, 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> of another portion not modified, and
                    which preserves the character of direct light.”</p>
                <p>Sir David Brewster made analogous experiments with thin films of glass, films of
                    mica, folds of gold-beaters’ skin, and films of gold leaf; but he occupied
                    himself chiefly in determining the law of the phenomena depending on the number
                    of plates through which the light was transmitted, and found <hi rend="italic"
                    >that the number of plates which polarise a maximum of light by transmission at
                    different angles of incidence, are to one another as the co-tangents of the
                    angles of incidence.</hi></p>
                <p>In determining this law, our author employed forty-seven plates of crown-glass,
                    each about three inches long and one broad, and with these he obtained the

                    From a great number of observations made with a parcel of eighteen plates, our
                    author found the constant quantity for crown-glass to be 4l∙84 when the light
                    was that of a good wax-candle placed at the distance of about twelve feet, so

                <p>From these experiments our author drew the same conclusion as in the case of
                    reflection, respecting the state of what Malus calls the unpolarised light,
                    namely, that it had suffered a physical change; and he also showed that light
                    could be polarised by successive refractions, each refraction bringing it
                    gradually nearer and nearer to the state of complete polarisation.</p>

                <p>The first, and we believe the only, experiments that have been made on this
                    subject, were those of Sir David Brewster;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Phil. Trans. 1830, p. 133.</p></note> and we shall therefore
                    give an account <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> of his researches in his own
                    words, abridging it as much as possible.</p>
                <p>“If we take a plate of glass, deviating so slightly from parallelism between it
                    faces as to throw aside from the direct transmitted image of a luminous body the
                    faint images formed by reflection between its inner surfaces, we shall obtain,
                    even at the greatest obliquities, a pencil of light free of all admixture of
                    reflected light.</p>
                <p>“Let this plate be placed upon a divided circle, so that we can observe through
                    it two luminous discs of polarised light A, B (fig. 139) formed by double
                    refraction, and having their planes of polarisation inclined + 45° and — 45° to
                    the plane of refraction. At a perpendicular incidence, the inclination of the
                    planes of polarisation will suffer no change; but at an incidence of 30° they
                    will be turned round 40', so that their inclination to MN or the angle <hi
                    rend="italic">aec</hi> will be 45° 40'. At 45° their inclination will be 46°
                    47'. At 60° it will be 50® 7'; and it will increase gradually to 90°, where it
                    becomes 66° 19′. Hence the maximum change produced by a single plate of glass
                    upon the planes of polarisation is66° 19'—45° = 21° 19', an effect exactly equal
                    to <pb break="no" facs="nls:194562988" xml:id="kp-eb0716-2988-0471"/>what is
                    produced by reflection at angles of 39° or 70°. It is remarkable, however, <hi
                    rend="italic">that this change is made in the opposite direction, the planes of
                    polarisation now approaching to coincidence in a plane at right angles to that
                    of reflection</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a difference which might have been
                    expected from the opposite character of the resulting polarisation.</p>
                <p>“In this experiment the action of the two surfaces is developed in succession, so
                    that we cannot deduce from the maximum rotation of 21 <hi rend="superscript">
                    β</hi> 19', the real action of the first, or of a single surface, which must be
                    obviously more than half of the action of the two surfaces, because the planes
                    of polarisation have been widened before they undergo the action of the second
                    surface.</p>
                <p>“In order to obtain the rotation due to a single surface, I took a prism of glass
                    ABC, having such an angle BAC, that a ray RR, incident as obliquely as possible,
                    should emerge in a direction Rr perpendicular to the surface AC. I took care
                    that this prism was well annealed, and I caused the refraction to be performed
                    as near as possible to the vertex A, where the glass was thinnest, and
                    consequently most free from the influence of any polarising structure. In this
                    way I obtained the following measures.</p>

                    of parallel plate-glass, and the other a piece of very thin crown. The latter
                    had the advantage of separating the reflected from the transmitted light.</p>

                <p>“As the planes of polarisation of a pencil polarised + 45° and — 45° cannot be
                    brought into a state of coincidence by refraction, the quantity of light
                    polarised by refraction can never be mathematically equal to the whole of the
                    transmitted pencil, however numerous be the refractions which it undergoes; or,
                    what is the same thing, refraction cannot produce rays truly polarised, that is,
                    with their planes of polarisation parallel.”</p>

                    Refractions.</hi></p>
                <p>“The analysis given in the preceding paragraphs, of the changes produced on
                    common light, considered as represented by two oppositely polarised pencils,
                    furnishes us with the same conclusions respecting the partial polarisation of
                    light by refraction which we have already deduced respecting the partial
                    polarisation of light by reflectien. Each refracting surface produces a change
                    in the position of the planes of polarisation, and consequently a physical
                    change upon the transmitted pencil by which it has approached to the state of
                    complete polarisation.</p>
                <p>“This position I shall illustrate by applying the formula to the experiments in a
                    preceding page.</p>
                <p>“According to the first of these, the light of a waxcandle at the distance of ten
                    or twelve feet is wholly polarised by eight plates or sixteen surfaces of
                    parallel plateglass at an angle of 78° 52'. Now I have ascertained that a pencil
                    of light of this intensity will disappear from the extraordinary image, or
                    appear to be completely polarised, provided its planes of polarisation do not
                    form an angle of less than 88∣ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> with the plane of
                    refraction for a moderate number of plates, or 88½° for a considerable number of
                    plates, the difference arising from the great diminution of the light in passing
                    through the substance of the glass. In the present case the formula gives cot.
                    <hi rend="italic">ô</hi> = ζcos. <hi rend="italic">(i</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> z <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>)^ <hi rend="superscript"> 16</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Û</hi> = 88° 50 ’; so that the light should appear to be
                    completely polarised, as it was found to be.</p>
                <p>“At an angle of 61° 0' the pencil was polarised by twenty-four plates or

                    the force which polarises it is there a minimum. At the maximum polarising
                    light, Q is only 79∙5, because the glass is incapable of reflecting more light
                    at that angle, otherwise more would have been polarised. The value of Q, then,
                    rises to its maximum at <hi rend="superscript"> y</hi> 78° 7', and descends to
                    its minimum at 90°; but the polarising force has not increased from 56° 45' to

                    minimum only because there is no light to polarise. At the incidence of 78° 7',
                    where the quantities Q, Q' reach their maxima, the reflected light is exactly

                <p>Now this law is true only at the maximum polarising angle, the two pencils being

                    order, therefore, to obtain the true law for single plates, we must determine it
                    for a <hi rend="italic">single surface.</hi></p>
                <p>In order to do this, Sir David Brewster employed a well-annealed prism of
                    colourless glass, in place of a plate of glass, and he made the ray BI from a
                    sheet of white paper BA enter the surface FD perpendicularly at I, while another
                    ray AS was reflected to the eye from the surface ED of the prism. He then made
                    the experiment with a doubly refracting prism C in the manner described by Μ.
                    Arago, and obtained the law for <hi rend="italic">α single surface,</hi>

                <p>That is, what was supposed to be true of plates is true only of surfaces.</p>
                <p>The action of a single plate on light, involving the combined action of three
                    refractions and two reflections, without following the light beyond one internal
                    reflection, is sufficiently complex, and has been analysed in the following
                    manner by Sir David Brewster.</p>
                <p>He took a plate of glass of the form MN, fig. 142, having an oblique face <hi
                    rend="italic">Md</hi> cut upon one of its ends.</p>
                <p>“A ray of light RA, polarised + 45° and — 45°, was made to fall upon it at A, at
                    an angle of incidence of nearly 83 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>, so that the
                    inclination of the planes of polarisation of the reflected ray AP was about
                    36½°. Now the ray AC, after reflection in the direction CS, without any
                    refraction at B, where it emerges perpendicularly to MJ, would also have had the
                    inclination of its planes of polarisation equal to 36½° if there had been no
                    intermediate refraction at A; but this refraction alone being capable of
                    producing an inclination of 53°, or a rotation of 53° ∙— 45° = 8°, and this
                    rotation being in an opposite direction from that produced by the second
                    reflection at C, the inclination of the planes of polarisation for the ray CS is
                    nearly 44½°, the reflection of C having brought back the ray AC almost exactly
                    into the state of natural light.</p>
                <p>“Without changing either the light of the angle, I cemented a prism McJ on the
                    face MJ, so that <hi rend="italic">cd</hi> was parallel to JN, and I found that
                    the second refraction at <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> equal to that at A, changed
                    the inclination of the planes of polarisation to 53°; that is, the two
                    refractive actions at A and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> had overcome the action of
                    reflection at C, and the pencil <hi rend="italic">bs</hi> actually contained
                    light polarised perpendicular to the plane of reflection.</p>
                <p>“In order to put this result to another test, I took a plate Me NQ,(fig. 142) of
                    the same glass, which separated the pencil <hi rend="italic">bs</hi> reflected
                    at the second surface, from the parallel pencil AP reflected from the first
                    surface, and I found, that at an angle of 83°, the value of the inclination I or
                    <hi rend="italic">&lt;ρ</hi> for the ray was about 37½°, while the value of I
                    for the rayas was nearly 55°, an effect almost equal to the refractive action of
                    a plate at 83° of incidence.</p>
                <p>“When the pencil RA is incident on the first surface at the polarising angle or
                    56° 45', the rotation produced by refraction at A is about 2°, or the
                    inclination I =. 45° + 2° = 47°; but the maximum action of the polarising force
                    at C is sufficient to make I ~ 0° whether <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is 45° or
                    47°. Hence CB is completely polarised in the plane of reflection, and the
                    refractive action at <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is incapable of changing the plane
                    of polarisation when 1 = 0°; the reason is, therefore, obvious why the two
                    rotations at A and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> of 2 <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>In the preceding section we have considered common light as consisting of two
                    pencils of polarised light, having their planes of polarisation at right angles
                    to each other. The very same results would take place if we considered a beam of
                    light as consisting of two sets of polarised rays, all those of one set having
                    their planes of polarisation in every possible direction, and of another set
                    having their planes of polarisation at right angles to those of the former.<note

                    <hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> 1830, p. 84.</p></note> In this view of the
                    subject, common light is polarised when it issues from the luminous body, and
                    when we polarise it or decompose it by double refraction, or polarise it
                    completely by reflection or refraction, we merely separate the one half of it
                    polarised + from the half polarised This effect is analogous to the de
                    composition of white light into its colours. All the colours exist in the sun’s
                    light, and they are merely separated by prismatic refraction, or by
                    interference, or by absorption.</p>
                <p>Now common, light may also be decomposed by dispersion and absorption; that is,
                    if we can contrive any method of dispersing or absorbing <hi rend="italic">one
                    of the two polarised pencils</hi> of common light, we shall exhibit the other
                    pencil in its state of natural polarisation.</p>
                <p>Crystals in which this effect is produced are called singly polarising or singly
                    refracting crystals. They were first observed and described by Sir David
                    Brewster in the year 1812.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    1813, p. 101. <hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> 1814, p.' 183.</p></note> The first
                    mineral in which he discovered this property was the agate, in which one of the
                    pencils is dispersed into a nebulous mass of light, sometimes of the form of a
                    crescent, so that the bright image was all polarised in one plane, like one of
                    the pencils of Iceland spar. The mass of nebulous light, too, was always
                    polarised in a plane perpendicular to that of the bright image.</p>
                <p>The same author discovered a similar property in certain specimens of the
                    carbonate of barytes, which exhibited several interesting phenomena,<note

                    type="authorial"><p>Phil. Itans. 1814.</p></note> and very curiously in oil of

                    rend="subscript"> lbid-p</hi>.γ and 38.</p></note> and other substances. The
                    same property he found in various artificial crystals, but particularly in
                    nitre.</p>
                <p>Another very beautiful example of polarised nebulous images was observed by the
                    same author in an artificial kind of nacre already referred to, in which there
                    are three nebulous polarised images, with a bright image enclosed in the middle
                    one of the three nebulous images.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Phil. Trans. 1836, p. 53.</p></note></p>
                <p>A similar property was discovered in 1815 in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tourmaline,</hi> nearly about the same time, by Μ. Biot and Μ. Seebeck, the
                    priority belonging to the former. This crystal has double refraction, like all
                    other crystals of the same class; but when it is cut by planes passing through
                    the axis of the crystal, and has a certain thickness (about the twenty-fifth of
                    an inch, but which varies in different specimens), it transmits only one of the
                    pencils formed by double refraction. The pencil polarised in the plane of the
                    principal section is absorbed, or somehow or other lost, while the one
                    depolarised at right angles to that section is transmitted. If we take two such
                    plates of tourmaline, and place them with their axes parallel, the unabsorbed
                    pencil will be freely transmitted through both; but if we begin to turn one of
                    them round, the light will become fainter and fainter, and the luminous object
                    will vanish entirely when the axes are at right angles to each other. By
                    continuing to turn, the image again appears, reaches its maximum when the axes
                    are parallel, and then vanishes when the axes are at right angles. The same
                    phenomenon is exhibited by the <hi rend="italic">agate</hi> in reference to its
                    distinct image.</p>
                <p>In all the singly refracting and polarising crystals above enumerated, the
                    effects described arise from a certain degree of imperfection in the structure
                    and combination of the elementary crystals, by which one of the polarised
                    pencils is reflected or absorbed; but Sir David Brewster found that the same
                    property may be communicated to any crystal, <hi rend="italic">merely by
                    altering its superficial conformation.</hi></p>

                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194563053" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3053-0476"/>observe a
                    luminous object through two of its inclined surfaces that have a good natural or
                    artificial polish, we shall perceive two distinct and perfectly formed images.
                    If we now roughen these two surfaces, and cement upon each of them a plate of
                    glass by means of <hi rend="italic">balsam of capivi,</hi> the character of the
                    two images will be greatly changed. The image that has suffered the <hi
                    rend="italic">greatest</hi> refraction will be as <hi rend="italic"
                    >distinct</hi> as before, but the other image will be either of a <hi
                    rend="italic">faint reddish colour,</hi> or wholly invisible, according to the
                    degree of roughness induced upon the refracting surfaces. When <hi rend="italic"
                    >oil of cassia</hi> is used instead of the balsam, the <hi rend="italic">least
                    refracted image,</hi> if it was visible before, will now be <hi rend="italic"
                    >completely extinguished.</hi></p>
                <p>By substituting pure <hi rend="italic">alcohol,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >white of an egg,</hi> instead <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the balsam, the <hi
                    rend="italic">least refracted image</hi> will become <hi rend="italic"
                    >distinct,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">most refracted image</hi> will be
                    either a mass of <hi rend="italic">nebulous light,</hi> or almost invisible.</p>
                <p>In order to explain these phenomena, we must recollect that the index of
                    refraction for the <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> image <hi rend="italic"
                    >ο</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">i nitre</hi> is
                    1∙51l, and that of the <hi rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> image 1∙328. when
                    the rough surface of the nitre is covered with balsam of capivi, which has
                    nearly the same index of refraction as the ordinary image, the same effect is
                    produced as if the rough surface had been polished for the ordinary rays. All
                    the little pits or depressions in the rough surface being filled up with balsam,
                    the ordinary rays suffer little or no refraction in penetrating the crystal, and
                    therefore the image which they form will be as clear and distinct as in the
                    first experiment. But since the index of refraction for the extraordinary image
                    is much less than that of the balsam, the rays of which it is composed will not
                    enter the crystal undisturbed, but will be scattered in the same manner as if
                    its surface was rough, and had a refractive power corresponding to the
                    difference between the index of refraction for the extraordinary ray, and the
                    index of refraction for the balsam. When <hi rend="italic">water</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">alcohol</hi> is substituted in room of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >balsam,</hi> the effects now described are interchanged, the roughness being
                    removed for the extraordinary rays by the application of a fluid of the same
                    refractive density, while the rays that form the ordinary image are dispersed by
                    the refractions which still exist at the rough surface <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    the crystal.</p>
                <p>These effects will be better understood by supposing the crystal to consist of an
                    extraordinary and an ordinary medium, arranged in alternate strata, or as water
                    exists in wet hydrophanous opal. When the superficial polish of both these media
                    is removed, the application of the <hi rend="italic">balsam</hi> restores, as it
                    were, the polish of the ordinary medium, without restoring that of the
                    extraordinary medium; while the application of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >alcohol</hi> restores the polish of the extraordinary medium without restoring
                    that of the ordinary medium.</p>
                <p>These results were repeatedly obtained with <hi rend="italic">calcareous spar,
                    arragonite, nitre, carbonate of potash,</hi> and other crystals;<note

                    the common purposes of a plate of tourmaline or a parcel of glass plates.</p>

                    Light, and the Colours of thin Crystallized Plates in Polarised Light.</hi></p>
                <p>The phenomena which we are about to describe are among the most splendid in
                    optics. They were discovered by independent observation by Μ. Arago and Sir
                    David Brewster; the priority of discovery belonging to Μ. Arago. The very same
                    colours, indeed, as we shall presently see, had been observed by Huygens,
                    Robison, Malus, and others, in Iceland spar; but they were not aware of their
                    nature and origin.</p>
                <p>There are <hi rend="italic">four</hi> methods of exhibiting these colours, which
                    may be used at pleasure, and each of which has its advantages.</p>
                <p>1. If we take a plate of <hi rend="italic">agate</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >tourmaline,</hi> or any other of the artificial singly-polarising crystals
                    already described, and having cut it into two parts, each of which is at least
                    equal to the diameter of the pupil of the eye, though this is not absolutely
                    requisite, fix each of them above an aperture in a piece of card or brass, so
                    that no light passes at their edges. Let them be now placed at the distance of
                    an inch or more, the one near the eye being capable of turning round the axis of
                    vision; and let this last be turned into such a position that the light of the
                    sky, or that of a flame enlarged by a lens placed near it, is no longer able to
                    penetrate the second singly-refracting plate.</p>
                <p>If we now introduce between the two plates of tourmaline, for example, a plate,
                    either thick or thin, <hi rend="italic">of</hi> any doubly-refracting substance,
                    we shall observe very curious effects. If the plate is <hi rend="italic"
                    >thick,</hi> such as one of sulphate of lime, the 30th of an inch and upwards,
                    we shall find that the insertion of the plate has <hi rend="italic"
                    >revived,</hi> as it were, the light which refused to pass through the second
                    plate, and ffiis light will be white. If we turn the sulphate of lime round, we
                    shall find <hi rend="italic">four positions</hi> 90° from each other, in which
                    the revived light is a maximum; and other four bisecting these, and also 90°
                    from each other, in which the light entirely vanishes, as before the sulphate of
                    lime had been introduced.</p>
                <p>This property of reviving the light has been called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >depolarisation of light,</hi> because the sulphate of lime deprives the rays
                    polarised by the first plate, of that kind of polarisation which prevented them
                    from penetrating the second plate.</p>
                <p>But if the plate is thin, between the fiftieth and the seventy-fifth of an inch,
                    we shall have precisely the same phenomena, with this difference only, that the
                    restored light is brilliantly coloured. The colours vary in intensity, like the
                    white light, disappearing in the positions 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°, and reaching
                    their maximum at45°, 135°, 225°, and 315°. If we now turn the plate of
                    tourmaline next the eye round 90°, so that the axis of the two plates are
                    parallel, and the pencil polarised by the first freely transmitted by the
                    second, and if we then introduce the same plate of sulphate of lime as before,
                    we shall now find that in the <hi rend="italic">four</hi> positions of it, viz.
                    0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°, where no light or colours were formerly, nothing but
                    white light is visible; but that at the positions 45°, 135°, 225°, and 315°,
                    where the maxima of light and colour took place, we have the maxima of a colour
                    <hi rend="italic">complementary</hi> to that formerly seen, the intensity of
                    this colour gradually increasing from nothing at 0°, reaching its maximum at
                    45°, again diminishing to 90°, and so on with the other quadrants. These colours
                    are called the <hi rend="italic">colours of crystallized plates, or the colours
                    of polarised light.</hi></p>
                <p>In the preceding experiment with plates of tourmaline, we see only one of the two
                    complementary colours, while the position of the tourmaline remains the same.
                    The disadvantage of using the tourmalines is, that, from their brown colour, the
                    brilliancy of the polarised colours is greatly injured; and the tourmalines
                    therefore cannot be employed, either when we wish to have the most brilliant
                    representations of the phenomena, or when it is necessary to study the exact
                    tints which are developed.</p>
                <p>But if we use the plates of <hi rend="italic">agate</hi> or of roughened
                    Iceland<pb break="no" facs="nls:194563066" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3066-0477"/> spar
                    in the same manner, we shall not only have identically the same phenomena of
                    colour in the bright and distinct image formed by the agate with a purer light;
                    but we shall have the additional phenomenon of this bright coloured image placed
                    in the middle of a <hi rend="italic">nebula</hi> or haze of the <hi
                    rend="italic">complementary</hi> colour, so that we here see both the colours at
                    the same time, and without any of the superadded brown colour imparted by the
                    tourmaline. If the colour of the distinct image is <hi rend="italic">green,</hi>
                    it will be encircled by a haze of <hi rend="italic">red</hi> light; if it is <hi
                    rend="italic">blue,</hi> with a haze of <hi rend="italic">orange</hi> light; and
                    so on.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We would
                    recommend it to Mr Watkins to prepare this apparatus with the same ingenuity
                    with which he has done the other an. paratus for exhibiting the other phenomena
                    of polarised light.</p></note></p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">second</hi> method consists in placing the film of <hi
                    rend="italic">sulphate of lime</hi> GKHL between two bundles of glass plates A
                    and B, which polarise the light by <hi rend="italic">refraction,</hi> as shown
                    in the annexed figure. A ray Rr emerges from A, polarised as at <hi
                    rend="italic">st,</hi> and will freely penetrate the second bundle B, and
                    emerge, as shown at <hi rend="italic">vw,</hi> when the planes of refraction of
                    A and B are parallel, as in the figure; but not a ray of <hi rend="italic"
                    >st</hi> will emerge at <hi rend="italic">v</hi> when the planes of refraction
                    are perpendicular to each other. When we interpose, therefore, the sulphate of
                    limc GKHL, it will exhibit <hi rend="italic">identically</hi> the same phenomena
                    as between the tourmaline plates, the bundle A corresponding to the fixed plate,
                    and B to the moveable one, and the planes of refraction corresponding to the
                    axes of the tourmaline. If we suppose the bundles A and B to be placed with
                    their planes of refraction perpendicular to each other, then the position of the
                    plate of sulphate of lime, in which no colour appears, is, when its axis of
                    double refraction CD is its principal axis (viz. the line bisecting the
                    resultant axis) if it is biaxal, <hi rend="italic">parallel</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">perpendicular</hi> to the planes of refraction. When CD,
                    therefore, or EF (perpendicular to it), is in the plane of refraction of A, or
                    <hi rend="italic">the plane of primitive polarisation,</hi> as it is called, not
                    a ray of coloured light reaches the eye at <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> and hence
                    these have been called the <hi rend="italic">neutral axes</hi> of the plate of
                    sulphate of lime, because they produce no change upon the ray <hi rend="italic"
                    >st.</hi> On the other hand, when the lines GH, KL, perpendicular to each other,
                    and inclined forty-five degrees to the <hi rend="italic">neutral axes,</hi> are
                    in the plane of primitive polarisation, the coloured light depolarised is a
                    maximum, and hence they have been called the <hi rend="italic">depolarising
                    axes</hi> of the plate GK∏L, names which will be found very convenient in the
                    description of phenomena.</p>
                <p>lt is an interesting fact, which was discovered by Sir David Brewster, that
                    nature actually presents us, in the case of certain crystals of <hi
                    rend="italic">nitre,</hi> with the whole of the apparatus in the space of half
                    an inch. One part of the crystal has its laminae inclined like the bundle A,
                    while another part has them lying in a rectangular direction like B; so that
                    such a crystal, by merely looking through it when the opposite faces are either
                    polished by art or by a cement, exhibits its own coloured rings. Sir John
                    Herschel subsequently observed the same fact in carbonate of potash, and
                    proposes to call such crystals <hi rend="italic">idiocyclopha-ηοus,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">those which show their own rings.</hi></p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">third</hi> method is shown in the annexed figure, where
                    A is a plate of black glass (or a bundle of 8 or 12 plates of thin transparent
                    glass, for the purpose of increasing the light), which polarises in a horizontal
                    plane a ray Rr, incident at an angle of 56°, reflecting it polarised in the
                    direction <hi rend="italic">rs,</hi> where it is received upon a second plate of
                    black glass B at the same angle of 56°, so as to reflect it to the eye at 0. If
                    the plane of reflection from B is vertical, so as to be perpendicular to that
                    from A, not a ray of the pencil Rr will be reflected, but the eye at 0 will
                    perceive a large black spot on the part of the sky or other luminous surface
                    from which the ray Rr proceeds.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The appearance of this black spot shows that the
                    two°reflectors are properly adjusted, so as to save all the trouble of attending
                    to the angles at which the rays are incident on the two reflectors A and
                    B.</p></note> The plate or plates at A are called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >polarising plates,</hi> and that at B the <hi rend="italic">analysing
                    plate.</hi></p>
                <p>The plate of sulphate of lime is then placed at GKHL, anywhere between the
                    plates, and it will exhibit the very same phenomena as between the tourmalines
                    and the bundles of plates, though with more brilliancy and distinctness, as
                    there is no brown colour to disturb the tints, and no haziness, as happens with
                    the second bundle B of plates of glass. In this method the planes of reflection
                    perform the same part as the axis of tourmaline and the planes of refraction in
                    the other cases.</p>
                <p>4. The <hi rend="italic">last</hi> method which we shall mention, is to employ
                    rhombs of Iceland spar, both for polarising and analysing the light. If the
                    Iceland spar is converted into two of Nico’s prisms, then each prism performs
                    exactly the same part as the tourmaline and the reflectors, exhibiting only one
                    of the complementary colours. This ingenious contrivance, which derives its name
                    from its inventor, William Nico, Esq. of Edinburgh, consists of two pieces of
                    calcareous spar cemented together so as to transmit only one of the polarised
                    pencils; but the difficulty and expense of constructing it well, and the risk of
                    a change in the state of the cement which unites the two parts, render it
                    desirable to have a simple, a cheap, and a durable substitute for it. The
                    polariser and analyser used by Sir David Brewster in many of his experiments in
                    elliptical polarisation, and in the action of crystallized surfaces, was a <hi
                    rend="italic">single</hi> rhomb of calcareous spar, having thin plates of
                    colourless glass cemented to its natural surfaces by Canada balsam, which, while
                    it removes any imperfection of surface, protects the surfaces from any
                    accidental injury, or from the deterioration of the polish arising from
                    frequently cleaning them. This rhomb, shown at ABCD, may be of any thickness
                    suited to the diameter of the pencil of light which we wish to have. By a rhomb
                    one inch thick we can obtain a pencil of light 0∙115 of an inch in diameter; by
                    placing an aperture of that diameter at <hi rend="italic">a</hi> on the lower
                    side CD, we obtain two pencils <hi rend="italic">b, c,</hi> polarised in
                    opposite planes, and just touching each other.</p>
                <p>If we wish to use only one pencil, we can conceal <hi rend="italic">b</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> with a wafer, and use the other; but for the purpose of our
                    present experiment they may both be left clear. If we now construct an exactly
                    similar, or a larger rhomb, without any aperture upon it, and place the two as
                    we did the tourmaline plates, or in any of the positions shown in fig. 130, we
                    shall see only <hi rend="italic">two</hi> images, the other two being
                    evanescent. Let the plate of sulphate of lime be now interposed as formerly, and
                    we shall find, that when its principal axis CD forms angles of 0°, 90°, 180°,
                    and 270° with the plane of the principal section of the rhombs, no <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194563079" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3079-0478"/> light is
                    depolarised; but that when the axis forms angles of45°, 135°, 225°, and 315°
                    with the principal section, the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> evanescent pencils
                    are restored and brilliantly coloured, let us suppose with <hi rend="italic"
                    >green</hi> light, while the other two pencils formerly seen are brilliantly
                    coloured with the complementary <hi rend="italic">red</hi> colour. By turning
                    round the rhomb next the eye, these two colours undergo all varieties of
                    intensity, from their maximum tint to evanescence.</p>
                <p>If we now enlarge the aperture <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> fig. 145, in the first
                    rhomb, so that the two images <hi rend="italic">b, c,</hi> in place of being in
                    contact, overlap each other, we shall have the parts that do not overlap
                    exhibiting the two complementary colours as before, while the parts that do
                    overlap form <hi rend="italic">perfectly τvhite light;</hi> thus proving that
                    the two colours are exactly complementary to each other. Any of the images <hi
                    rend="italic">b, c</hi> may be enlarged, if necessary, by a convex lens placed
                    before them, or by other means.</p>
                <p>In order to obtain a large pencil of polarised light <hi rend="italic">b</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> we must make the rhomb very thick; but there is
                    another way in which we may obtain the same effect in thin rhombs. There are
                    particular specimens of the spar which are interrupted with veins, and which
                    will be described in a separate section. If we obtain one of these in which the
                    vein has a certain thickness, it will produce polarised images on each side of
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and c, and these images will be perfectly <hi
                    rend="italic">white.</hi> We may therefore use a much larger aperture <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> and obtain a very effective apparatus. This, however, will
                    be better understood afterwards.</p>
                <p>When the <hi rend="italic">veins</hi> above mentioned are <hi rend="italic"
                    >thin,</hi> these lateral images are beautifully coloured, the colours being
                    portions of the coloured rings produced by the thin vein, the prism in front of
                    the vein polarising the light, and the prism behind it analysing it.</p>
                <p>These different methods of exhibiting the colours of crystalline plates may be
                    varied, if we use a plate of glass as the polariser, and a tourmaline for the
                    analyser; or, in short, we may use one half of each apparatus with one half of
                    the other. When we wish to have a large surface of polarised light, the best and
                    readiest is a large surface covered with black varnish.</p>
                <p>In the preceding observations, with the <hi rend="italic">four</hi> different
                    kinds of apparatus, we have supposed the polariser and analyser to be fixed,
                    either with their similar planes parallel or perpendicular to each other, and
                    the plate of sulphate of lime to be moved round its axis. Let us suppose,
                    however, that the sulphate of lime is <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> in the
                    position where its colour, <hi rend="italic">bright red,</hi> for example, is a
                    maximum; that is, where any of the depolarising axes GH or KL, fig. 144, is
                    parallel or perpendicular to the plane Rrs of primitive polarisation. In this
                    position of GH, let the analysing plate B be&gt; made to revolve round the ray
                    <hi rend="italic">rs,</hi> its motion commencing at 0°, and always keeping the
                    same inclination to <hi rend="italic">rs,</hi> viz. 56°. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >bright red</hi> visible at 0° will gradually diminish in intensity as B moves
                    from 0° to 45°, when the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> colour will wholly vanish,
                    and the black spot be seen. Beyond 45° a faint <hi rend="italic">green</hi> tint
                    will appear, gradually increasing, and attaining its maximum of brightness at
                    90°. At an azimuth greater than 90°, the green becomes paler and paler, till it
                    vanishes wholly at 135°. Here the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> again begins, and
                    reaches its maximum brightness at 180°. Similar changes take place while the
                    plate B moves from 180° to its original position at 360° or 0°. Hence it
                    appears, that when the sulphate of lime alone revolves, only one of the
                    complementary colours is visible, whereas, when the plate B only revolves, both
                    the complementary colours are visible during each half of its revolution.</p>
                <p>When these experiments are repeated with plates of sulphate of lime, or any other
                    mineral having different thicknesses, different colours will be produced,
                    varying with the thickness; and in every case the two colours which are
                    produced, either when we use the two polarising rhombs, or cause the reflector B
                    to revolve, are always <hi rend="italic">complementary</hi> to each other, or
                    together make white light.</p>
                <p>If we remove the plate B, and look through the sulphate of lime, we shall find
                    that the light which it transmits is always white, whatever be the position of
                    the sulphate of lime, whatever be the inclination which the ray Rr forms with
                    the polariser A, and whatever be the condition of the polariser itself. The
                    decomposition of the white light, therefore, or its separation into two
                    complementary colours, must be effected by reflection from the plate B. Now
                    sulphate of lime is a doubly refracting crystal, giving two oppositely polarised
                    images, lying above one another, and one of its neutral axes CD is the section
                    of a plane passing through its principal axis of double refraction, while ÈF is
                    the section of a plane perpendicular to that section. Let any of these planes,
                    suppose EF, be placed, as in the figure, in the plane of primitive polarisation
                    Rrs, then the ray <hi rend="italic">rs</hi> will not be doubled, but will pass
                    into the ordinary ray of the sulphate of lime, and falling upon B, it will not
                    suffer reflection. The very same will happen if CD is brought into the plane of
                    primitive polarisation, so that in these two positions none of the light
                    transmitted through the sulphate of lime will suffer reflection at B, and reach
                    the eye at O. In all other positions, however, of the sulphate of lime, it forms
                    <hi rend="italic">two</hi> images or pencils of different intensities; and when
                    either of the depolarising axes GH or KL is in the plane of primitive
                    polarisation Rrs, these two images or pencils will be of equal intensity, and
                    polarised in opposite planes. Now, one of <hi rend="italic">these</hi> images is
                    <hi rend="italic">red,</hi> and the other <hi rend="italic">green,</hi> a fact
                    which will be afterwards explained; and as the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> is
                    polarised in the plane of primitive polarisation, it will not suffer reflection
                    from B; while the <hi rend="italic">green,</hi> being polarised in the plane of
                    reflection from B, will be reflected to the eye at O, and is therefore seen
                    alone. From the same cause, when B is turned round 90°, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >green</hi> will not suffer reflection from it; while the red will suffer
                    reflection, and be seen by the eye at 0. The plate B has therefore analysed the
                    compound beam of <hi rend="italic">red</hi> and <hi rend="italic">green</hi>
                    light by reflecting one and transmitting the other colour.</p>
                <p>Now, if the sulphate of lime had been thicker than the fiftieth of-an inch, the
                    two pencils would have been both white; and when the plate was moved round, we
                    should have had a white pencil reflected from B, and undergoing the very same
                    changes that the coloured one did. Hence we see the cause of the <hi
                    rend="italic">depolarisation of light,</hi> both when the depolarising plate is
                    thick and thin.</p>
                <p>In the preceding experiments, the sulphate of lime has been supposed to be so
                    thin as to give a <hi rend="italic">red</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">green</hi>
                    tint; but if the plate is only 0 ’ 00046 of an English inch thick, it will
                    depolarise no light at all, either coloured or uncoloured, and the black spot
                    will be seen in every position of the sulphate of lime. If the thickness of the
                    plate is 0∙00124 of an inch, the light depolarised will be the <hi rend="italic"
                    >white,</hi> the first order of Newton’s scale, whose complementary colour is a
                    deep <hi rend="italic">violet</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and if the plate is
                    0*01818 of an inch, or upwards, it will also polarise white light, composed of
                    all the colours of the spectrum. When the plates of the mineral have an
                    intermediate thickness between 0∙00124 and 0∙0l818, they will give, at
                    successive thicknesses, all the intermediate colours in Newton’s table, between
                    the white of the first order, and the white compounded of all the colours. The
                    colours from the plate B will be those in col. 2 of Newton’s table, while the
                    colours seen in turning round the plate B will be the complementary ones in col.
                    3 of the same table, the one corresponding to the <hi rend="italic">reflected
                    sxA</hi> the other to <hi rend="italic">retransmitted</hi> tints of thin
                    plates.</p>
                <p>By a variety of accurate experiments, Μ. Biot pointed out the connection between
                    the colours of polarised light <pb break="no" facs="nls:194563092"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-3092-0479"/>and of thin plates; and in the case of sulphate of
                    lime, the films of which he measured with an ingenious instrument invented by Μ.
                    Cauchoix, called the spherometer, he has proved that the thicknesses which
                    produce the different colours in Newton’s table are proportional to the value of
                    the tints in the last column of’Newton’s table for glass; this substance having
                    nearly the same refractive power as sulphate of lime. If we wish, for example,
                    to know the thickness of sulphate of lime which will give the <hi rend="italic"
                    >red</hi> of the first order of colours, the number in the last column opposite
                    red is 5^ths; then, since the <hi rend="italic">white</hi> of the <hi
                    rend="italic">first</hi> order is produced by a plate 0∙00124 of an inch thick,
                    the number opposite which is 3∣∙ths, we say, as 3Jths is to 5½ths, so is 0∙00124
                    to 0∙0021l, which is the thickness at which sulphate of lime depolarises the <hi
                    rend="italic">red</hi> of the first order. By reversing this rule we can
                    determine the colour which will be depolarised at any given thickness. This law
                    of the colours is by no means general, and we shall presently see that the
                    colours of polarised light bear frequently no relation whatever to those of thin
                    plates.</p>
                <p>The above phenomena may be beautifully exhibited to the eye by combining pieces
                    of sulphate of lime into a painted Gothic window, so that when the window is
                    exposed to common or to polarised light it appears perfectly colourless, but
                    when seen by reflection, it will exhibit all the splendid colours of the
                    separate films. Though this experiment is well suited for exhibition, yet the
                    following one, which was also made by Sir David Brewster, is more instructive.
                    Selecting an uniform plate of sulphate of lime, about the twenty-fifth of an
                    inch thick, he ground down,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The plate may be cemented by one of its faces to a piece of plate-glass,
                    which will protect it from breaking, and after it is finished and bisected, each
                    half should be enclosed between two glass plates.</p></note> with the powder of
                    schistus, one of its faces, so as to make it a sort of wedge, in which the
                    thickness varies from the twenty-fifth of an inch down to the thinnest edge that
                    could be made. The plate was then placed in water, which acted upon it slowly,
                    making its edge thinner, and giving a slight polish to its surface. When this
                    film is placed at GH, in fig. 144, its' figure will be seen covered with
                    coloured fringes, as in fig. 146, parallel to its edges. At its thinnest edge
                    the colours of the first order will commence from <hi rend="italic">black,</hi>
                    and gradually increasing, as in New ton’stable, till, at the thick edge AD, we
                    have the sixth or seventh, or higher orders of colours. Here we see at once how
                    all the different tintsand different orders are connected with the different
                    thicknesses of the plate.</p>
                <p>If we now cut this plate into two equal parts AB, CD, and cross them as in the
                    figure, a <hi rend="italic">new set of fringes</hi> will appear, parallel to a
                    line joining the points whore the two thinnest and the two thickest edges
                    intersect, that is, parallel to NP, one of the diagonals of the intersectional
                    square MNOP. The line NP will be black, and from NP to Μ and N the fringes will
                    be exactly the same as those from the thin to the thick edge of the plate.</p>
                <p>If the plates <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi><hi rend="italic">cd</hi> have their axes
                    at right angles to each other, there will be only one set of fringes, beginning
                    at the angle where the two tints are minimum.</p>
                <p>If we grind one side of the plate spherical, so that the thickness shall vary
                    like the plate of air between a convex and a plane surface, then, by combining a
                    plate of this kind with a prismatic plate, or by combining two similar plates,
                    and by varying their maximum thicknesses, their breadths, &amp;c. we shall
                    produce, by their parallel or rectangular combination, intersectional fringes of
                    figures of great variety and extreme beauty. These figures will be analogous,
                    <hi rend="italic">mutatis</hi><hi rend="italic">mutandis,</hi> to those observed
                    by Mr Knox, and the far more splendid exhibitions produced by crossing plates of
                    glass in the manner described in <hi rend="italic">a</hi> subsequent
                    chapter.</p>
                <p>If we grind <hi rend="italic">concave</hi> surfaces on one of the faces of the
                    crystalline plate, we shall have circular rings, equidistant if the concavity is
                    conical, but resembling those of thin plates if it is spherical. These plates
                    may also be combined with those which give circular and rectilineal fringes, and
                    very fine effects produced by the combination.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We would recommend to the practical optician
                    the construction of such plates as a matter of trade.</p></note> Still more
                    remarkable effects may be produced by turning beautiful patterns upon the
                    sulphate of zinc, or etching them either by the action of pure <hi rend="italic"
                    >water,</hi> or water slightly acidified. Lines of equal depths will be all
                    equally coloured, and the slightest differences in depth, which can be easily
                    regulated by a fine turning-lathe, will produce a great variety of different
                    colours. Coloured figures and landscapes may be executed by scraping away the
                    surface to the thickness necessary to produce the requisite tints. A cipher,
                    too, might be executed upon a mineral; and if we cover the Surface upon which it
                    is formed with a fluid of the same refractive power, it will be absolutely
                    illegible by common light, but may be distinctly deciphered when placed between
                    the polarising and analysing plates.</p>
                <p>A sheet of ice irregularly frozen, and held in the position just mentioned,
                    exhibits the colours of crystallized plates in a splendid manner; but if in a
                    severe winter, when ice can be handled without melting, we take an uniform
                    plate, and dissolve a pattern upon it by heat, which maybe applied in many ways,
                    so as to affect only the parts to be made thinner, we shall observe a phenomenon
                    than which nothing can be more splendid.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VIII.— <hi rend="italic">On the System of Rings
                    produced by Uniaxal Crystals.</hi></p>
                <p>In the preceding experiments the crystallized plate is held at such a distance
                    from the polarising plate that its surface could be distinctly seen by the eye;
                    and it was from observations made in this manner that Μ. Biot deduced his
                    empirical formulae for expressing the variation of the tint, as depending on the
                    thickness of the crystallized plate, and on the square of the sine of the
                    inclination of the refracted ray to the axis of the crystal.</p>
                <p>From this mode of observation Μ. Biot concluded, that <hi rend="italic"
                    >arragonite, topaz, sulphate of lime, felspar, sulphate of barytes, and sulphate
                    of strontian,</hi> were all crystals with one axis of polarisation and double
                    refraction. In 1813, however, Sir David Brewster was led to an entirely
                    different mode of observation. He brought the crystal or plate as close to his
                    eye as possible, and by using a large polarising plate, such as a black japanned
                    tray, he was able to see, <hi rend="italic">at the same instant,</hi> the
                    colours produced at various angles of inclination, in place of determining the
                    loci of these colours, as was done-in the old way, by a great number of
                    insulated observations.</p>
                <p>When, for example, he looked through the <hi rend="italic">ruby,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">emerald, topaz, ice, nitre,</hi> and other bodies, he observed the
                    most beautiful system of rings when the polarised light <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194563105" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3105-0480"/>passed along the axis of
                    double refraction of these bodies. The rings in crystals with one axis are
                    essentially different from those with two axes.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">uniaxal system of rings</hi> is represented in Plate
                    CCCLXXXHL fig. 29, 30. I discovered them in all the doubly refracting crystals
                    with one axis, already mentioned, excepting in Iceland spar, in which they were
                    first observed by Dr Wollaston, and independently by M. Biot and Dr Seebeck.
                    This system of rings is seen along the axis of double refraction; and it has
                    been customary to cut faces upon the obtuse angles of the rhomb of calcareous
                    spar perpendicular to the axis, in order to see them. Sir David Brewster,
                    however, employed the simple method shown in the annexed figure, which does not
                    require the aid of the lapidary. Let CDEF be the principal section of a rhomb of
                    Iceland spar; cement upon CD and EF two small prisms DLK, FGH, having the angles
                    LDK, GFH about 45°. each; and let this rhomb be placed between the polarising
                    and analysing plates, so that the polarised ray <hi rend="italic">rs</hi> passes
                    perpendicularly through the faces LD, FG. The rhomb must be held as close as
                    possible to the reflector B, which need not be larger than the pupil of the eye.
                    When the black spot is seen on the reflector B, in the apparatus as adjusted,
                    then, when the rhomb is interposed, the observer, with his eye close to the
                    plate B, and looking, as it were, through the reflected image of the rhomb, will
                    see the beautiful system of rings shown in fig. 29, Plate CCCLXXXIII.,
                    intersected by a black rectangular cross AB, CD, the arms of which are parallel
                    and perpendicular to the plane of primitive polarisation. The colours of the
                    rings, of which seven or eight may be readily seen, are almost exactly the same
                    as those of the reflected rings in thin plates, as seen in Newton’s table or
                    scale of colours.</p>
                <p>If we turn the rhomb round its axis, the rings will suffer no change, the four
                    arms of the black cross revolving round the circumference of the rings, or
                    rather these four arms remain fixed, and the rings revolve with the rhomb.</p>
                <p>If the rhomb is now fixed so that the rings are distinctly visible, and if we
                    cause the plate to revolve from zero or 0°, then the rings will change into the
                    form shown in fig. 30, Plate CCCLXXXIII., in which the black cross is broken up;
                    and at 45° the rings will appear as in fig. 31, which is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >complementary system,</hi> with a white centre exactly similar to the system
                    seen by transmission in thin plates. These two systems of rings superposed or
                    placed one above the other, would produce uniform white light, without any trace
                    of rings. By continuing to turn B, the <hi rend="italic">primary system,</hi>
                    fig. 29, will re-appear at 90 <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi>, 180°, and 270°;
                    and the <hi rend="italic">secondary system,</hi> fig. 31, at 45°, 135°, 225°,
                    and 315°; while the <hi rend="italic">intermediate system,</hi> fig. 30, will be
                    seen at intermediate azimuths.</p>
                <p>It is very interesting to trace the passage of the <hi rend="italic">primary</hi>
                    into the <hi rend="italic">secondary</hi> system. when B begins to turn, the
                    arms of the black cross widen and become less black, and within them we can see
                    segments of the <hi rend="italic">complementary</hi> rings, whose dark intervals
                    correspond to the bright ones of the primary rings, and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi> As B advances, the rings of the primary set grow less, and more
                    dilute, while the others grow larger and brighter, till, at 45°, the <hi
                    rend="italic">secondary</hi> set is complete. When the light previous to
                    polarisation has passed through ground glass, the diluted primary rings appear
                    of a gray-white colour, and as if they were nearer the eye than the rest.</p>
                <p>If, in place of the plate B, we use a polarising rhomb or an achromatised prism
                    of Iceland spar, and look through it along the axis of the other rhomb, then,
                    when the plane of its principal section is parallel or perpendicular to the
                    plane of primitive polarisation, we shall see in one of its two images the <hi
                    rend="italic">primary</hi> system of rings, and in another the <hi rend="italic"
                    >secondary</hi> system; and in intermediate positions we shall see the
                    intermediate system, the one constantly passing into the other.</p>
                <p>When all these experiments are repeated in homogeneous light, the system <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> rings will be <hi rend="italic">smallest</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">violet,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">largest</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">red light,</hi> and of intermediate sizes in intermediate
                    colours.</p>
                <p>If we divide the rhomb of spar, fig. 148, into two parts by the line MN, and
                    examine the rings through each separate!}’, we shall find that the rings
                    produced by each part are <hi rend="italic">larger</hi> than those produced by
                    the whole, the thinnest piece producing the largest rings. Hence two rhombs
                    united will give a system of rings corresponding to those produced by one rhomb
                    of the same magnitude.</p>
                <p>The systems, if formed <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">xy zircon,
                    ice,</hi> and positive doubly-refracting crystals, are exactly the same as the
                    preceding. But if we unite a positive system with an equal negative system, they
                    will destroy each other; and if the two systems are unequal, we shall have a
                    system equal to the difference of their effects. These experiments of combining
                    systems of positive and negative rings, though rather troublesome, are extremely
                    interesting. When such systems are combined, and the space between the crystals
                    that form them left open, a series of splendid changes are induced upon the
                    resulting system, by placing one or more crystallized films in one or more
                    azimuths between them; but we shall have occasion to return to this subject in
                    the section on the multiplication of images by lce∙ land spar.</p>
                <p>In examining the phenomena of the primary rings, it is obvious that there is no
                    polarisation, as there is no double refraction along the axis of the crystal.
                    The tints polarised increase with the double refraction, that is, with the
                    inclination of the polarised ray to the axis of double refraction; and their
                    numerical value, as given in Newton’s scale, increases with the square of the
                    sine of that inclination. At any given inclination to the axis the tint
                    increases with the thickness through which the polarised ray passes, so that
                    when we have determined the tint at any given inclination and thickness, it is
                    easy to find it for another inclination and thickness.</p>
                <p>In crystals with one axis of double refraction, the lines of equal double
                    refraction are circles when the thickness is equal, as in a sphere; in like
                    manner, the lines of <hi rend="italic">equal tint,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >isochromatic lines,</hi> are circles, the tints being a maximum in the equator,
                    where the inclination to the axis is 90°. In crystals with great double
                    refraction the same tint at the same inclination to the axis is produced at a
                    much less thickness than in crystals with feeble double refraction. Quartz, for
                    example, has a very feeble double refraction, and at the same inclination to the
                    axis it would require a plate of quartz 115 times as thick as a plate of Iceland
                    spar to produce the same tint in Newton’s scale.</p>
                <p>In some crystals with one axis, such as quartz, amethyst, beryl, the system of
                    rings is disturbed by secondary causes, which we shall have occasion to refer to
                    more fully in regard to the two first crystals. In other crystals imperfect
                    crystallization is the general cause of these irregularities.</p>
                <p>In Iceland spar, zircon, ice, tourmaline, and various other minerals, the tints
                    of the rings arc very nearly those of Newton’s scale; but there are other
                    crystals, such as apophyllite, in which Sir David Brewster and Sir John Herschel
                    discovered remarkable deviations, which will be described in a subsequent
                    section.</p>
                <p>The intensity of the polarising force, or the value of the tint polarised at a
                    given thickness, has been calculated by different persons for different
                    crystals. The following have been given by Sir John Herschel for uniaxal
                    crystals.</p>

                    produced by Eiaxal Crystals.</hi></p>
                <p>The biaxal system of rings was discovered by Sir David Brewster, while he was
                    looking along one of the axes of <hi rend="italic">tοραz</hi> when the crystal
                    happened to reflect the light of a part of the sky which was partially
                    polarised, so that they were seen without the aid either of a polarising or an
                    analysing plate.</p>
                <p>Upon examining other minerals, he discovered that the possession of two systems
                    of rings was the characteristic of by far the greater number of crystallized
                    bodies. In some of the crystals, such as <hi rend="italic">topaz,</hi> the lines
                    along which each system of rings is seen are so much inclined to each other,
                    that we cannot see the two systems at once; whereas in others, where the
                    inclination of the lines is small, both the systems may be distinctly seen at
                    the same time. This will be understood, in the case of topaz, from fig. 149,
                    where MN is a plate of topaz with parallel faces of cleavage perpendicular to
                    PQ, the principal axis of double refraction. If we expose this plate to
                    polarised light, so that the polarised ray passes along the line ABeE (the plane
                    of incidence being in one of the two neutral axes of the plate); and if the eye
                    at A receives this ray <hi rend="italic">without</hi> using the <hi
                    rend="italic">analysing plate,</hi> it will see in the direction of that ray a
                    system of oval rings of extreme beauty, like that shown in Plate CCCLXXXIII.
                    fig. 32. When the polarised light is transmitted along the line CBtZD, equally
                    inclined to the perpendicular PQ, it will see a similar system. The line’s BD,
                    Be are therefore the resultantaxes of topaz, along which the double refraction
                    vanishes. The angle ABC is about 121° 16', but the inclination of the refracted
                    rays or of the resultant axes is only 65 <hi rend="superscript"> 6</hi>. Similar
                    rings are seen by transmission in the direction Dd, Ee, but only <hi
                    rend="italic">when the analysing plate</hi> is used.</p>
                <p>If we now receive the reflected ray upon the analysing plate at 0°, the system of
                    rings will appear as in fig. 33, Plate CCCLXXXIIL, which differs from fig. 32
                    only in the parts near the major axis. The colours are the same, but the central
                    spots are much smaller, and the mass of darkness with which they are surrounded
                    encroaches considerably upon the blue part of the first ring. The same system
                    will be seen at 90°, 180°, 227°; but upon turning round the analysing plate, we
                    shall see, at 45°, I35°, 225°, and 315°, a third set, shown in fig. 34, which is
                    comparatively faint in its colour, but distinguished by its peculiarities. In
                    its general structure it resembles the set in fig. 32, but in the middle of each
                    central spot there is a darker spot, composed of blue and red chiefly, with a
                    little green above the blue, and every ring is divided into two rings, each of
                    which has the same colours as the original ring. This division of the rings
                    occupies only a part of the semicircumference of each, and is not seen beyond
                    the third ring. When the analysing plate begins to move from 0°, 70°, &amp;c.
                    where fig. 33 is seen, towards 45°, 135°, &amp;c. two blue spots, and the
                    division of the rings, begin to appear at A and A in all the rings, and in the
                    two central spots, and move along each till they reach B at 45°, 135°, &amp;c.
                    Continuing to turn the analyser, the spots and divisions move onward from B to C
                    in all the rings, &amp;c., and disappear at C at 90°, 180°, &amp;c. This curious
                    system of rings is obviously the first set in fig. 32, seen at the same time
                    with their complementary rings, and is a very rare phenomenon.</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> r</hi>, The biaxal system of rings is best seen in <hi
                    rend="italic">nitre</hi> or <hi rend="italic">saltpetre,</hi> in which the
                    inclination of the resultant axes is only about 5°, or forming an angle of 2½
                    with the axis of the six-sided prism. When a plate of nitre, about the sixth or
                    eighth of an inch thick, is placed before a small analysing plate, and very
                    close to it, and the eye also held as close to the analysing plate as possible,
                    we shall see the beautiful biaxal system of rings discovered by Sir David
                    Brewster, and shown in Plate CCCLXXXIII. fig. 35, where the plane passing
                    through the two axes of nitre is parallel or perpendicular to the plane of
                    primitive polarisation. At angles inclined 45° to these planes, the rings assume
                    the form Shown in fig. 36. In passing from the one of these states to the other,
                    tire rings assume the forms shown in figs. 37 and 38. The colours begin at the
                    centres A and B of each system; but at a certain distance, varying with the
                    thickness of the plate,· the rings, in place of returning and encircling each
                    pole, encircle the two poles, as an ellipse does its foci. When the thickness of
                    the plate is very small, the rings enlarge, and the fifth ring will surround
                    both poles. At a less thickness the fourth, and so on, till at a very small
                    thickness the first ring, will surround both poles, and the system then
                    resembles much the uniaxal system of rings <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> If the
                    plate of nitre is very thick, the rings diminish in size. These colours deviate
                    more and more from those of Newton’s scale, and the tints do not begin at the
                    poles A and B, but at virtual poles in their vicinity. The colours of the rings
                    within the two poles are <hi rend="italic">red,</hi> and beyond them <hi
                    rend="italic">blue,</hi> and the great body of the rings is pink and green. The
                    rings have been called <hi rend="italic">isochromatic lines,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">lines of equal tint</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the axes
                    passing through the poles A, B, <hi rend="italic">optical axes,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">axes of compensation,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">resultant
                    axes.</hi></p>
                <p>We have already given a long list of the various minerals and crystals which
                    exhibit the biaxal system of rings, and also the position of the line which
                    bisects the angular distance between the resultant axes, which is the <hi
                    rend="italic">principal axis</hi> of the crystal.</p>
                <p>The following table, showing the inclination of the resultant axes in different
                    crystals, was drawn up from the observations of Sir David Brewster. Several
                    observations by other observers have been added.</p>

                </table>
                <p>Many of the measures in the preceding table were taken with much care; but some
                    of them were only estimated, and others will admit of correction by the use of
                    better specimens than the author was able to procure.</p>
                <p>In order to explain the biaxal system of rings, and to discover the law of the
                    tints by which every point of the complex system of rings can be calculated, Sir
                    David Brewster considered the <hi rend="italic">optic or resultant axes</hi> P,
                    P' as produced by two or more rectangular axes, the principal one passing
                    through 0, and the other two at AB and CD. We shall suppose, however, the most
                    simple case, where the axes are only <hi rend="italic">two,</hi> viz. that at O,
                    and another either coinciding with AB or CD, perpendicular to O. Now, if 0 is a
                    <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> axis, AB must also be <hi rend="italic"
                    >negative</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but if we take CD for the other axis, it
                    must be <hi rend="italic">positive</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for as the axis
                    CD compensates the <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> axis 0 at P, acting in the
                    same plane, it must be a <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> axis, for a negative
                    axis would have united its effect with that of 0. For a similar reason, the axis
                    at AB must be <hi rend="italic">negative,</hi> in order to compensate the <hi
                    rend="italic">negative</hi> axis 0 in a plane at right angles to it.</p>
                <p>Supposing, then, 0 and AB to be two <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> axes, as in
                    <hi rend="italic">mica,</hi> let it be required to determine the system of rings
                    which they will produce, or the <hi rend="italic">tint</hi> at any point F. Now
                    we may either assume the relative intensities of these axes, or, what is better,
                    the angle formed by the two poles P, P, where the actions of the two axes are
                    compensated, as this angle can be readily measured in any crystal. As the action
                    of the axis AB (or the tint which it produces) at P is destroyed or compensated
                    by the action of the axis 0, or the tint which it produces, and as the tint is
                    proportional to the square of the sine of the angle which the ray makes with the

                <p>From a great number of observations made at all inclinations to the resultant
                    axes, and from accurate measurement of the projected rings, Sir David Brewster
                    found that all the phenomena of the rings, with all their varieties of form and
                    curvature, were represented by the following law.</p>

                <p>Such is the method of determining the tints, and consequently the form of the
                    isochromatic curves in relation to the real axes to which the forces refer; but
                    in relation to the poles P, P, the law of the tints may be more simply expressed
                    by the formula T = <hi rend="italic">t</hi> sin. PE × sin. P ’ E, where Os the
                    maximum tint at A, which must be previously determined. This rule was deduced by
                    Μ. Biot mathematically from Sir David Brewster’s law, and it was afterwards
                    established experimentally by Sir John Herschel, without being aware of its
                    having been deduced from the general law.</p>
                <p>The preceding general law is equally applicable when the rings are formed in
                    homogeneous light.</p>
                <p>Sir John Herschel,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Treatise on Light, sect. 903.</p></note> in examining the systems ofbiaxal
                    rings, found that they resembled lemniscates, as represented in the annexed
                    figure. In these curves the rectangle PE × P ’ E is invariable throughout each
                    curve, and the value of this constant rectangle in any one curve is <hi
                    rend="italic">α ×</hi><hi rend="italic">b,</hi><hi rend="italic">b</hi> being
                    the parameter of the curve, and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> half the distance
                    between the poles P, P. The quantity <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is of course the
                    same for each curve, but <hi rend="italic">b</hi> in different curves increases
                    in the arithmetical progression 0, 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. for the several dark
                    intervals of the rings, beginning at the poles, and in the progression ½, ∣, ½,
                    &amp;c. for the brightest intermediate spaces.</p>
                <p>Many interesting conclusions have been deduced from the preceding general law by
                    Sir David Brewster. When the two <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> axes 0 and AB,
                    fig. 150, are of equal intensity, then their action will be compensated at C and
                    D, and C D will be a single <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> axis of double
                    refraction, and also of an uniaxal system of rings like those in <hi
                    rend="italic">zircon</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the isochromatic curves
                    given by the preceding formulas will be circles surrounding the axis. Hence it
                    follows, <hi rend="italic">that two negative rectangular axes of double
                    refraction and polarisation compose a single positive axis.</hi> If we now
                    suppose a negative axis at CD, equal in intensity to any of the other two, it
                    will evidently destroy the <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> axis of compensation
                    at CD, so that three equal and similar <hi rend="italic">negative axes in any
                    crystal destroy each other</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and hence our author was
                    led to the conclusion, that all the tessular crystals in which there was neither
                    double refraction nor polarisation had three such axes. But if the <hi
                    rend="italic">third</hi> axis at CD is not equal to 0 or AB, and if 0 and AB are
                    unequal, then we shall have all the phenomena of a crystal with two axes. In
                    order to compute the tints thus produced by <hi rend="italic">three</hi> unequal
                    axes, let 0, AB', and CD be three axes, and P, P' the centres of the double
                    systems of rings which they produce. We have already shown that the resulting
                    tint of two axes 0 and AB, at any part E, is <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi><hi
                    rend="underline">«</hi><hi rend="underline">sin. +</hi></p>
                <p>-sin.ζ + ⅛√</p>
                <p>In order, however, to combine this tint with another, we must know the direction
                    of it. Since ψ is the double of the real angle of the planes in which the forces
                    from 0 and AB act, the direction of the new plane in which these forces act must
                    form an angle with the real direction of 0, whose complement is <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> M÷l∙</p>
                <p>or it forms with the real direction of A an angle whose complement is i±=i <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi> r⅛-i, 2 4 2</p>
                <p>Hence the direction of the resultant in relation to BE, the direction of the
                    third force with which it is to be combined, is known.</p>
                <p>In order to illustrate this in a case where the truth of the result will be
                    immediately seen, w <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> shall take the case of three
                    equal axes, the general resultant of which is <hi rend="italic">nothing.</hi> In

                    Biaxal Crystals.</hi></p>
                <p>The phenomenon of conical refraction seen along the axes of biaxal crystals was
                    deduced by Sir W. Hamilton from the undulatory theory, and was discovered
                    experimentally and examined by Professor Lloyd in <hi rend="italic"
                    >arragonite.</hi> It followed from the theory, that a single ray, proceeding
                    from a point within the crystal, and emerging at each of the four poles, must be
                    divided into an <hi rend="italic">infinite number of</hi> emergent rays,
                    constituting a conical surface; and that a single ray incident externally would
                    be similarly divided.</p>
                <p>In order to examine the emergent cone formed in air, Professor Lloyd placed a
                    lens of short focus at its focal distance from the first surface of a plate of
                    <hi rend="italic">arragonitβ</hi> 0∙49 of an inch thick, having its parallel
                    faces perpendicular to the principal axis of the crystal, and so that the
                    central part of the pencil might have an incidence nearly parallel to the
                    optical axis. He then looked through the crystal at the light of a lamp placed
                    at a considerable distance, and observed a point more luminous than the space
                    around it, having a sort of stellar radiation. In order to examine this
                    phenomenon, he placed a plate of thin metal, having a minute aperture, on the
                    surface of the crystal next the eye, and adjusted the aperture so that the line
                    connected with the luminous point on the first surface might be in the direction
                    of the optical axis. When the adjustment was complete, there appeared at first a
                    luminous circle with a small dark space in the centre, and in this dark central
                    space were two bright points, separated by a narrow and well-defined dark line,
                    as shown in Plate CCCLXXXIV. figs. 39 and 40. When the aperture in the plate was
                    slightly shifted, the phenomena rapidly changed, assuming successively the forms
                    shown in figs. 41, 42, 43. In the first stage of the change the central dark
                    space became greatly enlarged, and a double sector appeared in the centre.</p>
                <p>The circle was reduced to about a quadrant, and was separated by a dark interval
                    from the sector just mentioned. This is shown in fig. 41. The remote sector then
                    disappeared, and the circular arch diminished, as in fig. 42; and as the
                    inclination of the internal ray to the optical axis was farther increased, these
                    two luminous portions merged gradually into two doubly-refracted pencils. This
                    change is shown in fig. 43. In these experiments the emergent rays were received
                    directly by the eye placed close to the aperture on the second surface.</p>
                <p>Professor Lloyd succeeded in showing the phenomena on a screen with the sun’s
                    light, and he found the light sufficiently distinct when the diameter of the
                    section was one and a half inch. Upon examining the cone with a tourmaline,
                    Professor Lloyd was surprised to observe that one radius only of the circular
                    section vanished in a given position of the tourmaline, and that the ray which
                    disappeared ranged through 360°, as the tourmaline was turned through 180°, the
                    rays of the cone being all polarised in different planes. Upon a more attentive
                    examination he discovered the remarkable law, “<hi rend="italic">that the angle
                    between the planes of polarisation of any two rays of the cone is half the angle
                    between the planes coìitaining the rays themselves and the axis?</hi> The angle
                    of the cone was found to be 6° 24', 5° 56 ’, and 6° 22'; the mean of which is 6°
                    14.</p>
                <p>When the aperture was considerable, such as that formed by a large-sized pin, two
                    concentric circles were seen to surround the axis, the inner one being nearly
                    twice as bright as the outer one, and consisting of unpolarised light, while the
                    outer one was polarised according to the preceding law. By using smaller
                    apertures the inner circle grew less, until it became a point in the centre of
                    the fainter exterior circle, which remained fixed. With a still less aperture a
                    dark space sprung up in the centre, increasing as the aperture diminished,
                    until, with a very minute aperture, the breadth of this central space increased
                    to about three fourths of the entire diameter. In these cases the appearances
                    are as shown in figs. 44 and 45. When the line joining the luminous point on the
                    first surface was slightly inclined to the axis, the appearance was that shown
                    in fig. 46.</p>
                <p>Professor Lloyd observed an interesting variation in the phenomena, by
                    substituting a <hi rend="italic">narrow linear aperture for</hi> the circular
                    one on the first surface of the crystal, this aperture and the one in the plate
                    next the eye being in the plane passing through the optic axes. The line had the
                    appearance shown in fig. 47, swelling out into the form of an oval curve round
                    the optical axis. By using a very minute aperture next the eye, the phenomenon
                    was as shown in fig. 48. When the plate next the eye was slightly shifted, so
                    that the plane passing through the aperture did not coincide with the plane of
                    the optic axes, the curves rapidly changed, preserving, however, the form of the
                    conchoid, whose pole was the projection of the axis of the emergent cone, and
                    asymptote the line on the first surface. These effects are represented in figs.
                    49 and 50.</p>
                <p>The second kind of conical refraction deduced theoretically by Sir W. Hamilton
                    takes place when a single external ray is incident upon a biaxal crystal, so
                    that one refracted ray coincides with an optic axis. In this case there should
                    be a cone of rays within the crystal, the angle of the cone in arragonite being
                    1° 55'. As this cone will have its rays refracted at emergence, in a direction
                    parallel to the incident ray, they will form a small cylinder of rays in air,
                    the character of whose section by the surface of emergence being only 1° 55' at
                    a distance equal to the thickness of the crystal.</p>
                <p>In order to detect the existence and measure the size of this cylinder, Professor
                    Lloyd used the light of a lamp placed at some distance, and he made its light
                    pass through two small apertures placed in a straight line, the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194563170" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3170-0485"/>one in a screen near the
                    flame, and the other in a plate of metal close to the first circle of the
                    crystal. Under ordinary circumstances, the incident ray will be doubly refracted
                    within the crystal, and the two pencils will emerge parallel to the second
                    surface. Professor Lloyd was able to distinguish these two pencils by means of a
                    lens; and turning the crystal slowly, so as to vary the incidence, he observed a
                    position in which the two rays changed their relative places rapidly on any
                    slight change of incidence, and appeared at times to revolve round one another
                    as the incidence was changed. Being convinced that the ray was now at the
                    critical incidence, Professor Lloyd changed the position of the crystal relative
                    to the incident ray very slowly; and after much care in the adjustment, he at
                    last saw the two rays spread into a continuous circle, and exhibit the phenomena
                    which we have already described in his own words in our history of Optics.</p>
                <p>Professor Lloyd measured the angle of the cone by an indirect method, and found
                    it 1° 50', differing only 5' from the angle deduced from theory.<note

                <p>By applying compressing and dilating forces to minerals, he succeeded in altering
                    their doubly-refracting structure in every direction; but the effect was always
                    most easily seen when it was produced along the real axes of uniaxal crystals,

                    either nothing, or compensated. The following were some of the results to which

                <p>Μ. Fresnel was, we believe, the first person who ob-÷ served the influence of

                    Professor Mitscherlich, however, has investigated the action of heat upon this
                    mineral so completely as to include all previous experiments in his results.
                    Having found that heat acts upon calcareous spar differently in different
                    directions, expanding it in the direction of its axis, and slightly contracting
                    it in directions perpendicular to the axis, he sought to determine if any
                    variation in the double refraction was produced by heat. By the method of
                    interferences, and observing the compensation produced by crossing plates of
                    crystals at different temperatures, he observed that a change in the double
                    refraction was produced.</p>
                <p>In extending these experiments, Professor Mitscherlich found that the two
                    resultant axes of sulphate of lime inclined 60° to each other at common
                    temperatures, approached each other when heated, till they met, and constituted
                    one axis of double refraction. By increasing the heat they again separated <hi
                    rend="italic">in a plane perpendicular to the laminae.</hi> In this experiment
                    the principal axis of double refraction which bisected the optic axes gradually
                    increased, while the second real axis perpendicular to the laminae diminished
                    and disappeared when the crystal assumed the uniaxal state. A new axis then
                    sprung up in the plane of the laminae perpendicular to the principal axis.</p>
                <p>Sir John Hersehel, in mentioning this remarkable experiment, states that he
                    observed the tints of a plate of sulphate of lime <hi rend="italic">rise</hi>
                    rapidly in the scale when the plate was moderately warmed by the heat of a
                    candle held at some distance below it, and sink again when the heat was
                    withdrawn. He found, on the contrary, “that mica similarly heated undergoes no
                    apparent change in the position of its axes, or in the size of its rings, though
                    heated nearly to ignition.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The extraordinary experiment of Professor Mitseherlich was repeated by Sir David
                    Brewster with one of the specimens of sulphate of lime, in which he discovered
                    one of the resultant axes of this mineral. The following is the account which he
                    has given of this experiment, and of the discovery of a still more curious
                    property in <hi rend="italic">glauberite.</hi><note anchored="true"

                    half inch thick in the plane of the laminae, and the system of rings which
                    surrounded this axis was exceedingly minute, with the usual black brush at each
                    end of them. The other system of rings could not be seen in this specimen, owing
                    to the manner in which it was cut. Having brought the crystal to a considerable
                    heat, and exposed it to polarised light, it was a singular sight to see the
                    system of rings travelling along towards the line which bisects the optic axes,
                    like a celestial body passing through the field of a telescope, and changing
                    their form and size as they advanced. The specimen did not permit me to see the
                    two systems unite, and still less to see them open out <pb break="no"

                    off the water of crystallization from part of the specimen, I presume that the
                    complete phenomenon cannot be developed without destroying the constitution of
                    the crystal; that is, that alter the two systems of rings have opened out in a

                    heat to it, the two optic axes for red light gradually close, and, at a
                    temperature which the hand can endure, the two systems of rings for red light
                    have united into one system, so that the crystal has now only one axis of double
                    refraction for red light. By continuing to increase the heat, the two axes
                    separated, and the single system of rings opened out into two systems, lying in
                    a plane at right angles to that in which they were placed at first. The heat was
                    now less than that of boiling water. By increasing it, the inclination of the
                    optic axes gradually increased.</p>
                <p>“I now applied artificial cold to a crystal of glauberite at the ordinary
                    temperature of the atmosphere. The inclination of the optic axes for red light

                    but if we commence the experiments at a low temperature, such as the freezing
                    point, the order and connection of the phenomena will be more easily
                    understood.</p>
                <p>“At 32° glauberite has two axes of double refraction for rays of all colours, the
                    inclination of the axes for the violet rays being least, and that for the red
                    the greatest. As the temperature rises, the optic axes for all colours gradually
                    approach, and the axes for violet first unite into one. At this time the crystal
                    has two axes for all the other colours; but as the heat increases, all the other
                    pairs of axes unite in succession, and form a single system of rings. But before
                    this has taken place, the axes for violet rays have opened up again in a plane
                    at right angles to that in which they originally lay, and they are followed by
                    all the other pairs of axes; so that at a temperature much below that of boiling
                    water, each pair of axes appears with different inclinations arranged in a new
                    direction.</p>
                <p>“During all the changes which have been described above, the crystal has
                    preserved its constitution; and by abstracting the heat, the phenomena are all
                    repeated in an inverse order.</p>
                <p>“If the crystal should happen to be observed at that temperature, which very
                    often occurs when the greenish-yellow or most luminous rays have the optic axes
                    corresponding to them united, or form a single system of rings, then the blue
                    rays will have two systems of rings lying in one plane, and the red rays also
                    two systems of rings in a plane at right angles to this. In two rectangular
                    positions, namely, when the planes of the double axes coincide with or are at
                    right angles to the plane of primitive polarisation, the black cross will be
                    very distinct; but in intermediate positions it will be much less so, and the
                    uniaxal system of rings which predominates, from the greater intensity of their
                    light, will have that indistinctness of character which, whenever it occurs,
                    indicates a peculiar action of the doubly-refracting force on the
                    differently-coloured rays. When the black cross is perfect and equal]; distinct
                    in all positions, while the colours of the rings deviate from those of Newton’s
                    scale, then the axes for al colours are obviously coincident, and the
                    peculiarity <hi rend="smallcaps">ìl</hi> the colour of the rings is owing to an
                    irrationality in tht action of the doubly-refracting forces on the

                    the author to Sir David Brewster, and published in the London and Edinburgh

                    by Professor Rudberg of Upsal. Professor Mitscherlich having only determined the
                    rati∣ between the mean double refraction of Iceland spar in a cold and in a
                    heated state, without ascertaining the separate variations in each pencil,
                    Professor Rudberg was desirous of supplying this desideratum.</p>
                <p>For this purpose he constructed a box, AB, havingfour of its faces double, so as
                    to enclose a space which received through the pipe P, and retained, the steam
                    from a boiler. This space communicated also with the external air. The other two
                    faces of the box were formed with plates of mica. The inner box, therefore,
                    contained only air, which was heated by the surrounding steam. A thermometer T
                    indicated the temperature of the air. A tube R, passing through the two lower
                    surfaces of the box, formed a free communication between the interior and the
                    exterior air, so that their elasticity was the same. Through this tube R,
                    without touching its sides, there rose from the centre of the repeating circle a
                    vertical copper rod, carrying a plate C, upon which the crystal was placed. This
                    rod was attached below to another plate of copper, which rested on a ring of
                    copper, which, having teeth upon its circumference, could be moved by a screw.
                    By this arrangement he could perform the experiments as readily as if there had
                    been no heating apparatus to obstruct them. The heating apparatus was attached
                    by a rod Q of iron rising from the masonry on which the repeating circle
                    rested.</p>
                <p>The experiments were made to determine the index of refraction of the ray F of
                    Fraunhofer’s spectrum near the boundary of the <hi rend="italic">green and

                <p>Hence, says our author, <hi rend="italic">the double refraction of arraymite
                    appears to decrease a little with the temperature,</hi> because the refracting
                    power in the direction of the axis A has diminished in a smaller ratio than that
                    along the axes B and C. In other respects arragonite comports itself quite
                    differently from calcareous spar. The axis Aofarra-gonite obviously corresponds
                    with the axis of crystallization of the spar; but notwithstanding this, the
                    refractive power in this direction diminishes in the former, and, on the
                    contrary, increases in the latter, besides, that in the direction perpendicular
                    to the axis A, the refractive power diminishes considerably in arragonite,
                    whilst, on the contrary, it undergoes almost no change in calcareous spar.</p>
                <p>While heat and pressure thus modify the doubly-refracting structure in minerals,
                    they are capable of creating it with <hi rend="italic">regular axes</hi> in
                    several soft substances. This effect is quite different, as we shall soon see,
                    from that which is produced upon bodies by pressure, where the result is
                    modified by the external form of the body, and where the double refraction
                    disappears when the heat or pressure is removed, or when the body is subdivided.
                    A permanent change is induced upon the soft solids in question, and, when
                    subdivided, each part of the mass or plate preserves the property communicated
                    to it. Sir David Brewster described, in the Philosophical Transactions for
                    1815,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Page 31,
                    32.</p></note> the original experiment which he made on this subject with a
                    mixture of rosin and white wax; but in the same work for 1830,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Page 87-</p></note> he has
                    given a detailed account of his experiments, and of the conclusions to which
                    they lead respecting the origin of the doubly-refracting structure. The
                    following is the fundamental experiment described by our author.</p>
                <p>“I took a few drops of the melted compound (rosin and bees’ wax), and placed them
                    in succession on a plate of thick glass, so as to form a large drop. Before it
                    was cold I laid above the drop a circular piece of glass about two thirds of an
                    inch in diameter, and, by a strong vertical pressure on the centre of the piece
                    of glass, I squeezed out the drop into a thin plate. This plate was now al most
                    perfectly transparent, as if the pressure had brought the particles of the
                    substance into optical contact.</p>
                <p>“If we expose this plate to polarised light, we shall find that it possesses one
                    <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> axis of double refraction, and exhibits the
                    polarised tints as perfectly as many crystals of the mineral kingdom. The
                    structure thus communicated to the soft film by pressure does not belong to it
                    as a whole, nor has it only one axis passing through its centre, like a circular
                    piece of unannealed glass. In every point of it there is an axis of double
                    refraction perpendicular to the plates, and the doubly-refracting force varies
                    with the inclination of the incident ray to this axis, as in all regular uniaxal
                    crystals.</p>
                <p>“When the two plates of glass are drawn asunder, we can remove one or more
                    portions of the compressed plate, and these portions act upon light exactly like
                    plates of uniaxal mica or hydrate of magnesia, and develope a doubly-refracting
                    force of nearly equal intensity.”</p>
                <p>By reasoning from this experiment, our author is led to the opinion that double
                    refraction is acquired by the particles of bodies at the instant of their
                    aggregation, and arises from the pressures produced in the direction of three
                    rectangular axes, by the forces of aggregation. When these forces are very weak,
                    double refraction will not be produced; when they are sufficiently strong and of
                    equal intensity, they will produce tessular crystals; when they are equal in two
                    rectangular directions, they will produce uniaxal crystals; and when they are
                    unequal in all the three directions, they will form biaxal ones. In this way all
                    the phenomena of cleavage may be readily explained.</p>
                <p>Upon some substances heat performs the same part as pressure; but our limits will
                    not permit us to detail our author’s experiments on this subject.</p>

                <p>gave polarised tints similar to those of Newton’s scale, and he therefore
                    considered this to be their character. In 1813, however, when Sir David Brewster
                    described the rings in topaz, he gave a list of all the colours in different
                    azimuths round the optic axes, and he not only found these colours to vary in
                    these different azimuths in the same ring, but observed some colours at the
                    extremity of the optic axes. In his paper on the laws of polarisation, published
                    in the Philosophical Transactions for 1818, he remarks, that “in almost all
                    crystals with two axes, the tints in the neighbourhood of the resultant axes,
                    when the plate has a considerable thickness, lose their resemblance to those in
                    Newton’s scale, as will be more minutely described in another paper.” In April
                    1817 he communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh an account of the
                    extraordinary system of rings in the apophyllite from the Tyrol, which consisted
                    of <hi rend="italic">purple</hi> and <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi> light, like
                    the residual colours arising from the combination of irrational spectra.</p>
                <p>In examining the colours of the polarised rings in biaxal crystals, he was led to
                    divide them into two classes, viz. 1. Those that had the <hi rend="italic"
                    >red</hi> ends of the rings <hi rend="italic">inwards,</hi> or between the
                    resultant axes, and the blue ends <hi rend="italic">outwards.</hi> 2. Those that
                    had the red ends of the rings <hi rend="italic">outwards,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">blue</hi> ends of the rings <hi rend="italic">inwards.</hi></p>
                <p>The crystals in which the deviation is very striking are given in the following
                    table.</p>
                <p>bir John Herschel found anomalous tints in hyposulphate of lime, and Vesuvian,
                    both crystals with one axis, a circumstance which we ascribe to that axis being
                    the resultant of three axes, two of which are equal.</p>
                <p>In examining the rings formed by biaxal crystals, Sir David Brewster found that
                    the black spot at the point of compensation was not in the centre of the rings,
                    and the position of this spot for <hi rend="italic">topaz</hi> is given in his
                    table of these colours.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Phil. Trans. 1814-, p. 204, 205.</p></note></p>
                <p>It is to Sir John Herschel, however, that we owe the complete investigation of
                    this subject in reference to biaxal crystals. By using homogeneous light, he
                    found that the angle of the resultant axes POp, fig. 129, was different for the
                    different colours of the spectrum, varying, in the case of <hi rend="italic"
                    >tartrate of potash and soda,</hi> from 75° 42' in <hi rend="italic">red</hi>
                    light, to 55° 14' in <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> light, so that with <hi
                    rend="italic">white</hi> light we have a system of rings, consisting of five
                    rings of all colours, overlapping each other, and these five constituting an
                    irregular system, unlike those produced by ordinary crystals.</p>
                <p>In crystals where the displacement of the rings is great, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >oval central spots</hi> seen in Plate CCCLXXX11I. figs. 32, 33, and 34, are
                    drawn out, as Sir John Herschel remarked, into long spectra or tails of <hi
                    rend="italic">red, green,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> light, and the
                    extremities of the rings are distorted and highly coloured, as in fig. 51, Plate
                    CCCLXXX1V. When we view these spectra with coloured media, they are found to
                    consist of well-defined spots of the several simple colours, arranged on each
                    side of the principal section, as shown in fig. 52.</p>
                <p>These results are capable of being rigorously calculated by the law of resultant
                    axes given by Sir David Brewster, and may be considered as a proof of that law.
                    If this were not the case, <hi rend="italic">tartrate of potash and soda</hi>
                    would have two axes for every different ray of the spectrum, and four series of
                    poles extending each over a space of <hi rend="italic">ten degrees.</hi></p>
                <p>In order to show how these phenomena may be calculated by two axes, let 0 and A,
                    fig. 153, be two negative axes, which in <hi rend="italic">reel</hi> light
                    compensate each other at F and F; then, if 0 and A had the same proportional
                    action on the <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> and other rays as on the <hi
                    rend="italic">red</hi> rays, F would also be the point of compensation for the
                    <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> and other rays. In this case F would be the centre
                    of all the systems of rings, as in uniaxal crystals, and the tints those of
                    Newton’s scale. But if the axis 0 has a greater proportional action upon the
                    violet and other rays than A, the point of compensation will be at <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> which will be the centre of the violet system of rings, the
                    centres of all the other systems being between F and <hi rend="italic">f</hi> if
                    the action of 0 upon them is of an intermediate nature. This is the case with
                    all the crystals in Class 1 of the foregoing table. On the other hand, if 0 has
                    a less proportional action on the violet than on the red, <hi rend="italic">c,
                    c</hi> will be the points of compensation for the <hi rend="italic">violet</hi>
                    rays, and the centres of the two systems of violet rings.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable instances of deviated tints are those in <hi rend="italic"
                    >apophyllite,</hi> a crystal with one axis, discovered by Sir David Brewster.
                    Sir John Herschel, in examining a number of apophyllites, found that some
                    specimens exercise <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> action upon the rays at one
                    end of the spectrum, a positive action upon rays at the other end, and no action
                    at all upon the mean refrangible rays, the doubly refracting action ceasing, in
                    the one case, in the yellow rays, and in another in the indigo.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cambridge Trans, vol. i. p.
                    21-24.</p></note> In other specimens, the diameter of the rings was nearly the
                    same for all the colours of the spectrum, and hence the rings were approaching
                    to a series of black and white ones. All these phenomena may be separately
                    calculated by the law of resultant axes already mentioned, on the supposition
                    that apophyllite has three rectangular axes of double refraction. Sir David
                    Brewster had discovered, in the tesselated apophyllite, portions which had <hi
                    rend="italic">two</hi> axes co-existing with portions that had <hi rend="italic"
                    >one</hi> axis; and in his coloured drawings of the phenomena exhibited by this
                    mineral, he has pointed out a most extraordinary law of symmetry which regulates
                    its varying double refraction; and as he had shown that a double dispersive
                    power existed in the same crystal, the following explanation of the remarkable
                    phenomena of apophyllite approaches to the character of demonstration.</p>
                <p>Let 0 be the positive axis of uniaxal apophyllite, and let A and B be two <hi
                    rend="italic">positive</hi> axes which, if equal, would produce a <hi
                    rend="italic">negative</hi> axis at 0. But as the real axis at 0 is a positive
                    one, the apparent or finally resultant axis at <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194563222" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3222-0489"/>0 will be a single axis, <hi
                    rend="italic">negative</hi> if the <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> is the
                    strongest, and positive if the positive is the strongest. Let us now suppose
                    that the two axes at O have equal intensity, viz. + 0 = — 0 for <hi
                    rend="italic">yellow</hi> light (— 0 being the resultant of + A and + B), and
                    that — 0 acts more powerfully upon the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> rays than + 0,
                    while + 0 acts more powerfully upon the <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> rays. In
                    this case the two axes + 0, — 0 will exactly compensate each other. In <hi
                    rend="italic">yellow</hi> light, a yellow ray will experience neither double
                    refraction nor polarisation; whereas in <hi rend="italic">red</hi> light, the
                    predominance of— 0 will leave a single negative axis for <hi rend="italic"
                    >red</hi> rays, and produce a <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> system of rings;
                    and in <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> light the predominance of + 0 will leave a
                    single <hi rend="italic">positi</hi><hi rend="italic">ve</hi> axis of double
                    refraction for violet rays, and consequently <hi rend="italic">a positive</hi>
                    system of rings. This compensation resembles that of a compound lens, consisting
                    of a <hi rend="italic">convex</hi> and <hi rend="italic">concave</hi> lens of
                    equal curvature, of such a glass that their refractive index for <hi
                    rend="italic">yellow</hi> light is equal, while the index of refraction for the
                    <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> rays is <hi rend="italic">greater</hi> in the <hi
                    rend="italic">convex</hi> lens, and the index for the <hi rend="italic">red</hi>
                    rays <hi rend="italic">greater</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">concave</hi> lens.
                    Such a lens will <hi rend="italic">converge</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >violet</hi> rays, <hi rend="italic">diverge</hi> the <hi rend="italic">red
                    rags,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">produce no deviation</hi> at all in the <hi
                    rend="italic">yellow</hi> ones; that is, the same compound lens will be a <hi
                    rend="italic">plane</hi> lens in <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi> light, a <hi
                    rend="italic">convex</hi> one in <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> light, and a <hi
                    rend="italic">concave</hi> one in <hi rend="italic">red</hi> light. Hence each
                    order of colours in apophyllite is as it were a secondary or residual spectrum
                    arising from the opposite action of unequal negative and positive axes. From the
                    fact of some apophyllites exercising a negative action, Sir David Brewster
                    stated his expectation that apophyllites might be found in which the double
                    refraction is negative for all the rays of the spectrum; and several years
                    afterwards he discovered the remarkable mineral of <hi rend="italic"
                    >οmhvmte,</hi> which is an apophyllite with this property.<note anchored="true"

                    is neither double refraction nor polarisation, the double refraction and the
                    tints commencing at these planes, and reaching their maximum in the centre of
                    the space enclosed by three of the dark lines. The tints are those of Newton’s
                    scale, and are negative in relation to each of the four axes of the <hi
                    rend="italic">icositetrahedron.</hi> When light is transmitted through any pair
                    of the four planes which are adjacent to any of the three axes of the solid, it
                    is doubly refracted, the least refracted image being the extraordinary one, and
                    consequently the double refraction negative in relation to the axes to which the
                    doubly-refracted ray is perpendicular.</p>
                <p>If we suppose the crystal to have the form of a <hi rend="italic">cube,</hi> the
                    planes of double refraction will be, as in fig. 54, a plane passing through the
                    two diagonals of each face of the cube.</p>
                <p>The tints vary as the square of the distance from the nearest plane of double
                    refraction.</p>
                <p>The tints shown in figs. 53 and 54 cannot of course be seen at the same time, but
                    are deduced from observations made by transmitting polarised light in every
                    direction through the crystal.</p>

                <p>In all the crystallized bodies whose action upon light we have been considering,
                    excepting <hi rend="italic">analcime,</hi> the phenomena are identical in all
                    parallel directions, the smallest fragment having the same property as the
                    largest, from whatever part of the crystal it is taken.</p>
                <p>In the mineral world, however, and among the products of artificial
                    crystallization, there occur crystals which are composed of several individual
                    crystals whose axes are not parallel. These crystals sometimes occur in such
                    regular symmetrical forms, that mineralogists have long regarded them as simple
                    forms; and it is probable that they would have still been viewed in this light,
                    if they had not been exposed to the scrutiny of polarised light.</p>
                <p>One of the most remarkable of these composite crystals is Iceland spar, some
                    specimens of which were observed, even by Bartholinus and Huygens, to exhibit
                    phenomena quite different from those which we have already described. The
                    property which they possessed of multiplying the images of a luminous body seen
                    through them had been carefully studied by Benjamin Martin, Professor Robison,
                    Lord Brougham, Malus, and others; but until the publication of Malus’ work on
                    Double Refraction, no sound explanation was given of these remarkable
                    phenomena.</p>
                <p>Malus describes the phenomena as produced by fissures parallel to the surface of
                    the variety of this mineral described by Haüy under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">chaux</hi><hi rend="italic">carbonatée equiaxe.</hi> He explains
                    the duplication of the images on the supposition that there is a <hi
                    rend="italic">fissure</hi> or real opening between the conjoined faces of the
                    spar, and he ascribes the varying tints to a cause not adequate to the
                    production of such splendid phenomena,—to the colouring of the thin plate of air
                    included in the fissure. He states correctly, that the secondary images are
                    doubled by <hi rend="italic">two</hi> fissures, tripled by three, &amp;c.<note

                    194-19ÍL</p></note></p>
                <p>This class of phenomena was particularly investigated by Sir David Brewster, who
                    found that the fissures described by Malus <hi rend="italic">were thin
                    crystallized laminae of Iceland spar,</hi> having their axes of double
                    refraction inclined to that of the portions of the crystal which it separated;
                    that these laminae varied in thickness, the thinnest producing a large system of
                    rings, and the thicker plates smaller systems, the plates being sometimes so
                    thick that no colours whatever appeared. Hence it was obvious <hi rend="italic"
                    >that each crystal of this kind was a polarising and an analysing apparatus, the
                    thin laminae being the plate which exhibited its polarised tints in this
                    singular position.</hi></p>
                <p>In order to understand this remarkable structure, we have represented the laminae
                    in fig. 155 by the planes ABCD, <hi rend="italic">ebcg, afhd</hi> parallel to
                    the edges EGFH, and also to the long diagonals of the rhomboidal faces, or
                    perpendicular to the short diagonal EF. When we look through a crystal with only
                    <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of these laminae, we observe the two principal images
                    of the candle A, B, or luminous <pb break="no" facs="nls:194563235"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-3235-0490"/>body, while at a vertical incidence, and separated
                    just as they would have appeared in a common crystal of the same thickness. But
                    on each side of this double image is a singlepolarised image C and D, C being
                    polarised in the same plane as B, and I) in the same plane as A. Let us suppose
                    that these phenomena are seen through a rhomb with only one plane ABCD (fig.
                    155), and through the faces EACÌ), BEHC. Then, if we incline the rhomb in
                    different directions slightly, we shall see the images C, D disappear when they
                    have a certain distance from A, B. If we incline the rhomb, bringing EA nearer
                    the eye than CD, the images C, D will approach to AB, and will be found to
                    disappear nearer and nearer to _AB as the inclination is increased, it being
                    necessary to bring the edge EG nearer the eye than AD, to make C and D
                    disappear. While C and D are thus approaching to A, B, they become less and less
                    coloured till they are all white. If we incline the rhomb in an opposite
                    direction, so that GD is brought nearer the eye than EA, the images C, D recede
                    from A, B, and become more highly coloured, the two images A, B becoming also
                    coloured. The images C, D sometimes appear doubled when this inclination is
                    going on, but it is only a duplicity of colour, so to speak, in consequence of
                    the spectrum being divided by portions of it passing into the reflected pencil.
                    When we bring EC nearer the eye than AD, the colours increase, A and B become
                    also coloured, and an apparent colorific duplication of the images C and D takes
                    place. If the rhomb is inclined in an opposite direction, so that AD is brought
                    nearer the eye than EC, the images C, D become also at first more coloured; but
                    by increasing the inclination, the image C recedes rapidly on the right side
                    from A, B, contracts in breadth, and becomes prismati-cally coloured, the
                    spectrum which it exhibits being subdivided by several black lines or bands, the
                    parts of the spectrum corresponding to these black lines or dark bands having
                    passed into the reflected ray. The spectrum D recedes as rapidly to the left,
                    expanding in breadth, and even disappearing, as well as the images A, B.</p>
                <p>All these phenomena are more finely seen, and the law of their changes more
                    easily detected, if, instead of a candle, we look at a long line of light, such
                    as the narrow opening between the edges of the window-shutters.</p>
                <p>If we look through the faces ADFH, ADRG of the rhomb, placing a prism of glass
                    with an angle of 12° or 15 <hi rend="superscript"> 9</hi> upon one of the faces,
                    to permit the refracted rays to emerge at a moderate angle of deviation, the
                    prismatic images formerly described will be large spectra, subdivided by black
                    spaces into 4, 5, 6, &amp;c. coloured images of the candle, or of the long
                    luminous line, exhibiting one of the most magnificent phenomena that can be
                    witnessed.</p>
                <p>These phenomena vary, of course, with the thickness of the enclosed laminae, and
                    as the laminae increase in thickness the subdivisions of the spectral images
                    become more numerous.</p>
                <p>When we reflect light from these laminae, ABCD, for example, by allowing the
                    light to enter by the face BFHC, and emerge through the face AFHD, the boundary
                    of total reflection is marked by a series of brilliant rectilineal fringes,
                    polarised in the same manner as the image Ç, which is now the lowermost. When
                    the light is transmitted through the laminae at the boundary of total
                    reflection, by entering through the face BECG, and emerging through AFHD, a
                    series of rectilineal fringes complementary to the former reflected series is
                    seen. They also are polarised in the same plane as C, or the lowermost secondary
                    image, and become much more distinct, by causing the oppositely polarised pencil
                    to disappear.</p>
                <p>The structure which produces the preceding phenomena, and the duplication of the
                    images, will be understood from fig. 157, where ABCD is the principal section of
                    a crystal of this kind <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Iceland spar, having AD for its
                    axis. One of the laminae oppositely crystallized is shown at M<hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi>, Nw, but much thicker than they are generally, the angles AmM, DnN being
                    141° 44'. A ray of ordinary light Rè will be refracted in the lines <hi
                    rend="italic">be, bd.</hi> These rays entering the laminae MN, will be again
                    refracted doubly; but as the vein is so thin as to produce the system of uniaxal
                    rings, the colours <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> will vary with the thickness
                    of the film and the inclination of the ray to the axis of the lamina. The four
                    pencils will emerge from the lamina at <hi rend="italic">e,f</hi> and will be
                    refracted again, as in the figure, into the pencils <hi rend="italic"
                    >em,</hi><hi rend="italic">en,</hi><hi rend="italic">fo, fp,</hi> the colours of
                    <hi rend="italic">eη,fο</hi> being complementary to those <hi rend="italic">of
                    em,fp.</hi></p>
                <p>That the multiplication and colour of the images are produced by the causes above
                    explained, has been proved by Sir David Brewster, by actually placing laminae of
                    different crystals between the prisms AN, BN. In this way, by introducing
                    different films in different azimuths, most beautiful combinations may be
                    produced.</p>
                <p>If we grind down the angles A and B, so as to have two faces perpendicular to the
                    axis AB, the uniaxal system of rings is beautifully modified by the action of
                    the lamina MN; and that this was the cause <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    singular transformations which the rings experienced in different crystals, was
                    proved by the author above quoted, by inserting laminae between two plates of
                    the <hi rend="italic">chaux carbonatée basée</hi> of Haüy, whose natural faces
                    are perpendicular to the axis. These transformations are exceedingly beautiful.
                    Some of them are shown in figs. 55, 56, and 57, one of the rings consisting of
                    eight dark radii, while the complementary system has its inner circle marked
                    with <hi rend="italic">eight</hi> darkcoloured spots. These rings suffer
                    beautiful changes, both by the motion of the plane round its axes when the
                    analysing plate is stationary, and by the motion of the analysing plate when the
                    rhomb is stationary. In studying these phenomena in a great variety of crystals
                    intersected with one or more laminae, Sir David Brewster noticed a very
                    remarkable fact. A rhomb of spar which produced in one part of it the
                    transformed systems already mentioned, exhibited a singular effect in another
                    part, where <hi rend="italic">the crystallization appeared perfect and
                    simple,</hi> and where there were decidedly no veins or laminae. In one position
                    or azimuth of this crystal, this portion gave, as might have been expected, the
                    regular system of rings with the black cross shown in fig. 29. But upon turning
                    it round 45°, all the rings became <hi rend="italic">elliptical,</hi> as shown
                    at ABCD in fig. 58, the <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> ∕⅛si order of colours in
                    one quadrant having joined the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> order of colours in
                    the adjacent quadrant. The arms of the black cross took the contorted position
                    <hi rend="italic">abc, def,</hi> the continuations of it afterwards, viz. <hi
                    rend="italic">am, cη,</hi> do,yþ being so very faint as to show the continuity
                    of the elliptical rings. In this figure the rings of the same order are marked
                    with the same figure. The very same phenomenon, which points to important
                    theoretical consequences, was observed by the same author in another rhomb of
                    spar <hi rend="italic">wholly without veins,</hi> but the rings were not so
                    elliptical as in fig. 58.</p>
                <p>This composite structure was discovered by Sir David <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194563248" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3248-0491"/>Brewster in various minerals,
                    and he has described it very minutely in the case of <hi rend="italic">Brazilian
                    topaz, sulphate of ροtash,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">apophyllite.</hi></p>
                <p>Sir John Herschel, we believe, first noticed this structure in Brazilian topaz,
                    and observed that the central portion of the crystal had a different colour from
                    the external portion, and that the plane of the principal section of the
                    different parts made angles of 20 →z <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi>. Sir David
                    Brewster found very remarkable arrangements of the coloured portions, which he
                    has represented in coloured drawings in the Cambridge Transactions, vol. ii. In
                    some of these crystals the structure was tesselated, as in fig. 158, where ABED,
                    CBEF, are the two external tesselae, at one of the obtuse angles of the
                    rhomboidal section. If we suppose that these tesselae are divided into <hi
                    rend="italic">four</hi> laminae, 1, 2, 3, 4, and that MN is the principal
                    section, or one of the neutral axes of the central portion of the crystal
                    contiguous to DEF, then the laminae 1, 1 have their principal section in the
                    direction <hi rend="italic">ad,</hi> forming a very small angle with MN; the
                    laminae 2, 2 have their principal section in the line <hi rend="italic">bb,</hi>
                    and so on to the superficial laminae 4, 4, which have their principal section in
                    the direction <hi rend="italic">dd,</hi> inclined from 10° <hi rend="underline"
                    >→-</hi> to 22° =tz to MN, the inclination varying in different crystals. The
                    lines <hi rend="italic">aa', bld,</hi> &amp;c. are also the principal sections
                    of the corresponding laminae on the side NC. In like manner, the principal
                    sections αα', ∕3∕3', &amp;c. of the laminae in BCFE, are the principal sections
                    of the corresponding laminae on the other side AN. As the laminae, however, are
                    infinite in number, the principal sections have every possible direction between
                    <hi rend="italic">dd!</hi> and ðá·</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">bipyramidal sulphate of potash,</hi> which Count Bournon
                    supposed to be a simple crystal, was found by Sir David Brewster to be a
                    tesselated crystal, composed of three pair of crystals of the prismatic sulphate
                    of potash combined so that each pair had their principal axis parallel. When
                    exposed to polarised light, each pair gave the system of biaxal rings, and when
                    held at a distance from the eye, had the tesselated appearance shown in fig. 59,
                    Plate CCCLXXXIV., each opposite pair of the triangles having the same tint.<note

                <p>The most remarkable of this class of minerals, and indeed the most remarkable
                    body in the whole mineral kingdom, is the <hi rend="italic">tesselated
                    apophyllite.</hi> It crystallizes most commonly in four-sided rectangular
                    prisms, like CD, fig. 60. If we remove the uppermost slice A and the undermost B
                    to the thickness of between the 50th and the 100th of an inch, and examine it
                    either by the microscope or by polarised light, we shall find that it is like
                    other uniaxal plates, giving a single system of rays having the very peculiar
                    colours which have been already described. A number of veins appear at the
                    edges, as shown in the figure. All the other slices lying below this exhibit the
                    beautiful tesselated figure shown in fig. 61. The outer case MNOP, which, âs it
                    were, binds together the internal portions, consists of a great number of
                    parallel veins or plates, which give the colours of grooved surfaces. This frame
                    encloses <hi rend="italic">nine</hi> different crystals, namely, the central
                    lozenge <hi rend="italic">abed,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">four</hi> prisms A,
                    B, C, D with trapezoidal bases, and the∕owr triangular prisms <hi rend="italic"
                    >ehl, lmn, nkg, gfe,</hi> all of which are separated by distinct lines or veins,
                    which are nearly all visible by the microscope by a proper method of
                    illumination. In polarised light they are all seen with great facility.</p>
                <p>The most extraordinary fact connected with this structure is, <hi rend="italic"
                    >that the central lozenge has only</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">one</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">axis of double refraction, like the terminal plates A, B,
                    fig.</hi> 60, <hi rend="italic">while the four prisms A, B, C, D, and the four
                    triangular spaces, have</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">two</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >axes.</hi> In A and D the planes of the resultant axí?s are coincident, as in
                    the opposite triangles of sulphate of potash, and he in the direction MN, while'
                    the planes of the resultant axes in B and C lie in the direction OP.</p>
                <p>When the plate MONP is exposed to polarised light and turned round its axis
                    before the analysing plate, the lozenge <hi rend="italic">abed</hi> will be dark
                    in evety position of the plate, while the portions A, B, C, D will depolarise
                    the light, or be luminous, when MO or ON are parallel or perpendicular to the
                    plane of primitive polarisation.</p>
                <p>Remarkable as is the structure which we have now described, it is greatly
                    excelled in beauty by another variety of Faroe apophyllite, in which Sir David
                    Brewster discovered the most extraordinary organization. He has given an
                    enlarged coloured drawing of the fine symmetrical tints which it exhibits in
                    polarised light, in theEdinburgh Transactions; but we hope its structure may be
                    understood by the following description which he has given of it. The crystals
                    have a greenish-white tinge, and are aggregated together in masses. The
                    quadrangular prisms are in general below one twelfth of an inch in width; they
                    are always unpolished on their terminal planes; they have the angles at the
                    summit more deeply truncated than the other quadrangular prisms from Faroe; they
                    are always perfectly transparent; and may sometimes be detached in a complete
                    state, with both their terminal summits.</p>
                <p>“In examining this variety of apophyllite, I was enabled, by the perfection of
                    the crystals, to study their structure through the natural planes, and at right
                    angles to their axes. The phenomena which this investigation presented to me
                    were of a very singular and unexpected nature. In symmetry of form and splendour
                    of colouring they far surpassed any of the optical arrangements that I had seen,
                    while they developed a singular complexity of structure, and indicated the
                    existence of new laws of mineral organization.</p>
                <p>“When a complete crystal of this variety of apophyllite is exposed to polarised
                    ligkt, with its axes inclined 45° to the plane of primitive polarisation, and is
                    subsequently examined with an analysing prism, it exhibits, through both its
                    pair of parallel planes, the appearance shown in fig. 62. In turning the crystal
                    round the polarised ray, all the tints vanish, re-appear, and reach their
                    maximum at the same time, so that they are not the result of any hemitropism,
                    but arise wholly from a symmetrical combination of elementary crystals
                    possessing different primitive forms and different refractive and polarising
                    powers. The difference in the polarising powers is well shown by the variation
                    of tint; and the difference of refractive power may be observed with equal
                    distinctness by examining the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194563261"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-3261-0492"/>crystal with the microscope under favourable
                    circumstances of illumination, when the outlines of the symmetrical forms shown
                    in fig. 62 will be clearly visible.</p>
                <p>“In examining the splendid arrangement of tints exhibited in the figure, the
                    perfect symmetry which appears in all its parts is particularly remarkable. The
                    existence of the curvilineal solid in the centre; the gradual diminution in the
                    length of the circumscribing plates, in consequence of which they taper, as it
                    were, from the angles of the central rectangle to the truncated angles at the
                    summits; but, above all, the reproduction of similar tints on each side of the
                    central figure, and at equal distances from it, cannot fail to strike the
                    observer with surprise and admiration.</p>
                <p>“The tints exhibited by each crystal vary, of course, according to its thickness;
                    but the range of tint in the same plate, and at the same thickness, generally
                    amounts in the largest crystals to three of the orders of colours in Newton’s
                    scale. The central portion, and the two squares above and below it, have in
                    general the same intensity, while the four segments round the central portion,
                    and some of the parts beyond each of the squares, are also isochromatic. In the
                    central part the colours have a decided termination; but towards the summit of
                    the prism their outline is less regular, and less distinctly marked; though this
                    irregularity has also its counterpart at the other termination. A part of these
                    irregularities is sometimes owing to the longitudinal striae on the natural
                    faces of the crystal, so that by carefully grinding these off, die beauty and
                    regularity of the figure is greatly improved.</p>
                <p>“In order to ascertain the order of the colours polarised by the crystal, and
                    observe in what manner they passed into one another, I transmitted the polarised
                    light in a direction parallel to one of the diagonals of the quadrangular prism,
                    and thus obtained, as it were, a section of the different orders of colours from
                    the zero of their scale. The result of this experiment, which is shown in fig.
                    63, was highly interesting, as it displayed to the eye not only the law
                    according to which the intensity of the polarising forces varied in different
                    parts of the crystal, but also the variation in the nature of the tints, and the
                    connection between these two classes of phenomena. At the points in the diagonal
                    <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> opposite to <hi rend="italic">ba</hi> of the crystal,
                    the tints rose to the <hi rend="italic">seventh</hi> order of colours; and in
                    other two places opposite to <hi rend="italic">cd,</hi> they were only to the
                    <hi rend="italic">sixth</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> while near the summits at
                    <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> they descended so low as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fourth</hi> order. Hence it follows that the four curvilincal segments, fig.
                    62, arc next to these in intensity; that the central portions of the squares arc
                    again inferior to these; and that the weakest polarising force is near the
                    summit of the prisms. At <hi rend="italic">αb,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fourth, fifth,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sixth</hi> fringes have a singularly
                    serrated outline, exhibiting, in a very interesting manner, the sudden
                    variations which take place in the polarising forces of the successive
                    laminae.</p>
                <p>“Having thus described the structure and properties of the tesselated
                    apophyllite, it becomes interesting to inquire how far such a combination of
                    structures is compatible with the admitted laws of crystallography. The growth
                    of a crystal, in virtue of the aggregation of minute particles endowed with
                    polarity, and possessing certain primitive forms, is easily comprehended,
                    whether we suppose the particles to exist in a state of igneous fluidity or
                    aqueous solution. But it is a necessary consequence of this process, that the
                    same law presides at the formation of every part of it, and that the crystal is
                    homogeneous throughout, possessing the same mechanical and physical properties
                    in all parallel directions.</p>
                <p>“The tesselated apophyllite, however, could not have been formed by this process.
                    It resembles more a work of art, in which the artist has varied, not only the
                    materials, but the laws of their combination.</p>
                <p>“A foundation appears to be first laid by means of an uniform homogeneous plate,
                    the primitive form of which is pyramidal. A central pillar, whose section is a
                    rectangular lozenge, then rises perpendicularly from the base, and consists of
                    similar particles. Round this pillar are placed new materials, in the form of
                    four trapezoidal solids, the primitive form of whose particles is prismatic; and
                    in these solids the lines of similar properties are at right angles to each
                    other. The crystal is then made quadrangular by the application of four
                    triangular prisms of unusual acuteness. The <hi rend="italic">nine solids</hi>
                    arranged in this symmetrical manner, and joined by transparent veins performing
                    the functions of cement, are then surrounded by a wall composed of numerous
                    films, deposited in succession, and the whole of this singular assemblage is
                    finally roofed in by a plate exactly similar to that which formed its
                    foundation.</p>
                <p>“The second variety of the tesselated apophyllite is still more complicated.
                    Possessing the different combinations of the one which has just been described,
                    it displays, in the direction of the length of the prism, an organization of the
                    most singular kind. Forms unknown in crystallography occupy its central portion;
                    and on each side of it particles of similar properties take their place at
                    similar distances, now forming a zone of uniform polarising force, now another
                    increasing to a maximum, and now a third descending in the scale by regular
                    gradations. The boundaries of these corresponding though distant zones are
                    marked with the greatest precision, and all their parts as nicely adjusted as if
                    some skilful workman had selected the materials, measured the spaces they were
                    to occupy, and finally combined them into the finest specimen of natural
                    mosaic.</p>
                <p>“The irregularities of crystallization which are known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">macle</hi> or <hi rend="italic">hemitrope</hi> forms, and those
                    compound groups which arise from the mutual penetration of crystals, are merely
                    accidental deviations from particular laws which govern the crystallizations in
                    which they occur. The aberrations themselves testify the predominance of the
                    laws to which they form exceptions, and they are susceptible of explanation by
                    assuming certain polarities in the integrant molecules. The compound structure
                    of the apophyllite, however, cannot be referred to these capricious formations.
                    It is itself the result of a general law, to which there are no exceptions, and
                    when more deeply studied and better understood, it must ultimately lead to the
                    introduction of some new principle of organization, of which crystallographers
                    have at present no conception.</p>
                <p>“The difficulty of accounting for the formation of apophyllite is in no way
                    diminished by giving the utmost license to speculation. We cannot even avail
                    ourselves of the extravagant supposition of a crystalline embryo, which, like
                    that of animal and vegetable life, gradually expands to maturity. The germ of
                    plants and animals is nourished by a series of organs, of which, however
                    recondite be the operation, we yet see the action and witness the effects; but
                    in the architecture of apophyllite no subsidiary organs are seen. The crystal
                    appears only in its state of perfection; and we are left to admire the skill
                    which presided at its formation, and to profit by the instruction which is so
                    impressively conveyed by such mysterious organization.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>When a beam of light passes through the most transparent media, such as air and
                    water, a certain portion of it <hi rend="italic">is lost.</hi> This loss of
                    light is particularly apparent in such bodies when a beam of light has traversed
                    a great thickness of the gas or the fluid. This loss of light has been called
                    <hi rend="italic">absorption,</hi> and the Kght lost is said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">absorbed</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a term which we use at
                    present as merely expressing a fact</p>
                <p>There are two kinds of absorption which may be noticed. 1. That in which all the
                    rays of the spectrum are proportionally absorbed or lost; and, 2. that in which
                    different quantities of the differently coloured rays are lost. Those bodies in
                    which the first kind of absorption takes place are <hi rend="italic"
                    >colourless,</hi> and those in which the second kind takes place are <hi
                    rend="italic">coloured.</hi> In black <hi rend="italic">ink,</hi> for example,
                    the transmitted light of the sun is white. In red ink it is red, more of the
                    most refrangible rays of the spectrum being lost than of the least refrangible
                    ones.</p>
                <p>When a beam of the sun’s light falls upon a piece of charcoal, the light is
                    almost wholly lost or absorbed. Sir Isaac Newton thought that the light was
                    reflected or refracted “to and fro” within such bodies till it was lost; but
                    still the question meets us, why is it lost? If it is scattered in all
                    directions it must emerge again from the charcoal, and be visible in some way or
                    other. In order to meet this and other difficulties, the light is supposed to be
                    detained within the body, and somehow or other united to its substance.</p>
                <p>In the case of red ink and similar bodies Sir Isaac Newton conceived that the <hi
                    rend="italic">blue</hi> rays which were lost were reflected by the particles of
                    the ink, while the red rays were transmitted, as in the colours of thin plates;
                    but as we cannot by any process see these <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> rays, we
                    can only say that they are lost, and the cause of their loss is as difficult to
                    be found as in the phenomena of imperfect colourless transparency.</p>
                <p>The following are the general phenomena of coloured absorptions in transparent
                    bodies.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Red</hi> transparent solids or fluids absorb, generally
                    speaking, the blue end of the spectrum.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Blue</hi> substances absorb, generally speaking, the red end
                    of the spectrum.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Green</hi> bodies absorb both the blue and the red ends of
                    the spectrum.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Yellow</hi> bodies absorb the <hi rend="italic">blue</hi>
                    and part of the <hi rend="italic">green</hi> of the spectrum.</p>
                <p>But when we examine more narrowly the action of coloured bodies on the spectrum,
                    we find that a body may derive its peculiar tint from absorbing two, three,
                    four, up to many hundred separate parts of the spectrum, so that the colour of
                    such a body is the combination of all the parts of the spectrum which are not
                    absorbed. We may infer, however, from the general tint of the body, what parts

                    rend="italic">gas,</hi> for example, must have acted most powerfully upon the
                    blue end of the spectrum, as we have already seen that it does.</p>
                <p>Three theories of absorption have been recently published, namely, by Sir John
                    Herschel, Baron Wrede, and Μ. Lamé, all of which are founded upon the undulatory
                    theory. Sir John Herschel conceives that light may be lost within bodies by the
                    interference of different parts of a ray, which, after taking two routes of <hi
                    rend="italic">different lengths,</hi> meet again in a condition to interfere.
                    This hypothesis has been modified by Mr Whewell in the following manner: “If we
                    conceive,” says he,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Report of the Fourth Meeting of the British Association, 1834, p.
                    551.</p></note> “with Sir John Herschel, a medium which will not transmit
                    vibrations except through certain canals, these canals must have a determinate
                    direction, and therefore such a constitution would give different proportions in
                    different directions. But let a medium consist of certain particles regularly
                    distributed, the intervening space being filled by a medium capable of
                    vibration. Let it be supposed, also, that each vibration, on reaching a medium
                    so disposed, proceeds in part directly and in part by the indirect routes which
                    go <hi rend="italic">round</hi> some of the particles and rejoin the direct
                    course. We have thus combinations of ramifying and uniting paths, which, though
                    very complex in each direction, are the same in different directions, in
                    consequence of the regular distribution of the particles. If the distribution,
                    though regular, have a reference to certain axes, as in many crystals, the
                    phenomena of absorption may be different in different directions with regard to
                    these axes.</p>
                <p>“In this way the theory of ramifying canals comes to coincide with the theory of
                    vibrations, of which parts are differently retarded, and thus interfere with
                    each other; a theory which has been suggested by other authors.”</p>
                <p>Baron Wrede<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>l’avlor s
                    Scientific Memoirs, part m.</p></note> supposes the particles of a transparent
                    body placed regularly at equal distances, with the ether diffused between them.
                    When a ray of light is propagated directly through this medium, a portion of it
                    encounters some of the particles, and is reflected backwards, then forwards
                    again, and emerges along with the direct ray, so that the reflected and direct
                    portions will be in a state to interfere and destroy each other. This theory,
                    which is analogous to Newton’s, or rather the very same as Newton’s, is liable
                    to the objection we have already urged to every theory in which the light is
                    supposed to be decomposed by interior reflections. Now, Baron Wrede’s hypothesis
                    may explain all the phenomena, such as dark bands and dark lines, which are
                    known to be produced by thin plates of various thicknesses, as Dr Young has
                    stated;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>&lt; Elements of
                    Natural Philosophy, vol. i. J. 469.</p></note> and it may even explain those
                    bands and absorptions which have been recently discovered in decomposed glass by
                    Sir David Brewster, where the effects are clearly produced by a combination of a
                    great number of thin plates,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Phil. trans. 1837, part u.</p></note> but where the
                    reflected light is as copious as the transmitted light. But we cannot conceive
                    it at all applicable to the cases of nitrous gas (to which he has attempted to
                    apply it), and to solids and fluids, in which all attempts have failed to
                    discover any of the reflected rays.</p>
                <p>The hypothesis of Μ. Lamé, which we have already stated in our history of Optics,
                    is incompatible with the actual phenomena of absorption. In place of the lines
                    and bands depending on the surface of emergence, the system of lines is
                    determined by the action of the first surface of the body, a fact independent of
                    all theory.</p>
                <p>Of all the theoretical views which we have mentioned, we consider those given by
                    Sir John Herschel and Mr Whewell as the most consistent with observation. They
                    relieve<pb break="no" facs="nls:194563287" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3287-0494"/> us
                    from the difficulty of accounting for the reflected light; but though they have
                    this in their favour, they are not founded on any direct data, and indeed were
                    brought forward, as Mr Wlιewell remarks, “to show that there is no incongruity
                    between the undulatory theory and the phenomena of absorption.”</p>
                <p>An attempt has been recently made by Sir David Brewster to deduce an explanation
                    of absorption, both in uncrystallized and doubly refracting bodies, from direct
                    experiment; butas the details have not been published, we can only at present
                    give a very general notice of it. Having been led to suppose, along with Dr
                    Young,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr Young made
                    this supposition, not to explain absorption, but to account for the dispersion
                    of colours by refraction. Ēlem. Nat. Phil. vol. ii. p. 937.</p></note> that a
                    transparent medium transmits light in two separate portions, one passing through
                    its ultimate particles, and the other through its pores, and that these portions
                    reunite continually after each successive separation, Sir David Brewster
                    endeavoured so to combine a number of thin plates, that the light transmitted
                    through the whole should move with different velocities, the differences being
                    so small as to produce interference. This task he found to be a very difficult
                    one, but he succeeded, after many failures, in finding a doubly-refracting
                    mineral upon which he could impress this mechanical condition.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The same property was
                    afterwards found in several crystallized minerals.</p></note> When he placed a
                    small aperture upon this crystal, in order to exclude as much as possible all
                    the light which had not experienced any change in its velocity, and looked
                    through it at a well-formed prismatic spectrum, or, what was the same thing,
                    analysed the light transmitted by the plate with a good prism, he was astonished
                    at the sight which was presented to him, not only because it confirmed his views
                    on a subject of such high scientific interest, but from the splendour of the
                    phenomena which it displayed. The spectrum was covered with the sharpest bright
                    and dark lines and bands grouped with all the irregularity of the solar and
                    nitrous gas lines. The bright lines of maximum intensity were variously placed;
                    and in almost every spectrum thus formed there was a narrow band of <hi
                    rend="italic">pure homogeneous</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">white</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">light, incapable of being decomposed by prismatic analysis.</hi>
                    But the interest of this result did not stop here. The spectrum of the <hi
                    rend="italic">ordinary</hi> differed from that <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> ray, and the brightest lines had a different
                    locality in each of them. Here then we have the phenomenon of dichroism, of the
                    absorption of light in crystallized and uncrystallized bodies, and of bright and
                    dark lines and bands in the spectrum, and of the unequal absorption of rays of
                    the same refrangibility, but differing in colour, all displayed by an
                    artificially produced combination, in which we know that the phenomena are owing
                    to the interference of rays differently retarded. It can therefore scarcely be
                    doubted that the varied phenomena of absorption arise from the differences of
                    velocity in the rays which pass through the ultimate particles and through the
                    pores of bodies. The constitution of the body, or the arrangement of the
                    ultimate particles in the first film on which the light is incident, determines
                    the nature of the absorptive action which the body exercises at different
                    thicknesses.</p>

                    Absorption of Common and Polarised Light by Doubly Refracting Crystals.</hi></p>
                <p>, The name of <hi rend="italic">dichroism</hi> or <hi rend="italic">double
                    colours,</hi> was given very appropriately, by M. Cordier, we believe, to a
                    mineral called <hi rend="italic">iolite,</hi> which in <hi rend="italic">common
                    light</hi> exhibited two different colours in different directions. Dr Wollaston
                    and several mineralogists had observed this double colour in certain crystals of
                    palladium, tourmaline, and other crystals. The origin of this singular property
                    was not known till Sir David Brewter investigated its origin in <hi
                    rend="italic">iolite,</hi> and showed that it was connected with the
                    doubly-refracting structure; that it never occurred in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tessular</hi> crystals which did not possess double refraction.</p>
                <p>The connection of dichroism with double refraction, and its general laws, will be
                    understood from the following observations. In a specimen of <hi rend="italic"
                    >yellow Iceland spar</hi> the <hi rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> image is of
                    an <hi rend="italic">orange-yellow</hi> colour, while the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ordinary</hi> image is <hi rend="italic">yellowish-white.</hi> Along the axis
                    of double refraction the colour of the two pencils is exactly the same, and the
                    difference of colour increases with the inclination of the refracted ray to the
                    axis. Hence the difference of colour increases in proportion to the difference
                    of the velocities of the two rays, and is consequently a maximum in the equator
                    of double refraction, and is the same in all parallels; the colour along the
                    axis being the natural colour of the mineral. This is the invariable law of the
                    phenomena in uniaxal crystals. The following are the observations made by the
                    author already referred to.</p>

                <p>Sir John Herschel has found this property beautifully displayed in the
                    sub-oxysulphate of iron, which crystallizes in six-sided prisms. Along the axis
                    the colour is a <hi rend="italic">deez&gt; blood-red,</hi> while through the
                    sides of the prism it is of a <hi rend="italic">light green</hi> colour. Several
                    tourmalines have also been observed by Sir John to have these same colours along
                    the axis, and at right angles to it. There can be little doubt that this
                    property will be found in every crystal of sufficient thickness that has the
                    property of double réfraction. Even if the crystal is colourless, a slight
                    inequality in the intensity of the two images may be observed; and when it is
                    distinctly coloured, the difference of intensity is very easily seen, even when
                    the two colours are not of a different kind.</p>
                <p>The phenomena of <hi rend="italic">dichroism</hi> are best seen in crystals with
                    <hi rend="italic">two</hi> axes of double refraction, and are well
                    exemt&gt;∣i-fied<pb break="no" facs="nls:194563300" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3300-0495"
                    /> in <hi rend="italic">iolite,</hi> a mineral which crystallizes in six or
                    twelve sided prisms. These prisms are of a <hi rend="italic">deep blue</hi>
                    colour when seen along the axis, and of a yellowish brown colour when viewed in
                    a direction perpendicular to the axis.</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">abed</hi> is a section of the prism of iolite in a plane
                    parallel to the axis of the prism, the transmitted light will be <hi

                    rend="italic">dc,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">yellowish-brown</hi> through <hi

                    the prism. If we grind down the angles <hi rend="italic">a, c, b, d,</hi> so as
                    to replace them with faces <hi rend="italic">mn, m'n</hi><hi rend="italic

                    axis of the prism; then, if the plane <hi rend="italic">abed</hi> passes through
                    the resultant axes of double refraction, we shall observe, by transmitting
                    polarised light through the crystal in the directions <hi rend="italic"
                    >ac,bd,</hi> and subsequently analysing it, a. system of rings round each of
                    these axes. The system will exhibit the individual rings very plainly if the
                    crystal is thin; but if it is thick, we shall observe, when the plane <hi
                    rend="italic">abed</hi> is perpendicular to the plane of primitive polarisation,
                    <hi rend="italic">some branches of blue and white light, diverging in the form

                    ones. The summits of the blue masses at <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> ’ are tipped with purple, and are separated by whitish
                    light in some specimens, and yellowish light in others. The white light becomes
                    more blue from <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> ’ to o,
                    where it is quite <hi rend="italic">blue,</hi> and more yellow from <hi

                    spots of white light, but everywhere else the light is a deep blue.</p>
                <p>In the plane <hi rend="italic">cadb,</hi> fig. 159, the mineral, when we look
                    through it at common light, exhibits no other colour but yellow, mixed with a
                    small quantity of blue polarised in an opposite plane. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >ordinary</hi> image at <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is
                    yellowish brown, and the <hi rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> image faint blue,
                    the former receiving some <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> rays,‘and the latter some
                    <hi rend="italic">yellow ones</hi> from <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> and at <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> where the difference of
                    colour is still well marked. The <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi> image becomes <hi
                    rend="italic">fainter</hi> from <hi rend="italic">α</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> to <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and/»', till it changes into <hi
                    rend="italic">blue,</hi> and the faint <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> image is
                    strengthened by other blue rays, till the intensity of the two blue images is
                    nearly equal. As the incident ray advances from <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> to <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p',</hi>
                    the faint blue image becomes more intense, and the <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi>
                    one, receiving an accession of <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> rays, becomes of a
                    <hi rend="italic">bluish white</hi> colour. The ordinary image is <hi

                <p>The principal axis of double refraction in <hi rend="italic">iolite</hi> is

                <p>Sir David Brewster found that the dichroism of several crystals is changed by
                    heat, and that in some cases this property may be communicated to them. In
                    several coloured glasses, too, he found an analogous property, when they had
                    received the doubly-refracting structure either temporarily or permanently.<note

                <p>Sir David Brewster also observed that the polarisation was more complete in
                    azimuth 0° than in azimuth 90° on the faces of the rhomb; but more complete in
                    azimuth 90° than in azimuth 0° in faces parallel to the axis.</p>
                <p>As these experiments clearly proved that the forces which produced double
                    refraction extended beyond the surface of Iceland spar, our author became
                    desirous of ascertaining if the light polarised by reflection from the spar
                    suffered any change from the same cause. He therefore thought of weakening the
                    force which produces reflection, in order to allow the interior force to show
                    its weaker influence; and he accomplished this by placing oil of cassia on its
                    surface, and examining the light reflected at the separating surface of the spar
                    and the oil. The experiments which were thus made, and which are detailed in the
                    Philosophical Transactions for 1819, completely proved that the interior force
                    polarised common light out of the plane of reflection, and modified the law of
                    intensity, according to which light is reflected at different angles of
                    incidence.</p>
                <p>These experiments excited no attention till 1835, when Professor Maccullagh, of
                    Trinity College, Dublin, began to investigate the laws which regulate the
                    reflection and refraction of light at the separating surface of two media. He
                    had anticipated from theory effects the reverse of those deduced from the
                    preceding experiments; and in order to account for the latter, he was obliged to
                    modify his theoretical views, and was thus led to the result, that when a ray is
                    polarised by reflection from a doubly-reflecting surface, the plane of
                    polarisation deviates from the plane of incidence, except when the axis lies in
                    the latter plane. The formula which expresses this deviation represents very
                    accurately the measures of the polarising angles in different azimuths in the
                    natural faces of the rhomb, the only surface in which the exception is true; but
                    at all other inclinations of the reflecting planes to the axis, the theory and
                    the formula are in fault, for there is a large deviation when the axis or
                    principal section of the crystal is in the plane of reflection.</p>

                    deviation increasing as the refractive power of the medium approached to that of
                    the spar, induced Sir David Brewster to resume his inquiries, the general result
                    of which he communicated to the British Association at Bristol in 1836, in the
                    following very brief abstract.</p>
                <p>“When light is reflected at the separating surface of two media, the lowermost of
                    which is a doubly-refracting one, the reflected ray is exposed to the action of
                    two forces, one of which is the ordinary reflecting force, and the other a force
                    which emanates from the interior of the doubly refracting crystal. When the
                    first medium is air, or even water, the first of these forces overpowers the
                    second; and, in general, the effects of the one are so masked by the effects of
                    the other, that I was obliged to use oil of cassia, a fluid of high refractive
                    power, in order that the interior force of the calcareous spar which I wished to
                    examine might exhibit its effects independently of those which arise from
                    ordinary reflection. The separating surface, therefore, which I used, had a
                    small refractive power; and the reflecting pencil is so attenuated, especially
                    in using polarised light, that it is almost impossible to use any other light
                    than that of the sun.</p>
                <p>“When a pencil of common light is reflected from the separating surface of oil of
                    cassia and calcareous spar, the general action of the spar is to polarise a part
                    of the ray in a plane perpendicular to that of reflection, and thus to produce
                    <hi rend="italic">by reflection the very same effect that other surfaces do by
                    refraction.</hi></p>
                <p>“On the face of calcareous spar, perpendicular to the axis of the crystal, the
                    effect is exactly the same in all azimuths; but in every other face the effect
                    varies in different azimuths, and depends upon the inclination of the face to
                    the axis of double refraction. On the natural face of the rhomb common light is
                    polarised <hi rend="italic">in the plane</hi> of reflection, in 0° of azimuth,
                    or in the plane of the principal section; but at 38° of azimuth, the whole
                    pencil is polarised at right angles to the plane of reflection; and in other
                    azimuths the effect is nearly the same as I have stated in my printed paper.
                    «</p>
                <p>“In order, however, to observe the change which is actually produced upon light,
                    it is necessary to use two pencils, one polarised + 45°, and the other — 45°, to
                    the plane of incidence. The planes of polarisation of these pencils are inclined
                    90° to each other, and the invariable effect of the <hi rend="italic">new</hi>
                    force is to augment that angle in the same manner as is done by a refracting
                    surface, while the tendency of the ordinary reflective force is to diminish the
                    same angle. Hence I was led to make an experiment in which these opposite forces
                    might compensate one another. I mixed oil of olives and oil of cassia, till I
                    obtained a compound of such a refractive power that its action in bringing
                    together the planes of polarisation should be equal to the action of the new
                    force in separating them. Upon reflecting the compound pencil from this surface,
                    I was delighted to find that the inclination of the planes was still 90°, and I
                    thus obtained the extraordinary result of a reflecting surface which possessed
                    no action whatever upon common or upon polarised light.</p>
                <p>“The action of the new force when the plane of reflection coincides with the
                    principal section of the crystal isobvi-ously inexplicable by any theory of
                    light, though I have no doubt that the undulatory theory may ultimately
                    accommodate itself to this as well as to other classes of phenomena which it
                    does not at present embrace. The difficulty, however, is increased by another
                    result of my experiments, which it is important to notice. On the faces of the
                    spar which are inclined 0°, 45°, 90°, to the axis of double refraction, the
                    action of the new force is symmetrical upon the two pencils of polarised light
                    whose planes are inclined -f- 45° and — 45° to the plane of incidence; whereas
                    in all intermediate faces, whose inclination to the axes is 22∣ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0</hi> and 67½°, the plane of one of the polarised rays
                    remains stationary, while that of the other is turned round 15°.</p>
                <p>“Thiseffect isundoubtedly a very extraordinary one, and indicates some singular
                    structure in calcareous spar, the nature of which it is not easy to
                    conjecture.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194563326" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3326-0497"/>
                <p>“1 have examined taese phenomena by using, in place of oil of cassia, various
                    fluids whose refractive powers descend gradually to that of water; but it would
                    be a waste of time to give any detailed account of them at present. I shall only
                    state, that the action of the new force becomes weaker and weaker as the force
                    of ordinary reflection is increased, by diminishing the refractive power of the
                    oil which is placed in contact with the spar. with an oil of the highest
                    refractive index, the action of the new force predominates over the feeble power
                    of the ordinary force of reflection. With an oil of a lower index the two forces
                    exactly balance each other; while with oils of still lower indices of
                    refraction, the ordinary force overcomes and conceals the action of the new
                    one.</p>
                <p>“Although I have obtained pretty accurate measures of the amount of the
                    deviations produced by the new force, on eight surfaces, differently inclined to
                    the axis, and in various azimuths on these surfaces, yet many experiments are
                    still necessary before we can hope to discover the physical law of the
                    phenomena; and if this should be done, 1 have no doubt that Mr Maccullagh will
                    be equally successful in the higher attempt of accounting for them by some
                    modification of the undulatory theory.”</p>

                <p>“In studying the interferences of polarised rays, Μ. Arago and I found that they
                    no longer exercise any influence upon one another when their planes of
                    polarisation are perpendicular to each other; that is, that they cannot then
                    produce fringes, although all the necessary conditions for their appearance in
                    ordinary cases be scrupulously fulfilled. I shall describe the three principal
                    experiments which illustrate this fact, beginning with that which belongs to Μ.
                    Arago. It consists in making two pencils, emanating from the same luminous
                    point, and introduced by two parallel slits, traverse two piles of very thin
                    transparent plates, such as those of mica or blown-glass, which are sufficiently
                    inclined to each other to polarise almost completely each of the two pencils,
                    taking care that the two planes are perpendicularly inclined to each other. In
                    this case no fringes can be perceived, whatever care may have been taken thus to
                    compensate the differences of both in varying very gently the inclination of one
                    of the piles; but when the planes of incidence of the piles are no longer
                    perpendicular to each other, they always cause the fringes to appear, ln
                    proportion as the planes cease to be parallel, the fringes become weaker, and
                    they disappear altogether when they are rectangular, provided the polarisation
                    of the two pencils has been sufficiently complete. It results from these
                    experiments, that rays polarised in the same plane influence one another, like
                    the rays of light not modified; but this influence diminishes in proportion as
                    the planes of polarisation deviate from one another, and becomes nothing when
                    they are rectangular.</p>
                <p>The following is another experiment which leads to the same results. Take a plate
                    of sulphate of lime or of rock-crystal parallel to its axis, and of a uniform
                    thickness; cut it in two, and place each of the halves upon one of the slits of
                    the screen. I suppose that we have turned the two halves in such a way that the
                    edges which were in contact before the division of the plate are parallel, and
                    the axes will also be parallel. But, in this case, we only perceive a smgle
                    group of fringes in the middle of the bright space as it was before the division
                    of the plates. But, if we turn one of these halves in its plane, thus disturbing
                    the parallelism of their axes, we make two other groups of fainter fringes
                    spring up, situated one on the right, and the other on the left of the group in
                    the middle, and which are completely separated from it, in the white light when
                    the plates of rock-crystal or of sulphate of lime which are used, are only a
                    millimetre thick. It is to be remarked, that the number and breadth of the
                    fringes lying between the middle of one of these groups and the central group,
                    is proportional to the thickness of the plates for crystals of the same kind, or
                    whose double refraction is of the same strength, like rock-crystal and sulphate
                    of lime. In proportion as the angle of the two axes increases, these new groups
                    of fringes become more and more distinct, and attain at last their maximum
                    intensity when the axes of the two plates are perpendicular to each other. In
                    this position, the central group, which had been gradually weakened, altogether
                    disappeared, and is replaced by a uniform light. From this we may conclude, that
                    the rays which produce them, by their interference, are no longer capable of
                    influencing one another.</p>
                <p>From the position of these fringes, it is easy to see that they result from the
                    interference of the rays, which have undergone the same kind of refraction in
                    the two plates, since, having travelled with equal velocities, they ought to
                    arrive simultaneously at the middle of the bright space which corresponds to the
                    equal routes, if as we suppose the two plates have the same thickness, and
                    always continue perpendicular to the rays. Hence, the fringes of the central
                    groups were formed by the superposition of those which arise—1. From the
                    interference of the <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> rays of the <hi
                    rend="italic">left</hi> plate with the <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> ray of
                    the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> plate; 2. From the interference of the <hi
                    rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> rays of the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> plate
                    with the <hi rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> rays of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >second.</hi> The two eccentric groups, on the contrary, arise from the
                    interference of the rays which have undergone different refractions in the two
                    plates; and as it is the <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> rays which move with
                    the greatest velocity in <hi rend="italic">sulphate of lime</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">rock-crystal,</hi> we see that, if we employ one of these two
                    species of crystals, the <hi rend="italic">left</hi> group ought to be formed by
                    the union of the <hi rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> rays of the <hi
                    rend="italic">left</hi> plate with the <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> rays of
                    the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> plate, and the <hi rend="italic">right</hi>
                    group by the union of the <hi rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> rays of the <hi
                    rend="italic">right</hi> plate with the <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> rays of
                    the <hi rend="italic">left</hi> plate. This being established, it remains now to
                    determine the direction of polarization in each of the pencils which interfere,
                    in order that we may deduce from it what are the relative directions of the
                    planes of polarization which favour or hinder their mutual influence. Analogy
                    shews that the mode of the polarization of light ought to be the same as in the
                    small plates in crystals thick enough to divide it into two distinct pencils.
                    But as this hypothesis might perhaps be an object of discussion, and contradict
                    an ingenious theory of one of our most celebrated philosophers, we shall not
                    present it at first as a certain principle, and we shall have recourse to a
                    direct experiment to determine the planes of polarisation, both of the ordinary
                    and extraordinary rays which emerge from these plates, which we suppose to be
                    one or two millimetres thick. This thickness is sufficient to allow us to cut
                    one of their edges obliquely, and obtain by this prismatic form the separation
                    of the ordinary and extraordinary rays. We then find that they are effectually
                    polarised, the first in the principal section, and the others in a perpendicular
                    direction. If we are not sufficiently convinced that this is their manner of
                    polarisation in emerg∙∙</p>

                <p>ing from each plate when these two surfaces are parallel, we shall find a new
                    demonstration of this in the facts that we are about to describe, setting out
                    from the principles established by the experiments <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Μ.
                    Arago, and which are besides confirmed by others, of which we are going to
                    speak. If, on the contrary, we no longer question the direction of the
                    polarisation of the ordinary and extraordinary rays, actual experiment will
                    afford us a second demonstration of these principles. When the axes, indeed, of
                    the two plates were parallel, the rays which had experienced the same
                    refractions in the two crystals were found polarised in the same direction, and
                    those of contrary colours in rectangular directions. It is thus that the group
                    of fringes in the middle which proceed from the interference of rays of the same
                    name, had a maximum intensity, and the two others, which resulted from the
                    interference of the rays of contrary names, did not appear again. But when the
                    axes of the two plates formed an oblique angle, of 45° for instance, the rays of
                    a contrary name, and those of the same name, could act at the same time one upon
                    the other, since their polarising planes were no longer rectangular, and the
                    three groups of fringes were produced. When, in short, the axes became
                    perpendicular to one another, the rays of the same colour were polarised in
                    rectangular directions, and the central group, to which it had given birth,
                    vanished, while the <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> rays of the <hi
                    rend="italic">left</hi> plate were then polarised <hi rend="italic"
                    >parallel</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> rays of the <hi
                    rend="italic">right</hi> plate, and this is the cause why the right group which
                    they produce attained its maximum intensity. It is the same with the <hi
                    rend="italic">left</hi> group, arising from the interference of the <hi
                    rend="italic">ordinary</hi> rays of the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> plate with
                    the <hi rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> rays of the <hi rend="italic">left</hi>
                    plate.</p>
                <p>The following is a <hi rend="italic">third</hi> experiment, which entirely
                    confirms the results which we have drawn from the first. Having polished a rhomb
                    of calcareous spar upon two opposite faces, wrought with care so as to be quite
                    parallel, I sawed it perpendicularly to these faces, and I obtained in this
                    manner two rhombs of equal thickness, and in which the routes of the ordinary
                    and extraordinary rays were exactly parallel at the same incidence. I placed
                    them one before the other, so that the rays proceeding from the luminous point
                    which had traversed the first rhomb passed through the second, taking care that
                    their faces were perpendicular to the direction of the incident rays; moreover,
                    the principal section of the second rhomb was perpendicular to that of the
                    first, in such a manner that the four pencils which they produced were in
                    general reduced to two; the ordinary pencil of the first rhomb was refracted
                    extraordinarily in the second, and the extraordinary pencil of the first was
                    refracted ordinarily in the second. From this arrangement it followed, that the
                    difference of the route, proceeding from the difference of velocity of the
                    ordinary and extraordinary rays, was found compensated for by the two emerging
                    pencils. They crossed each other, too, at a very small angle, and such that the
                    fringes ought to have had a magnitude much more than sufficient to be seen; and,
                    notwithstanding, though the necessary conditions for the production of the
                    fringes, in ordinary circumstances, were carefully observed, I never could
                    succeed in making them appear.</p>
                <p>While I was searching for them with care, holding a magnifying-glass to my eye, I
                    gently varied the direction of one of the rhombs, sometimes to the right,
                    sometimes to the left, in order to compensate the effect resulting from any
                    difference of thickness that might have existed; but in spite of this trial,
                    repeated a great many times, I never could perceive any fringes; and this is not
                    surprising, after what the other experiments have taught us, since the two
                    pencils emerged polarised at right angles to each other. But what proves that
                    the absence of fringes does not depend upon the difficulty of arriving by trials
                    at an exact compensation is, that I easily succeeded in making them appear by
                    employing the light which had been polarised before it entered the rhombs, and
                    in causing it to receive a new polarisation after its emergence. It is, then,
                    completely demonstrable from the experiments which I have described, <hi
                    rend="italic">that rays polarised at right angles cannot exert any sensible
                    influence upon one another</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> or in other words, that
                    their union always produced the same intensity of light, whatever may be the
                    difference of route of the two pencils which interfere.</p>
                <p>Another remarkable fact is, that when they have been once polarised in
                    rectangular directions, it is not sufficient that they are brought back to a
                    common plane of polarization, in order that they may give apparent signs of
                    their mutual influence. If in the experiment of Μ. Arago, indeed, or that which
                    I have described, we cause the rays which have emerged from the two slits, and
                    which are polarized atrightangles, to pass through a pile of inclined platesof
                    plane glass, no fringes were perceived, in whatever direction its ray of
                    incidence was turned. Instead of a pile, we may employa rhomb of calcareous
                    spar, if we incincitsprincipal section at 45° to the plane of polarisation of
                    the incident pencils, so that it divides into two equal parts the angle which
                    they make with each other, each image will contain the half of each pencil, and
                    these two halves having the same plane of polarisation in the same image, ought
                    to produce fringes there, if it is sufficient to bring back the rays to a plane
                    of common polarisation, to re-establish the apparent effects of their mutual
                    influence. But the fringes can never be obtained by this method, as long as the
                    rays have not been polarised in the same plane, before they were divided into
                    two pencils polarised at right angles.</p>
                <p>When the light has experienced this previous polarisation, on the contrary, the
                    interposition of the rhomb makes the fringes reappear. The most advantageous
                    direction to give the primitive plane of polarisation, is that which divides
                    into two equal parts the angle of the rectangular planes, in which the two
                    pencils are polarised in the second instance, because then the incident light is
                    equally divided between them. Suppose, in order to fix our ideas, that the
                    primitive plane of polarisation is horizontal, it will be necessary that the
                    planes of polarisation impressed upon each of the two pencils, is inclined 45°
                    to the horizontal plane, the one above it and the other below it, in such a <hi
                    rend="underline">man</hi>- ner that they remain perpendicular. We can obtain
                    this rectangular polarisation either with the help of the two little piles
                    employed in the experiment of Μ. Arago, or with two plates whose axes are
                    rectangular axes, or, finally, with a single crystallized plate: We shall only
                    consider this last case, the two others presenting phenomena precisely
                    similar.</p>
                <p>To divide the light into two pencils, which cross under a small angle, and which
                    may thus produce fringes, the apparatus of two mirrors is generally better than
                    the screen pierced by two slits, because it produces more brilliant fringes. It
                    has, besides, the advantage of giving immediately to the two pencils the
                    previous polarisation necessary to our experiment; it is sufficient for this
                    purpose that the two mirrors should be of glass not tinned, and inclined 35° to
                    the incident rays; care must be taken to blacken them behind, to destroy the
                    second reflection. We place near them, in the line of the reflected rays, and
                    perpendicularly to their direction, a plate of sulphate of lime or of
                    rock-crystal parallel to the axis, and one or two millimetres thick, inclining
                    its principal section 45° to the plane of primitive polarisation, which we have
                    supposed horizontal. The apparatus beingthus placed, we only see a single group
                    of fringes across the plate as before its interposition, and it occupies the
                    same place. But if we put before the magnifying-glass, a pile of glass plates,
                    inclined in a horizontal or vertical direction, we dis <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194563352" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3352-0499"/>cover on each side of the
                    central group another group of fringes, which is the more distant as the
                    crystallized plate is thicker. If we replace the pile of plates by a rhomb of
                    calcareous spar, whose principal section is divided horizontally or vertically,
                    we shall see in each of the two images which it produces, the two systems of
                    additional fringes which the interposition of the pile of plates has caused to
                    appear; and it deserves to be remarked, that these two images are complementary
                    to one another; that is to say, that the obscure bands of the one correspond to
                    the briiiiant bands of the other.</p>
                <p>We see in this experiment a new confirmation of the principles demonstrated by
                    the preceding ones. The rays which have experienced the refractions of opposite
                    names, cannot influence each other, because, in emerging from the same plate in
                    the case we arc now considering, they are found polarised in rectangular
                    directions; consequently the groups to the right and the left cannot exist, at
                    least while we have not re-established the mutual influence of those rays by
                    bringing them to a common plane of polarisation; this is what is effected by the
                    interposition of the pile of plates or of the rhomb. The fringes thus produced
                    are the more distinct, as the two pencils of contrary names which concur in
                    their formation are more equal in intensity; and this is the reason why the
                    direction of the principal section of the rhomb, which makes an angle of 45°
                    with the axis of the plate, is the most favourable to the appearance of the
                    fringes. When the principal section of the rhomb is parallel or perpendicular to
                    that of the plate, the rays refracted ordinarily by the plate pass entirely into
                    one image, instead of being divided between the two, and all the extraordinary
                    rays pass into the other image, so that there can be no more interference
                    between them; and the additional groups of fringes disappear, each image
                    presenting only the fringes which resulted from the interference of the rays of
                    the same name, that is to say, those which compose the central group.</p>
                <p>These two groups of additional fringes which polarized light exhibited in the
                    first position of the rhomb, afford one of the most exact methods of measuring
                    double refraction and of studying its law. Their eccentric position, indeed,
                    depends on the difference of route of the ordinary and extraordinary rays which
                    emerge from the plate; and we can judge of the number of undulations by which
                    the extraordinary rays of the right pencil remain behind the ordinary rays of
                    the left one, by the number and width of the fringes comprised between the
                    middle of the right group, and that of the central group. We may determine this
                    difference of route still better, by measuring the interval between the middle
                    of the two extreme groups, which is the double of their distance from the middle
                    of the central group. White light is best suited for this kind of observations,
                    because it is brightest, and renders the central band of each group easier to be
                    observed. By comparing the thickness of the plate with the difference of the
                    observed route, we may deduce from it the ratio of the velocities of the
                    ordinary and extraordinary rays.”</p>

                    and by turning round the analysing plate, we shall see the complementary set, as
                    in fig. 31, these rings will be seen as if they were in the substance of the

                    cover up a corresponding part of the system of rings. The axis of the system or
                    of double refraction is here fixed in the axis of the cylinder, and does not lie
                    in every direction parallel to that axis, as in regularly crystallized

                <p>If a well annealed parallelopiped of glass EFCD, fig. 80, is submitted to the
                    processes already described, or even if we lay one edge of it CD on a piece of
                    iron almost red hot, and place the whole between the polarizing and analyzing
                    plates, so that if the heated edge CD is inclined 45° to the planes of primitive
                    polarization, and the eye can see the whole surface of the glass, a series of
                    remarkable phenomena will be produced. The moment the heat enters the lower
                    surface at CD, fringes of brilliant colours are seen above CD, and almost at the
                    same instant, before the heat has reached the upper surface EF, or even the

                    are separated from those at the edges by two dark lines or planes MN, OP,

                <p>If we combine any two plates of the same shape, the resulting system of fringes
                    will be equal to the sum of their systems or effects, if the plates are of the

                    rend="italic">negative,</hi> or to the difference of their effects, if they are
                    of different names. When the plates are solids or symmetrical forms, such as
                    cylinders, cubes, or quadrangular plates, no essential variation of figure is
                    produced by the combination; but when the plates are rectangular, very
                    interesting phenomena are exhibited when plates of the same or of different
                    names are crossed rectangularly. Sir David Brewster has given for-mnlae for
                    calculating the forms of the compound or isochromatic curves, as he calls them,
                    but our space will only permit us to exhibit the effects to the eye.</p>
                <p>When equal rectangular plates of <hi rend="italic">similar names,</hi> that is,
                    both negative or both positive, are crossed, the phenomena of the <hi

                <p>When the plates are of <hi rend="italic">different names,</hi> and of different
                    breadths, but containing the same number of fringes, the isochromatic curves

                    subdividing plates of glass under the influence of heat or cold.</hi></p>
                <p>If we alter the shape of any of the plates above described, the form of the
                    isochromatic curves is immediately changed. If we cut any rectangular plate into
                    two by a line passing through its middle, each of the two plates thus produced
                    has the property of the whole plate, though the fringes are less numerous. If a
                    plate A BCD gives the tints shewn in fig. 86, OP and MN being the dark neutral
                    lines; then if we cut it with a diamond at <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> so as to
                    subdivide it into two plates, as in fig. 87, each of the plates EFrs, GHrs, will
                    have the same structure as ABCD, viz. two neutral lines <hi rend="italic">op,

                <p>Art. II. <hi rend="italic">On the Permanent Influence of Rapid Cooling.</hi></p>
                <p>In March 1814, Sir David Brewster found that glass melted and suddenly cooled, as
                    in the case of Prince Rupert’s drops, possessed a permanently doubly refracting
                    power, and he communicated this fact in a letter to Sir Joseph Banks, dated
                    April 8. 1814; and without knowing that Dr Seebeck had published in December
                    1814 similar results with cubes of glass, our author had discovered that cubes,
                    cylinders, plates, spheres, and spheroids of glass, exhibiting permanently the
                    phenomenadescribed in theprecedingpages, may be formed by bringing them to a red
                    heat, and cooling them rapidly and equally on their edges. A great variety of
                    beautiful optical figures, developed in polarised light, may thus be obtained by
                    cooling the glass on metallic patterns. A very simple effect of this is shewn in
                    fig. 88, where the plate of glass was cooled by resting it at its centre on a
                    cylinder of iron.</p>

                    and Dilatation.</hi></p>
                <p>The effects of compression and dilatation in producing double refraction were
                    discovered by Sir David Brewster, and communicated to the Royal Society in 1815.
                    Our limits will permit us to only give a slight notice of them.</p>
                <p>The phenomena both of compression and dilatation or extension may be well seen by
                    bending, merely with the force of the hands, a square rod, or a long and narrow
                    plate of glass, as in fig. 89. When it is held between the polarising and
                    analysing plate, eight or ten inches from the latter, with its edge AB inclined
                    45° to the plane of primitive polarisation, the whole thickness of the glass
                    will be covered with two series of coloured fringes, like those in the figure
                    separated by a dark neutral line MN, where there is neither compression nor
                    dilatation. The fringes on the convex side are <hi rend="italic">negative,</hi>
                    being produced by the <hi rend="italic">extension</hi> of the glass in the
                    direction <hi rend="italic">m A, m</hi> B, while those on the concave side are
                    produced by the <hi rend="italic">compression</hi> of the glass in the
                    directions C <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> D <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> The iso ∙
                    chromatic curves marked by similar figures, indicating the orders of the

                <p>When a plate of bent glass producing fringes crosses another at right angles, the
                    effect at the intersectional space is shewn in fig. 90, where the tint is
                    supposed only to be the white of the first order.</p>
                <p>When a plate of bent glass is crossed with a plate crystallized by heat, the
                    fringes in the intersectional square will be <hi rend="italic">parabolas,</hi>
                    as shewn in fig. 91, whose vertex will be towards the <hi rend="italic"

                    cavities in the diamond, in glass, and in various gums, arise from the gradual
                    induration of the mass, combined with the elastic pressure of the air included
                    in the cavities: They are therefore not properly cases of induration alone.</p>

                <p>A sphere of transparent jelly or isinglass, when allowed to indurate gradually,
                    will have an axis of double refraction in every direction, like a sphere of

                <p>CHAP. II. ON CIRCULAR POLARISATION.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Circular Polarisation in Rock-crystal and Amethyst.</hi></p>
                <p>The general phenomena of circular polarisation were discovered by Μ. Arago in
                    1811. He found that in plates of rock-crystal, the colours polarised along its
                    axis were different from those which he had studied in plates of other
                    crystallised bodies. When they were analysed by a prism of Iceland spar, he
                    found that the two images had complementary colours in the ordinary tints, but,
                    what was remarkable, they descended in Newton’s scale as the prism revolved, so
                    that if the tint of the extraordinary image was <hi rend="italic">red,</hi> it
                    became in succession <hi rend="italic">orange, yellow, green,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">blue.</hi> Hence he concluded that the differently coloured rays
                    had been polarised in different planes in passing along the axis of the
                    rock-crystal.</p>
                <p>Μ. Biot took up the subject at this point, and investigated it with his usual
                    ingenuity and success. He found that while in <hi rend="italic">some</hi>
                    crystals of quartz the tints descended in the scale of colours, by turning the
                    analysing prism from <hi rend="italic">right</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                    >left,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">others</hi> they descended m the scale by
                    turning the prism from <hi rend="italic">left</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                    >right.</hi> The one he called left-handed quartz, and the other right-handed
                    quartz. He took a plate of quartz, for example, <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> ⅛th
                    of an inch thick, and having polarised the homogeneous colours of the spectrum,
                    be transmitted them in succession along the axis of this plate, and obtained the
                    following <pb break="no" facs="nls:194563391" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3391-0502"

                    >red</hi> light polarised by the plate was a maximum. When the analysing plate
                    was turned from right to left, the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> tint gradually
                    diminished, and after a rotation of 17⅛°, itwholly vanished. With a plate
                    2-25ths of an inch thick, the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> tint did not vanish
                    till after a rotation of 35°, and so on, every additional 25th of an inch of
                    rock crystal requiring an additional rotation of 17⅜ to make the tint vanish. A
                    whole inch of quartz, for example, would require 25 × 17⅛° =437½°, or one whole
                    turn, and 77⅜° more to cause the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> tint to vanish. It
                    is obvious that twenty-five plates of quartz, 1 -25th of an inch thick, would
                    produce the same effect as <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> one inch of it.</p>
                <p>When <hi rend="italic">right-handed</hi> plates, however, are combined with <hi
                    rend="italic">left-handed</hi> ones, the rotation produced is equal to the
                    difference of their actions; thus a plate of left-handed quartz 1-25th of an
                    inch, combined with a plate 2-25ths of an inch, would produce a rotation of only
                    17⅛°. The following table contains the rotations produced upon the other

                <p>Μ. Biot conceived that this property of quartz belonged to its ultimate
                    molecules, but Sir David Brewster proved that this was not the case, by shewing
                    that heat deprived quartz of the property of circular polarisation; and Sir John
                    Herschel’s beautiful discovery, that it was connected with the crystallisation
                    of the mineral, put this result beyond a doubt. He found that those crystals in
                    which the plagiedral faces described by Haily, went round the crystal from <hi
                    rend="italic">right to left,</hi> exhibited the optical properties of
                    left-handed crystals, and those crystals in which the plagiedral faces leant
                    round the crystals from <hi rend="italic">left to right,</hi> had the properties
                    of right-handed crystals. Hence he concluded <hi rend="italic">that whatever be
                    the cause which determined the direction of rotation, the same law acted in
                    determining the direction of the plagiedral faces.</hi></p>
                <p>When Sir David Brewster discovered the system of rings in quartz, he found the
                    tints of circular polarisation occupying, as might have been expected, the inner
                    circle of the rings as shewn in fig. 94, only small portions of the black cross
                    being visible; but these black portions were larger as the plate became
                    thinner.</p>
                <p>In examining the structure and properties of the amethyst, Sir David Brewster
                    found that this singular mineral was actually composed of the two different
                    kinds of quartz, viz., the <hi rend="italic">right-handed</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">left-handed.</hi> These two kinds of quartz are arranged in veins,
                    as represented in figs.; 95, 96. In fig. 95, the shaded veins which correspond
                    to each alternate face of the pyramid turns the planes of polarisation from <hi
                    rend="italic">right</hi> to <hi rend="italic">left,</hi> while all the rest of
                    the crystal turns the same planes from <hi rend="italic">left</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">right;</hi> and what is very interesting, the black lines where
                    these two structures unite have no action whatever on the planes of
                    polarisation. In some specimens these opposite veins are so very minute, that
                    they destroy each other’s action upon the polarised ray, and when this happens,
                    the single system of rings appears with its black cross, and entirely free of
                    any of the tints of circular polarisation. The colouring matter of the amethyst
                    is arranged in a very singular manner in relation to these veins; and the
                    fracture across the veins exhibits a beautiful, and sometimes a regular rippled
                    structure, rese mbling the engine-turning of a watch, and affords an infallible
                    mineralogical character of the amethyst, whether its colour is <hi
                    rend="subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">yellow, orange, olive, green,
                    blue,</hi> or perfectly colourless.</p>
                <p>The general structure of well crystallised amethysts is shewn in fig. 96, which
                    is of the natural size, and is taken from one of the finest specimens that Sir
                    David Brewster met with. « On the three alternate sides of the prism,” says he,
                    “viz., MN, OP, and QR, are placed sectors McN, OdP, QαR, which are divided into
                    two parts by dark lines <hi rend="italic">cd, eld, aa',</hi> which separate the
                    direct structures of A, C, and E from the retrograde structures of B, D, and F.
                    On the other three alternate faces of the prisms are placed the three veined
                    sectors McδaR, NcòcfO, and Pc‰zQ, which meet at <hi rend="italic">b</hi> in
                    angles of 120°, and consist of veins of opposite structure, alternating with
                    each other, and so minute, that in many places the circular tints are almost
                    wholly extinguished by their mutual action. The direct sectors A, C, and E, are
                    all connected together by the three radial veins <hi rend="italic">bα, be,
                    bd,</hi> and are therefore to be considered as the expanded terminations of
                    these veins. The retrograde sectors B, D, and F, are expansions of the first
                    retrograde veins next to <hi rend="italic">l&gt;clc, dba,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">abc,</hi> and the lines <hi rend="italic">cc', dd',</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">aα',</hi> are continuations of the dark or neutral lines which
                    separate the first retrograde vein from the direct radial veins.</p>
                <p>“All the sectors A, B, C, D, E, and F, are of <hi rend="italic">a. yellowish
                    brrnvn</hi> colour, and all the rest of the crystal is of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >pale lilac</hi> colour, the lilac tints being arranged in the manner previously
                    described. The phenomena which I have now mentioned as existing in this specimen
                    are very common in the amethyst; and I have never yet found a specimen in which
                    the yellow tints were not confined to those portions which formed the expanded
                    terminations of veins; a fact which indicates that this would have been the
                    colour of the crystal, whether its action were direct or retrograde, and that
                    the lilac colour affects in general those portions which are composed of
                    opposite veins.”</p>
                <p>The subject of circular polarisation received great accessions from the genius of
                    Μ. Fresnel. He conceived thata ray passing along the axis of quartz should be
                    refracted in two pencils, and he ascertained this to be the case by the
                    following experiment. He took a prism ACB of <hi rend="italic">right-handed</hi>
                    quartz, having its faces AC, BC, equally inclined to its axis AB, so that a ray
                    PV should be incident at angles of 75° on either face. As a ray, however,
                    refracted at R, would not emerge at all from the other side CB, he took another
                    similar prism, but from a crystal of <hi rend="italic">left-handed</hi> quartz,
                    and having cut it into two halves, he placed these two halves ACD, BCE, as in
                    the figure, so that he had an achromatic combination of three prisms. Now a ray
                    PQ incident perpendicularly at Q, should pass straight on without deviation, or
                    double refraction, if quartz were like other uniaxal crystals. But if the pencil
                    PQ suffer any double refraction at Q, this double refraction will be doubled at
                    R, because ABC has an opposite kind of double refraction. The same effect takes
                    place at C, so that the ray PQ at its emergence at T, ought to have a very
                    sensible double refraction, even if that at Q was very small. Now Μ.
                    Fresnelfoundthatthisdouble refraction actually existed, but upon examining the
                    image he found thatthey had suffered«/te?« <hi rend="italic">kind of double
                    refrewtionì</hi> and acquired new properties. In place oftheir being polarised
                    in opposite planes, like other doubly refracted pencils, which, when examined
                    with a doubly refracting prism, give two unequal images, alternating in
                    brightness during the revolution of the spar prism, they exhibit the following
                    properties:—</p>
                <p>1. Either of the quartz rays, when examined with a spar prism, gave two images of
                    equal intensity in every position <pb break="no" facs="nls:194563404"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-3404-0503"/><hi rend="italic">of</hi> the prism. Hence they
                    resemble unpolarised light, as if they consisted of two rectangularly polarised
                    rays.</p>
                <p>2. They differ from unpolarised light in having the following remarkable and
                    characteristic property. If either of them are incident at right angles, as
                    shewn at RP, fig. 160, upon the face AB of a parallelepiped of crown glass,
                    having its refracting index 1∙5l, and its angles ABC and ADC 54½°, it will
                    suffer two total reflexions at Q and S, emerging perpendicularly from the
                    surface DC in the direction ST. Now this ray ST is found to be completely
                    polarised in a plane inclined 45° to the plane of its reflexions, whatever may
                    be the position of that plane. If the other ray is incident at <hi rend="italic"
                    >rp,</hi> and is reflected at <hi rend="italic">q</hi> and s, so as to emerge in
                    the direction <hi rend="italic">st,</hi> the one ray ST will be polarised in a
                    plane 45° to the <hi rend="italic">right,</hi> and the other <hi rend="italic"
                    >st</hi> 45° to the <hi rend="italic">left</hi> of the plane of reflexion. Hence
                    they emerge when superimposed in a state of common light. The two rays RP, <hi
                    rend="italic">rp,</hi> are said to be <hi rend="italic">circularly
                    polarised</hi></p>
                <p>3. If a ray thus circularly polarised is transmitted through a thin crystallized
                    plate, and parallel to its axis, it is divided by double refraction into two
                    rays of complementary tints, thus shewing a decided difference from a ray of
                    common light; and these complementary colours always differ from those that are
                    produced from light, polarised and analysed in the usual way, by an exact
                    quarter of a tint either in defect or in excess -</p>
                <p>4. A circularly polarised ray transmitted again along the axis of rock crystal,
                    and subsequently analysed, produces, like common light, no colours", and differs
                    in this respect from polarised light.</p>
                <p>As two circularly polarised rays RP, <hi rend="italic">rp,</hi> emerge from <hi
                    rend="italic">Fresnel’s rhomb,</hi> (as the parallelepiped of glass ABCD, fig.
                    160, has been called), in rays ST, <hi rend="italic">st,</hi> polarised +45° to
                    the plane of reflection, it occurred to Fresnel, and he found it to be so, that
                    a ray TS polarised 45° to the plane of reflexion in the rhomb, would emerge in
                    the direction PR, as a circularly polarised ray, possessing all the properties
                    of one of the rays formed along the axis of quartz.</p>
                <p>In an extensive series of experiments, of which we shall give some account in the
                    following chapter, Sir David Brewster had occasion to examine some of the
                    kindred phenomena of circular polarisation. His first experiments on this
                    subject preceded those of Fresnel. He found that total reflexion produced
                    polarised tints analogous to those of crystallised laminae, and he supposed that
                    these colours were produced by the interference of two portions of light, the
                    one partially reflected in the first instance, and the other beginning to be
                    refracted, and caused to return, by the continued operation of the same
                    power.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                    >Trans.</hi> 1830, p. 310.</p></note> In continuing his experiments, he found
                    that the colours produced by total reflexion did not rise in the scale by
                    successive reflexions; and at the end of 1816, he announced in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal</hi> of the Royal Institution,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Vol. iii. p∙ 213.</p></note> that he had
                    discovered “a new species of moveable polarisation, in which the complementary
                    tints never rise above the white (the bluish white) of the first order, by the
                    successive application of the polarising influence,” &amp;c. He determined
                    experimentally the angles at which this tint was successively produced and
                    destroyed, and thus discovered some of the leading properties of total
                    reflexion. It was Fresnel, however, that discovered this new species of
                    polarisation to be circular, and made those other splendid discoveries which we
                    have just detailed. We owe to Sir David Brewster, however, the discovery of the
                    inversion of the spectrum in the phenomena of total reflexion, of which we shall
                    give some account in the next chapter.</p>
                <p>In giving the name of circular polarisation to that which is impressed on the two
                    rays along the axis of quartz, Μ. Fresnel was guided by theoretical
                    considerations. Mr. Airy has, however, taken a different view of the condition
                    of the light forming these two rays in quartz, and has been led to results of
                    very high interest. The following are the experiments, which we shall give in
                    his own words, on which he founded his deductions. They were made with a
                    Fresnel’s rhomb, fitted up as in the annexed figure, where the rhomb is shewn at
                    rr.</p>
                <p>“1. If Fresnel’s rhomb, mounted as in the annexed figure,be placed to receive the
                    polarised light, so that the plane ofreflex-ion passes through the divisions 45°
                    and 225°, the calc spar will present another appearance 97. The rings are
                    abruptly and absolutely dislocated: those in the upper right hand quadrant and
                    the quadrant opposite to it, are pushed from the centre by one-fourth of an
                    interval, and those in the other quadrants are drawn nearer to the centre by the
                    same quality. The line separating the quadrants is nowhere black; the intensity
                    of its light is uniform, and about equal to the mean intensity. If the plane of
                    incidence pass through 135° and 315°, the phenomena of adjacent quadrants are
                    exactly interchanged. No alteration is made by turning the analysing plate round
                    the incident ray; the lines dividing the quadrants are always parallel and
                    perpendicular to the plane of reflexion at the analysing plate.</p>
                <p>“2. If the plane of reflexion in the rhomb pass through 0° and 180°, or through
                    90° and 360°, the phenomena are precisely the same, and undergo the same changes
                    as those in ordinary rings. If while the plates are crossed, the rhomb be turned
                    gradually from the position 0° towards 45°, the rings are gradually changed, at
                    first becoming (as far as the eye can judge) elliptical, and then assuming the
                    form represented in fig. 98.</p>
                <p>“3. If a plate of quartz, whether right or left handed, be interposed between the
                    crossed plates, a set of rings is seen like those in fig. 94. As far as the eye
                    can judge, the rings are exactly circular, but there is no black cross, and the
                    central tint is not black, but removed from it by a number of tints in Newton’s
                    scale proportional to the thickness of the quartz. Thus with a thickness of 0∙48
                    inch, the central tint is pale pink; with a thickness 0∙38 inch, the central
                    tint is bright yellowish green; with thickness 0∙26 inch it is a rich red plum
                    colour; with thickness 0∙ 17 inch, it is a rich yellow.</p>
                <p>“The colours then appear to be nearly the same, beginning from the centre, as in
                    Newton’s scale, beginning with the tint representing this central tint. At a
                    considerable distance from the centre, four dark brushes begin to be visible, in
                    the same directions as the arms of the black cross in calc spar.</p>
                <p>“4. Now, (supposing the crystal right handed), if the plate of quartz be thin,
                    and the analysing plate be turned, the upper part towards the observer’s left
                    hand, a bluish short-armed cross appears in the centre, which, on turning
                    further, becomes yellow, and the rings are enlarged. On turning still further,
                    the cross breaks into four dots. The rings are no longer circular, but of a form
                    intermediate between a circle and a square, their diagonals (as well as the
                    cross) being inclined to the left of the parallel, and perpendicular to the
                    plane of reflexion. See fig. 99∙ If the analysing plate be turned the other way,
                    there is no cross; the form of the rings is changed from circular nearly as in
                    the former case.</p>
                <p>“5. If the plate of quartz be thick, the dilatation, and the rings, and the
                    change of form are all the perceptible phenomena<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194563417" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3417-0504"/>. And on turning the
                    analysing plate continually to the left, the rings continually dilate, and new
                    spots start up continually in the centre, and become rings. If the crystal be
                    left handed, the remarks in this and the last article apply equally well,
                    supposing the analysing plate turned in the opposite direction.</p>
                <p>“6. If Fresnel’s rhomb be placed in the position 45°, and the light thus
                    circularly polarised pass through the quartz, on applying the analysing plate
                    instead of rings, there are seen two spirals naturally inwrapping each other, as
                    in fig. 100. If the rhomb be placed in position 135°, the figure is turned
                    through a quadrant. If the quartz be left handed, the spirals are turned in the
                    opposite direction. The central tint appears to be white. With the rhomb which I
                    have commonly used, (which is of plate glass, but with the angles given by
                    Fresnel for crown glass), there is at the centre an extremely dilute tint of
                    pink. I think it likely that this arises from the cross in the angles, as the
                    intensity of the colours have no proportion to that in other parts of the
                    spirals. The figure was drawn from the appearances given by a plate of quartz 0
                    ’ 26 inch thick.</p>
                <p>“7. If two plates of quartz of equal thickness, but cut one from a right handed,
                    and the other from a left handed crystal, be attached together, and put between
                    the polarising and analysing plates, the left handed slice nearest to the
                    polarising plate, the appearance presented is that of fig. 101. Four spirals
                    (proceeding from a black cross in the centre, which is inclined to the plane of
                    reflexion), cut a series of circles at every quadrant. The points of
                    intersection are in the plane of reflexion, and perpendicular to it. This is the
                    simplest way of describing the form; but if we followed the colours which
                    graduate most gently, we should say that the form of each is alternately a
                    spiral and circular arc, quadrant after quadrant.</p>
                <p>“At a distance from the centre, the black brushes are seen. If the combination be
                    turned, so that the right handed slice is nearest to the polarising plate, the
                    spirals are turned in the opposite direction. This is one of the most beautiful
                    phenomena of optics. The slices from whose appearance the figure was drawn, are
                    each 0∙16 inch thick.”</p>
                <p>The preceding phenomena are described as they appear when examined with an
                    analysing plate of unsilvered glass. The following are the theoretical views
                    which Mr. Airy considers as consonant with these experiments. They had been
                    originally suggested to him by the desire of finding some connecting link
                    between the peculiar double refraction in quartz, and the common double
                    refraction.</p>
                <p>“1. I suppose the ordinary rays to consist of light elliptically polarised, the
                    greater axis of the ellipse being perpendicular to the principal plane, and the
                    extraordinary rays to consist of light elliptically polarised, the greater axis
                    of the ellipse being in the principal plane.</p>
                <p>“2. I suppose that when the ordinary ray is right-elliptically polarised, the
                    extraordinary ray is left-elliptically-polarised, and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi></p>
                <p>“3. I suppose that the proportions of the axes of the two ellipses are the same,
                    each proportion being one of equality when the direction of the ray coincides
                    .with the axis, and becoming more unequal, according to some unknown law, as the
                    direction is more inclined to the axis; the minor axes of the ellipses having
                    sensible magnitudes when the rays are inclined 10° to the axis.</p>
                <p>“4. I suppose that the course of the rays after refraction can be determined by
                    the construction given by Huygens for calc spar, with this difference only, that
                    the prolate spheroid for determining the course of the extraordinary ray must
                    not be supposed to touch the sphere for determining the course of the ordinary
                    ray, but must be entirely contained within it.”</p>
                <p>In a supplement to his investigations, Mr. Airy remarks, that he has not yet
                    ascertained the law which connects the ellipticity of the rays with the angle
                    that they make with the axis. He considers, however, the following points as
                    made out :—</p>
                <p>“One of the rays is certainly right-handed elliptical, and the other certainly
                    left-handed elliptical. The major axis of one is certainly perpendicular to the
                    principal plane of the crystal, and the major axis of the other is certainly in
                    that plane. Mr. Airy remarks, that in some trials for measuring the
                    ellipticities of the rays, he seems to have arrived at the conclusion, that the
                    proportion of the axes of the ordinary ray is more nearly one of equality than
                    the proportion of the axes of the extraordinary ray.”</p>
                <p>This subject has recently been investigated by Professor Maccullagh, whose object
                    was to pave the way for a mechanical theory, by shewing that all the phenomena
                    may be grouped together by means of a simple geometrical hypothesis. Setting out
                    from this hypothesis, he arrives immediately at all the known laws, and obtains
                    at the same time a law that was previously unknown, and which is technically
                    called the <hi rend="italic">law of ellipticity.</hi> By this law Professor
                    Maccullagh has been able to compute the ellipticities observed by Mr. Airy in
                    rays inclined to the axis of quartz, from the angles of rotation observed by Μ.

                <p>The phenomena of circular polarisation were discovered by Sir David Brewster, in
                    plates of glass possessing the doubly refracting structure. Μ. Dove of Berlin
                    has found it also in compressed glass and has published an interesting memoir on
                    the subject, in which he takes little notice of the previous labours of others,
                    on the various subjects of which he treats. As our limits will not permit us to

                <p>Although this remarkable property was discovered in some fluids by M&gt;Seebeckby
                    independent observation, yet Μ. Biot had anticipated him in it, and has made
                    this subject so completely his own, by a series of the most elaborate and
                    beautiful researches, that if he had done nothing else for science, they would
                    have ensured him a high reputation. We regret extremely that our limits will not
                    permit us to give any thing like a full and satisfactory account of his
                    discoveries, particularly those contained in his valuable paperof 1832. We must
                    therefore refer the reader to his original memoirs, and present to them in as
                    abridged a form as possible his leading results.</p>
                <p>Μ. Biot discovered that some fluids turn the planes of a polarised ray from right
                    to left, and others from left to right. He found also that the tints rose in the
                    scale as in quartz by an increase in the thickness of the fluid. The following

                    pure and colourless, and olive oil, produced no effect upon polarised light.</p>
                <p>He found, however, that tartaric acid dissolved in the proportion of 53 of acid

                <p>One of the most curious discoveries contained in Μ. Biot’s memoir, is that of the

                    uncrystallisablc syrup which is found in the farina of rice, wheat, and even of

                    rotation, and from sugar in its superior power of rotation, which is almost
                    triple of that which is exerted by sugar of canes. It surpasses all animal and
                    vege table substances at present known, at equal densities and thicknesses, in
                    turning round the plane of a polarised ray,— rock crystal only being superior to
                    it. The name of dextrine has been given to it in order to mark the direction as
                    well as the powerful energy of its force of rotation.</p>
                <p>Μ. Biot and Μ. Persozhave more recently found a sugar of starch, whose power of
                    rotation is almost equal to that of crystallised sugar of canes. They have also
                    discovered that, when sugar of canes is dissolved in water mixed with dilute
                    sulphuric acid, and heated below the boiling point, it loses its power of
                    turning the planes of polarisation from left to right, like sugar of grapes not
                    solidified. Sugar of starch submitted to the same process did not experience
                    this inversion.</p>
                <p>Μ. Biot likewise found, that the colouration of liquids did not exercise any
                    influence on their rotatory property.</p>

                    recent, and extremely interesting researches on the growth and nutrition of
                    plants. These researches have a high practical value, and shew in a striking
                    manner that the most abstract researches in physical science will sooner or
                    later find some useful application.</p>
                <p>CHAP. III. ON ELLIPTICAL POLARISATION.</p>
                <p>The phenomena and laws of elliptical polarisation, as they are at present known,
                    have been investigated only by Sir David Brewster. This species of polarisation
                    forms the connecting link between <hi rend="italic">plane polarisation</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">circular polarisation,</hi> passing nearly into the former
                    when exhibited by <hi rend="italic">galaena</hi> and into the latter when
                    exhibited by <hi rend="italic">silver.</hi></p>
                <p>Sir David Brewster found at an early period, what Malus had previously observed,
                    that the light reflected from metals was polarised in different planes. The
                    former, however, found, that the pencil polarised in the plane of reflexion was
                    always more intense than that polarised in a perpendicular plane, and which he
                    conceived had entered the metal and been partially absorbed. He found the
                    difference between the intensities of these pencils to be least in silver and
                    greatest in galaena, metals which had an intermediate effect, being arranged as
                    in the following table.</p>

                <p>He found also that, by increasing the number of reflexions, <hi rend="italic">the
                    whole of the light could be polarised in one plane.</hi> The white light of a
                    wax candle 10 feet distant, is polarised by <hi rend="italic">eight</hi>
                    reflexions from <hi rend="italic">steel</hi> between 60° and80°, whereas it
                    requires more than <hi rend="italic">thirty-six</hi> from <hi rend="italic"
                    >silver,</hi> and in total reflexion where the elliptical polarisation becomes
                    circular; and when the two pencils are equal, the total polarisation of the
                    pencil cannot be effected by any number of reflexions.</p>
                <p>The action of metals upon polarised light presents us with a series of very
                    extraordinary phenomena. One of the first of these which was discovered by our
                    author, was the action of successive reflections from silver and gold upon
                    polarised light. These reflexions are made from two metallic plates placed
                    between the polarising and analysing plate or rhomb, and when the plane of
                    metallic reflexions is parallel or perpendicular to the plane of primitive
                    polarisation, its <pb break="no" facs="nls:194563443"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-3443-0506"/>azimuth will be 0°, 90 <hi rend="superscript">
                    n</hi>, 180°, &amp;c. and when it is inclined 45° to that plane, its azimuth
                    will be 45°, 135°, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In azimuth 0° no colours are observed by reflexions from two plates of silver
                    placed parallel to one another, just as in the case of crystallised laminae
                    whose axes are in 0° of azimuth.</p>
                <p>At 45°, 135° of azimuth, the most brilliant complementary colours are seen,
                    either by turning round the analysing plate, or by using a rhomb of spar that
                    gives two images. These colours become fainter and fainter while the azimuth
                    changes from 45° to 90°, or from 45° back to 0°, exactly like those of
                    crystallised laminae.</p>
                <p>When a small number of reflexions are used, the tints are fainter and less
                    brilliant, and they increase with the number of reflexions. There is an angle of
                    reflexion about 75°, at which the tints are brightest, and they become fainter
                    as the reflexions are performed at greater or at less angles.</p>
                <p>All the other metals in the preceding table, as well as total reflexion from
                    glass, give analogous colours, but they are most brilliant in silver, and
                    diminish towards galaena.</p>
                <p>Now, it is obvious, that at about 75° of incidence (if we suppose the metal to be
                    steeD the polarised light which it reflects has acquired some new physical
                    property.</p>
                <p>1. It is neither <hi rend="italic">common light</hi> nor <hi rend="italic"
                    >partially polarised</hi> light, because if we reflect it a second time at 75°
                    <hi rend="italic">it is restored</hi> to light polarised in one plane.</p>
                <p>2. It is not polarised light, because it does not vanish during the revolution of
                    the analysing rhomb.</p>
                <p>In order then to discover its nature, let it be transmitted along the axis of
                    Iceland spar. The common uniaxal system of rings is changed into that shewn in
                    fig. 102, which is similar to the effect produced by crossing the uniaxal system
                    of rings with a thin film polarising the pale blue of the first order. If we
                    substitute for the Iceland spar, films of sulphate of lime, we shall find that
                    their tints are increased or diminished according as the metallic action
                    coincides with or opposes that of the crystal. This experiment led our author
                    into the eιτoneous opinion that metals acted like crystallised plates; but when
                    he found that a second reflexion at 75° destroyed the effect of the first
                    reflexion, he saw that this opinion was untenable, and was led to consider the
                    phenomena as having some resemblance to those of circular polarisation.</p>
                <p>We have already seen, that a circularly polarised ray RP, fig. 161, emerges after
                    two total reflexions in the direction ST, polarised 45° to the plane of the two
                    reflexions in every azimuth. Now, if we reflect a ray of light R polarised +45°
                    at Q, from one plate of <hi rend="italic">silver</hi> CD, the rays Q,S wall have
                    acquired a property analogous to that of circular polarisation; for if it is
                    reflected a second time at S, the reflected ray ST will emerge polarised 39° 48'
                    to the plane of reflexion. Now the difference between this result and that from
                    total reflexion, is that one reflexion from silver impresses the same character
                    upon light, whereas in total reflexion two reflexions are necessary. Another
                    point of difference is, that when the ray is restored by the same number of
                    reflexions, it is not wholly restored to a plane — 45°, but only to a plane —
                    39° 48'. But there is another difference of a very interesting kind. In circular
                    polarisation, the ray has the same properties on all its sides, and the angles
                    of reflexion at which it is restored to polarised light in different azimuths,
                    are all equal to the radii of a circle described round the rays. “Hence,” says
                    our author, “without any theoretical reference the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >circular polarisation</hi> is from this and other facts experimentally
                    appropriate.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Sir
                    John Herschel’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise οη Light,</hi> § 1050.</p></note> In
                    like manner, <hi rend="italic">without referring to the theoretical existence of
                    elliptical vibrations</hi> produced by the interference of two rectilineal
                    vibrations of unequal amplitudes, we may give to the new phenomenon the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">elliptic polarisation,</hi> because the angles of reflexion at
                    which this kind of light is restored to polarised light, may be represented by
                    the variable radius of an ellipse.”</p>
                <p>Now, it is a curious fact, that while silver restores the ray to angles of 39°
                    48', other metals restore it to angles deviating more and more from 45°, as is
                    shewn in the following table:</p>

                <p>At an incidence of 67° 40' elliptical polarisation is produced by l½, 4^, 7½
                    reflexions. Hence we draw the interesting conclusion, that the ray must have
                    completed its elliptical polarisation in the middle of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >second</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fifth</hi> reflexion; that is, when it had
                    reached its greatest depth within the metallic surface. It then begins to resume
                    its state of polarisation in a single plane, and recovers it at the end of the
                    3d, 5th, and 7th reflexion. Another very interesting effect is produced when one
                    reflexion is made on one side of the polarising angle, and the other reflexion
                    on the other side. A ray that has been partially elliptically polarised by one
                    reflexion at 85° does not as in plane polarisation acquire more by a reflexion
                    at 54°, but it retraces its course, and recovers its state of single
                    polarisation.</p>
                <p>Wehave seen that by <hi rend="italic">two</hi> reflexions, there is only <hi
                    rend="italic">one</hi> angle, viz. 73° for silver, at which the elliptically
                    polarised ray can be restored to plane polarisation. At <hi rend="italic"
                    >three</hi> reflexions there are <hi rend="italic">two</hi> angles, viz. 63°
                    43', and 79° 40', at which the restoration can take place, at <hi rend="italic"
                    >four</hi> reflexions <hi rend="italic">three</hi> angles, and so on. This
                    phenomena is exhibited to the eye in fig. 103, where the concentric arches I, I;
                    II, II, &amp;c., represent the quadrant of incidence from <hi rend="italic">one,
                    two,</hi> &amp;c. reflexions, B being the point of 90° and C that of 0°. The
                    point D on the line A is the point or line of maximum elliptic polarisation,
                    viz. 73° for silver, and the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, indicate the points or nodes
                    of restoration, and their distances from C, the corresponding angles of
                    incidence at which the restoration takes place. The loops or double curves lying
                    between the points 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. are drawn to give an idea of the intensity
                    of the elliptic polarisation which has its minimum at 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. and its
                    maximum at the white intermediate parts. These points of maximum intensity do
                    not bisect the loops, or are not equidistant from the minima; but such is their
                    relation that the <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi> for <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    reflexions is the minimum for <hi rend="italic">2n</hi> reflexions. These
                    phenomena lead us to the explanation and analysis of the complementary colours
                    which accompany elliptical and circular polarisation.</p>

                <p>When the preceding experiments are made with homogeneous light, we find that the
                    points and angles of restoration vary for the differently coloured rays. Thus in

                <p>Hence it is obvious that at the point of restoration where the <hi rend="italic"

                    are not restored, and consequently will appear when the principal section of the
                    analysing rhomb is in the plane of reflexion.</p>
                <p>Here, then, we have the cause of the phenomena of the complementary colours seen
                    in reflexion from metals. They are analogous to the colours in <hi rend="italic"
                    >oil of cassia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">chromate of lead</hi> at the maximum
                    polarising angle.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For a

                <p>But the remarkable result of the preceding measures is, that in <hi rend="italic"

                    in the language of the undulatory theory, the refractive index increases with
                    the length of the wave. In a recent communication to the Royal Irish
                    Academy,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Jan. 9,
                    1837.</p></note> on the propagation of light in uncrystallized media, Professor
                    Lloyd has obtained an expression for the velocity of the propagation of light,
                    each of its terms consisting of two parts with opposite signs, one of which is
                    due to the action of the ether and the other to that of the body. Conceiving,
                    therefore, that there may be bodies in which the principal term is nearly
                    nothing, the principal part of the expression will be that derived from the
                    second term; and if that term be taken as an approximate value, it will follow
                    that the refractive index of the substance must be in the subduplicate ratio of
                    the length of the wave nearly. “Now,” says Professor Lloyd, “it is remarkable
                    that this law of dispersion, so unlike any thing observed in transparent media,
                    agrees pretty nearly with the results obtained by Sir David Brewster in some of
                    the metals. In alI these bodies, the refractive index (inferred from the angle
                    of maximum polarisation) increases with the length of the wave. Its values for
                    the <hi rend="italic">red, mean,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">blue,</hi> ray in
                    <hi rend="italic">silver,</hi> are 3 ’ 866, 3∙271, 2∙824, the ratios of the
                    second and third to the first being .85 and .73. According to the law above
                    given, these ratios should be .88 and .79.”</p>
                <p>Professor Maccullagh has very recently<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Proceedings of Royal Irish Academy, Oct. 24,

                    preceding pages by empiricalformulae, in the same manner as Fresnel represented
                    those of total reflexion. The following is a brief abstract of Professor
                    Maccullagh’s researches, which we shall give in his own words.</p>
                <p>“The author observes, that the theory of the action of metals upon light is among
                    the <hi rend="italic">desiderata</hi> of physical optics, whatever information
                    we possess upon this subject being derived from the experiments of Sir David
                    Brewster. But, in the absence of a real theory, it is important that we should
                    be able to represent the phenomena by means of empirical formulae; and
                    accordingly, the author has endeavoured to obtain such formulae by a method
                    analogous to that which Fresnel employed in the case of total reflexion at the
                    surface of a rarer medium, and which, as is well known, depends on a peculiar
                    interpretation of the sign √ ’ — I. For the case of metallic reflexion, the
                    author assumes that the velocity of propagation in the metal, or the reciprocal
                    of the refractive index, is of the form <hi rend="italic">m</hi> (cos. <hi
                    rend="italic">X</hi> + √ — 1 sin- <hi rend="subscript"> x</hi>); without
                    attaching to this form any physical signification, but using it rather as a
                    means of introducing two constants (for there must be two constants, <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">χ,</hi> for each metaD into Fresnel’s
                    formulae for ordinary reflexion, which contain only one constant, namely, the
                    refractive index.</p>
                <p>“Then if <hi rend="italic">i</hi> be the angle of incidence on the metal, and <hi
                    rend="italic">i'</hi> the angle of refraction, we have sin. z'= <hi

                <p>Then according to the interpretation, before alluded to, of √—1, the angle δ will
                    denote the <hi rend="italic">change of phase,</hi> or the retardation of the
                    reflected light; and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> will be the amplitude of the

                <p>“The number M=— may be called the <hi rend="italic">modulus,</hi> and <hi

                    David Brewster has called the <hi rend="italic">maximum polarising angle.</hi>
                    After two reflections at this angle, a ray originally polarised in a plane
                    inclined 45° to that of reflexion, will again be plane polarised in a plane
                    inclined at a certain angle <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> (which is 17° for steeD to

                <p>“The most remarkable thing in this table is the last column, which gives the
                    intensity of the light reflected when common light is incident. The intensity

                    (less than 75°,) and then increases up to 90°, where there is total reflexion.
                    This singular fact, that the intensitydecreases with the obliquity of incidence,
                    was discovered by Mr. Potter,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    as an incidence of 70°. Whether the subsequent increase which appears from the
                    table indicates a real phenomenon, or arises from an error in the empirical
                    formulae, cannot be determined without more experiments. It should be observed,
                    however, that in these very oblique incidences Fresnel’s formulae for
                    transparent media do not represent the actual phenomena for such media, a great
                    quantity of the light being stopped, when the formulae give a reflexion, very
                    nearly total.</p>

                    plane-polarized if the sum of the values of δ'—δ for the two angles of incidence
                    be equal to 180°.</p>

                    Through the last twenty or thirty degrees of incidence the first dark ring,
                    surrounding the central spot, which is comparatively bright, remains constantly
                    of the same magnitude; although the other rings, like Newton’s rings formed
                    between two glass lenses, dilate greatly with the obliquity of incidence. This
                    appearance was observed at the same time by Professor Lloyd. The explanation is
                    easy. It depends simply on this circumstance, (which is evident from the table,)
                    that the angle 180° —δ', at these oblique incidences, is nearly proportional to
                    cos. <hi rend="italic">i.</hi></p>

                <p>In concluding our account of the phenomena of Physical Optics, we could have
                    wished to have given a popular account of the undulatory theory of light, and of
                    the explanation which it affords of a great variety of the most interesting
                    phenomena in optics. This however has been done to such an extent by Dr. Thomas
                    Young, in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Chromatics</hi> in this work, and in
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Polarisation</hi> by Μ. Arago, that we would
                    not be justified in entering again upon the subject. Notwithstanding, however,
                    its acknowledged power in accounting for such a variety of facts, there are many
                    of the principal phenomena in optics of which it is not capable of giving the
                    least explanation; and there are others to which it seems in its present form to
                    be totally inapplicable. We look forward, however, with much hope, to the
                    labours of Professor Lloyd, and Professor Maccullagh, and Professor Powell, in
                    this country, who, in place of checking the progress of enquiry, as has been
                    lately done, by declaring the theory of undulations to be <pb break="no"

                    every phenomenon, regard it as still imperfect even as a mathematical
                    representation of the phenomena, and consider experimental research as the only
                    means by which a true theory of light can be obtained.</p>
                <p>PART VIII. ON THE APPLICATION OF OPTICS TO THE EXPLANATION OF NATURAL
                    PHENOMENA.</p>
                <p>As several of the subjects which belong to this branch of Optics have been
                    treated pretty fully in other parts of this work, we must confine our attention
                    to topics which have not been previously discussed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">On the Rainbow.</hi></p>
                <p>A general description of the rainbow has already been given among the optical
                    phenomena in <hi rend="smallcaps">Meteorology.</hi> In order to explain the
                    progress of the rays of light which form the two bows, let R, R, R, R, fig. 104,
                    be parallel rays proceeding from the sun, situated at the back of the observer,
                    placed at 0, and let them fall on drops of rain E, F, G, H, in front of the
                    observer. Some of these rays of light will enter the spherical drops of rain,
                    and those which fell perpendicularly and nearly so, will be transmitted through
                    the drop, and of course never reach the observer at 0. Other rays, however,
                    especially those which fall obliquely, will be separated into the prismatic
                    colours atthe first refraction, and will subsequently be reflected <hi
                    rend="italic">once, twice,</hi> and more times, within the drop, and emerge
                    after <hi rend="italic">one, two,</hi> or more reflexions in different
                    directions. Now, it is obvious that there will be some position of the drops,
                    such as E, F, at which rays that have suffered <hi rend="italic">one</hi>
                    reflexion will reach the eye of the observer at 0. Drops above these will throw
                    the rays which they refract after one reflexion above 0, and drops below these
                    will throw the same rays below 0. In like manner, there must be some position,
                    as at H and G, at which other drops in which the light that has suffered two
                    reflexions will fall upon the eye at 0, the drops above these throwing the rays
                    above, and the dropsbelowthemthrowingtheraysbelowO. Now,each drop forms
                    byrefraction a prismatic spectrum, or coloured and elongated image of the sun.
                    The rays RE, RF, which reach the eye at 0, must fall upon the lower drops E, F,
                    on their upper side, as shewn in the figure, and consequently (as may be found
                    by tracing the rays through the drops) the spectrum which they form will have
                    the red rays uppermost, as at <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> near F, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">violet</hi> rays downwards, asatr, near E; and as die same effect
                    will be produced from all the other drops which reflect the sun’s rays to the
                    point 0, there will appear to an eye at O, a coloured bow, such as we see it in
                    the heavens, with all the colours of the spectrum, as if they had been formed
                    from the sun’s image, by a prism of water that produced the same degree of
                    refraction. In like manner, the rays that enter the lower side of the drops will
                    form an inverted spectrum, after <hi rend="italic">two</hi> reflexions, in which
                    the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> rays are below, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >violet</hi> ones above, and as this spectrum is much fainter, it will give a
                    second coloured bow, fainter than the first, and having its red side below, and
                    its violet side above. The following are the dimensions of the two bows :—</p>
                <p>Radius of the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> edge of the <hi rend="italic">inner</hi>

                <p>Dr. Halley has shewn that the solar rays which suffer <hi rend="italic"
                    >three</hi> reflexions, will form a bow round the sun at the distance of 40° 28
                    ’, and that those which suffer <hi rend="italic">four</hi> reflexions will form
                    a bow at the distance of 45° 33' from the sun; but the light which reaches the
                    eye after so many reflexions is too faint to be seen, and these bows have
                    consequently never been discovered.</p>
                <p>Supernumerary <hi rend="italic">bows</hi> of red and green light, to the number
                    of <hi rend="italic">three,</hi> have been seen in contact with the violet arch
                    of the inner bow, and we have seen them also on the outside of the outer or
                    secondary bow. The cause of these is not known, but a very ingenious explanation
                    of them has been given in <hi rend="smallcaps">Chromatics,</hi> vol. xi. p. 634,
                    sect. iii.</p>
                <p>Sir David Brewster, upon examining the two rainbows with a rhomb of Iceland spar,
                    found that they consisted wholly of <hi rend="italic">light polarised</hi> in
                    the plane of reflexion within the drop, or in planes coincident with the radii
                    of the bow. The two bows present a case of <hi rend="italic">conical
                    polarisation,</hi> the part of the bow vanishing as the principal section of the
                    rhomb becomes parallel to its radius. It is strange that the polarisation of the
                    bow, and consequently of light, had not been discovered when it happened to be
                    seen by reflexion on panes of glass, or other reflecting substances, lying with
                    their planes of reflexion perpendicular to the planes of reflexion within the
                    drop, and near the angle of maximum polarisation. See <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>The name of <hi rend="italic">halos</hi> and <hi rend="italic">parhelia</hi> have
                    been given to circles round the sun and moon, some of which are extremely
                    complicated and beautiful. The general theory of this class of phenomena has
                    been given by Dr. Young, in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Chromatics,</hi>
                    vol. vi. p. 634, sect, ii., and a description of the phenomena themselves, in
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Meteorology,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 749∙</p>
                <p>The production of halos, which have their origin in the refraction and reflexion
                    of crystals of ice floating in the atmosphere, may be illustrated by the
                    following method given by Sir David Brewster. A few drops of a saturated
                    solution of alum spread over a plate of glass, so as to crystallise rapidly,
                    will cover the glass with an imperfect crust, which is composed, when examined
                    by the microscope, of flat octahedral crystals, scarcely visible to the eye. If
                    the observer places his eye behind this plate, and close to its smooth side, he
                    will see the sun or the candle encircled with three fine halos, placed at
                    different distances. The interior one, which is the whitest, is formed by the
                    refraction of the rays through two of the faces that have the least inclination
                    to each other, and consequently give a spectrum in which the colours are not
                    greatly dispersed; and as a similar pair of refracting planes lie in every
                    direction, there will be a spectrum in every direction, and consequently a
                    rainbow of a circular form. The second halo, which is <hi rend="italic"
                    >blue</hi> without and <hi rend="italic">red</hi> within, with all the
                    intermediate prismatic colours more highly dispersed, is formed by a pair of
                    faces more inclined. The third halo, which is larger and more brilliantly
                    coloured, is produced by a third pair of refracting planes, having a greater
                    refracting power, and consequently giving a higher dispersion. When the granular
                    crystals have double refraction, and when they crystallise with their axes
                    perpendicular to the plates, combinations of greater variety and beauty will be
                    produced.</p>
                <p>We have endeavoured, by looking through hoarfrost upon glass, to produce halos
                    actually resembling those seen in nature; but we have not succeeded, though we
                    have no doubt that it may be effected by causing vapour deposited under a
                    variety of circumstances, to be frozen in different ways.</p>

                    facs="nls:194563495" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3495-0510"/>is the explanation which it
                    affords of the extraordinary phenomena which arise from difference of density in
                    different parts of the atmosphere. As this subject has been treated very fully
                    in our article <hi rend="smallcaps">Meteorology,</hi> vol. xiv., and illustrated
                    with some interesting figures, we shall confine ourselves at present to an
                    account of the most extraordinary of all the phenomena of this kind which have
                    been observed and correctly described. It was observed by Dr. Vince, on the 6th
                    of August 1806, about seven o’clock in the evening. Between Ramsgate and Dover
                    there is a hill, over which the tops of the four turrets of Dover castle are
                    usually seen to a person at Ramsgate. At the time above mentioned, however, Dr.
                    Vince, when at Ramsgate, not only saw the four turrets <hi rend="italic">v, x,
                    w, y,</hi> but the <hi rend="italic">whole of the castle, m, n, s, r,</hi>
                    appearing as if it were situated on the side of the hill next to Ramsgate, and
                    rising as much above the hill AB as usual, <hi rend="italic">as if it had been
                    brought over and placed on the Ramsgate side of the hill,</hi> fig. 105. This
                    appearance continued about twenty minutes. Between Ramsgate and the land from
                    which the hill rises, there is about six miles of sea, and from thence to the
                    top of the hill about the same distance, the height of the eye above the surface
                    of the sea being about seventy feet. It is a very singular circumstance in this
                    phenomenon, that the image of the castle was so very strong and well defined
                    that the hill itself did not appear through the image.</p>
                <p>In order to explain this phenomenon, Dr. Vince supposes AB, fig. 106, to
                    represent the castle, FC the cliff of Ramsgate, BTD the hill, DC the sea, E the
                    place of the spectator, T the top of the'hill, Ayt <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> E a ray of light coming from the top of the castle to the observer, and
                    Bxw&gt;E another ray coming from the bottom of the castle, and T∙z <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> zE a ray from the summit of the hill, reaching the
                    eye at E, in a direction between those of the other two rays; then it is obvious
                    that such a disposition of the rays will produce the observed appearance. In
                    order to give such a refraction, the density of the air between <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">î/vE</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">aeîøE</hi> must have varied

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV— <hi rend="italic">On the Colours of the
                    Atmosphere.</hi></p>
                <p>As the earth’s atmosphere acts upon light like all other transparent bodies, and
                    is continually changing its chemical, mechanical, and hygrometrical condition,
                    it acts upon light in very different ways, under different circumstances. As the
                    colour of the sky is absolutely black on the tops of the highest mountains, its
                    blue colour in the regions which we inhabit is owing to the action of the
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <p>That the <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> light of the sky is light that has suffered
                    reflexion from the particles of our atmosphere, is proved by the fact observed
                    by Sir David Brewster, that this blue light is polarized in a plane passing
                    through the observer’s eye and the sun. This fact is well illustrated by the
                    discovery which we owe to the same author, of <hi rend="italic">atmospheric
                    lines</hi> in the spectrum, formed by the blue sky. These lines are principally
                    in the more refrangible spaces, as already described, and hence the prevailing
                    light is blue.</p>
                <p>The splendid colours which mark the rising and the setting of the sun, varying
                    from the deepest <hi rend="italic">red</hi> to <hi rend="italic">orange,
                    yellow,</hi> and even <hi rend="italic">green,</hi> arise from the same cause;
                    for when we analyse these various lights with the prism, we find that they are
                    owing to definite parts of the spectrum having been absorbed by the
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <p>The phenomenon of blue shadows is finely seen when the sky is particularly blue.
                    It arises solely from the shadows being illuminated by the blue sky, while the
                    part round the shadow is illuminated by the sun, or by the light of a candle. If
                    the light of the sun passes at the time through vapours so as to make it yellow
                    or orange, the contrast of the shadow is still more striking and beautiful. The
                    light of a candle which contains a great excess of red light, and which may be
                    made to contain more by letting it burn with a long wick, exhibits along with
                    the light of the sky the phenomenon of blue shadows in great perfection.</p>
                <p>The subject of the blue colour of the sky has been treated at considerable length
                    in our article on <hi rend="smallcaps">Meteorology,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 760, and
                    an instrument called a <hi rend="italic">Cyanometer,</hi> for measuring its blue
                    colour, has been well described, and an account of the experiments made with it
                    fully detailed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V.— <hi rend="italic">On the Colours of Natural
                    Bodies.</hi></p>
                <p>The splendid colours which appear in the natural world have long attracted the
                    attention of philosophers; but no <hi rend="superscript">;</hi> person ever had
                    the courage to give a philosophical theory of them but Sir Isaac Newton. When he
                    had completed his analysis of the colours of thin plates, he conceived that they
                    furnished the true cause of the colours of natural bodies. If we take a thin
                    film of mica, a few millionths of an inch in thickness, it appears to the eye of
                    a bright blue colour. Sir Isaac Newton maintained, that if this film could be
                    cut into a great number of minute parts of the same thickness as itself, these
                    particles would “keep their colour, and a heap of them constitute a mass or
                    powder of the same colour which the plate exhibited before it was broken.” A
                    plate of mica of a different thickness, would be <hi rend="italic">green,</hi>
                    another <hi rend="italic">yellow,</hi> and another <hi rend="italic">red,</hi>
                    and all these, if broken down into particles “of the same thickness with the
                    plates,” would of course, according to our author, give a <hi rend="italic"
                    >green,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">yellow,</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">red</hi>
                    mass.</p>
                <p>We have already seen that different thickness of a transparent plate like mica,
                    give various orders of colours; each different tint corresponding with a
                    particular thickness. Considering then the particles of all bodies whatever as
                    transparent, and as having different sizes, they will produce colours
                    corresponding to these different sizes, and consequently we shall have as great
                    a variety of tints in nature as there are varieties in the sizes of the
                    particles of bodies. A difficulty, however, here presents itself. The colours
                    arising from thin plates vary rapidly by inclin <hi rend="underline">ing</hi>
                    them to the incident light, whereas those of coloured media suffer no such
                    change. Hence Sir Isaac Newton, was driven to the supposition that the particles
                    of bodies have such an enormous refractive power, that the paths of the rays
                    refracted by a parallel film will not differ much in length from, and
                    consequently not be very oblique to, a perpendicular line. After explaining this
                    theory, Sir Isaac ventures to affix to different natural colours the order to
                    which they belong, the very tint of that order, and consequently the thickness
                    of the particles which produce the colour. He says, for example, that the <hi
                    rend="italic">green</hi> colour of all vegetables, the most general tint in
                    nature, is a <hi rend="smallcaps">green</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">third</hi>
                    order, and that the <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> colour of the sky is a <hi
                    rend="italic">blue</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> order. Now we know
                    the composition of a <hi rend="italic">green</hi> of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >third</hi> order, and of a <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >first</hi> order, as given by Sir Isaac Newton himself. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >green</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> order “is principally
                    constituted of <hi rend="italic">original green,</hi> but not without a mixture
                    of some <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> and <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi>;” that is,
                    it consists of all the rays of the green space, with the least refrangible rays
                    of the <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> space, and the most refrangible rays of the
                    <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi> space, and it does not contain a single ray of <hi
                    rend="italic">indigo, violet, orange,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">red</hi>
                    light.</p>
                <p>Such being the case, it occurred to Sir David Brewster that the green colour of
                    plants could be accurately analysed by the prism, and having extracted by means
                    of alcohol the green juice of a great variety of vegetable bodies, he analysed
                    their colours by the prism. In all bodies he found the composition of this green
                    colour to be identically the same; but it had no relation whatever to the <hi
                    rend="italic">green</hi> of the first order. It contained portions of all the
                    colours of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194563508" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3508-0511"
                    />spectrum; and the prismatic spectrum seen through these green juices was
                    divided unequally into <hi rend="italic">six</hi> luminous bands of various
                    breadths, separated by dark intervals.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Transactions,</hi> vol.
                    xii.</p></note> In the same manner he found that the <hi rend="italic">blue</hi>
                    colour of the sky was not a <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >first</hi> order.</p>
                <p>From a series of experiments in which the same author has been engaged, he has
                    been led to the conclusion that absorption is the cause of this extensive class
                    of colours; and that all the colours of natural bodies arise from the
                    interference of light, by which certain rays are extinguished. When the
                    interference takes place as in thin plates, between the light reflected from the
                    two surfaces, and between the direct transmitted ray and other transmitted rays
                    which suffer reflexion within the thin plates, we have two colours complementary
                    to each other; but even in this case, when the number of films is great, as in
                    decomposed glass, the transmitted colours lose all their resemblance to the
                    colours of thin plates, while the reflected tints are exceedingly brilliant and
                    metallic in their lustre.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans.</hi> 1837, p. 245.</p></note></p>
                <p>In coloured fluids and coloured glasses, and coloured gaseous media, the
                    interference arises from rays that acquire different velocities in passing
                    through the coloured medium, one part of the intromitted light passing through
                    the particles, and the other through the intervening spaces. Hence there are no
                    reflected tints in such coloured media.</p>

                <p>If we execute a large diagram of the eye, and by means of the above indices of
                    refraction trace the progress of parallel rays from the cornea to the retina, we
                    shall find that they converge to points in or near to that membrane. The
                    increase of density in the crystalline lens towards its centre is calculated to
                    correct the spherical aberration, by bringing the central rays to the same focus
                    with the marginal rays; but there is no provision in the eye for correcting the
                    aberration of colour, because the purposes of vision do not require it to be
                    corrected. It may be readily proved by tracing the rays diverging from both
                    extremities of any object to the retina, and it may be also shewn by direct
                    experiment, that an inverted image of the object is formed upon that membrane.
                    Now, it is a law of vision, that when a ray of light falls upon any point of the
                    retina, the mind infers that the ray proceeded from apoint
                    insomelineperpendicular to that point of the retina. Hence, as rays from the
                    upper part of an object fall upon the lower part of the retina, and <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> such rays will seem to proceed from the upper
                    part of the object, and all points of an object will be seen in the direction of
                    the rays which issue from them, and consequently the object itself <hi
                    rend="italic">must</hi> appear <hi rend="italic">erect,</hi> though its image is
                    inverted.</p>
                <p>As it is a law of vision that an object seen with a single eye is seen in a fixed
                    direction, arising from the form of the retina as a whole, or from the form of
                    its individual parts, then if rays from the same object fall upon another eye,
                    or upon a hundred other eyes which have the power of placing the retina of all
                    the eyes, so as to see the same object in the same direction, then the object
                    thus seen must appear single. The only difference will be, that the object will
                    be seen twice as bright with two eyes, and a hundred times as bright with an
                    hundred eyes. If we place a hundred shillings in the same straight line, an eye
                    whose axis coincides with the axis of the cylinder which they compose, will only
                    see one shilling, and the same effect would be produced if the shillings were
                    transparent. If the hundred eyes were placed with their axes in a hundred
                    different directions, an hundred objects will be seen. Small objects are seen
                    double and even triple with one eye when the crystalline lens is not uniform in
                    its refractive power.</p>
                <p>The defect of squinting may arise from several causes. It may be an original
                    defect, in which the <hi rend="italic">axis of the eye,</hi> or the line in
                    which objects are seen most distinctly does not pass through the centre of the
                    pupil. In this case it is incurable: but it is generally speaking a disease
                    arising from an imperfection in one eye, from its having a different focal
                    length from the other, from its giving a less distinct vision of objects, or
                    from its muscles not being able to direct it as quickly as the other to visible
                    objects. The consequence of this is, that as the observer can do without it, and
                    uses only his best eye, the imperfect one does not follow the movements of the
                    other, and therefore squints.</p>
                <p>When we wish to see any object very distinctly, we invariably direct to it the
                    axis of the eye, and it is a curious fact that there is no retina at the point
                    where the axis meets the back of the eye, the <hi rend="italic">foramen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">centrale</hi> corresponding to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194563521" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3521-0512"/>extremity of the axis. When
                    the eye thus sees an object with perfect distinctness, every other point of the
                    same object is seen indistinctly, and there is no adjustment of the eye by which
                    distinctness of vision can be obtained at any distance from the axis of the eye,
                    the only way of seeing disinctly being to direct the axis to the point we wish
                    to examine. The preceding fact leads to the opinion, that parts of an object
                    seen in the retina cannot be seen distinctly, and yet if this were the case, we
                    should be able to perceive upon an uniform ground the <hi rend="italic"
                    >foramen</hi><hi rend="italic">centrale.</hi></p>
                <p>The opinion that the retina, though sensible to light, does ,not give perfectly
                    distinct vision, is favoured by the fact, that when the image of any object
                    falls upon the round base of the optic nerve, shewn in Plate XXXIII. fig. 3 of
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy,</hi> the object is not distinctly visible. This
                    may be easily proved by fixing on the wall of a room, at the height of the eye,
                    three wafers each <hi rend="italic">two</hi> feet distant. Stand in front of the
                    middle wafer with one eye shut, and beginning near the wall, withdraw gradually
                    from it, (continuing to view the <hi rend="italic">left</hi> hand wafer if the
                    <hi rend="italic">right</hi> eye is open, and the <hi rend="italic">right</hi>
                    hand wafer if the <hi rend="italic">left</hi> eye is open,) till the middle
                    wafer vanishes. This will be found to take place at <hi rend="italic">five</hi>
                    times the distance from the wall at which the wafers are placed, that is, at the
                    distance of <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> feet in the present case. If we use three
                    candles, the middle one will not vanish like the wafer, but will become a cloudy
                    mass of light.</p>
                <p>The occasional insensibility of the retina to objects seen obliquely, was
                    discovered by Sir David Brewster, who has illustrated it in the following
                    manner. If we fix one eye on a particular point, such as the head of a pin stuck
                    into a green cloth, and lay down a quill or strip of paper upon the green cloth,
                    some inches distant from the pin, and then keep looking steadily at the pin’s
                    head, part of the quill, or the whole of it, will occasionally disappear, as if
                    it had been wholly removed from the cloth. In a short time it will reappear, and
                    again vanish. The very same effect is produced, though less readily, when both
                    eyes are used, and when a luminous body is used in place of the quill. In this
                    case the luminous body does not disappear, but expands into a mass of nebulous
                    light, which is of a <hi rend="italic">bluish white</hi> colour, encircled with
                    a bright ring of <hi rend="italic">yellow</hi> light.</p>
                <p>But though we cannot see objects distinctly by oblique vision, yet they appear
                    much brighter, and minute objects, especially luminous ones, are more easily
                    seen by turning the axis of the eye away from them. Various astronomers have
                    found that very faint stars, and the satellites of Saturn, which disappear when
                    the eye is turned fully upon them, may be distinctly seen by directing the eye
                    to another part of the field. This effect seems to arise from the expansion and
                    enlargement of luminous points seen obliquely.<note anchored="true"

                <p>It has long been disputed, but the question has not been much agitated in modern
                    times, whether the retina or the choroid coat behind it is the seat of vision.
                    The insensibility of the base of the optic nerve, and the fact that vision is
                    most distinct where there is no retina, are arguments in favour of the choroid
                    coat being the seat of vision, as Mariotte believed. The transparency of the
                    retina, and the opacity of the choroid coat were considered as additional
                    arguments in favour of that opinion. Dr. Knox has shewn, that in the eye of the
                    cuttle fish, there is a membranous opaque pigment in front of the retina, so
                    that in this case the retina must receive the influence of light from the vi-
                    brationsofthis⅛embrane just as it may receive them in other cases, from the same
                    membrane placed behind it. Μ. Lehot, a living French author, has endeavoured to
                    shew that the vitreous humour is the seat of vision; that we see the length,
                    breadth, and thickness of every object as we do an image formed in smoke; and
                    that the retina takes cognizance of this image in its three dimensions, by
                    nervous filaments extending so far into the vitreous humour as to render any
                    adjustment of the eye at different distances unnecessary.</p>
                <p>The insensibility of the retina to direct impressions of faint light, was
                    discovered by Sir David Brewster,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Journal of Science,</hi> No. vi.
                    p. 2S8.</p></note> who found, that when the eye directed its axis to objects
                    faintly illuminated, it could not keep up a sustained vision of them. They
                    disappeared and reappeared, and the eye was thrown into a state of painful
                    agitation.</p>
                <p>When we shut the eye quickly after looking at an object, we see it for an instant
                    (about the <hi rend="italic">seventh</hi> part of a second) in its own colours;
                    but this impression is instantly followed by an image of the object in its
                    complementary colours. If we look at a window at the end of a long passage, we
                    first see, after shutting our eyes, a picture of the window, with <hi
                    rend="italic">black</hi> bars and <hi rend="italic">white</hi> panes; but after
                    the <hi rend="italic">seventh</hi> of a second the picture is one with <hi
                    rend="italic">white</hi> bars and <hi rend="italic">black</hi> panes. When we
                    whirl a burning stick, we see a complete circle of red light, although the
                    burning end of the stick can only be in one part of the circle at the same
                    instant. This affection of the retina is the principle of Dr. Paris’s pretty
                    toy, called the <hi rend="italic">Thaumatrope,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wonder-turner.</hi> A circular card with two strings is made to whirl rapidly
                    round one of its diameters. If we draw a cage on one side of a card, and a bird
                    on the other, and whirl the card round, we shall see the bird within the cage,
                    the retina retaining the impression of both even when none of them are seen,
                    which is the case when the edge of the card is directed to the eye.</p>
                <p>The same property of the retina to preserve impressions of light, is the
                    principle on which that beautiful instrument, called the phenakistoscope, or
                    magic disc, is founded. This instrument was, we believe, originally invented by
                    Dr. Roget, and improved by Μ. Plateau, at Brussels, and Mr. Faraday. It consists
                    of a circular disc from six to twelve inches in diameter, with rectilineal
                    apertures on its margin in the direction of its radii. A series of figures, of a
                    rider for example, leaping a fence, is drawn on the .circumference of a circle,
                    parallel to the rim of the disc. The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> figure
                    represents the rider and horse standing <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the fence;
                    and the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> figure represents them standing <hi
                    rend="italic">over</hi> the fence tvhen the leap is completed. Between these two
                    figures there are several others, representing the rider and the horse in
                    different parts of the leap. The observer then stands in front of a
                    looking-glass, with the disc in his left hand, attached to a handle, and by a
                    piece of simple mechanism he whirls it rapidly round, looking at its image on
                    the glass through the notches in its margin. He is then surprised to see the
                    horse and his rider actually leaping the fence, as if they were alive, and
                    returning and leaping again as the disc revolves. If we look over the margin of
                    the disc, at the reflected picture on the face of the disc, all the figures are
                    effaced, and entirely invisible; but when we look through the notches, we only
                    see the figure of the horse and rider at the instant the notch or aperture
                    passes the eye, so that the picture instantaneously formed on the retina is not
                    obliterated by preceding or subsequent impressions. Hence the eye receives in
                    succession the pictures of the horse and rider in all the attitudes of the leap,
                    which are blended, as it were, into one action. The apparent velocity with which
                    the horse and rider advances (supposing the disc always to have the same
                    velocity) depends on the proportion between the number of apertures in the
                    margin of the disc, and the number of figures of the horse and rider.</p>
                <p>If we use a disc with three concentric circles of apertures, each containing
                    different numbers, 8, 10, and 12, for example, then considering that these
                    apertures revolve in the opposite direction in the reflected image, it is
                    obvious that when we look through the circle of 10, which moves from left to
                    right at the image of 10, revolving in the mirror from right to left, these
                    opposite motions will destroy<pb break="no" facs="nls:194563534"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-3534-0513"/> each other, and the circle of 10 apertures will
                    appear ‘to stand still in the picture. On the other hand, the circle of 12
                    apertures will always gain upon the one of 10, from which we look, and will
                    appear to move from left to right, with the difference of the velocities of the
                    two, while the one of 8 will move backwards with the same difference.</p>
                <p>If we whirl a disc containing any word or figure upon it, without using a
                    reflector, all is confused, and we cannot read the word or see the figure. Let
                    it be whirled, however, in the dark, and let a spark of electricity, or the
                    light of a littleinflamed gun-powder, or of a percussion-cap, illuminate the
                    disc, which it does only for an instant, and during that short instant, the word
                    or figure will be seen to stop, and we shall read the one and see the other with
                    great distinctness.</p>
                <p>When objects are placed at different distances, the focus or point of distinct
                    vision in the eye must vary. We feel that the eye has the power of adapting
                    itself to these different distances, so as to make the picture on the retina
                    always distinct. How this is done has been long a matter in dispute. There can
                    be no doubt, however, that the first step in the process is the variation of the
                    pupil, which seems by a mechanism at the base of the iris to increase the
                    distance of the lens from the retina.</p>
                <p>At the age of about forty, the eye loses this power of adaptation in consequence
                    of the flattening of the crystalline lens, which renders it necessary to use a
                    convex glass, which just compensates the flatness of the lens, and permits the
                    eye to adjust itself as formerly. The opposite state of the eye, not produced by
                    age, but rather diminished by it, is common even in young persons, arising
                    either from a too great convexity or refractive power in the lens, or too great
                    convexity in the cornea. In this state of the eye, the.image is formed in front
                    of the retina, and a concave lens is necessary to correct it. This is called <hi
                    rend="italic">short-sightedness,</hi> which almost always decreases by age in
                    consequence of the crystalline lens becoming flatter.</p>
                <p>When the eye looks steadily at a bright coloured <hi rend="italic">red</hi>
                    wafer, and then looks at the white paper on which the wafer lies, it will see
                    for a while a <hi rend="italic">green</hi> one, the green being the <hi
                    rend="italic">accidental</hi> colour, or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >complementary</hi> one to the <hi rend="italic">red.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >green</hi> image is called an <hi rend="italic">ocular spectrum,</hi> as it has
                    no real existence. The <hi rend="italic">accidental colours</hi> and the
                    original colours are the same as those given in Newton’s Table, p. 432, where
                    the <hi rend="italic">reflected</hi> tints correspond with the original or <hi
                    rend="italic">red</hi> colour of the wafer, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >transmitted</hi> ones to the accidental colour, or <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> so that we can determine from that table the
                    accidental colours of any coloured object upon which the eye may look
                    steadily.</p>
                <p>When the eye looks at the sun, or a bright image of it, the ocular spectrum is
                    not <hi rend="italic">black,</hi> but of various colours in succession, each
                    colour being surrounded with a rim of its accidental colour.</p>
                <p>The following beautiful experiment, shewing the effect of light in diminishing
                    the sensibility of the retina to particular colours, we owe to Mr. Smith,
                    surgeon at Fochabers. Hold a slip of white paper vertically about a foot from
                    the eye, and direct both eyes to an object beyond it, the slip will appear
                    double, and the two images equally white. Let a candle be brought near the right
                    eye, so as to act strongly upon it, without affecting the left, then the <hi
                    rend="italic">left</hi> image of the paper, or that seen by the right eye, will
                    grow <hi rend="italic">green,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> hand
                    image, or that seen by the <hi rend="italic">left</hi> eye, will grow <hi
                    rend="italic">red,</hi> forming a beautiful contrast of colours. If the candle
                    is brought round to the left eye, the images will first become of the same
                    whitish colour, and then the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> hand one will become
                    <hi rend="italic">green,</hi> and the left hand one <hi rend="italic"
                    >red.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>An analysis
                    of this and similar experiments will be found in the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The insensibility of the eye to particular colours is very uncommon. Professor
                    Dugald Stewart, Dr. Dalton, and</p>
                <p>Mr. Troughton, were unable to distinguish the colours at the red end of the
                    spectrum. All red objects appeared green, owing to the insensibility of their
                    retinas to red colours. This subject has already been treated of in our article
                    on <hi rend="smallcaps">Colours,</hi> vol. vii. p. 128.</p>
                <p>PART IX. DESCRIPTION OP OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS.</p>
                <p>The great number of optical instruments which have been described in different
                    parts of this work, renders it scarcely necessary to treat this subject in the
                    general article. Under the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Burning Instruments,
                    Camera</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Lucida,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Kaleidoscope,
                    Micrometer, Microscope, Photometers,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Telescope,</hi> the reader will find the information, some of which he might
                    have expected here. There are instruments, however, so intimately connected with
                    Optics, and not previously described, which we must shortly notice, namely, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Cylindrical Mirror,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Camera
                    Obscura,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Magic Lantern,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Phantasmagoric Machine.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Cylindrical Mirror.</hi></p>
                <p>We have already (see p. 382) described the principle of cylindrical mirrors. If
                    we suppose one of these mirrors, AB, fig. 107, to be placed on a table, with the
                    portrait of any person laid before it on the table, the reflected picture of the
                    portrait in the cylindrical mirror will be distorted. If we take an accurate
                    drawing of this distorted picture and lay it before a cylindrical mirror, as
                    shown at MN, where the human form can scarcely be recognised, we shall see in
                    the cylindrical mirror its image reduced to symmetry.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">On the Camera Obscura.</hi></p>
                <p>We have already explained the principle of the camera obscura in treating of the
                    images formed by convex lenses. The instrument is indeed nothing more than a
                    convex lens placed in a suitable box, on the side or bottom of which an image of
                    external objects is formed by the lens.</p>
                <p>A convenient portable camera obscura for drawing objects is shown in fig. 108.
                    The external object or landscape is reflected down into the lens AB by an
                    inclined mirror CD. The rays thus falling vertically upon the lens, are
                    refracted to their foci, and form a distinct image of the landscape on the paper
                    placed at EF. On one side of the box there is an opening through which the
                    observer introduces his head and hand, care being taken, by a curtain of black
                    cloth behind him, to exclude all extraneous light. Μ. Cauchoix of Paris has
                    found that the best form of the lens for a camera is a meniscus, having its
                    convex surface towards the image, and its concave surface towards the object,
                    and their radii of curvature as 5 to 8.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">On the Magic Lantern.</hi></p>
                <p>The magic lantern, an invention of the celebrated Athanasius Kircher, is shewn in
                    fig. 109∙ It consists merely of a lens AB, which forms on the wall of a dark
                    room a picture of any object placed before it, and at a greater distance than
                    its anterior principal focus. The light of an argand lamp is thrown in a
                    condensed state by the illuminating lens D, upon transparent varnished pictures
                    painted on long sliders. The lens AB forms a large circle of light upon the
                    wall, which, if it is not smooth and white, should be covered with a white
                    smooth cloth, and the images of the coloured figure appear within this
                    circle.</p>
                <p>A magic lantern is the same as a solar microscope, the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194563547" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3547-0514"/>sun being used for the source
                    of light in the latter case, and natural objects in place of pictures. The <hi
                    rend="italic">solar camera microscope</hi> invented by Dr. Goring, and fully
                    described in our article <hi rend="smallcaps">Microscope,</hi> vol. xv. p. 46,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">oxyhydrogen microscape,</hi> described in the same
                    article, may be considered as the most perfect magic lanterns that have been
                    constructed, there being no difficulty in adapting them to give magnified
                    representations of minute transparent paintings.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">On the Phantasmagoric Apparatus.</hi></p>
                <p>The apparatus for the <hi rend="italic">phantasmagoria,</hi> or the raising of
                    spectres, is nothing more than a magic lantern mounted upon wheels, which, in
                    place of throwing its pictures upon an opaque white ground, upon which the
                    spectator looks, throws them upon one side of an imperfectly transparent screen,
                    the spectator viewing them on the other side of the screen. The direct light of
                    a lamp A, fig. 110, and the light reflected from the concave mirror B, is thrown
                    upon the two illuminating lenses C, D, which condense it, and thus strongly
                    illuminate the spectres and figures painted upon sliders at E. These sliders are
                    placed a little before the anterior focus of the magnifying lens F, which forms
                    a highly magnified picture of the figures on the transparent screen at G. When
                    this apparatus is mounted upon a carriage with wheels, as at H, it may be made
                    to approach to, or recede from, the screen G, in consequence of which the
                    figures may be made to contract into dwarfs, disappearing in a point of light,
                    or swell out into giants of enormous magnitude. In order, however, to have the
                    pictures distinct at different distances of the apparatus from the screen, an
                    adjustment is necessary, to make the distance EF increase as the apparatus
                    approaches to G, and diminish as it recedes from it. With this view, the lens F
                    is fixed to a slider, which may be drawn out by the general frame H. When this
                    frame H is drawn away' from the screen, the point K is brought lower by means of
                    the rod IK, connected with another rod KN fixed to the frame of the screen at N,
                    where there is a joint or centre of motion. The descent of the point K causes
                    another lever KL to move the horizontal slider (which carries the lens F) in
                    such a manner as to keep the sereen always in the focus of F, and consequently
                    the picture upon it always distinct. When the frame H, on the other hand,
                    advances to the screen, the point K rises, and the lens F is again adjusted by
                    the motion of the slider. When the images diminish and appear to vanish, the
                    support of the lens F permits the screen Μ to fall and intercept part of the
                    light. The screen Μ may have a triangular opening, so as to uncover the middle
                    only of the lens F. In this adjusting apparatus the rods KN and KL must be
                    equal, and the point I must be twice the focal length of the lens F before the
                    object, L being immediately under the focus of the lens. The object of the
                    screen Μ is to diminish the illumination of the objects as they get smaller and
                    appear to retire from the spectator, because in the instrument they actually
                    become brighter.</p>
                <p>When Μ. Robertson exhibited this remarkable instrument, living persons were often
                    strongly illuminated and introduced into the picture. The effect of life,
                    however, was better given when the shadows of living objects only were
                    introduced.</p>
