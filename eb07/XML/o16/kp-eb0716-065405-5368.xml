                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">OSIRIS</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Mythology,</hi> one of
                    the gods of ancient Egypt, and by many believed to have been the Sun, or at
                    least the mind actuating that luminary.</p>
                <p>The Egyptians derived all things from two principles; one active, and the other
                    passive. Their active principle, according to Jablonski, was an infinite and
                    eternal Spirit; and their passive principle was Night. This spirit they
                    considered sometimes as a male, sometimes as a female divinity, and occasionally
                    they attributed to it both sexes; but it does not appear to have been the object
                    of their worship. The earliest objects of Pagan adoration were the sun, moon,
                    and planets; and that the philosophers and priests of ancient Egypt worshipped
                    the Sun by the name of Osiris, may be proved by numberless testimonies from the
                    most authentic records of antiquity. Diogenes Laertius affirms, that they held
                    the Sun and Moon as divinities, and that they called the latter Isis; and
                    Macrobius says expressly, “Nec in occulto est, neque aliud esse Osirin quam
                    Solem, nec Isim aliud esse quam Terram.” The same writer informs us, that in the
                    hieroglyphical writings of ancient Egypt, “Osiris was represented by a sceptre
                    and an eye,” to denote that this god was the Sun looking down from heaven on all
                    things upon earth. In the hieroglyphical inscriptions the symbol of Osiris is an
                    eye surmounting a chair or throne.</p>
                <p>It must not, however, be concealed, that some of the ancients, and a few of the
                    most learned of the moderns, have contended, that by Osiris the Egyptians
                    understood the Nile or spirit of the Nile, whilst others have confounded him
                    with the Grecian Bacchus. Scaliger and Selden have adopted the former of these
                    opinions, and Servius on Virgil has given countenance to the latter. But that
                    they are all mistaken has been proved by Jablonski in such a manner as to
                    enforce the fullest conviction. « When the Egyptians,” says he, “in their sacred
                    books, sometimes gave the name of Osiris to the Nile and its wonderful increase
                    during the heat of summer, they meant nothing more than to attribute to their
                    god Osiris the gift which fertilizes their country.” This they would the more
                    readily have done, because they believed the Nile to have its source in heaven.
                    Hence Eusebius tells us, <hi rend="italic">O∙&gt;ιyς εστιν</hi> ó Νί/λο;, <hi
                    rend="italic">ον iξ ουξανου</hi><hi rend="italic">καταφεξεσάαι</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">οιoνται, Osiris is the Nile, because they think it is sent down
                    from heaven.</hi> In one sense Osiris might be Bacchus, because the original
                    Bacchus was himself the Sun; but that the Egyptian god could not be worshipped
                    as the inventor of wine is undeniable, iζ as Jablonski labours to prove, the
                    primitive religion of that country inculcated upon its votaries that wine was
                    the gift, not of a benevolent god, but of an evil genius, the enemy of the human
                    race. In support of this opinion he quotes from Plutarch a passage, whence it
                    appears, that, before the era of Psammetichus, the Egyptians neither drank wine
                    themselves, nor offered it in libations to the gods; because they believed that
                    the first vine which sprung from the earth was impregnated by the blood of those
                    giants who perished in the war with the gods. It is indeed true, that the
                    Greeks, who borrowed their religion as well as the first principles of their
                    science from Egypt, attributed to Bacchus many of the actions of Osiris; but it
                    is likewise true, that they ascribed to him other attributes, which the Egyptian
                    god could not possess, consistently with the established superstitions of that
                    country. Salmasius, however, attempts to prove, from the import of the name,
                    that the Osiris of Egypt must have been the Bacchus of Greece, <hi rend="italic"
                    >^∑ηζ,</hi> or ∑∕g∕, he says, signifies <hi rend="italic">a son</hi> in the
                    Egyptian language; and hence he concludes that the god was called Osiris by the
                    Egyptians, for the same reason that by the Greeks he was called <hi
                    rend="italic">Kουξος,</hi> and by the Romans <hi rend="italic">Liber.</hi> But
                    this seems to be all a mistake. <hi rend="italic">Siris</hi> forms a part of
                    many Egyptian proper names, as <hi rend="italic">Bu∙siris, Thermo∙siris,
                    Tapo∙siris,</hi> and the like, and is by some derived from the Hebrew word <hi
                    rend="italic">Sar,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sur,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sir,</hi> which signifies a prince, potentate, or grandee. As the name of the
                    god was in Egypt not Osiris, but <hi rend="italic">Isiris,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Ysiris,</hi> it was probably composed of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sir</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Siris,</hi> and the Hebrew prefix <hi
                    rend="italic">I</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ish,</hi> denoting strength; so that
                    the whole word would signify the strong or mighty prince. And if so, we cannot
                    doubt, as Diodorus Siculus, Eusebius, Sextus Empiricus, and others affirm, that
                    the Egyptians worshipped the Sun by the name of Osiris, but that by this name
                    they meant the power or governing mind of the Sun, as the Greeks and Romans seem
                    to have done by their Phoebus and Apollo.</p>
                <p>But although-the original Osiris was undoubtedly the Sun, or the intelligence
                    actuating the Sun, yet there is reason to believe that there was a secondary
                    Osiris, who at a very early period reigned in Egypt, and was deified after his
                    death, for the benefits which he had rendered to his country. This is indeed so
                    generally admitted, that amongst the learned great controversies have arisen
                    respecting the time when he flourished, and whether he was the civilizer of rude
                    barbarians or the victorious sovereign of a polished nation. Newton, it is well
                    known, has adopted the latter opinion, and with much plausibility endeavoured to
                    prove that Osiris was the same with Sesostris or Sesak; but it must be confessed
                    that his conclusion is contrary to all the most authentic records of antiquity,
                    and that it would be easy, by the same mode of arguing, to give a show of
                    identity to two persons universally known to have flourished in very distant
                    ages. The annals of Egypt, as may be seen in the writings of Herodotus, Diodorus
                    Siculus, Strabo, Plutarch, and others, who copied from them, expressly asserted
                    the distinct personality of Osiris and Sesostris, and placed them in eras very
                    distant from each other. If any credit be due to the historians just named,
                    Osiris was the founder of the Egyptian monarchy; and, as was customary in those
                    days, the same personage, having either received the name of the Sun, or
                    communicated his own to that luminary, was after his death deified for the
                    benefits which he had rendered to his country; and, being at first worshipped
                    only as a demigod, was in process of time advanced to full divinity, and
                    confounded with his heavenly godfather. The Greeks, who, although original in
                    nothing, were always prompted by their vanity to hold themselves out as the
                    first of the nations, claimed this Osiris as their own, and pretended that he
                    was the son of Jupiter and Niobe. According to them, he reigned over the
                    Argives; but afterwards, having delivered his kingdom to his brother Aigialeus,
                    took a voyage into Egypt, of which he made himself master, and there married Io
                    or Isis. He established many good laws in.</p>

                <p>that country, and both Osiris and Isis were after their deaths worshipped as
                    gods. But that this is a ridiculous fiction needs no proof; because every one
                    knows that good laws were established in Egypt long before the Argives had any
                    king, or indeed existed either as a tribe or a nation.</p>
