                <p><label type="entry">OPORIO, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Porto</hi></label>, a city of
                    Portugal, usually considered as the northern capital of that kingdom, and one of
                    the most important commercial places of the peninsula. It is situated in the
                    province Entre Douro and Minho, at the mouth of the latter river. The land near
                    the mouth of the river is generally low, but the city, being situated on an
                    elevation on the northern bank, may be descried at the distance of four or five
                    leagues, by a remarkably black steeple, called Los Clerigos, which rises in the
                    middle of it. On approaching the bar, the town and castle of St John de Foz are
                    seen upon low land, near the mouth of the river, with a lighthouse, lighted
                    every night. On the northern point of the castle of St John de Foz a ledge of
                    rocks extends towards the south-west, some of them above water; and without
                    these, on the opposite side, is a similar ledge. This formation renders the
                    entrance difficult without much previous knowledge, especially as with winds
                    from the south-west and the north-west a heavy sea sets in along the coast. The
                    bar of the Douro is liable to alterations of its position from gales of wind,
                    which makes it the more necessary to take a pilot, a matter not difficult, as
                    there are plenty of fishermen perfectly competent, who are ready to act in that
                    capacity. When vessels have passed the bar they are in a state of security,
                    except at periods when, after a heavy fall of rain, such torrents rush down the
                    Douro as to raise the water from thirty to forty feet in a few hours. These <hi
                    rend="italic">freshes,</hi> as they are called, have also a great influence in
                    changing the position of the bar. The vessels that are intended for the harbour
                    of Oporto should not, however, draw more than sixteen feet water.</p>
                <p>As this city gives name to the whole kingdom of which it forms the second
                    capital, a short sketch of its history may be appropriate. It is first noticed
                    in the itinerary of the Emperor Antoninus, in the year A. D. 160, under the name
                    Cago or Gaia, but was then on the opposite bank of the river, and defended the
                    passage over it against the forces of Viriato. When the Goths, Vandals, Alans,
                    and Suevi had overrun France and Spain, and attained the end of their career,
                    the Alans entered Lusitania, and established their capital in this city, which
                    they adorned and fortified, giving it the name of Castrum Novum, to distinguish
                    it from Cale or Caya, the ancient part, on the opposite bank of the river,
                    called <hi rend="italic">Castrum Antiquum.</hi> This part of Lusitania was
                    seized upon, about the year 540, by the Arian Goths, under their King
                    Leovogiklo, who put to the sword all who refused to embrace his opinions, and,
                    as has been said, amongst others his own son. The Goths maintained their
                    dominion till the invasion of the Moors in 716, when Abdulhassan overran all
                    Galicia, and possessed himself of the whole country up to the river Douro. It
                    fell again into the hands of the Christians, when again the Moorish chieftain
                    Abderrahman, attacked the Catholic King Alfonso I. in 820. A desperate battle
                    was fought at Campanha, in which the Moors were defeated, and many of them
                    driven into the river Tinto; and a part of the city whence the Christians issued
                    to the contest still retains the name of Batalha. Another Moorish chief
                    subsequently conquered the city, and retained his power within it till 1092,
                    when some Gascon kυights, under the command of Don Alfonso Fredriquez, finally
                    subdued the Moors; since which it has been retained by the Christians, and
                    followed the fortune of the rest of Portugal.</p>
                <p>Oporto is about two miles from the mouth of the river, on the right bank, from
                    which it rises abruptly by an ascent, in some parts attained by a flight of 140
                    steps. It occupies a valley and several hills, which render some of the streets
                    very steep. Its back or north part rests upon rocky heights, in which are
                    quarries of granite that have yielded the stone with which the city has been
                    built. There are many magnificent and spacious streets, well paved for foot
                    passengers, with some fine churches, convents, and other public buildings; and
                    these are interspersed with numerous gardens, abounding with flowers and
                    beautiful shrubs, which give an air of great beauty to the whole place. The most
                    remarkable edifices, as in most Catholic cities, are those devoted to religious
                    purposes, as churches, convents, and monasteries. The most striking are very
                    magnificently ornamented. The cathedral is a superb building, which was
                    constructed in 1112, by Count Henrique de Porto, and the ascent to the choir is
                    by a fine broad marble staircase. The collegiate church of Cedo∙ feita is the
                    next in celebrity. It is a purely Gothic structure, built in the year 559, and
                    was left untouched by the Moors, having been redeemed from destruction by a
                    noble family of the name of Connigos, who paid a yearly tribute for its
                    preservation. The church of Misericodia, built in the year 1555, belongs to a
                    corporate body, which relieves misery of all kinds, takes care of more than 2000
                    sick, maintains 900 foundlings, and buries those whose friends cannot afford to
                    do so. The church of the Clerigos, built in 1748, stands at the top of a fine
                    wide street called Calcada de Natividade. It is a superb building, most
                    beautifully ornamented, and has a tower, before noticed, the most lofty in the
                    kingdom, if not in Europe, which may be seen from the sea at the distance of
                    several leagues. The other parochial churches are St Nicoao, said to be the
                    richest, St Victoria, St Ildefonso, Santa Marinha, in Villa Nova; San Pedro;
                    MiragayaTerco e Ca-ridade, which is connected with a good hospital; Nosso Venhor
                    de Bom Fim; St Pedro Gonsalvez, appropriated to the seamen; Bon Jesus de Gaya,
                    and Señora de Lapa. Besides these, there are about eighty chapels, some of them
                    elegantly fitted up, in which the public religious worship is celebrated. There
                    were twelve monasteries, containing no less than 380 monks; but some of them
                    were destroyed during the siege of Oporto by Dorn Miguel, and others suffered
                    severely. There were five convents, which contained about 340 nuns of different
                    orders, besides numerous females who resided in them under the tuition of the
                    nuns.</p>
                <p>There are few cities in Europe in which the charitable institutions are more
                    numerous than in Oporto. The public hospitals especially are extensive
                    establishments. The principal of them is the Hospital Real, which is built of
                    granite, and has the appearance of a palace, and is remarkable not more for its
                    extent and grandeur than for the great number of patients which are relieved in
                    it; they are attended by the best physicians and surgeons, both English and
                    Portuguese, and are supplied with the best medicines, dispensed not only to the
                    sick in the house, but also to out-door patients at half price. Of a less extent
                    are the foundling hospital, two for unfortunate and poor females, one for
                    beggars, one for poor old women, one for the English, and three upon a small
                    scale distinguished by the names of St Sylva, San Crispin, and San Francesco da
                    Carma.</p>
                <p>This city suffered severely during the long siege which commenced in December
                    1833, and continued till August 1834. It was a period of severe misery to the
                    inhabitants, as well from the constant fire kept up against the </p>

                <p>town, as fiom the scarcity of food, fuel, and other necessaries. I he army of
                    Dorn Miguel had surrounded the city with works, which extended in a circuit of
                    nearly fourteen miles, and from the forts on those lines kept up a cannonade and
                    bombardment. The effect of the former was to make an impression upon the works
                    of Dorn Pedro, and that of the latter to destroy whatever was destructible in
                    the houses of the inhabitants, and in the public buildings. The churches were
                    spared by the assailants as far as their position did not interfere with the
                    military operations. Both the public and the private buildings are constructed
                    of massy blocks of stone, and have little combustible matter in their
                    composition. Thus, though the windows, the decorations, and the furniture of
                    many buildings, were much injured or destroyed, and more than sixteen thousand
                    of the civic inhabitants killed, there was but little damage done to the
                    interior appearance of the place; and as far as that was concerned, a very short
                    period witnessed the restoration of the city to its former beauty. Within two
                    years after the termination of the siege the inhabitants had in a great degree
                    returned to those mercantile pursuits and habits which have long distinguished
                    the city.</p>
                <p>Oporto, in a national view, is a commercial place of the greatest importance,
                    being the channel by which the most valuable produce of the soil of Portugal is
                    distributed to other countries. That soil is peculiarly favourable to the growth
                    of a strong red wine, highly relished in England, and not much esteemed in any
                    other part of the world. It is produced from a grape originally transported from
                    Burgundy to the banks of the Douro, whence it has spread throughout the province
                    of Tras os Montes and the interior and higher grounds of the province Entre
                    Douro and Minho. From the growers the wines are collected by merchants of
                    Oporto, and preserved in large quantities till they are shipped for the markets
                    of consumption. The best of the wines formed the subject of a monopoly to a
                    privileged company, who possessed the right of pre-emption of a limited number
                    of pipes before the general buyers were allowed to make their contracts. That
                    monopoly has been abolished, a circumstance which has given a new direction to
                    the internal trade; but the sufferings occasioned by the siege are still felt,
                    and this, with the change of system, has made it difficult to prognosticate what
                    may be the future condition of the wine trade in this city. One thing is
                    certain, however, that as long as the taste for port wine continues in Great
                    Britain as it has hitherto done, the trade of Oporto must be of the greatest
                    importance to the kingdom of Portugal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">An Account of the number of Pipes of Wine shipped at Oporto
                    from</hi> 1824 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 1833, <hi rend="italic">distinguishing

                <p>Of the number of pipes, 49,575, sent to other countries than Great Britain in
                    these ten years, Brazil took 28,261, the other parts of South America 8944,
                    whilst North America, the whole of Europe, India, and Africa, took only 12,370
                    pipes, of which Hamburg alone received 5573. This statement shows to what an
                    extent the north of Portugal is dependent upon the consumption of Great Britain
                    for the chief product of its soil. A duty is collected from the wine, both on
                    its transport from the interior, and on its exportation to foreign countries.
                    The amount varies with the kind and quality of the wine, and is often subject to
                    considerable fluctuation.</p>
                <p>The other exports from Oporto consist of oil, oranges, figs, and various fruits,
                    wool, refined sugar, cream of tartar, shumac, leather, and cork. The imported
                    articles are, corn, rice, and other provisions; sugar and coffee from Brazil;
                    cotton and woollen goods, hardware, tin plates,butter, and cheese, from Great
                    Britain and Ireland; and hemp, flax, deals, and other timber, from Norway or the
                    Baltic. It is said that a large portion of the British cottons and woollens
                    imported at this place are for the purpose of being carried into Spain through
                    Braganza and other frontier towns, by means of the contraband trade.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of the city suffered exceedingly by the siege, but are now
                    reviving. The sugar refineries are considerable; gold and silver lace is made,
                    and also some hosiery. Cotton and linen weaving gives some occupation, as do the
                    making of glass and paper. Though the population was reduced by the siege, it is
                    now rapidly recovering its former state, and, by the latest calculation, amounts
                    to about 80,000. Though somewhat cold in the winter, and therefore not so much
                    visited by invalids as Lisbon, Oporto is generally considered as a more healthy
                    city. The latitude, by accurate observation, is 41. 11. 15. N. the longitude 8.
                    8. 22. west from London.</p>
