                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">OTWAY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi></label>, an eminent
                    tragic poet, was the son of Mr Humphrey Otway, rector of Woolbeding, in Sussex,
                    and was born at Trottin, in that county, on the 3d of March 1651. He received
                    the rudiments of his education at Winchester school, and in 1669 was entered a
                    commoner of Christ-Church; but, from whatever cause, he left the university
                    without a degree, and proceeded to London, where he commenced player. In 1672,
                    he made his first appearance on the stage in the character of the king in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Forced Marriage,</hi> though with indifferent success, and
                    soon found that he was not likely to gain much reputation as an actor. This
                    inability to shine on the stage Otway shared with Shakspeare and Jonson, as he
                    likewise shared some of their excellencies. It seems reasonable to expect,
                    indeed, that a great dramatic poet should without difficulty become a great
                    actor; that he who can feel might also express; that the man who can excite
                    passion should be able to exhibit readily its external modes and indications.
                    But experience has fully proved that, whatever be the affinity of these powers,
                    one of them may be possessed in a great degree by a person who has very little
                    of the other; and that they either depend on different faculties, or a different
                    use of the same faculty. The actor must possess a pliancy of mien, a flexibility
                    of countenance, and a variety of intonation, in which the poet may easily be
                    supposed deficient; or the attention of each may have been differently employed,
                    the poet considering thought and the player action, the one watching the heart
                    and the other contemplating the expression of the countenance.</p>
                <p>Otway, however, though sensible of his inability to attract notice as an actor,
                    felt conscious of possessing powers which qualified him for becoming a dramatic
                    author; and, under this impression, his very first attempt was made in the
                    highest department of the art. His tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Alcibiades</hi>
                    was acted at the Theatre Royal in 1675, though with what measure of success we
                    are not informed. The story is taken from Nepos and Plutarch; but in certain
                    points he departs from history in order to accommodate the character<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194565589" xml:id="kp-eb0716-5589-0671"/> of his hero to
                    the effect which he wished to produce. <hi rend="italic">Don Carlos,</hi>
                    another tragedy in heroic verse, founded on St Real’s novel of the same name,
                    and the Spanish chronicles of the life of Philip 1I., was performed in 1676, and
                    appears to have succeeded much better than any other of his plays. For many
                    years indeed it was more applauded and followed than either <hi rend="italic"
                    >Venice Preserved</hi> or <hi rend="italic">The Orphan;</hi> and it is even
                    asserted that it was played for thirty nights together, though this may
                    reasonably be doubted. At any rate, it was very successful, and brought more
                    money than any preceding tragedy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This circumstance is coarsely alluded to by Rochester in the

                    rend="italic">Titus and Berenice,</hi> a piece in three acts, translated with
                    alterations from Racine; and also <hi rend="italic">The Cheats of Scapin,</hi> a
                    farce partly taken from Molière; which were acted together with considerable
                    success, the custom of annexing farces to plays having about that time been
                    introduced. His comedy of <hi rend="italic">Friendship in Fashion,</hi> which
                    appeared in 1678, had also some success, though it seems doubtful whether the
                    author was at this time in London, as he certainly went abroad during the year
                    1677.</p>
                <p>The occasion of his going abroad will be immediately explained. Johnson, however,
                    in introducing this circumstance, observes: “Want of morals, or of decency, did
                    not in those days exclude any man from the company of the wealthy and the gay,
                    if he brought with him any powers of entertainment; and Otway is said to have
                    been at this time a favourite companion of the dissolute wits. But as he who
                    desires no virtue in his companion has no virtue in himself, those whom Otway
                    frequented had no purpose of doing more for him than to pay his reckoning. They
                    desired only to drink and laugh; their fondness was without benevolence, and
                    their familiarity without friendship.” Men of wit received at that time no
                    favour from the great except that of sharing their riots, from which they were
                    dismissed again to their own narrow circumstances; and thus they languished in
                    poverty without support, and often without resource. But some exception must,
                    nevertheless, be made. The Earl of Plymouth, a natural son of the king, procured
                    Otway a cornet’s commission in some troops which were then, 1677, destined for
                    Flanders. But the poet did not prosper in his military capacity. The society of
                    dissolute wits had but ill qualified him for submitting to the restraints of
                    discipline, or observing that regularity which the laws of the service required;
                    and hence, having left his commission behind him, he returned to London, where
                    he resumed his dramatic labours.</p>
                <p>In 1680, he produced <hi rend="italic">Cuius Marius,</hi> a tragedy, which had
                    some success, probably from the circumstance of the author having availed
                    himself of the excitement that then prevailed about the Popish Plot; and, in the
                    dissensions of Marius and Sylla, endeavoured to shadow forth the proceedings of
                    the factions in the reign of Charles I. But a higher degree of fame awaited him
                    from his next tragedy, <hi rend="italic">The Orphan,</hi> which appeared the
                    same year. This, as Johnson observes, is one of the few pieces which have kept
                    possession of the stage, and pleased through all the vicissitudes of dramatic
                    taste and fashion. It is a domestic tragedy, drawn from middle life, and its
                    whole power is upon the affections. <hi rend="italic">The Soldier’s
                    Fortune,</hi> and its second part, <hi rend="italic">The Atheist,</hi> produced
                    respectively in 1681 and 1684, were both successful, being far better suited to
                    the manners of that age than to those of the present. The incidents and
                    characters may, for the most part, be traced to other plays, and neither is in
                    any respect worthy of the genius which, in 1682, gave to dramatic literature <hi
                    rend="italic">Venice Preserved,</hi> a tragedy, the fame of which, like that of
                    <hi rend="italic">The Orphan,</hi> is secure against all the caprices of taste
                    and fashion, whilst it displays still higher powers of poetry and of expression.
                    The striking passages are familiar to all, and its faults as well as its
                    excellencies seem to have been rightly appreciated by the public. It is, in
                    fact, the production of a man not very attentive to decency, nor over zealous
                    for virtue, but of one who conceived forcibly, and drew originally by consulting
                    nature in his own breast. Besides the plays already mentioned, he wrote the
                    miscellaneous poems inserted in Johnson’s series of the poets; and he translated
                    from the French a History of the Triumvirate.</p>
                <p>But Otway’s career was destined to be a short one. He died before completing his
                    thirty-fourth year, on the 14th of April 1685, in a manner which has been
                    variously represented; but, according to every account, in circumstances of the
                    deepest distress. “Having,” says Johnson, “been compelled by his necessities to
                    contract debts, and hunted, as is supposed, by the terriers of the law, he
                    retired to a public-house on Tower Hill, where he is said to have died of want;
                    or, as is related by one of his biographers, by swallowing, after a long fast, a
                    piece of bread which charity had supplied. He went out, as is reported, almost
                    naked, in the rage of hunger, and finding a gentleman in a neighbouring
                    coffee-house, asked him for a shilling. The gentleman gave him a guinea, and
                    Otway going away bought a roll, and was choked with the first mouthful. All
                    this, I hope,” adds Johnson, “is not true; and there is this ground of better
                    hope, that Pope, who lived near enough to be well informed, relates, in Spence’s
                    Memorials, that he died of fever caught by violent pursuit of a <hi
                    rend="italic">thief</hi> who had <hi rend="italic">robbed</hi> one of his
                    friends. But that indigence, and its concomitants, sorrow and despondency,
                    pressed hard upon him, has never been denied, whatever immediate cause might
                    bring him to the grave.” Pope’s account of Otway’s death was first related by
                    Warton in the notes to his Essay on that poet; and it differs in several
                    particulars from the version of it given by Johnson. It would appear that an
                    intimate friend of Otway’s having been <hi rend="italic">murdered</hi> in the
                    street, the poet pursued the murderer on foot as far as Dover, where he was
                    seized with a fever, occasioned by the fatigue, which afterwards carried him to
                    his grave in London. By this account the robber is a murderer; and as Warton was
                    more correct in stating facts than Johnson, it is probable that he relates the
                    story exactly as he heard it. But it may nevertheless be traced to Spence, who,
                    it seems, was informed by Dennis, the critic, that Otway had a friend, named
                    Blakiston, who was shot in the street; that the murderer having fled towards
                    Dover, Otway pursued him; and that, on his return, having drunk water when
                    violently heated, he caught the fever which caused his death. Dennis, however,
                    in the preface to his Observations on Pope’s Translation of Homer, 1717, 8vo,
                    says merely that Otway died in an alehouse; a statement which is not
                    inconsistent with the preceding account, as, in point of fact, he generally
                    lived in one. As to the story of the guinea and the loaf, it rests upon no
                    sufficient authority, and may probably have been introduced to heighten the
                    picture of the poet’s distress, about which, unfortunately, there can be no
                    doubt whatever. Some, however, are inclined to think that both accounts might be
                    true. But this cannot be, for the supposition of Otway having died of fever,
                    occasioned by fatigue, or by drinking cold water when violently heated, is <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194565602" xml:id="kp-eb0716-5602-0672"/> altogether
                    inconsistent with the story of his running half naked into the street in the
                    rage of hunger, and being choked with the first mouthful of the bread purchased
                    with the money that had been charitably given him. No one ever heard or knew of
                    a patient in high fever being seized with raging hunger, and greedily devouring
                    the first morsel of bread he could procure. The idea is altogether absurd.</p>
                <p>When Otway first began to rise in reputation, Dryden spoke slightingly of his
                    performances; but afterwards, when <hi rend="italic">The Orphan</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Venice Preserved</hi> had established his fame, fully acknowledged
                    their merits. “To express the .passions which are seated in the heart by outward
                    signs,” says he in his preface to Dufresnoy, “is one great precept of the
                    painters, and very difficult to perform. In poetry the very same passions and
                    motions of the mind are to be .expressed; and in this consists the principal
                    difficulty, as well as the excellency, of that art. This, says Dufresnoy, is the
                    gift of Jupiter; and, to speak in the same heathen language, we call it the gift
                    of our Apollo, not to be obtained by pains or study, if we are not born to it.
                    For the motions which are studied are never so natural as those which break out
                    in the height of a real passion. Mr Otway possessed this part as thoroughly as
                    any of the ancients or moderns. I will not defend every thing in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Venice Preserved</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but I must bear this
                    testimony to his memory, that the passions are truly touched in it, though
                    perhaps there is somewhat to be desired both in the grounds of them, and in the
                    height and elegancy of the expression. But <hi rend="italic">nature is
                    there,</hi> which is the greatest beauty.” This is high, and, at the same time,
                    discriminating praise. Otway’s power consisted in moving the passions and
                    touching the heart. All the fountains of feeling were at his command, and he
                    could throw them open at his pleasure. His mastery over the emotions as well as
                    the passions of the soul was unrivalled. But he had not much cultivated
                    versification, nor replenished his mind with general knowledge; and hence his
                    numbers are sometimes harsh, and his allusions neither rich, varied, nor
                    striking. “Nature,” however, “is there,” and her presence atones for every
                    deficiency.</p>
                <p>It appears that Otway, when he died, had about him the copy of a tragedy which he
                    had sold for a trifle to Bentley the bookseller. An advertisement which appeared
                    in L’Estrange’s <hi rend="italic">Observator</hi> for the 27th November and the
                    4th December 1686, in which a reward is offered to any person who “can give
                    notice in whose hands the copy lies,” leaves no doubt whatever of the fact. The
                    play in question, however, seems to have been irrecoverably lost; for the
                    tragedy entitled <hi rend="italic">Heroic Friendship,</hi> which was printed in
                    1719, and attributed to Otway, is evidently no production of bis. It never was
                    acted, nor deserved to be acted. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi><hi
