                <p><label type="entry">OISE</label>, a department of the north of France, formed out
                    of the ancient Isle of France, and the districts of Beauvaisis and Valois. It
                    extends in north latitude from 49. 7. to 49. 38. and in east longitude from 1.
                    28. to 3. 4. It is bounded on the north by the Somme, on the east by the Aisne,
                    on the south by the Seine and Marne and the Seine and Oise, and on the west by
                    the Eure; and it is divided into four arrondissements, which are subdivided into
                    thirty-five cantons and 738 communes. It extends over 2428 square miles, and,
                    according to the census of 1836, contains 398,641 inhabitants, and elects three
                    deputies to the national representative body. The face of the country is plain
                    or undulating, with a chain of calcareous hills of moderate height, of which
                    Mount Caesar on the eastern part is the highest. The soil is various, being in
                    some parts clayey and in others sandy with marl, and generally a calcareous
                    subsoil, except in the marshy portions near the streams. The Oise runs through
                    it till it falls into the Seine, and it is navigable for barges. The Aisne,
                    another navigable river, passes through a part of this department before it
                    joins the Oise. There are a great number of smaller streams, some with and some
                    without a name, all of which reach the sea ultimately through the Seine. The
                    climate is dry and healthy, except in the marshy parts and near the woods, which
                    cover about one seventh part of the whole surface. The agriculture is tolerably
                    conducted; but the paucity of manure causes a great part of the land to be left
                    fallow; yet it yields more corn than is required for the consumption, and in
                    average years can spare one fourth of its growth for the supply of the
                    surrounding departments. Besides corn, it yields a vast quantity of fruit,
                    especially cherries, which can be conveyed by the rivers to Paris and other
                    large cities. A great quantity of apples is converted into cider. The vines in
                    general produce only a weak wine, not capable of being long preserved, except
                    some of Ancerville and of Villars-Saint-Sepulcre, which are preferred to all the
                    others of Picardy. The breeding of horses is carefully attended to, and some
                    excellent ones are reared. The stock of oxen and sheep is low for the extent of
                    country; but the races of the latter have been recently improved by the
                    crossings with Merinos, and some fine wool is now iurnished to the
                    manufacturers. There are fabrics of linen, woollen, and cotton goods in several
                    places; a considerable quantity of thread lace is made by the females; and there
                    are also many tanneries and potteries. There is a considerable transit trade on
                    the rivers, and they, as well as the rivulets, afford much fish.</p>
