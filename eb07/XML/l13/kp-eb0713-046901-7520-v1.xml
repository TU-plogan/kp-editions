                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> interesting part of Italy was in remote periods
                    thinly inhabited, till in the sixth century it formed a kingdom. As the history
                    of Lombardy is in this work included in the general history of Italy, we must
                    refer to that article in its alphabetical order, where may be traced the manner
                    and period by which it became the territory of the house of Austria.</p>
                <p>In its present state it is distinguished by the name of the kingdom of Venetian
                    Lombardy, which was conferred on it by the treaties of Vienna in 1815. It is a
                    compact territory, bounded on the north by Switzerland and the Tyrol, on the
                    east by Illyria and the Adriatic Sea, on the south by the States of the Church
                    and the duchies of Modena and Parma, and a part of the kingdom of Sardinia, and
                    on the west by Sardinia. It extends over 18,744 square miles, and contains
                    4,217,650 inhabitants, all of them adhering to the Roman Catholic church.</p>
                <p>The far greater part of this kingdom is a level plain, bounded on the north by
                    the Rhaetian Alps, and on the south by the river Po, into which most of the
                    numerous rivers and rivulets empty themselves. The whole valley declines towards
                    the south, but so gently, that the fall of water in that river, from its source
                    to its mouth, is not more than 190 feet; and the smaller streams are equally
                    languid. The soil is generally light, but fertile, on a basis of calcareous
                    subsoil, except that at the foot of the mountains there are some portions of
                    sandy heaths, and on the coast, where the great rivers discharge their waters,
                    the land is marshy, and formed into extensive lagunes. In the mountainous
                    northern border the land is frequently stony, but even there the soil which
                    covers the valleys is a vegetable mould of a greater or less degree of
                    fertility.</p>
                <p>The mountains which form the southern boundary, and which are within the kingdom,
                    are a portion of the Alps, beginning on the north side of the lake of Como, and
                    extending between it and Switzerland to the Tyrol. The valley of the Valteline
                    is enclosed by them; and the loftiest points are, the Splugen, 8130; the
                    Legnone, on the lake of Como, 8130; the Godena, 7459; the Tremezzo, 5106; and
                    the Corno de Canza, 4260 feet in height. Some of the mountains on the frontier
                    towards the Tyrol are still higher, but have this difference, that they are not
                    at all seasons bound in frost. Towards the east these ranges of mountains are
                    joined with those of Carinthia. Amongst all these extensive elevations are to be
                    found valleys of greater or less extent, but <hi rend="italic">of</hi> high
                    fertility, and presenting the most exciting prospects.</p>
                <p>The Po, the greatest of the Lombardy rivers, has a course of near 200 miles; and,
                    though languid in its current, is so filled, generally in the spring, as to
                    cause extensive inundations on both its banks. In its progress it receives the
                    waters of the Ticino, which rises near Mount St Gothard, and joins the Po near
                    Pavia. The other streams which contribute to this great river are, the Olona,
                    the Lambro, the Adda, the Oglio, and the Mincio. The next great river is the
                    Adige or Etsch, which rises in the Tyrol, passes through two lakes near to
                    Botzen, where it receives the Eisach, when it becomes navigable and enters
                    Lombardy, and then, passing by Rivoli, empties itself into the Adriatic Sea at
                    Brendola. In its progress it is » augmented by the waters of the Brenta, the
                    Bachiglione, the Piave, the Livinza, the Lemone, and the Tagliamento, all of
                    which are navigable.</p>
                <p>In Lombardy there are two descriptions of lakes, those of fresh water amongst the
                    mountains, and those of salt water in the level country on the borders of the
                    Adriatic.</p>
                <p>Of the former, the most remarkable for extent, and for the picturesque scenery on
                    the banks, are the following: 1sZ, Lago Maggiore. It begins in the Swiss canton
                    of Ticino, and extends into the boundaries of Lombardy and of Sardinia to Sesto.
                    It is formed by the river Ticino and twenty-six smaller streams, is about
                    forty-eight miles in length, from four and a half to seven in breadth, varying
                    considerably, and generally from twenty-four to thirty feet deep. It is
                    connected by the river Tresa with the lake of Lugano, and is 750 feet above the
                    level of the sea. 2&lt;7, Lago Lugano. This is also on the frontiers of
                    Switzerland, is 870 feet above the level of the sea, and is fed by forty-three
                    brooks and rivers, entering it from the Austrian dominions. <hi rend="italic"
                    >3d,</hi> Lago di Como. This is formed by the river Maixa, near Cordona, and is
                    divided on the southern part into two arms orbranches. Its elevation above the
                    sea is about 700 feet; the greatest length is thirty-seven miles, and its
                    breadth varies from one and a quarter to four miles. It is plentifully stocked
                    with fish; the banks are studded with farms and villages, whilst the lofty
                    mountains form a most picturesque background to the scenery. The river Adda
                    receives from it several of its tributary streams. 4√∕z, Lago d’Iseo. This Jake,
                    near the foot of the mountains, is about twenty miles in length, and in breadth
                    varying from four and a half to seven miles. <hi rend="italic">5th,</hi> Lago
                    d’Idro, which is only about seven miles in length. <hi rend="italic">6th,</hi>
                    Lago di Garda, or, as it is still sometimes called by the ancient name, Lake of
                    Benaco. It is one of the most beautiful of the lakes of Lombardy, is about
                    thirty-five miles in length, varying in breadth from four to fourteen miles, and
                    in depth from ten to 300 feet. It is chiefly fed by the river Sarca, and a
                    discharge of its water near Peschiera forms the river Mincio. It was the subject
                    of the panegyrics of Virgil and Catullus; and has been rendered celebrated by
                    the victories of Bonaparte over Wurmser in the year 1796.</p>
                <p>The lagunes are formed by the rivers which descend from the Alps, and spread
                    along the shores of the Adriatic; they are defended from the sea by steep
                    artificial walls, not unlike the dykes in Holland, which in some degree prevent
                    the influence of the rise and fall of the tides; but in some cases, where the
                    force of the sea has broken through, harbours have been formed. Of such havens,
                    there are four large ones, viz. Malamoco, Santa Nicolo, Chioggio, and Tre-Porti;
                    and two inconsiderable, viz. Lido Maggiore and St Erasmo.</p>
                <p>There are mineral springs of various degrees of efficacy and reputation for
                    medicinal purposes. The most remarkable of them are at Worms and Massimo in the
                    Valteline, at Albano in the delegation of Padua, at Caldiero near Verona, at
                    Recoaro in the province of Vicenza, at Tres-coria and St Pelegrino in the
                    delegation of Bergamo, and Cenedo and Piano in that of Treviso. The climate is
                    very mild, except on the border mountains. On the plains the snow scarcely ever
                    remains on the ground, and it is rare that ice is found in the still lagunes
                    near Venice. What falls from the heavens in winter is much more common in the
                    form of rain than of hail or snow. The winter scarcely lasts more than two
                    months; and in February the fields are covered with new grass. In May the hot
                    weather begins, and the harvest is secured in June and July. In September and
                    October the annual labours of the vintage are performed.</p>
                <p>The climate, on the whole, may be described as healthy; but from that description
                    must be excluded those parts where rice is extensively cultivated, as well as
                    the vicinity <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207533?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-7533-0470"/> of Mantua, and the marshy districts extending
                    from Venice to Rovigia, and beyond it. In the latter, sickness is marked in the
                    complexions of the inhabitants; and numbers of the people from the Apennines, or
                    of Illyrian peasants, a hardy race, who descend from their lofty homes to gather
                    the harvest, fall victims to the marsh fevers.</p>
                <p>As Lombardy is the most densely peopled, so it is the best cultivated, district
                    in Europe. In no other part is the benefit of irrigation more clearly
                    understood, or more accurately appreciated; and the practical application of it
                    becomes in some measure a substitute for that animal manure which is more
                    abundantly supplied in the other most productive portions of the earth.
                    Although, from the nature of the climate and the habits of the people, a larger
                    quantity of leguminous vegetables are used for aliment than of bread and flesh,
                    yet abundance of corn is annually raised. Wheat, barley, and oats are grown, but
                    not extensively; and rye is to be found very rarely, excepting in the delegation
                    of Friouli; but, on the other hand, rice is grown to a great extent, insomuch
                    that the government has attempted to check its further extension. As the wealth
                    and prosperity of Lombardy, and in fact of the whole of Italy, is derived
                    chiefly from the productions of the soil, an extended view of its agriculture
                    must be of much importance; and we enter upon the subject here, because, in the
                    description of the agriculture of the other parts of Italy, it will only be
                    necessary, in the progress of this work, to refer generally to the practices of
                    Lombardy, and to point out the few differences that may exist.</p>
                <p>The importance of irrigation is more felt, and the practice of it more extended,
                    in Lombardy, than in any other part of Europe. This depends much on the physical
                    circumstances of the country, but has also in a great measure arisen from the
                    skill of the people, who, by long practice in the art of conducting water, have
                    acquired the habit of leading it to the parts where it may be applied with the
                    greatest success.</p>
                <p>Two of the reservoirs that supply water for the purpose of irrigation, viz. Lago
                    Maggiore and Lago di Lugano, are only in part within the Austrian territory; but
                    the waters they discharge enter that part of Italy, and become available within
                    it for both the purposes of internal navigation and of irrigation. The lakes of
                    Como and of Garda, and several of smaller extent, are wholly within the
                    boundaries of Lombardy. All of them are vast deposits of water, chiefly formed
                    by the rapid streams issuing from the frozen ice and snow of the Alps, and in
                    part by springs, which abound near the foot of those lofty elevations. They are
                    scarcely ever frozen, and never to so intense a degree as wholly to suspend the
                    course of the streams which issue from them, and so powerfully tend to fertilize
                    the land through which they pass in their progress towards the Po.</p>
                <p>The lake of Como and Lago Maggiore are about 700 feet above the level of the sea;
                    and that of Garda, whose termination is nearer the Po, is 150 feet above it. As
                    the Po is a river of many sinuosities, by which its course to the sea is much
                    elongated, the river Ticino, from Lago Maggiore, which joins the Po a little
                    below Pavia, is calculated at that point to be about 300 feet above the level of
                    the Adriatic, and, through the stream of the Po, with many curves, is at length
                    lost in the sea.</p>
                <p>The plains of Lombardy, then, may be considered as a gentle slope, looking to the
                    south, and bounded in that quarter by the Po. If the average distance from the
                    foot of the mountains, where the lakes have been formed, to the Po, be computed
                    at sixty miles, and the points where the rivers fall into it at 300 feet lower,
                    we may assume that the slope of the plain is at the rate of about five feet in
                    the mile. Such a rate of declination cannot be accurate, but it is a sufficient
                    approximation to accuracy to give an idea of the facility with which irrigation
                    may be per formed. Though this representation of the gradual sloping of the face
                    of the country may be generally applicable to it, yet many exceptions must be
                    allowed for. Between the courses of the various streams are numerous elevations,
                    though none of them lofty, which are too high to be susceptible of being
                    irrigated by the great rivers; but in many instances such spots are benefited by
                    being near to springs or brooks, which the long acquaintance of the natives with
                    the practices of irrigation leads them to apply in a greater or less degree to
                    that purpose. Near to the principal streams which convey these collected waters
                    to the sea, there are portions of land so low as to be liable to such abundant
                    overflowings, that they can only be for a time left with a surface sufficiently
                    dry to admit of cultivation for rice; and the vicinity of such lands is
                    injurious to human life, whilst those fields which can, at the will of the
                    occupier, be left either dry, or watered with streams in motion, are not known
                    tû be less salubrious than those on the hills near them.</p>
                <p>The facilities for irrigation in the best districts have been much increased by
                    the construction of canals, which, whilst they serve the purpose of inland
                    navigation, are made use of to convey streams of water over the fields, which
                    pass from the property of one proprietor to that of another, till they enter
                    again the canals at a lower level. Some of these canals are the work of remote
                    ages. The most ancient, as well as the most considerable, of these, is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Naviglio Grande,</hi> which was opened in the year 1270. The water
                    is conveyed to the Ticino, near Tornavento, and proceeds to Abbiategrasso, a
                    distance of eighteen miles, where it divides into two branches. One of these is
                    conducted to Beneguardo, eleven miles, and the other to Milan, fourteen miles,
                    thus making a line of forty-three English miles. This great undertaking was
                    commenced after the death of Charlemagne, just as the cities of Lombardy began
                    to be constituted independent states, about the year 1177, and in a few years
                    was executed to Abbiategrasso. It was extended to Milan by 1257, but was then
                    only adapted to the purpose of irrigation. It was next widened, and thus
                    rendered navigable, at the expense of the city of Milan, which, within that
                    period, had become the capital of a rich dukedom; and, by the water
                    communication it thus obtained, flourished in a great degree from its commerce,
                    as well as from the rich fields which the waters had rendered highly
                    productive.</p>
                <p>It would be needless to record the progress of the other canals which have since
                    been constructed, or to enumerate them. It may not, however, be improper to
                    notice the last of these great and beneficial works. It is known as <hi
                    rend="italic">Nuovο Navigliο di Pavia,</hi> and passes from Milan to Pavia,
                    through Benasco, and there falls into the Adda, a little above the junction of
                    that river with the Po. This undertaking was begun in 1814, and completed in
                    1819. The quantity of goods conveyed by it, and the quantity of water supplied
                    by it to the neighbouring fields, have secured a large profit to the operators,
                    and conferred a great additional value on the lands in its vicinity.</p>
                <p>An ancient law of Lombardy has contributed, from the most remote period, to the
                    extension of the distribution of water. The whole of that substance was the
                    property of the sovereign. An individual, or a corporate body, might purchase
                    the water, and thereby acquire the right to conduct it by canals in any
                    direction, and there to sell it to the cultivators. But they could not carry it
                    through gardens or pleasure-grounds, and were bound to pay the owners of the
                    land the value of that portion which was made use of for the passage of the
                    water. In process of time the right of the sovereign over the water was ceded to
                    those who became the purchasers thereof, and was at length extended to those who
                    had springs on their ground, or should afterwards discover any. One instance <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193207546?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7546-0471"/>
                    recently occurred.of the exercise of this right. An individual found a spring on
                    a small piece∙of ground, seventeen miles from the main bulk of his property, and
                    conducted the water from one to the other over the lands of a vast number of
                    proprietors. Though, as all judicious people foresaw, he ruined himself by the
                    operation, instead of making money by selling his water near the spring, as he
                    might have done, yet the law proceedings which arose confirmed the right.</p>
                <p>The value of water in Lombardy is best seen by a comparison of the rent paid for
                    land of the same quality, according to the power of obtaining irrigation. Dry
                    meadows will let at from 24s. to 40s. per English acre, and that so situated as
                    to be accessible to water is eagerly rented at from 48s. to 160s. per acre,
                    according to its greater or less capability of obtaining water.</p>
                <p>The purchase and sale of water is a traffic of much importance in Lombardy. There
                    are individuals whose sole but respectable incomes are derived from such
                    operations. They are possessors of a given volume of water which they have
                    purchased out of the great canals, or they have several small springs or brooks
                    which they have bought or inherited, united in one small canal, and conducted to
                    such distances as the fall will allow, where it is sold to the cultivators. The
                    greater part of the proprietors are also the owners, or have shares in the
                    canals, from which they procure their water; but many amongst them, and
                    especially those who extend their irrigations, are insufficiently supplied from
                    their own canals, and must consequently buy it from others.</p>
                <p>The distribution of water is settled for a term, with strict covenants between
                    the parties. Fixed days and hours are appointed for opening and shutting the
                    sluices, and watchful guards are appointed; but, in spite of all precautions,
                    the courts of law are supplied with most abundant processes from the several
                    parties. The volume of water is reckoned by means of a local measure called the
                    <hi rend="italic">oneia,</hi> being about two English inches. An opening is made
                    through the sluice, which is three of these oneias in breadth and four of them
                    in depth, and the water is raised two oneias above the top of the orifice
                    through which the passage is made, in order tó give due force to the current.
                    This opening is calculated to discharge about seven cubic feet of water in a
                    minute. With this, in twenty-four hours, seven acres of sandy meadow, or six
                    acres of ploughed land, is deemed to be sufficiently irrigated. For the winter
                    meadows, which will be hereafter noticed, a large portion of water is requisite,
                    and the measure here described is applied to not more than one and a third acre.
                    A mechanical contrivance, invented by Ferrari, an officer of engineers, has of
                    late years been chiefly applied to the measuring of water, which has been found
                    to be accurate in its operation; but it is difficult to describe without the
                    drawing, which is given by the inventor in his work, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Descriziοηi del mοdo con cui</hi><hi rend="italic">sono formate le</hi><hi

                <p>The value of water depends upon a variety of circumstances, and the purchaser can
                    afford to pay more for that i .vhich is applied to gardens and to meadows than
                    for what s wanted on arable land. The water of the canals is of nore value than
                    that which comes immediately from iprings or from small brooks. That water which
                    has I ιassed over the land is worth more than that immediate-y from the canals,
                    as it is supposed to bring with it more ιutritive particles. In the vicinity of
                    Milan the water of he Vettabbia is more valued than any other, because it
                    ontains particles of matter collected from the filth of the i ity. In that
                    neighbourhood, the common water obtained rom the other canals is generally,
                    where a constant stream i i bought, paid for at the rate of from L.40 to L.50
                    the <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> ∩eia. If it be bought for the winter only, the
                    payment is not more than the same number of shillings. Some instances are stated
                    by a writer of accuracy and veracity, where an oneia of water has been sold for
                    more than L.600. (Breislak, <hi rend="italic">Descrizione Geologica

                <p>Whatever may have been the original component parts of the soil of Lombardy, yet,
                    from the great facilities for irrigation, those lands which are susceptible of
                    that operation have become the most productive of any in the kingdom, or perhaps
                    of any in Europe. There are, however, some exceptions; they are indeed but few,
                    and chiefly confined to the vicinity of Mantua, where, even with great power of
                    watering, the land, which is mere sand, does not produce copiously.</p>
                <p>These watered lands may be divided into three classes: The first of them,
                    “convertible meadows,” or, in Italian, <hi rend="italic">Prati</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">a Vicenda,</hi> are the most abundant, and are constantly
                    increasing. They are prepared to be laid down in grass by previous corn or green
                    crops, and those are prepared which require good manuring, and also best tend to
                    clean the land from weeds. The course adopted, therefore, is to grow maize and
                    then wheat, or to sow hemp, succeeded by millet, and that followed by wheat; or,
                    in the first year to sow hemp and then millet, in the second year maize, and in
                    the third wheat. In each of these rotations a half fallow is introduced, and the
                    ground three or four times ploughed, and such fallowing is either in the spring
                    or the autumn, as may best suit the variations in the rotation. Red clover is
                    generally sown in the wheat, which yields a good crop the first year after the
                    wheat harvest, which usually takes place in June, and in the following spring;
                    but after that it disappears, and gives place to most abundant crops of white
                    clover, which seems to be the most natural, and almost the spontaneous, product
                    of the soil, and the seed of which must be scattered on the land <hi
                    rend="subscript"> h</hi> by the wind from the fields around it. It continues in
                    grass for three, or in some cases four years, during which time it is mowed
                    three, four, and even five times in the course of the summer. During the process
                    of fallowing, great pains are taken to remove any such inequalities of the
                    surface as would impede the equal distribution of the water over the whole of
                    the field. The soil is removed, by a machine contrived for that purpose, from
                    any part above the level of the field, and thrown into the hollows. The field is
                    divided into narrow beds, between each of which is a water-furrow. In the
                    process of watering, these become first filled, and then from them the water is
                    let in till it rises sufficiently high to cover the whole surface of the land.
                    The same furrows, in excessive rainy weather, serve to drain the land of its
                    surplus moisture. The mode of ploughing naturally raises the middle of the bed
                    somewhat higher than the sides of it, but the difference seldom exceeds four or
                    five inches. The application of fields of this description may be generally
                    stated to be as follows: Three sixths grass, one sixth wheat, one sixth maize,
                    and the remainder flax, beet, rape, or other green crops. There are, as must be
                    obvious to any one acquainted with agriculture, many variations; but, assuming
                    the crops to be grown in that proportion, we cannot be far from accuracy. The
                    portion of the grass-land on these meadows is very great; in many instances
                    where there have been but three mowings and subsequent feedings, they have
                    yielded six London loads of hay to the acre on the average of years, and in some
                    of the best farms near Lodi a load more. There may be mentioned amongst the
                    convertible meadows, those which are chiefly cultivated with rice, which are on
                    the lowest level, and where the watering is the rule, and the letting them dry
                    the exception. The water on them is stagnant during the greater part of the
                    growth of the crops; but, to change the rotation, it is in some years cultivated
                    along <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207559?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-7559-0472"/> with other plants. Such lands may be generally
                    stated to yield, one half of them rice, and the other half an equal portion of
                    clover, wheat, and maize. The culture of rice will be further investigated.</p>
                <p>The second of the classes of watered lands are those denominated “permanent
                    summer meadows.” These are day by day diminishing in extent, as the cultivators
                    become convinced that it is more profitable to change the plants for a few
                    years, than to leave them constantly in grass. The difference in produce between
                    these and convertible meadows arises chiefly from the gradual disappearance of
                    the clovers, and their place being occupied by a variety of the common grasses.
                    They are fitted more for having their plants converted into hay than those of
                    the convertible meadows, and less adapted for the growth of those kinds of grass
                    which are, in conformity with the general practice ∙of the country, most
                    beneficial for stallfeeding. After the last mowing, they are depastured by the
                    oxen. Most of these meadows have on their banks willows, which are from time to
                    time cut a few inches from the ground, and sold to the basket-makers with great
                    benefit.</p>
                <p>The most important portion of the land in Lombardy is that part designated as
                    “permanent winter meadows.” In laying them down, great attention is paid to
                    levelling the surface, so that no inequalities may prevent the regular
                    distribution of the water in passing over them, and that in no part there may be
                    hollow places in which it can become stagnant. They can only be created in
                    situations where a flowing stream can in all seasons at pleasure be turned over
                    them. They are usually laid down by sowing them with <hi rend="italic">lolium
                    perenne</hi> or rye-grass, with about one part of red clover; and the sweepings
                    of the hay loft are abundantly scattered. As these meadows grow older, other
                    grasses appear; and in the later mowing of each year, a large portion of white
                    clover is always found. These meadows are well dunged every year, and the
                    omission of it, even once, is considered by good cultivators as an unpardonable
                    fault. Thus, if the other descriptions of land are not manured, it is because
                    all of them are sacrificed to the winter meadows. Everywhere are to be seen on
                    them heaps of manure, which are to be prepared during the summer, in order to be
                    carried out and equally spread over the surface in the autumn. Those who intend
                    to mow their meadows in the middle of December, carry the manure on them in the
                    latter end of September, and then begin watering them; but those who design to
                    mow them in January, carry on the manure at the end of October, or till the
                    middle of November. If sufficient manure be not obtained from the farm, either
                    ground rape-cake or ashes are used abundantly for the purpose, and thickly
                    scattered over the soil.</p>
                <p>The manure is separated as much as possible before the watering commences. At
                    first the water is turned over the meadows in very small quantity, that it may
                    produce the solution of the manure, and thus sink it down to the roots of the
                    plants before the force of the stream can carry it away. Afterwards the water is
                    let on in greater quantities, and especially when the temperature of the air is
                    below the freezing point. At such times the greatest attention is given to
                    create such a current of water as shall prevent it from freezing. If the cold is
                    sufficiently strong to form a thin coat of ice, which rarely happens, the water
                    is instantly withheld, and thus the soil remains free from frost, whilst a thin
                    sheet of ice covers it; and if the cold, as usual, is but for a few days, an
                    additional stream of warmer water melts the ice or carries it away, and the
                    grass remains uninjured, and continues to grow. If, however, the frost should be
                    so strong as to freeze the ground, the first mowing of the meadow would be lost;
                    but such occurrences are so very rare, that they are looked at without any
                    apprehension, nor are any precautions adopted by the cultivators.</p>
                <p>As the chief profit as well as the receipt of ready money to the cultivator
                    depends upon the cheese he makes, it becomes of great importance to him to have
                    an abundant supply of green food to produce the milk; and this, which the farmer
                    is afforded in the north of Europe by the use of turnips, mangel wurzel, or meal
                    in tepid water, is supplied in Lombardy, during ten or eleven months, by his
                    winter meadows. It is hence not a subject of surprise that every other portion
                    of his land is sacrificed by the Lombard farmer to the necessity of raising the
                    product of his winter permanent meadows to the highest possible state of
                    pro-ductivenesss.</p>
                <p>As the lands here spoken of are continually in a state of producing crops, they
                    would in time become exhausted in spite of the irrigation, if they were suffered
                    to remain without the application of abundant manure. Although some considerable
                    quantity of extraneous manure is to be procured from the large cities, by those
                    cultivators who carry on their operations near to them, or to the canals
                    connected with them, yet the larger portion is provided for by the live stock
                    which is maintained on the land. The chief labour of ploughing, except in a pail
                    of Pavia, is performed by oxen, and horses are used for the carts and waggons
                    only. The cows are kept in the best possible condition, in order to enable them
                    to yield milk in the greatest quantity, and of the richest quality. The number
                    of black cattle is • considerable, as will appear from the following official
                    account of what existed in 1823, since which they have much increased.</p>

                <p>As the number of young cattle is scarcely in due proportion to the cows and oxen,
                    it may not be amiss to mention in this place, that the Italians used at one
                    period to prefer the young cattle from Switzerland, and drew from thence a
                    considerable number annually; but of late years their own race has been greatly
                    improved, chiefly by the exertions of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193207572?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7572-0473"/> one
                    enlightened gentleman, Signor Dominico Berra, a follower of the system of our
                    countryman Bakewell, and the annual import of cattle has been diminishing for
                    the last twenty years. The numbers thus brought in of all kinds from 1815 to
                    1819, were more than 50,000 on the average of the five years. In the next five
                    years, from 1819 to 1824, the average number was 38,800. No official accounts of
                    the subsequent years could be obtained, but there is reason to believe that the
                    diminution had been progressive, and that at this time the number scarcely
                    amounts to 20,000 yearly. In the whole period, however, the stock on the land
                    has gone on gradually increasing.</p>
                <p>The whole of these animals are constantly fed in their stalls, or, if sent out to
                    graze, it is but for a very short period. The use of roots, such as turnips,
                    ruta baga, and mangel wurzel, is almost unnecessary, as the cattle can be
                    supplied with sufficient green food from the meadows the whole of the year. The
                    farms where the convertible husbandry is followed have abundance of litter from
                    the straw of the wheat, but especially from the leaves of the Indian com, which,
                    though good food whilst they are green, are, when they become dry, used in the
                    cattle-stalls for their bedding. Whilst this practice of stall-feeding has been
                    found by long experience the most favourable to the health of the cattle, it is
                    decidedly preferable on account of the vastly greater quantity of manure which
                    it produces. On all the meadow farms a great number of pigs are fattened on whey
                    mixed with the flour of Indian corn. These are put into the styes when they have
                    attained the weight of 100 or 110 pounds, and are kept there during five or six
                    months, till they attain the weight of 350 or 360 pounds. It is found that
                    twenty such pigs yield ample manure for four or four and a half acres of the
                    meadow-land. This kind of manure is highly esteemed for that purpose, but more
                    especially so when proper reservoirs are constructed, out of the influence of
                    the sun or the rain, for the preservation of the urine of the animals. In
                    Lombardy are many small occupiers of land, who have not a number of cows
                    sufficient to yield as much milk as will make a cheese daily. These sell their
                    milk to the cheese-makers near them. In their agreement for the milk for the
                    year, the purchaser contracts to keep in the seller’s styes a number of
                    fattening pigs, determined upon by a calculation of the quantity of milk which
                    the cows will yield. It is commonly believed that the number of swine annually
                    fattened by the meadow occupiers amounts to more than 140,000; and, from the
                    great application of the flesh to hams, bacon, and especially to sausages, it
                    does not appear to be an exaggerated estimate.</p>
                <p>In a country where the land is chiefly ploughed with oxen, and where, as in
                    Lombardy, much work is performed with the spade and the hoe, the number of other
                    beasts for draft will be proportionally inconsiderable. This is the case here,
                    as the following official account shows, as far as relates to the government of
                    Milan.</p>

                <p>So scanty a stock of this description of animals can yield but little manure, how
                    carefully soever it may be preserved; nor, with the addition made to it by the
                    226,479 sheep that are kept, will it bear any comparison with that arising from
                    the half million of black cattle.</p>
                <p>It deserves notice with reference to this subject, that the rural parts of
                    Lombardy exhibit but few houses except those of the mere peasantry. The
                    proprietors of even the smaller properties, though they may in some measure be
                    viewed in the light of cultivators, yet, placing their estates in other hands,
                    on the system of the <hi rend="italic">meta,</hi> seldom find it necessary to
                    reside on or near them, and are satisfied with visiting them at the seasons when
                    the produce is to be divided. When thé estates are of small or of moderate
                    extent, or when they are large and comprehend several farms, the superintendence
                    is intrusted to their agents. Such agents, also, in some cases, have the
                    disposal of the share of produce, and account for the proceeds to the
                    proprietors of the soil.</p>
                <p>The great body of the population who are in circumstances of even moderate ease
                    are thus collected in the cities and large towns; and in them is thus also
                    collected that mass of corrupted vegetable and animal substances which is most
                    adapted to the purposes of manure, and which is carefully preserved for that
                    application. The cities and towns thus contain a larger proportion of the whole
                    inhabitants than most of the other parts of Europe. If the numerical portion is
                    not greater, the portion who by their mode of living produce the greatest
                    quantities of exuviae, which are convertible into manure, is much larger. Such
                    of these substances as are of the liquid kind, or are the most easily reduced to
                    that form by putrefaction, are carried into the canals and rivers on which the
                    cities and towns are built; and, when their water is distributed over the first
                    fields with a gentle motion, to enrich them by the deposition of the matter they
                    contain in suspension, no other manure is required to be applied. Whilst the
                    lower grounds near the cities are refreshed by these means, the higher grounds
                    are supplied, with little expense of labour in the conveyance, from the
                    substances which retain a solid or less soluble form.</p>
                <p>The management of manure when collected is not so universally attended to as it
                    ought to be; but the best cultivators have adopted a plan that is found highly
                    beneficial, and is likely to be extended. Large sheds are built, sufficient to
                    cover the dung-hills. A bedding of mould is formed about one foot in thickness,
                    on which the dung is heaped to the height of five or six feet. The roof protects
                    the heap from the great quantity of rain which falls in the winter months, and
                    in an equal degree from the excessive drying influence of the sun during the
                    burning months of summer. The fermentation process is regulated from time to
                    time, as occasions require, by the application of the liquid matter from the
                    cattle, which is collected in the cess-pools near the stables and cattle-stalls.
                    Berra asserts that the most profitable money expended on a farm, is that which
                    is applied to building sheds for the reception of dung heaps. Whenever there is
                    an opportunity of doing so, the ashes collected from the bleachers of linen, and
                    those from the soapboilers, are abundantly used as manure, and are found
                    peculiarly beneficial for the grass land. It is necessary however to use them in
                    very dry weather, when they can be most equably scattered upon the' surface.
                    When the air is damp they run together into lumps, which it is difficult
                    afterwards to break.</p>
                <p>With the best farmers it is the custom every year to clean out the small canals
                    of irrigation that are formed in every part of the meadow-lands. These ditches
                    contain a compost of various earths, with a large quantity of vegetable and
                    animal matter produced by the decomposition of many organic substances. It is
                    obvious that each of these canals becomes a reservoir, in which is deposited the
                    fat <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207585?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-7585-0474"/> which the water has brought, and which being
                    mixed with the earth in them, must have a great degree of activity in promoting
                    vegetation by the portion of gas it generates, which forms the food of the
                    several kinds of plants.</p>
                <p>In some lands of an inferior quality, the practice of growing green crops, and
                    ploughing them in to form manure, has been introduced. A kind of bean called
                    fisole, a species of lupin, grows almost spontaneously on some of even the poor
                    soils. When they are cultivated they produce a large quantity of succulent
                    vegetable matter, which, when covered with earth, and mingled with it, forms an
                    excellent pabulum for other plants. By two operations of this kind in
                    succession, some of the poorest soils on the hills of moderate height have been
                    sufficiently enriched to bear profitable crops of wheat. There is a part of
                    Lombardy, not inconsiderable, where very little or no manure is applied to the
                    land, and yet it is cultivated with corn, though the crops grown are very
                    scanty. It is a portion of the delegation of Mantua, and not far from that city.
                    It is easily susceptible of irrigation, but the soil is one of the poorest
                    descriptions of sand. It is chiefly cultivated by small occupiers. These tenants
                    have no cattle of any kind, and the whole labour is performed by the sole use of
                    the spade and the hoe. Their dwellings and their clothing are of the most
                    wretched description; their food of the coarsest kind, and of that they have at
                    times a bare sufficiency. Their usual course of cropping is alternately with
                    Indian corn and wheat. The farms are from four to eight acres in extent, and are
                    divided into two equal parts, growing the two kinds of corn. One half of the
                    produce is delivered to the proprietor, out of which he pays the taxes, and the
                    other is for the subsistence of the occupier. In some cases the owner takes that
                    half which consists of wheat, and the tenant is supported on the Indian corn.
                    The value of these is nearly equal, as the price of wheat is commonly about one
                    third higher than that of maize, whilst the quantity of the latter exceeds that
                    of the former in about the same proportion. The maize is the sole food of the
                    farmer, and is more convenient to him, as it can be converted into aliment
                    without any other operation previous to its culinary application. It is by those
                    who use it deemed the most healthy food for the working classes. Although the
                    soil is poor, and little or no manure is applied, yet crops are raised, one half
                    of which maintains the labourers who are occupied on the soil, though in the
                    most wretched manner. As the maize is nearly three months in the earth, and the
                    wheat scarcely more than six months, there is an interval between the crops,
                    during which the soil, by being frequently turned over by the spade, imbibes a
                    certain portion of oxygen, which, with the addition of water by the irrigation,
                    furnishes food for the plants.</p>
                <p>A district adjoining to this, with a soil somewhat less sterile, but capable of
                    constant irrigation, is chiefly cultivated with rice, growing almost
                    continually, or with very short intervals, in the water. The inhabitants are
                    scarcely maintained on better or more abundant provisions; and, on account of
                    the maladies produced by the stagnant water, arc remarkable for their sickly
                    appearance, and for the short duration of their lives.</p>
                <p>Lombardy comprehends a large portion of the Alps within its limits. The elevated
                    pasture-lands on these mountains are stocked with cattle only during the summer
                    months. At that time the peasants take up their temporary residence in the
                    chalets, and there convert the milk of the cattle into butter and cheese, as is
                    practised in the adjoining Swiss cantons. The dung of the cattle serves to
                    refresh the pastures during the summer, but no extraneous manure is ever applied
                    to them.</p>
                <p>Some mineral manures are used, the most important of which is gypsum, which is
                    ground in mills, and then scattered on the clovers and the grass. Lime is used
                    as a manure in some of the provinces. It is laid on the ground in heaps in
                    October, and covered with the soil; and after the sowing of wheat, the compost
                    with the lime, completely slaked, is spread over the field. The quantity of lime
                    is very small.</p>
                <p>In taking a view of the amount of the produce of land in Lombardy, it may be best
                    to begin with the estimate of the marciti, or winter-watered meadows. These are
                    commonly mowed four, five, and even six times in the year; but it is not very
                    easy to determine the quantity of hay they yield, because the chief portion of
                    their produce is consumed by the cattle in the stalls, in the form of grass. One
                    of the most accurate of the practical cultivators (Berra, already mentioned) has
                    constructed a weighing bridge at his farm, over which every load of grass
                    brought from his meadows, as well as the manure carried on them, is weighed and
                    registered. According to him, the average produce, for a series of years, has
                    been as follows. They are kept by him in the weights and measures of the
                    country, but are here reduced into English hundredweights, and English statute
                    acres.</p>

                <p>That is, 560f cwts., or 30 loads.</p>
                <p>The whole of the grass which is cut in January and in September is eaten in the
                    green state, and the hay is made almost exclusively from what is cut in May and
                    July. In what is converted into hay, it is found that there is a loss of weight
                    by drying equal to three fourths. It is supposed that, from its containing so
                    much more water, the grass cut in January and September would lose five sixths
                    of its weight, and that cut in March four fifths. This view would give six loads
                    of the finest hay as the annual produce of an English acre. There is good reason
                    to believe that this may be near an accurate estimate, because the best meadows
                    frequently, in the two mowings of May and July, yield more than at the rate of
                    five loads per acre; but these are in the vicinity of the city of Milan, where
                    the water that irrigates them is more fully impregnated with the rich drains
                    from the city than that at a greater distance from it. From the last mowing in
                    the beginning of September, till the end of November, the cows are fed on the
                    meadows. Thus to the estimated crops of hay must be added the value of this
                    pasture for the cattle during about two months. The usual price for the best hay
                    in the cities is about 40s. sterling the load. The cost of making it, where the
                    weather is so settled as it usually is in Lombardy, must be trifling, and that
                    with the mowing and carrying cannot exceed the value of the after-feeding, so
                    that each acre will give a profit of L.12 sterling annually. It is not then
                    surprising that such land can be sold as high as 1000 lire the portica, or L.200
                    sterling the English acre, an occurrence by no means unusual.</p>
                <p>The profit of these meadows does not arise from the sale of hay, which, in a
                    country where few horses are kept for pleasure, must necessarily be very
                    insignificant, but from the fattening of cattle in a small degree, and the
                    operations of the dairy as the most important pursuit. The dairies are
                    extensive, and carried on with the greatest care, and most scrupulous attention
                    to cleanliness. The dairy-farms in the three provinces of Milan, Lodi, and
                    Pavia, are mostly occupied by persons of competent capital; many by the
                    proprietors, and the rest by tenants who are not metayers, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193207598?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7598-0475"/> but have
                    leases for a term never exceeding nine years, at a fixed money rent. They,
                    unlike the farmers in other parts, are the owners of the live stock, and of the
                    implements of husbandry, and have comfortable dwellings, moderately furnished,
                    and are well informed and active, and with diligence unite much economy.</p>
                <p>The dairies of the three delegations of Milan, Lodi, and . Pavia occupy the
                    second place in the lists of articles as regards the amount, that become the
                    exportable productions of the Milan division of Lombardy. The cheese
                    distinguished by the name of Parmesan is to be found in most parts of Europe,
                    and has long enjoyed a great reputation. It may perhaps have been originally, or
                    at some early period, made in the duchy from which it derives its name. It is
                    not now known in Italy by that name,’ but bears that of the delegation where the
                    most of it is produced. It is commonly called <hi rend="italic">Fromaggio
                    Lodisana.</hi> At the present day little or none of it is made in Parma. The
                    annual export of this cheese to foreign countries amounted to 1,800,000 pounds
                    in the year 1824, and in each succeeding year has gone on increasing, besides
                    what is consumed in the Italian and German provinces of the Austrian empire.</p>
                <p>The operative part of making the cheese is confined to experienced practical men,
                    who acquire a tact that enables them to time the several steps of the process
                    with great accuracy, and, without the aid of a thermometer, to ascertain the
                    requisite heat of the materials in each of these steps. From the nature of the
                    climate, the milk will not keep long, but a cheese must be made every day. The
                    cheeses are most valuable when they are large; and as the greater number of
                    farmers have not milk sufficient to make such a cheese daily, the milk is sent
                    by them to other farmers, so as to make up the requisite quantity. Thus, on one
                    farm near Lodi (Tavazzano), where only twenty-seven cows are kept, the milk is
                    sent very early to a neighbouring farm, where sixty-three cows are kept.
                    Sometimes four, or five, or more, small farms contribute their day’s milk to one
                    who has more stock, to make the cheese; and there are instances where the
                    cazarro or cheese-maker buys the whole of the milk from which his cheese is
                    made.</p>
                <p>The cows arc milked evenings and mornings, in the first case about five or six
                    o’clock, in the second at daybreak, or just before. The milk of the evening is
                    skimmed of what cream has risen on it before eight o’clock, and the milk of the
                    morning, of that small quantity which is thrown up between day-break and that
                    hour, and from that cream butter is made. Though the Parmesan cheese is thus
                    made from skimmed milk, yet a very large portion of the cream is still left in
                    it to enrich the cheese. The milk is then placed in a kettle, and warmed to the
                    heat of 22° Fahrenheit, when the rennet is applied, the effect of which is
                    increased by a small addition of vinegar, and sometimes of grated cheese, and a
                    very small quantity of pepper. The. other parts of the process so much resemble
                    the practices in the best dairy-farms in England, as not to require any special
                    notice.</p>
                <p>It is salted after it is made, by sprinkling the surface with that substance
                    daily during six weeks, and turning the cheese to imbibe the particles. These
                    cheeses vary in weight when fit for sale, from fifty-two to 122 pounds
                    avoirdupois. They are kept some time before they arc sold, a few at eight
                    months, some at one or two years old, a less number at three, and a few at four
                    years old. It requires much care to preserve the cheese against the heat of the
                    climate. At Codogno and Corsica, where the wholesale trade is carried on, there
                    are large magazines on the groundfloor, twenty feet in height, with shelves
                    around, on which each cheese is placed singly. They have large windows, which
                    are carefully shut to exclude the sun the whole day, but are opened during the
                    night. It is difficult to estimate correctly the average quantity of butter and
                    cheese produced from a given number of cows. In one farm (Meleg-nanello) in the
                    province of Lodi, there were on the farm ninety-one cows, from which were made
                    173 cheeses, varying in weight from fifty to 120 pounds, but the weight of which
                    the man who made them averaged at 100 pounds each. These had been made in the
                    preceding six months and a half. Supposing the remainder of the year to be
                    equally productive, the whole herd would have yielded on an average at the rate
                    of 370 pounds in the year. There was, however, no certain accounts of the
                    quantity of butter made on the farm during the period; and the quantity of
                    cheese alone, though correct, does not give any certain data upon which to frame
                    an estimate of the productiveness of the animals. The proportion which the
                    cheese bears to the butter varies in the different irrigated provinces. Thus,
                    according to the estimate of the accurate Signor Berra,</p>

                <p>A writer in a periodical work, <hi rend="italic">Annali</hi><hi rend="italic">di
                    Agricoltu</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">a,</hi> gives
                    the medium product of each cow to be 416 pounds of cheese and 178 pounds of
                    butter yearly. Another person, a practical and accurate man, who had passed much
                    time in examining every portion of the agriculture of the Austrian Italian
                    dominions, gave, as the result of his investigation, a calculation framed from
                    data collected from a considerable number of farms of various extent. According
                    to him, the annual produce from each cow is from 102 to 120 pounds of butter,
                    and from 340 to 392 pounds of cheese. As the informant was perfectly master of
                    the local weights and measures, which vary in each of the provinces of Austrian
                    Italy, some credit may be given to the estimate; and the more so, because it
                    makes the produce of the dairies the lowest, though it far exceeds any returns
                    of the produce of those of Holland, England, or Germany.</p>
                <p>The farms in these provinces are generally small. One of 250 English acres would
                    be denominated large; and though there are a few that exceed that extent,’ yet
                    the greater portion of the irrigable land is occupied by farms much below,one
                    half of that extent. Amongst the occupations that are confined exclusively to
                    the <hi rend="italic">marciti</hi> or winter-watered meadows, many, perhaps the
                    greater part, do not exceed forty acres. As the farms are small, so there are
                    very few proprietors. The family of Luoghi Pii have the greatest tract of the
                    best land in the province of Milan, divided into many farms, and said to amount
                    to 3000 acres. No other exceeds one third of that extent.</p>
                <p>The value and the rent of land depend less upon the natural fertility than upon
                    the local situation, on the power of irrigation it can command, and on the
                    capital expended on making roads to it, fences around it, and in erecting houses
                    and agricultural buildings. In the vicinity of the city of Milan, those
                    winter-watered meadows have the greatest value which are to the south, and are
                    watered from the canal of Vettabbia, whose water is furnished by the Riviere
                    Seveso and canal of Martìsana, which flow through the city, and bring with them
                    the precious manure of that populous place. The present price of such land is
                    about L.130 sterling the English acre; and, if it has good roads and buildings,
                    may be let to good tenants at from L.6 to L.7 per acre. The land which has not
                    sufficient irrigating power to form winter meadows, but enough for the purposes
                    of convertible husbandry, is worth from L.50 to L.60 per English acre, and may
                    be let at from 60s. to 70s. per acre. In these cases the taxes and repairs are
                    paid by the proprietor, as well as the contributions collected for keeping <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193207611?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7611-0476"/> in
                    proper repair the canal by which water is conveyed. Some parts of the irrigable
                    provinces have lands of inferior natural quality, but being on the banks of the
                    Po, are well calculated to grow rice, by their capability of being constantly
                    flooded. An estate of that description in the province of Pavia, with four acres
                    of winter meadow-land, five acres of land in convertible husbandry, with
                    sufficient for the purpose of occasional irrigation, fifty acres of rice land,
                    and a house, garden, and homestead of two acres, was lately sold at L.2000
                    sterling, or nearly L.33 per acre. It was doubtful if the purchaser would occupy
                    it or let it, but it was thought a rent might be obtained of somewhat more than
                    L.100 per annum, the owner, as in other cases, paying the government territorial
                    tax.</p>
                <p>The value of land is much affected by the rate of the territorial taxation. This
                    is founded on a very old valuation, and the parts that were then in a very high
                    state of cultivation and irrigation must contribute in proportion to that state,
                    whilst the properties that have since been reclaimed, either by irrigation,
                    manuring, or by planting mulberry-trees, or vines, or other valuable trees, pay
                    a less rate, and are consequently of greater value. In the provinces of Milan,
                    Lodi, and Pavia, where the great steps in irrigation were made before the
                    valuation which is now acted upon was framed, the territorial and commune
                    imposts amount to nearly twelve shillings per annum for an English acre, on an
                    average of the whole land, and consequently they are much higher on that of the
                    greatest value. This circumstance alone makes it difficult for a stranger to
                    generalize with any accuracy the value of land, or the rent of it in due
                    proportion to the amount of the sum invested on it. An opinion generally
                    prevails, that the capital laid out in land might be assumed to pay an annual
                    rate of interest of about four per cent., but that as most of the rent, with the
                    exception of the irrigated provinces, was paid in produce, those who employed
                    factors to manage their property, or who managed it themselves, without great
                    judgment and perpetual watchfulness could scarcely calculate on obtaining more
                    than, if so much as, three per cent.</p>
                <p>It may serve to give some idea of the difficulty of ascertaining the amount of
                    the rent of land, if a slight view be taken of the description of the classes of
                    persons occupied in cultivation. The first of these somewhat resembles the
                    middle-man now generally to be found in Ireland. They rent large portions of
                    land at a money price, and either let it out again to sub-tenants, who work it,
                    if in small lots, by means of their own family, with an additional servant or
                    two, or, if large, by day-labourers and their families, who are established on
                    the property.</p>
                <p>The next class is called <hi rend="italic">Affiÿuoli,</hi> or farmers. These are
                    the most advantageous to the proprietors, and they are tolerably numerous, as
                    well in the Venetian as in the Lombard provinces. In this class is comprehended
                    the farmers in the watered provinces, whose chief object is the making of
                    cheese, in some cases combined with the culture of rice. These lay out large
                    sums at first, and have a good stock of cattle and utensils, and a sufficiency
                    of capital. The advantage of this class to the proprietor is obvious. They take
                    from him the labour of superintendence, and all risks from failing years and
                    from loss of cattle; and, having leases renewed every nine years, they can have
                    no inducement to destroy the fertility of the soil. Though many of them have
                    more extent of land, the greater proportion may be described as occupying from
                    seven to twenty-five acres.</p>
                <p>The third, and by far the largest class of all, are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coloni,</hi> colonists, sometimes called <hi rend="italic">Pigíonanti
                    Chiusuranti,</hi> who occupy from three quarters of an acre to an acre and a
                    half of land, with a cottage, or more correctly a hovel. These premises they
                    take either of the proprietors, of the middle-man, or of the farmers, and pay a
                    rent by a share of the produce. They are in fact day-labourers, and, besides
                    what they pay in produce, must work for their superior at a lower than the
                    customary rate of wages. Some of these, however, have a little larger extent of
                    land, but rarely so much as two acres. Such a one pays to his superior a fixed
                    quantity of corn yearly, or commutes that for money, and an agreed proportion of
                    the other products, such as wine, or in many cases the whole of it is divided.
                    When these shares are not too small, and the ground is fruitful, the most common
                    custom is to pay a distinct measure of corn, and the half of the wine. The
                    meadow-land is paid for in money, in silk-worms’ eggs, or in cocoons. The
                    cattle, perhaps a cow and a donkey, are furnished to the colonist on credit, and
                    if his terms are favourable, and he gets forward, he becomes the proprietor of
                    them, as well as of the utensils; but if the land is unproductive, or the shares
                    of the proprietor too great, he must give up the cattle and the utensils, and
                    may then be permitted to continue on the land, giving to the proprietor at least
                    one half the produce, or, if the crops prove heavy, a still larger share.</p>
                <p>The farmers of the great estates in the watered provinces are in prosperous
                    circumstances, and generally well educated persons; and their chief occupation
                    consists in overlooking the workmen, and making the due bargains for the
                    disposal of their produce. They are also necessarily furnished with some
                    capital, as a proof of which, one near Lodi, occupying a farm of 250 English
                    acres, upon which were fifty-eight cows, a bull, and eight horses, and who had
                    on hand the cheese made in the six preceding months, asserted that the value of
                    his stock exceeded eight hundred pounds sterling. On that farm there are
                    twenty-two families of day-labourers. Six or seven men, the heads <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> those families, are in the constant employment of the
                    occupier, either as herdsmen, ostlers, or stable-servants. All the rest and the
                    females and children are only employed when there is work to be done, for which
                    they are paid daily wages, viz. to the men about fourpence halfpenny a day, to
                    the women threepence, and to the children from twopence to threepence, according
                    to the age or strength. They have also one meal a day, consisting of rice and
                    beans, but no wine, and only milk one day in the year. Some of them are
                    occupied, on fixed terms, in rearing articles that require a great portion of
                    labour to prepare them, and receive a proportion of the product. Thus, of flax
                    they receive one half, of maize one third or one fourth, and of rice one
                    seventh. Their condition is generally very wretched, though when not wanted they
                    may get occasional wages on neighbouring farms. They are, however, frequently in
                    want of the common necessaries of life, are miserably clothed and housed, in
                    case of sickness can obtain no medical relief, and are utterly destitute of
                    instruction. In spite of the checks, the population is as rapidly increasing as
                    in those parts of Europe where the labourers are placed in more favourable
                    circumstances. The only alleviation to their accustomed wretchedness is but a
                    temporary one during the time the silk-worms areat work, or have finished their
                    spinning, and the silk is to be wound from the cocoons. In most of their
                    habitations they hatch a few eggs if they can find money or credit to buy
                    mulberry leaves; and if not, they have some occupation in winding the silk for
                    those who are a little better situated.</p>
                <p>In those provinces of Lombardy which are not to any extent capable of irrigation,
                    there are few large farms, and no substantial or intelligent farmers. The
                    greater portion of the land is divided into small allotments of a few acres,
                    either directly by the proprietors, or through the management of middle-men. The
                    real cultivators, called also colonists <hi rend="italic">(coloni),</hi> with
                    their wives and children, perform all the labour, and contract to deliver half
                    of the raw produce <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207624?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-7624-0477"/> I to the proprietor. Their condition must be
                    worse than that of day-labourers in other countries. It is obvious to any person
                    who haâ attended to the subject of husbandry in any part of Europe, that the
                    cost of labour in cultivating corn must amount to more than half the value of
                    the produce where the labour is in part performed by horses or oxen; but in this
                    case all is done by human hands, and it must be of more real cost, and
                    consequently the landlord draws more from the land than his due proportion, and
                    that is at the cost of the sweat of the brow of his tenant. On land in England
                    of such a quality as to bear three quarters of wheat per acre, and which could
                    be sold at 56s. per quarter, no farmer would contract to pay one half or one
                    quarter of that quantity as rent, even if the landlord paid the taxes; and the
                    corn-land in Lombardy requires quite as much labour as it does in England. The
                    rapid increase of population, and the difficulty of day-labourers finding
                    employment, are such, that no proprietor finds himself at a loss to get
                    occupiers on the metayer principle. It may perhaps arise from the nature of
                    these contracts, that the owners )f land are rarely the cultivators. The fewwho
                    have attempted to cultivate have soon discovered, that though by hiring
                    Jjay-labourers, and farming in a better style, they obtain more raw produce,
                    they draw from their estates much less net proceeds than they can now extract
                    from them by means of the slovenly cultivation of their ignorant and suffering
                    colonists. This description of tenants are as much bound :o continue in their
                    state of poverty and dependence as he slaves on the estates in Russia, or those
                    who were till ∙ecendy feudatories under the nobles of Germany. If the rifling
                    property they possess is merely equal to the debt hey owe their landlord, it is
                    impossible for them to rénové; and if they could remove in a state of
                    destitution, t would be difficult to procure land elsewhere. The mo- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> al degradation produced by this system is not one of
                    the east evils it generates. A constant struggle is going on <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">ό</hi> defraud the proprietor of that part of the share which
                    is conditioned to be delivered to him, and the tenant feels no remorse at the
                    fraud, but justifies it to himself by the hard :erms upon which the land is let
                    to him. All friendly intercourse is destroyed, the proprietor looks on the
                    colonist as ι thief, and the latter views the former as an oppressor. Γhe
                    depravity thus begotten tends to fill the country with ιuιnerous offenders
                    against the laws, chiefly amongst the ’ uined colonists, who have nothing left
                    when expelled rom their narrow pieces of land but to take refuge in open cr
                    secret robbery.</p>
                <p>The picture here exhibited, though a representation of he far greater portion of
                    the peasantry of Lombardy, has orne, but not numerous exceptions. Instead of one
                    or wo acres of land, a few tenants have from fifteen to twen- .y acres, and are
                    enabled to keep two or three cows, vhich are stall-fed, and perhaps a horse or a
                    mule. The cattle and utensils are thcir own property. They pay a noderate
                    money-rent for the corn-land, and divide with the andlord in equal portions the
                    wine, and the cocoons of the silk-worms. Such persons, if they perform the work
                    by he members of their own families, subsist chiefly on maize, ιse none of the
                    wine, and otherwise practise the most rigid economy, though they do not become
                    rich, may live in ι respectable and comfortable manner when compared vith that
                    in which the great body of the same class exist.</p>
                <p>On the whole, the condition of the great mass of the <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> colonists is very far inferior to that of the lowest class of
                    ιgricultural labourers in England, France, or Germany, ιnd nearly resembles that
                    of the most wretched of the cotiers of Ireland.</p>
                <p>The ‘chief product which is furnished by Lombardy to external commerce is silk,
                    which interests more or less I every family in the country, and receives the
                    greatest share )f general attention. As the quantity and the quality of the silk
                    depend on the worms that spin it, the subsistence of those worms becomes an
                    object which engrosses much consideration. The leaves of the mulberry-tree are
                    exclusively the food of the worms, and the greater weight of these leaves that
                    can be gathered, the greater is the silk that is produced. In many parts are
                    numerous nurseries, where those leaves are raised, with most careftd
                    cultivation, from seed. The beds in which the seed is sown are well and deeply
                    ploughed or dug the year before, and manured with the most powerful substances.
                    It is at last dug once more, made as fine and as level as possible, and the seed
                    is then sown in rows about eight or ten inches from each other. It is slightly
                    covered with earth, and also with hay and straw, the latter to protect it
                    equally from the slight frosts which occasionally appear in winter, or from the
                    excessive droughts which frequently occur in summer. In very dry weather they
                    are watered as becomes necessary. As the plants grow, they are carefully weeded
                    with the hoe, and are also thinned out. They grow but little in the first year,
                    but considerably in the second, at the end of which, or at the beginning of the
                    third year, they are transplanted from the seed-bed to the nurserygarden, and
                    cut close to the eye. In the next year they are again cut close, and the stump
                    grafted. In the fourth year, when the new shoots have formed what is to be the
                    crown of the tree, they are cut into a hollow so as to resemble a basin, which
                    is found the best shape, both for the fruit and the leaves. In the fifth year
                    they are generally sold; or, when the nursery is kept by one who means to plant
                    them on his own property, they are transplanted to the hedgerows or other spots
                    where they are intended permanently to remain. The growth of the plant up to
                    this period depends mainly on the manure which is applied to the nursery, but
                    generally they have attained a diameter of from four to five inches.</p>
                <p>The wild mulberry, or <hi rend="italic">Morus</hi><hi rend="italic">Alba,</hi>
                    yields the best leaves for the nourishment of the worms, and the silk they spin
                    whilst feeding upon them is of the finest quality; but the quantity of leaves
                    they yield is so small, that it requires a great outlay and a great number of
                    trees to give sustenance to an extensive silk establishment; on which account
                    they are grafted with other kinds of mulberry-trees, which have larger and
                    dark-green leaves, and in such abundance that they yield at least double the
                    weight of leaves. Attempts are now making, and experiments in progress, for
                    obtaining a new genus of the mulberry-trees, which may unite abundance of leaves
                    with greater fineness in the silk. According to Moretti, professor of botany at
                    Milan, the finest silk is obtained from the wild ungrafted mulberry-tree, the
                    next finest from one of a new genus produced by his experiments, the third from
                    the grafted white mulberry, and the coarsest from the black mulberry. The fruit
                    of none of these trees is in any estimation. In order to procure more .leaves,
                    the cultivators of the trees, every fourth year after the leaves have been
                    stripped, cut off all the smaller branches quite close to the principal ones. In
                    the succeeding year the leaves are not taken from the new shoots, but they are
                    in the next and following years; and in the fourth year, when the shoots have
                    attained a diameter of four inches, they are as bushy and thick as if they had
                    not been tapped.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to form an average of the produce of mulberry leaves from each
                    tree, as much depends on the soil, but more upon the age of the tree. As soon as
                    they have attained six inches in diameter, they yield from 19 to 27 lbs., and
                    continually increase their produce till they attain a diameter of two feet, when
                    they yield from 220 to 260 lbs. Having then attained their full growth, they
                    continue to increase in produce till they yield in some cases, but extreme ones,
                    as much as 500 lbs. The market prices of the leaves undergo a great fluctuation,
                    varying <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207637?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-7637-0478"/> sometimes one hundred per cent in a fortnight. In
                    J une of the year 1833 they were sold at 3s. the hundredweight, and two weeks
                    before at 7s.</p>
                <p>Some persons who have none, and others who have but few mulberry-trees, yet breed
                    silk-worms. They are careful to make contracts for what they expect to want, in
                    March or April, when they are cheapest. It not unfrequently happens that by a
                    storm of hail, which is not an unusual occurrence, the price is so raised that
                    the breeder, instead of drawing a profit from his operations, finds he has paid
                    more for the leaves than he can obtain for the cocoons. There are persons so
                    skilful in estimating in the spring the weight of leaves which each tree will
                    produce, that their assistance is commonly resorted to by those who make
                    bargains for the leaves. When the first signs of life begin in the worms they
                    eat very little, but when they begin to spin they require a considerable
                    quantity of food. The price of leaves naturally rises very high; and if at that
                    time a hail-storm should occur, the advance becomes most ruinous to those who
                    are compelled to purchase. In general the mulberry-trees are, by the terms of
                    the leases, let to-the farmers or colonists, who divide the cocoons equally with
                    the proprietors of the land. The tenant provides half the eggs, and superintends
                    the insects, feeding them, and keeping them clean whilst they are working; the
                    other half of the eggs, as well as the leaves, are the contributions of the
                    landlord to this equally joint-stock concern. The tenant estimates what worms
                    can be nourished by the quantity of leaves the trees upon his farm will feed,
                    and the two parties procure the estimated weight of eggs. If the tenant
                    miscalculates, or if a hail-storm destroys his calculation, he is bound to
                    purchase such a portion of leaves as will subsist the insects through their
                    working period.</p>
                <p>The planting of mulberry-trees, and the consequent produce of silk, have been
                    favoured by circumstances which have naturally led to a rapid extension of every
                    branch of that trade. It is an object of attraction to every grade of society,
                    from the greatest landholder to the lowest of the colonists and day-labourers;
                    and these have all been stimulated by the constantly advancing price of the raw
                    silk in each year from the return of tranquillity in the year 1814 to the
                    present time; but the most striking advances of price were those which took
                    place from 1820 to 1822. From the vast number of trees, only an approximation to
                    the rate of increase can be made. It has, however, been ascertained of late,
                    that three fourths of all the mulberry-trees of Lombardy are of less than thirty
                    years growth, and that one half of that three fourths, consequently thirtyseven
                    per cent, of the whole, are under fifteen years of age.</p>
                <p>The greater portion of the mulberry-trees in Lombardy are to be found in the dry
                    provinces, though some few are planted in the irrigated districts. From the city
                    of Milan to Varese, from that city to Como, between Lecco and Bergamo, quite to
                    the river Adda, the cultivation of vines has almost everywhere given place to
                    that of mulberry-trees. One of the finest views in Italy is from the high ground
                    about Bergamo, which comprehends the hills of Brescia and Bergamo, and the
                    extended plain of Lombardy. Around the city the appearance is that of an
                    extensive orchard or fruit-garden; but the trees are planted chiefly for the
                    leaves, and are found, with less annual expense, more profitable than any trees
                    cultivated for their fruit. The lowest calculation of the average profit of the
                    trees makes it, including all ages, from five to fifty years old, nearly six
                    shillings sterling from each tree annuJly.</p>
                <p>In the lower parts of Lombardy, in the irrigated provinces of Milan, Pavia, and
                    Lodi, the cultivation of mulberry-trees, and the consequent breeding of
                    silk-worms, are by no means extensive; yet, even in each of these of late an
                    increase has taken place, and preparations are made, by which it is calculated
                    that in three years the number of the trees will become double what they are at
                    present. The greater number of mulberry-trees are at this time to be seen on the
                    sterile and strong soil in the province of Verona, especially between that
                    capital and Desenzano, and from Castelnuovo, through Vallego, quite to
                    Rover-bello. The surface of these districts consists of masses of pebbles,
                    rounded by having been washed down at some remote period from the neighbouring
                    Alps, and in which the culture of corn will scarcely repay the cost of the
                    labour devoted to it. As much land is mingled with these stones, which is
                    favourable to the mulberry-trees, vast numbers have been everywhere planted. A
                    prejudice is said to prevail in these districts against the practice of
                    engrafting, and that owing to it the quantity of leaves does not bear the same
                    proportion to the number of the trees, as in the other parts of Lombardy.</p>
                <p>The eggs of the silk-worms are not preserved by all those who manage their
                    working, but are made an object of trade by a few persons whose establishments
                    are upon so large a scale as to make it worthy their attention, and who, when
                    preserving for themselves, collect greater quantities for sale. They are sold by
                    weight, generally at about two shillings the English ounce; and some individuals
                    have collected in one year as much as 2500 ounces, though one tenth of that
                    weight is nearer the average of the whole of the several producers. The eggs are
                    divided into three classes. The worm from the first of them casts its skin four
                    times, and is of a large size, and an ounce contains 24,024 eggs. Supposing each
                    egg to produce a caterpillar, and each caterpillar a cocoon, as 110 cocoons
                    weigh a pound, the whole ounce of eggs will yield 218 pounds of cocoons. The
                    second also casts its skin, but the animal is of a smaller size, as are the
                    cocoons; an ounce of them contains 25,185 eggs, and the cocoons produced from
                    them weigh less, 216 being a pound, and consequently the whole weight of the
                    cocoons is only ninety-six pounds. The third class casts its skin but three
                    times, an ounce contains 31,004 eggs, 440 cocoons weigh about a pound, and the
                    whole weight of the cocoons is only about seventy pounds.</p>
                <p>In every house, room is made for laying out the worms as soon as any symptoms of
                    life appear, and in even the poorest cottages of the colonists, who have but a
                    single apartment, it is so contrived that some space is allotted to them, and
                    the inhabitants shift as well as they can during three weeks or a month. Tables
                    of reed are formed, about two feet and a half in breadth, and from fifteen to
                    eighteen feet in length. These are suspended from the roof, the upper shelf two
                    feet below it, and others at a foot distance, with the lowest of them two feet
                    from the floor. The window's are made of paper, to prevent currents of cold air,
                    and too great heat; the shutters are of straw, and the door consists of a piece
                    of old linen cloth. Within, the place is kept in darkness, except when the worms
                    are to be fed or the place cleaned out, when lamps are used. In many of these
                    places, thermometers, made for the express purpose, are kept to ascertain the
                    temperature. They are made of spirits of wine, and show no other change of heat
                    than that between the 16th and 20th degrees of Reaumur, to which limits it is
                    deemed necessary to confine their range of temperature. In the houses where
                    there are none of these simple instruments, habit has given a tact, by which the
                    people ascertain the degree of heat with tolerable accuracy.</p>
                <p>Some of the colonists within a season produce as much as 140 pounds of cocoons.
                    Taking their half of them at seventy pounds, and estimating them at the average
                    price (for there is great variation in the price), viz. two shillings and
                    threepence per pound, it will yield for a month’s labour <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193207650?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7650-0479"/> near eight
                    pounds, which is an enormous sum for persons in that condition of life in that
                    country. From it, however, must often be deducted the cost of leaves, when the
                    landlord’s trees do not yield as much sustenance for the insects as the tenant
                    has calculated when purchasing the eggs.</p>
                <p>The rapid growth of these insects is one of those singularities in natural
                    history which seemed to be worth 'collecting and recording, as is also the
                    increased space they occupy, and the increased portion of food they devour, in
                    the several periods of their short existence. From their escape from the shell
                    to their death is commonly thirty-two days, which is usually divided into five
                    periods, according to the change observable in them, thus:</p>

                <p>As the leaves are kept at least one day, and sometimes nore, after they are
                    gathered, they have lost by drying sixty-one pounds, and by cleaning from dirt
                    and small sticks eighty-three pounds, so that to supply this food 939 pounds of
                    leaves must have been procured. It is found in cleaning the insects, that the
                    remains of the leaves which are not consumed, consisting of thick stalks in the
                    middle of each leaf, and some of the relics, weigh 329 pounds. Thus the actual
                    food is 465 pounds. According to those experiments, as seventy pounds of cocoons
                    were procured from the ounce of eggs, each pound must have required 11⅛o^ pounds
                    of leaves as they come from the trees, or fi⅛⅛ θf real vegetable nourishment.
                    The obtaining the cocoons is a step of great importance in the whole operation
                    of procuring the silk. With the small producers, and it is they who, after all,
                    furnish the far greater quantity, their labours are for the most part at an end,
                    as they generally sell them to other persons, who make the winding the silk, and
                    the subsequent operations to fit it for the manufacturer, a distinct trade.
                    There are, however, some few large establishments, in which the silk-worms are
                    nursed, and in which the cocoons are wound off, and all the steps taken to
                    prepare the silk for market. It would lead to some very long description and
                    discussion, to show satisfactorily and accurately the relation which exists
                    between the quantity of leaves and the weight and number of cocoons, and also
                    the relation between the number and weight of cocoons, and the actual weight of
                    silk prepared for the manufacturer. It has been minutely discussed by Dandolo,
                    with whose results this part of the subject may now be closed. One hundred
                    pounds weight of cocoons yield about eight pounds and one third of silk. The
                    thread drawn from each cocoon must be about 800 feet long to weigh a grain. Each
                    of such cocoons yields nearly one grain and a half of silk. One pound of them
                    will produce in length 17,600 feet. It requires about one hundred and fifty
                    pounds of mulberry leaves to produce one pound of silk.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to ascertain the quantity or the value of the silk annually
                    produced at present from the soil of that part of Lombardy contained in what is
                    now within the boundaries of the government of Milan. Much of it is consumed
                    within that government. A much larger portion is sent, without any official
                    notice, to be manufactured in Austria Proper, in Bohemia, and in Hungary. The
                    greater part of what goes to the Prussian factories on the Lower Rhine, as well
                    as that for France and for the English market, passes by land-carriage; and the
                    accounts, not being kept for purposes of revenue, arc not collected with
                    exactness, nor brought into a focus. The only account whose authenticity can be
                    relied on, is an official paper transmitted to Vienna for the year 1824, since
                    which period the growth of silk has been constantly and extensively
                    increasing.</p>

                    taken of the results of those other operations of agriculture, which are almost
                    exclusively confined to domestic consumption.</p>
                <p>Amongst corn, that most extensively grown is maize. It is the chief nourishment
                    of the working classes, and is deemed by them the most healthy and most
                    strengthening of all grain. It has, too, the advantage of being most easily
                    converted into wholesome food, requiring, unlike wheat, no assistance from the
                    baker. It requires only a kettle and a little fuel to make it into polenta, a
                    kind of thick pudding or gruel, which, without any addition, forms the common
                    food of the peasantry. It is also a valuable product on other accounts. The
                    grains in a green state are a substitute for green peas; the leaves, when fresh,
                    are a fodder, on which cattle eagerly feed, and, when dry, they are used to make
                    excellent beds, or rather mattresses; the stalks are used for fuel in that
                    country, where fuel is scarce; and, finally, the feathery tops are converted
                    into brushes for sweeping the houses.</p>
                <p>This article is also cheaper than wheat, being commonly sold at about two thirds
                    the price of that grain; but, from its being the food of the far greater part of
                    the population, in seasons of great scarcity, such as those following the
                    harvest of 1816 and 1828, the indispensable demand for it caused the price to
                    rise higher than that of wheat. From the circumstances here stated, more than
                    one third of all the arable land of Lombardy is destined to the cultivation of
                    this grain, and the average product per acre is greater than that of wheat. It
                    is grown almost indiscriminately on all kinds of soil; and the nature of the
                    climate is but little regarded, as it is to be seen equally on the cold hills,
                    and in the warm valleys of the provinces. The culture of it does not appear to
                    have received any improvement since its first introduction. It is in some cases
                    sown broadcast, and covered in with the plough. From this mode of sowing it, it
                    can only be cleared of weeds by hand, and the earth is thrown round the plants
                    in the same way; whereas, in the countries where it is sown in rows or drills,
                    these operations can be more advantageously performed by appropriate
                    instruments. The expense of this hand-hoeing and shovelling up the earth is said
                    to be equal to the value of one third of the gross product of the crop. It is
                    customary, after the bloom is off, to strip the plant of its leaves, and also to
                    cut the stalks above the cobs or ears, which, if not done too early, is not
                    injurious to the grain. There are several species of this plant. The most common
                    is that with a large yellow grain, whose cobs grow about half way up the stalk,
                    and which ripens in three months, if sown in the month of May. If it cannot be
                    sown so early, or if it is sown after a crop of flax, or on clover after the
                    first mowing, it is usual to sow another kind called brigantino, whose grains
                    are smaller, and of a darkish brown colour. In the vicinity of Bergamo, the
                    greatest quantity of maize is of this kind. There are some species of this corn
                    of much smaller grains, called cinquanto and quarantô, from the number of days
                    which pass between the sowing and the harvesting. These kinds are commonly sown
                    on the wheat stubbles, or after a crop of flax or of rape-seed has been
                    gathered. It is seldom very productive, and, if the field on which it is sown be
                    poor, scarcely repays more than the seed and the labour.</p>
                <p>In a country where the soil and the.climate are so various as in Lombardy, and
                    where the difference in the quantity of manure applied to the soil is so great
                    in the several portions, it is impossible to arrive at any average calculation
                    of the produce of grain per acre. Nothing more can be done here than to state a
                    few facts on the subject. One very accurate cultivator on the richest irrigable
                    land, to which abundant manure is applied, stated that his crops yielded
                    annually in a series of years from fifty-nine to seventy-eight English bushels
                    an acre. Another also, in the same circumstances, a few miles distant, gave his
                    range of bushels at from fifty to seventy-eight per acre. The other side of the
                    picture is vastly different. According to an official valuation in the revenue
                    office at Milan, the following average of the produce of maize in some of the
                    poorest provinces is given, viz. in Verona, the greatest produce is rated at
                    fifteen bushels the acre; in Vicenza, from thirty-two to forty-two; in Padua,
                    from twelve to twenty-one; and in Udine, from thirteen to twenty-two. No other
                    provinces are noticed in the account. To this account of the average produce of
                    maize may be added calculations made by two of the most accurate agriculturists
                    of Lombardy. Count Dandolo informs us, that the average produce from the
                    colonists on his estates near to Vanese, on whose fields the peasantry had been
                    induced to plant the beans called fisole amongst the maize, was 2If bushels of
                    maize, and 4½ bushels of beans. The average on the whole of his estate,
                    including the part cultivated by himself, is stated to be 32½ bushels of maize,
                    and 7½ bushels of beans. Another intelligent agriculturist asserted, that,
                    according to the best calculation he could make, and he had taken much pains on
                    the subject, the average produce of maize did not exceed twenty-one metzen the
                    jock, or twenty-five bushels the acre, which he considered to be a produce one
                    third greater than that of wheat.</p>
                <p>Rice is a plant introduced from India and China at some distant but not very
                    remote period. According to some, it was known as early as the tenth century;
                    but no one large field was cultivated with it, until a patrician of Milan, in
                    the year 1522, first destined to it some marshy land upon his own estate in the
                    province of Verona. In the provinces of Verona, Mantua, and Pavia, it is the
                    most profitable grain that is grown; and in the provinces of Lodi and Milan it
                    always secures to the farmer moderate benefit. Much of it is consumed at home,
                    as those who do not subsist on maize alone have one meal a day of this article.
                    Some of it is exported, but the amount of that portion docs not exceed in value
                    L.12,000 sterling. Rice is a marsh plant, and can only be grown where the land
                    can be covered with water till it warms, and is very slowly dried up. The
                    evaporation is injurious to human health, and hence laws are enacted regulating
                    the distance which must intervene between the rice-fields and the cities and
                    towns. Without these restrictions, rice would be more extensively cultivated. At
                    present about 125,000 English acres form the extent of this culture. Some
                    portion of rice is grown in the rich provinces, as one of the crops in rotation
                    of convertible husbandry. In this practice, called <hi rend="italic">risare a
                    vicenda,</hi> it is most commonly sown after clover. The land is ploughed very
                    deep, but not harrowed. The water is then turned on, so as to cover the surface,
                    and to show any inequalities which remained by the use of the spade. The seed is
                    then sown, or rather scattered on the water, having been previously steeped
                    during eight or ten hours, to give it additional specific gravity, so that it
                    may sink immediately to the bottom. If it were sowed after clover, two bushels
                    of seed would be sufficient for one acre. When it is sowed, as is oftentimes the
                    case, after maize, the quantity is usually three bushels.</p>
                <p>The time of sowing is from the beginning of April till the middle of May. It
                    remains covered with water to the height of from two to three inches, and in
                    that state remains till weeding becomes necessary. That early sown requires the
                    operation to be performed in the middle of May, that later sown, some time in
                    June. It is executed chiefly by the females, who, with their lower garments
                    tucked up, stand in water over the ancles, and with the hand pluck up the weeds
                    by the roots. If the land were <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207676?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-7676-0481"/> dry, the weeds would break off, and leave the
                    roots to shoot out again. The most prevalent weed is the cockfoot grass, which,
                    at an early period, it is difficult to distinguish from the rice. Besides this,
                    there are several other weeds, chiefly of the rush kind. In the first year the
                    operation of weeding is performed twice. If the same field be sown with the rice
                    in the next year, once is deemed sufficient. This is the most expensive part of
                    the process, and is said in the first year to require twenty-five days’ work for
                    an acre, which, as the employment is unpleasant and unhealthy, is commonly paid
                    for at the rate of about tenpence per day. Much of this work is executed by the
                    colonists upon plans marked definitively in their leases. The terms vary
                    excessively, according to the locality and the soil. A common plan is, for the
                    colonist to receive one quarter of the gross produce, after the quantity used as
                    seed has been abstracted from it. For this he is bound to perform the following
                    portions of the labour, viz. the levelling the surface, the sowing, the weeding,
                    the reaping, and all the labour not performed by cattle, until the crop is
                    placed on the threshing-floor. In the case of some of the poorest land, the
                    colonist receives one third, instead of one fourth, of the produce. About
                    midsummer-day the water is allowed to run off the land, and during eight or ten
                    days it is suffered to become dry. This is done to destroy the numerous water
                    insects, which would prove injurious to the roots of the rice, and cause it to
                    fall into the water.</p>
                <p>Some few persons have, however, of late abandoned this practice of letting off
                    the water, and say it is advantageous to the perfecting the grain. In common
                    cases, at the end of this drying, the field is again covered with water, and it
                    continues until the time of harvest, which is usually the first week of
                    September. It is reaped, bound in sheaves, and carried to the threshing place,
                    where it is commonly trodden out by horses. When the rice has been trodden out,
                    it is exposed to the sun to dry it for a few days, and carried to the place
                    where, by stamping in a kind of mortar with wooden pestles, it is cleared from
                    the husks, which are separated from the grain by appropriate sieves, through
                    which it is frequently poured. If the rice is very good, it yields, when
                    stamped, about one half the measure it did in the raw state. If it yield but one
                    third, it is considered as scarcely marketable. The product of rice, as far as
                    can be gathered from the returns of the crops in various years and various
                    localities, is surprisingly different, and there seems to be no means of forming
                    any approximate average. The following are all the acts that could be collected
                    on the subject.</p>

                <p>These are the quantities of rice before it was cleaned from the husks, and from
                    which one half must be deducted, to give the produce in marketable rice.</p>
                <p>Wheat is a grain cultivated upon a small scale in most parts of Lombardy,
                    excepting in that portion of it which comprehends the mountainous Alps. It is
                    not, however, a plant which succeeds to the same extent as it does in climates
                    somewhat colder. There is but one species of it sown in the whole of the
                    province. It is a winter wheat, sown between the first week of October and the
                    first week of November; but the best farmers wish to finish their sowing by the
                    21st of October, if the season permit. The wheat is all of the bearded kind, the
                    preference of which has been owing to the opinion that the beard is a protection
                    against the fogs of the blooming season, and against the depredations of the
                    small birds at the time of the grain ripening. The produce is a kind of wheat
                    harder than that of the west and north of Europe, but less hard than some of the
                    wheat from the Black Sea. From this circumstance it is better calculated to be
                    converted into maccaroni than our wheat would be, for which purpose it is much
                    more frequently pounded in a mortar than ground-at a mill. The product of the
                    crops is less per acre than it is generally in the German dominions of Austria,
                    and considerably less than in England or in the best parts of the
                    Netherlands.</p>
                <p>It is of course most productive on the best lands of the rich provinces, where
                    irrigation is practicable to the exact extent which the nature of the crop may
                    require. On that description of soil it is less profitable than other crops,
                    and, therefore, only a small portion ,is applied to its growth; but even on the
                    best of that land it is a rare event to obtain sevenfold the quantity of the
                    seed that has been sown. On the farm of Tavezzano, one of the best cultivated in
                    the province of Lodi, the average produce of the wheat land in the past year had
                    been twenty-four and a third English bushels the acre. In the farm of Viltadoni,
                    near to it, the report was, that three and a fourth bushels per acre had been
                    sown, fifteen and a half reaped. Berra, in his work <hi rend="italic">ÇSull'
                    attuale Avvilimento del Pτezzo di Granï)</hi> published in 1826, calculates the
                    increase of wheat in the dry parts of Lombardy to be only at the rate of four
                    and a half times the quantity of the seed. In plain figures reduced into English
                    measures, he averages the seed sown to be two and a fourth bushels per acre, and
                    the crop gathered nine bushels and three fourths. The late Count Dandolo
                    estimates the produce higher, and concludes that, with the common culture, the
                    increase of wheat is about five times the seed, or that three bushels an acre
                    are sown, and fifteen bushels reaped. He does not state what the increase had
                    been on his own land, which was highly cultivated; but it appears, without being
                    informed whether he sowed thicker or thinner than his neighbours, that he
                    usually had a crop of twenty and a half bushels. In the neighbourhood of Mantua,
                    where the poor colonists grow wheat and maize in alternate years, where the soil
                    is sandy, and where, from the paucity of cattle, little manure is applied, it
                    does not appear that the crop of wheat grown more than equals four times the
                    seed. In some of the other provinces of the part of Lombardy within the
                    government of Milan, as well as in some of those in the Venetian government, the
                    report of the officers employed in making a new valuation or cadastral, and who
                    had been occupied three years in examining the state of the produce for
                    financial purposes, was obtained. As it was the business of these officers to
                    examine only the produce, no proportion is stated between the quantity of the
                    seed and that of the result.</p>
                <p>In Verona, the higher part of which is stony, and the lower part sandy, the best
                    of the land yields ten bushels, and the worst only six and a half. In Vicenza,
                    where the soil is better, the lands of the first quality yield eighteen bushels,
                    those of the second fifteen, the lowest twelve. In Padua, the first class of
                    lands yields fifteen and a half bushels, the second eleven and a fourth, and the
                    lowest class only seven bushels. In Udine, a poor sandy soil, mixed with many
                    pebbles, and where there are but few cattle, the first class of soils yields ten
                    and a half bushels, the second nine, and the lowest only six and a half.</p>
                <p>It is not easy to ascertain what portion of the fields is appropriated to the
                    growth of wheat. It appears by the appendix, that the whole land under the
                    plough is 1,461,700 English acres; of this portion, 125,000 acres are cultivated
                    with rice. On the best of the soils, according to the regular rotation of crops,
                    one half of the land is in grasses, the proportion of maize is greater than that
                    of wheat, and some <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207689?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-7689-0482"/> portion is sown with pulse, rye, millet, oats,
                    flax, hemp, and other kinds of crops. The whole portion sowed with wheat does
                    not probably exceed 200,000 acres, and the best judges estimate that such is
                    nearly the extent. If, then, the crop be calculated to yield on the average two
                    quarters to the acre, it will afford 400,000 quarters. If from this be deducted
                    what will be required for seed, being about a fifth, or 80,000 quarters, it will
                    leave as food for 2,500,000 persons, at the rate of little more than one bushel
                    for each, or about one eighth part of what is usually considered as the annual
                    consumption of each individual in England. From the great articles of human
                    consumption being so different, a comparison seems unnecessary; but it may serve
                    to illustrate a general principle of great importance, viz. that consumption and
                    production so act upon each other as constantly to tend towards an equilibrium.
                    Hence we may infer, that few countries extend their growth of articles of the
                    first necesssity far beyond what their own population require.</p>
                <p>The other kinds of grain are but very little cultivated. Barley and oats are
                    scarcely needed. They are never used as human food, and neither is any beer
                    brewed, nor any corn-spirit distilled. A little rye is grown upon some poor
                    districts, but it yields a very low price, and the quantity sown is every year
                    diminishing, as the taste of the people changes in favour of maize. Millet is
                    grown, but is not deemed a profitable crop, except occasionally, when it comes
                    to maturity, which it sometimes does if sown in stubble after the harvest.
                    Buck-wheat is known only in or near the Alpine districts, and is but slightly
                    attended to.</p>
                <p>The plants which do not serve for food are not of any great importance. Though
                    flax is grown chiefly for the employment it gives in spinning and weaving, yet
                    some oil is made from the seed, as also from rape, and the seed of other plants
                    of the brassica kind. The hilly regions abound with several kinds of nuts; and
                    chestnuts form an important portion of the sustenance of the poorer classes of
                    the inhabitants. The walnuts and hazelnuts are converted into a fine oil, much
                    valued by painters; but the demand for it, as well as the supply, has been
                    gradually declining of late years. Scattered olive-trees are to be seen in most
                    places between the hills and the lake of Garda, and a few olive gardens on that
                    and the lake of Como; but the quantity of oil expressed from them is very
                    insignificant. As none of the trees have been planted within the last sixty
                    years, their number has diminished, and is still constantly diminishing. The
                    inducement to extend the growth of mulberry trees and of vines is so much more
                    powerful than exists with regard to olive-trees, that the latter are almost
                    neglected, and more especially as the parts of Italy to the south of Lombardy in
                    contact with it have a more genial soil and climate, and can render olive-oil
                    upon more beneficial terms than it could be produced if much extended within
                    that territory.</p>
                <p>Few things are more striking to a visitor in Italy from the north of Europe, than
                    the straight rows of trees of all kinds that run through the corn fields, at the
                    foot of which vines are planted and trained, so as to extend in elegant festoons
                    from one tree to another, exhibiting the pendant clusters of grapes. If the same
                    mode of training the vines were attempted in the somewhat colder climates of
                    France and Germany, it is thought the shade of the trees would prevent the
                    grapes from ripening. This effect is not produced in Lombardy, where the berries
                    become ripe, and, when eaten, are of good flavour; but the wine produced from
                    them is in general of a bad or very indifferent quality. Though much of the wine
                    is produced from such vines in the corn fields as are distinguished by the names
                    of <hi rend="italic">Campi</hi><hi rend="italic">Arative</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Vitati,</hi> or of <hi rend="italic">Campi</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Arborati</hi><hi rend="italic">Vitati,</hi> and others from vines planted in
                    rows at such a distance from each other as to admit of maize being grown between
                    them, and called <hi rend="italic">Ponchi</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> yet in
                    some parts are vineyards properly so called, because, like those of France and
                    Germany, they alone occupy the ground, and are, like them, supported by props.
                    The greater part of the best wine, however, is produced from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ponchi.</hi></p>
                <p>The wine generally in Lombardy is of a very bad quality, which is attributed to
                    its production being left almost exclusively to that description of cultivators
                    before noticed under the name of colonists. These exercise little discretion and
                    little care, either in the choice of the kind of grapes they plant, or in the
                    management of the juice when it is expressed from them. Their chief care is to
                    obtain the largest quantity, without much regard to the flavour or the aptitude
                    of keeping; and commonly, as soon as it is made, they divide it in equal shares
                    with their landlords. One cause to which the inferiority of the wine is
                    attributed arises from the general predilection in favour of red wine, or, as it
                    is called, <hi rend="italic">Vιn Nero,</hi> which is prized according to the
                    darkness of its colour. In order to produce this deep colour, the skins of the
                    grapes are left, in the first part of the process, to ferment with the juice.
                    Sometimes this is suffered to continue during eight or ten days in a vat before
                    the liquor is drawn off, and sometimes still longer, as the longer it continues
                    the darker the wine becomes.</p>
                <p>There is no old wine in Lombardy, except, perhaps, in small quantities in the
                    hands of a few amateur proprietors. The wine of each vintage is sold in the
                    course of the following year; and when any of it is kept, even though it should
                    not have become, or show a tendency to become, vinegar, it will sell at a lower
                    price than new wine, because it is milder, and more agreeable to the taste of
                    the consumers. It would be as difficult to estimate the quantity of wine made
                    annually in Lombardy, as it would have been fifty years ago, if no duty had been
                    paid on malt, to have calculated the quantity of malt liquor of all kinds made
                    in England; at which time almost every family out of London brewed its own beer.
                    From a long list of the number of vines, and their produce in wine, of several
                    farms of various soils, around the corn-fields of which the vines had been
                    trained to the trees, it appears that in the most productive, the highest
                    produce was 122 gallons from 100 vines; that in the least productive year, from
                    that number of vines only thirty-three gallons were produced; and that on the
                    average of thirty-one such farms, every 100 vines yielded fifty-one and a half
                    gallons of wine.</p>
                <p>In the vineyards properly so called, the vines are, like those of France and
                    Germany, supported with sticks. Each vine, of course, produces less than those
                    trained from one tree to another. From a return of the produce of fourteen such
                    vineyards, it appears that the quantity yielded by the lowest was thirty-two
                    gallons, and the average of the whole seventy gallons to the acre. As wine is
                    not an article of export from the province of Lombardy, but, on the contrary,
                    much is imported from the other parts of Italy, and, for the few who indulge in
                    such luxuries, some from France and from Germany, it has been looked upon,
                    whilst drawing up these notices, purely in an agricultural point of view. It
                    would have been easy to have given more details respecting the preparation, but
                    it seemed to be more proper to leave that part of the subject to such persons as
                    may be employed in writing the history of vines, than to enter into it in this
                    place.</p>
                <p>Potatoes, which form so important a part of the food of the inhabitants in the
                    more northern parts of Europe, are very little cultivated in Lombardy. They are
                    almost exclusively confined to the Alpine districts, or, when grown on the level
                    country, are confined to the gardens. The absence of this root is a subject of
                    sincere regret to the most patriotic individuals who have devoted their
                    attention<pb break="no" facs="nls:193207702?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-7702-0483"/> to rural economics. Count Dandolo attributes much
                    of the dreadful consequences which followed the deficient harvests of 1816 and
                    1828, when great numbers perished from want of common necessaries, to the
                    absence of that seasonable supply of food which potatoes would then have
                    furnished. Others have made similar and ineffectual remarks. The taste for
                    polenta is much too deeply rooted and the dislike to potatoes so common amongst
                    the working classes of the rural'districts, that there is no present prospect of
                    their cultivation being speedily extended.</p>

                <p>The most important tax is the territorial impost. It is an ancient payment, which
                    has been alike collected under the several changes of rulers which have
                    administered the finances of the country. It has resisted all general attempts
                    to equalize its rate according to the productive powers of the soil, and
                    therefore falls in a very unequal degree upon different estates. Attempts have
                    been constantly making, and still are in progress, to equalize this impost; but
                    the pace of the commissioners appointed for the business is so very slow, that
                    no one can form an opinion of the period at which the work will terminate. It
                    will not be possible here to give more than a general view of the amount of this
                    tax. The province of Milan extends over 16,500 square miles. Of this, the roads
                    and the water are 730, and of the remainder, one quarter is esti-jnated to
                    consist of sterile rocks, of miserable pasture, or of more miserable woods,
                    yielding no produce worth collecting. This would leave of all descriptions of
                    valuable ιand to the extent of 11,830 square miles, or about 7,370,000 English
                    acres. The whole amount of the tax s 26,171,338 lire, or, taking the lira as the
                    thirtieth part of a pound sterling, is L.872,374, or about 2s. 2d. per ιcre. In
                    estates in the province of Lodi the amount of whose tax is clearly stated, it
                    amounted in one instance to Is. per acre, in others to 2s. 10d., in most to 2s.
                    6d. In the province of Pavia it amounted in one instance to 7s. per ιcre, in
                    others to 6s. and in several to 4s. 6d. In the province of Milan some estates
                    near the city were made to )ay as much as from thirty-eight to forty-one and a
                    fourth )er cent, on the actual rent. The estates here referred o were the best
                    land, and the best cultivated; and those he highest taxed were in that condition
                    when the last .urvey was made. These prices, so high above the ave- ' age, make
                    up for the little value of the extensive parts of l he poor land of the other
                    and larger six provinces. As his impost is collected in all cases from the
                    proprietor, it s regularly paid, and attended with little cost in the col-</p>
                <p>I ection.</p>
                <p>It is generally believed that more than five sixths of the nhabitants of Lombardy
                    subsist wholly by the labours of he field. Of these, the far greater proportion
                    are of the de-cription which is here called colonists. They are small Occupiers,
                    dividing the trifling products of the soil with the proprietors. Their condition
                    is far worse than that of day-labourers in this country, for they have no
                    resource in case of a deficient harvest but beggary or starvation. Their
                    dwellings are small and miserable; they are without furniture, utensils, or the
                    means of cleanliness. They generally marry early, and have families, though they
                    have no prospect of supporting them, beyond the hope that the half of the
                    produce of maize on an acre of land may yield them food during the year, with
                    the exercise of the greatest parsimony in its use. In the event of sickness they
                    have no relief; and their clothing is deficient, and of the coarsest materials.
                    The charity of those who can afford it is bestowed with as fair liberality as
                    can be expected, considering the numerous claimants that offer for its
                    reception. The worst part of this picture is, that no hope is entertained of
                    bettering their condition, an,d no means of doing so attempted to be put in
                    practice, either by public bodies, such as monasteries, which formerly existed,
                    or by the government, or by private associations of individuals.</p>
                <p>The mining operations are inconsiderable, and are confined to the procuring of
                    iron in the Alpine valleys of Bergamo and Brescia, and of copper in Belluno.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of Lombardy are extensive; that of silk gives the most
                    employment, but very large occupation is afforded by the linen and woollen
                    trades, and in both those branches the use of machinery has been widely
                    diffused. Woollen goods of almost every description are made in the delegations
                    of Venice, Padua, and Como. Milan has been from remote times celebrated for its
                    weapons and arms, and iron work of all kinds is still extensively made in the
                    delegation. Besides the great branches of manufacture, most of the smaller ones
                    are carried on, especially those of paper, glass, gold and silver articles, and
                    domestic utensils.</p>
                <p>The foreign trade is not material; that of Venice has much declined since its
                    union with Austria, though some of the smaller articles of that division are
                    still dispersed throughout the eastern countries. There are still many ships
                    navigating the Adriatic and the Mediterranean Seas, now bearing the Austrian
                    flag, which are built and equipped at Venice, and at the other ports under the
                    dominion of that power. The following table will show the extent of the foreign
                    trade.</p>

                    in lire, of which thirty-are about the value of the pound sterling; according to
                    which, the excess of the exports beyond the imports amounts to L.958,000
                    sterling.</p>
                <p>The government is almost an unlimited monarchy; for although, by the constitution
                    of April 1815, there are both central and provincial assemblies of
                    representatives of the people, their function is rather to form rules for the
                    execution of the laws promulgated from Vienna, than to contribute any share in
                    making such laws; and though they may make representations against them, they
                    have no power to prevent or suspend their operation. The kingdom of Lombardy is
                    ruled by a viceroy, who resides at Milan, and enjoys a salary of about L.40,000
                    yearly. Under him are the governors of the two divisions into which the kingdom
                    is formed, viz. Milan and Venice.</p>
                <p>The revenue of the kingdom is derived in part from national domains and
                    royalties, part of which once belonged to the church, a heavy tax upon tobacco,
                    with some other direct and indirect taxes. The gross sum extracted is about
                    L.2,000,000; but the collection is expensive, and the interest of the local debt
                    is paid off it, so that not one fifth of that amount reaches the imperial
                    treasury. There are also local taxes, which are collected and dispensed by the
                    municipal authorities of the cities and towns. By some recent laws, all taxation
                    on commodities passing from this kingdom into the other Austrian dominions have
                    been abolished, and commerce between them is free. A military board has the
                    direction of the army, and of the several fortresses, with their stores and
                    garrisons. Six regiments of infantry and two of cavalry are recruited in this
                    part of the empire.</p>
                <p>The chief or head of the ecclesiastical body is the patriarch of Venice, under
                    whom are the archbishops of Milan and Udine, with seventeen suffragan bishops.
                    The institutions for education are, the universities of Pavia and of Padua,
                    medical and surgical colleges at Milan, lyceums at Bergamo, Brescia, Como,
                    Cremona, Mantua, Vicenza, Treviso, and Udine. The promotion of the higher
                    branches of science is achieved by learned societies in most of the cities, the
                    most eminent of which are those of Milan, Venice, Padua, and Verona.</p>
                <p>The naval force of Austria is constructed and equipped in this kingdom. It
                    consists of eight ships of the line of seventy-six guns each, seven frigates of
                    forty-four guns, one corvette, eight brigs, and six schooners, mounting together
                    1064 cannon. Besides, there are several vessels on the stocks, but their
                    building proceeds in a dilatory manner. Most of them are at Venice, but some are
                    stationed at Trieste, Cattaro, and Zara. The commissioners who regulate naval
                    affairs meet at Venice. There is a corps of naval engineers, and a battalion of
                    infantry who serve as marines.</p>
