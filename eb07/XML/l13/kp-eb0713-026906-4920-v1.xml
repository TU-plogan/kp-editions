                    in its largest and most extensive sense, signifies any writing, picture, or the
                    like, of an immoral or illegal tendency; but, in a peculiar sense, it denotes a
                    malicious defamation of any person, and especially of a magistrate, made public
                    either by printing or by writing, by signs or by pictures, in order to provoke
                    him to wrath, or expose him to public hatred, contempt, and ridicule. The direct
                    tendency of these libels is a breach of the public peace, by stirring up the
                    objects of them to revenge, and perhaps to bloodshed. The communication of a
                    libel to any one person is a publication in the eye of the law, and therefore
                    the sending an abusive private letter to a man is as much a libel as if it were
                    openly printed, for it equally tends to provoke a breach of the peace.</p>
                <p>With regard to libels in general, there are two remedies; one by indictment, and
                    another by action. For the public offence, the remedy is indictment; because
                    every libel has a tendency to break the peace, or provoke others to break it, an
                    offence which is the same whether the matter contained be true or false; and
                    therefore the defendant, on an indictment for publishing a libel, is not allowed
                    to allege the truth thereof by way of justification. But in the remedy by action
                    on the case, which is to repair the party in damages for the injury done him,
                    the defendant may, as for words spoken, justify the truth of the facts, and show
                    that the plaintiff has received no injury at all. What has been said with regard
                    to words spoken, will also hold in every particular with regard to libels by
                    writing or printing, and the civil actions consequent thereon; but· as to signs
                    or pictures, it seems necessary always to show, by proper inuendos and averments
                    of the defendant’s meaning, the import and application of the scandal, and that
                    some special damage has followed; otherwise it cannot appear that such libel by
                    picture is understood to have been levelled at the plaintiff', or that it was
                    attended with any actionable consequences.</p>
                <p>In a civil action, then, a libel must appear to be false as well as scandalous;
                    for, if the charge be true, the plaintiff has received no private injury, and
                    has no ground to demand a compensation for himself, whatever offence it may be
                    against the public peace; and therefore, upon a civil action, the truth of the
                    accusation may be pleaded in bar of the suit. But, in a criminal prosecution,
                    the tendency which all libels have to create animosities, and to disturb the
                    public peace, is the sole consideration of the law. Hence, in such prosecutions,
                    the only points to be considered are, first, the making or publisning of the
                    book or writing; and, secondly, whether the matter be criminal; and, if both
                    these points are against the defendant, the offence against the public is
                    complete. The punishment of such libellers, for concocting, repeating, printing,
                    or publishing the libel, is a fine, and such corporal punishment as the court in
                    its discretion may inflict; regard being had to the quantity of the offence, and
                    the quality of the offender. By the law of the Twelve Tables at Rome, libels
                    which affected the reputation of an individual were made a capital offence; but
                    before the reign of Augustus, the punishment became corporal only. Under the
                    Emperor Valentinian it was again made capital, not only to write, but to
                    publish, or even to omit destroying libels. In this and many other respects, our
                    law corresponds rather with the middle age of Roman jurisprudence, when liberty,
                    learning, and humanity, were in their full vigour, than with the cruel edicts
                    that were established in the tyrannical age of the ancient decemviri, or in that
                    of the latter emperors.</p>
