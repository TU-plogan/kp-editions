                <p><label type="entry">LIPSIUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Justus</hi></label>, a critic
                    and antiquary of high reputation, was born on the 18th of October 1547, at the
                    village of Isque, situate at an equal distance from Brussels and Louvain. His
                    father, Gilles Lipse, a native of Brussels, belonged to one of the best families
                    of that city, and inherited considerable property, which he impaired by his
                    improvident mode of life. The name of his mother was Isabelle Petirive. At the
                    age of six he removed to Brussels along with his parents; and being then sent to
                    school, he discovered great aptitude for acquiring the elements of learning.
                    Having reached his tenth year, he was placed at Ath in Hainaut, where he was
                    initiated in Latin grammar; and after another interval of two years, he became a
                    student in the college of the Jesuits at Cologne. There he devoted himself to
                    the study of the Greek language, and likewise of history and philosophy. It was
                    the policy of the Jesuits to allure into their society such of their pupils as
                    exhibited the greatest promise of talent; and this young scholar was nearly
                    entangled in their net, when his parents, having heard of his desire to enrol
                    himself in the fraternity, recalled him from Cologne, and sent him to the
                    university of Louvain. He had then attained the age of seventeen, and had
                    already begun to exhibit various indications of his future eminence in letters.
                    His father had destined ’ him for the legal profession, and, that he might seem
                    to comply with his wishes, the son bestowed some attention upon-the study of
                    jurisprudence; but philology and philosophy were his favourite pursuits, and of
                    his proficiency in philology he exhibited a very early and conspicuous specimen.
                    The death of his father, when he himself had nearly completed the eighteenth
                    year of his age, left him at full liberty to devote himself to such studies as
                    best suited his own inclination. After this event, his mother fixed her
                    residence at Louvain, bringing with her an only daughter: she made a strenuous
                    effort to preserve the remnant of their fortune, but her worldly cares were soon
                    terminated by a dropsy. . In the year 1567, before he had completed the age of
                    twenty, he published his “Variarum Lectionum libri tres,’’ which he dedicated to
                    Cardinal de Granvelle, and which procured him no mean reputation as a critic. It
                    likewise had the effect of recommending him to the favour of this dignitary; who
                    on proceeding to Rome for the purpose of assisting at the election of a pope,
                    was accompanied by Lipsius in the capacity of his Latin secretary.</p>
                <p>Here he had an opportunity of attending the prelections of Muretus, who was at
                    that time a professor in the university of Rome; and with this very elegant
                    scholar he appears to have contracted some degree of intimacy. He likewise
                    became acquainted with several other learned men who then resided in Italy. His
                    leisure hours were chiefly devoted to the examination of manuscripts preserved
                    in the Vatican and other libraries; nor did he neglect those monuments of
                    antiquity which, in so many different forms, solicited the notice of a young and
                    ardent scholar. In the service of the cardinal he continued nearly two years;
                    and having then returned to Louvain, and being released from all his
                    engagements, as well as from all restraint, he there spent another year with
                    little improvement of his learning or morals. But he at length became sensible
                    of the folly of a life wasted in the frivolous and unsatisfactory pursuit of
                    pleasure; and in order to effect a complete interruption of his habits and
                    associations, he adopted the prudent resolution of again travelling in foreign
                    countries. On passing through Franche Comté, he directed his course to Dole, the
                    seat of a university, and there pronounced a panegyric on his friend Victor
                    Giselin, on the occasion of his taking a doctor’s degree in physic. To the
                    banquet which followed this ceremony he did so much honour, that he was seized
                    with a fever which endangered his life. On regaining sufficient strength, he
                    pursued his journey to Vienna, and there became acquainted with Busbequius,
                    Sambucus, Pighius, and other men of learning. Such was the impression of his
                    talents and attainments, that he was solicited to re <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193206259?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-6259-0372"/> main in the
                    Austrian dominions; but he declined more than one offer of employment, and
                    adhered to the resolution of returning to his native country. Proceeding to
                    Bohemia, he visited Prague, and was travelling through Germany, when he received
                    an alarming account of the progress of the war in the Netherlands, and the
                    serious injury to which his own property had been exposed. In this situation of
                    his affairs, he was glad to accept the professorship of history and eloquence in
                    the university of Jena. To this office he was admitted in the year 1572, and he
                    retained it till the first of May 1574, when some indications of a favourable
                    change had encouraged him to think of revisiting his native soil. But he first
                    directed his course towards Cologne, where he married a widow named Anne
                    Calstrie, who was descended of a good family at Louvain, and by whom he had no
                    children. His first edition of Tacitus was printed in octavo, at Antwerp, in the
                    year 1574. Totheillustration of this favourite author he afterwards devoted much
                    labour; and a sixth edition, in folio and quarto, was printed at the same place
                    in 1600. His “Antiquarum Lectionum libri quinque” were printed at Antwerp in
                    1575.</p>
                <p>Having lingered nine months at Cologne, he conducted his wife to Isque, where he
                    hoped to lead a life of studious tranquillity; but his dreams of felicity were
                    speedi-Iy dispelled by the renewal of hostilities in that vicinity, and he found
                    it expedient to seek shelter at Louvain. At the suggestion of his friends, he
                    resumed the study of jurisprudence, and in the year 1576 he took the degree of
                    LL.D. His taste and inclination did not lead him to the practice of this
                    profession; but his knowledge of the civil law was of material use in the
                    illustration of Roman antiquities. In 1577 he published his “Epistolicarum
                    Quaestionum libri quinque; in quis ad varios Scriptores, ple-raeque ad T.
                    Livium, Notae.” Here he could not long pursue his studies without alarm and
                    danger: the war continuing with unabated vigour, Louvain was exposed to a siege,
                    and changed its masters. After this event, he was offered the professorship of
                    history in the university of Leyden; to which he accordingly removed in the year
                    1579, and there taught with high reputation. At Louvain he was a papist, at Jena
                    he had been a Lutheran, and at Leyden he now became a Calvinist; if any adequate
                    preferment had allured him to Constantinople, he would in all probability have
                    become a Mohammedan. Towards the close of his life, Lipsius denied that he had
                    ever conformed to the established church of Holland; but if any regard is due to
                    this denial, how are we to understand the positive declaration of his zealous
                    biographer Le Mire, who has stated that after his retreat from Leyden, he was
                    publicly reconciled to the church of Rome? If he had never forsaken its
                    communion, where was the necessity or the pretext for such a reconciliation?
                    Niceron admits that he long appeared to be very indifferent about religion, and
                    that it was his great principle to conform to the religion of the place where he
                    resided; but, subjoins the reverend father, he at length quitted this state of
                    indifference, and was constantly and sincerely attached to the Catholic faith,
                    in which he was born.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    great principle, that is, who had so long evinced a total want of principle, it
                    would seem but reasonable to require some very substantial evidence. During the
                    latter years of his life, he certainly adhered to the tenets of popery, and
                    endeavoured to signalize his zeal by professing to merge his intellect in the
                    most abject superstition: but this was perhaps the mere zeal of a convert making
                    his third profession, and fully aware of the extreme suspicion which his
                    previous conduct could not have failed to excite; and had the course of his
                    fortunes finally conducted him from Louvain to Oxford, it is by no means <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> violent or uncharitable supposition that he might have
                    closed his career in the odour of high-church sanctity..</p>
                <p>At Leyden he produced several of his more elaborate works. In 1580 appeared
                    “Electorum liber primus,’’ and in 1582 “Electorum libri duo; in quibus, praeter
                    Censuras, varii prisci Ritus ;” in 1584 “De Amphitheatro liber; in quo Forma
                    ipsa Loci expressa, et ratio spectandi ;” to which is subjoined “De
                    Amphitheatris quae extra Romam libellus ;” and in 1585 “Saturnalium Sermonum
                    libri duo, qui de Gladiatoribus.” In 1586 he published “De recta Pronuntiatione
                    Latinae Linguae Dialogus ;” of which dialogue the scene is laid in Rome, and the
                    interlocutors are Lipsius and Muretus. It is dedicated to Sir Philip Sidney. His
                    edition of the tragedies ascribed to Seneca was printed in 1588. Nor were his
                    enquiries confined to philology and antiquities. In 1584 he had published “De
                    Constantia libri duo, qui Alloquium praecipue continent in publicis Malis ;’’
                    and in 1589 he produced a more ample work entitled “Politicorum, sive Civilis
                    Doctrinae, libri sex, qui ad Principatum maxime spectant.” The publication of
                    this work was attended with some unpleasant consequences to the author, and it
                    served to evince that his wisdom was not equal to his learning. He recommends,
                    in very plain terms, the punishment of heretics, or, in other words, of those
                    who dissent from the established faith; nor can it escape the observation of the
                    most obtuse reader that this recommendation proceeded from a man who, according
                    to his own doctrine, ought to have been punished at Jena if he had adhered to
                    the opinions which he professed at Louvain, who ought to have been punished at
                    Leyden if he had adhered to the opinions which he professed at Jena. But it must
                    be admitted that his conduct was perfectly consistent in one respect, inasmuch
                    as he changed his religion as often as he changed his place of residence.
                    Wherever his lot was cast, he was never to be found among the nonconformists.
                    This doctrine of exterminating heresy by fire and sword, proceeded with a
                    peculiar grace from an individual who, having escaped from the wreck of his
                    fortunes, had been protected and cherished by a people so recently released from
                    the iron yoke of Spain, with all the atrocities of the Spanish inquisition. His
                    intolerant opinions were immediately attacked by Theodore Koornhert; and finding
                    himself placed in a situation of no small embarrassment, he, in 1590, made a
                    very abortive attempt to defend himself, in a work entitled “De una Religione
                    adversus Dialogistam liber; in quo tria capita libri quarti Politicorum
                    explicantur.” His antagonist prepared a reply, which was not printed till after
                    the death of the author.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    In consequence of these illiberal and unseasonable speculations, he probably
                    found that his residence in Holland had been rendered less agreeable. Under the
                    pretext of drinking the medicinal waters, he proceeded to Spa, and afterwards
                    withdrew to Mentz, where the Jesuits gladly received the lost sheep returning to
                    the sheepfold. From this place, on the 14th of April 1591, he addressed a
                    canting letter to Delrio, a learned father of the same order; and only a short
                    time elapsed before be was publicly reconciled to that church whose communion he
                    had renounced as often as it suited his interest. So true it is that the bigots
                    of a corrupt church arc easily satisfied with a specious show of outward
                    conformity, while the disguise of their votary is too transparent to deceive any
                    one who is unwilling to be deceived. On ascertaining that there was no hope of
                    his returning to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193206272?mode=fullsize"

                    the utmost anxiety to find another scholar of equal and even superior
                    attainments; and with true discernment they selected Joseph Scaliger, a man
                    distinguished beyond all others by the extent and solidity of his learning. The
                    rulers of the state acted with conspicuous liberality towards him, and
                    afterwards towards Salmasius; "who,” as Dr Bentley has remarked, "were invited
                    out of their own country with the solemnity almost of an embassy, that they
                    would honour a potent republic with their presence, and accept of a noble
                    pension without any incumbrance of an office.”<note anchored="true"

                    Lipsius, and in none more than in the knowledge of the Greek language and
                    literature, both of which his capacious mind had embraced in their entire
                    conçpass. His advice and example had a great and lasting influence in
                    recommending this study to the youth of his adopted nation, in which it long
                    continued to flourish with a degree of vigour scarcely equalled in any other
                    country of Europe.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Sub

                <p>Having entered Mentz as a heretic and quitted it as a good catholic, he
                    afterwards lingered for about two years at Spa and Liege. During this interval,
                    many advantageous offers were made to him by princes and by dignitaries of the
                    church. One offer, not from a king or cardinal, but from a private individual,
                    deserves to be recorded: Benedictus Arias Montanus, a learned Spaniard whose
                    name is so frequently mentioned in the annals of biblical literature, repeatedly
                    urged him to come and share his income during his life, and to be the heir of
                    all his property at his death. But the love of his native land prevailed over
                    many other inducements, and Lipsius finally returned to Louvain as professor of
                    history and eloquence. His salary as a professor amounted to eight hundred
                    florins; and with the title of historiographer royal, Philip the Second bestowed
                    upon him a pension of one thousand. The archduke Albert, governor of the
                    Netherlands, added two hundred florins, and nominated him a member of the
                    council; but having no wish or aptitude to engage in public affairs, he wisely
                    restricted himself to the duties of his academical office. He taught with much
                    ability, and with high reputation, but his lectures did not attract a numerous
                    auditory; the students of that university having been trained by the Jesuits to
                    set a higher value upon scholastic disputation than upon classical
                    erudition.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Docet vir
                    doctus,” says Scultet in allusion to Puteanus, “ut et ante ipsum Lipsius, in
                    sterili auditorio, non alia de causa (ex magno viro hoc audivi) quam quod
                    juventus a melioribus studiis ad tricas disputationum scholasticarum per

                    of Lipsius.</p></note> He however continued with unabating ardour to pursue his
                    favourite investigations, and about this period he composed several of his
                    antiquarian works. “De Cruce libri tres, ad sacram profanamque Historiam
                    utiles,” appeared in 1595; “De Militia Romana libri quinque; Commentarius ad
                    Polybium,” in 1596; “Poliorceticωn, sive de Machinis, Tormentis, Telis, libri
                    quinque,” in the same year; “Admiranda, sive de Magnitudine Romana, libri
                    quatuor,” in 1598; “De Vesta et Vestalibus,” in 1603. In 1604 he published
                    “Manuductionis ad Stoicam Philosophiam libri tres, &amp; Physiologiae Stoicorum
                    libri tres, L. Annaeo Senecae, aliisque Scriptoribus illustrandis.” “Monita et
                    Exempla Politica, libri duo, qui Virtutes et Vitia Principum spectant,” followed
                    in 1605. In the course of the same year he published his edition of Seneca the
                    philosopher, and likewise “Lovanium, sive Oppidi et Academiae ejus Descriptio.”
                    It would have been well for his reputation if he had adhered to such
                    lucubrations as these, instead of occupying himself with miserable details of
                    the miracles of our Lady of Hall and of Zichem. In 1604 he published “Diva Virgo

                    abject tales of superstition exposed him to the ridicule and contempt of
                    protestants, nor have the more rational papists commended him for such a
                    manifestation of his zeal. His idolatry of the wooden goddess<note

                    several controversial tracts; and the character of Lipsius was not much indebted
                    to those friends who undertook his vindication. One of his fiercest antagonists
                    was our learned countryman George Thomson, who was a protestant clergyman in
                    France, and the author of several works in French as well as Latin.<note

                    of Lipsius was undertaken by Claude Dausquei, a canon of Tournay, who published
                    a work entitled “Scutum duplex, alterum B. Virginis Aspri-Collensis, alterum J.
                    Lipsii; utrumque adversus Agricolae Thracii satyricas petitiones.” Duaci, 1610,
                    8vo. Thomson is mentioned in the following terms by Dominicus Baudius: “Georgium
                    Thomsonum amo quidem et aestimo plurimum, ob studium bonarum partium, et
                    egregios in solida doctrina progressus; sed, ut verum apud te fabuler, nullo
                    modo possum probare nimiam ejus violentiam atque asperitatem in nostrum Lipsium:
                    cujus quidem Divarum sanos omnes pudet pigetque, sed tamen majore cum reverentia
                    tractandum fuit praestantissimum pene ingenium hujus seculi, et qui pro parte
                    sua strenue tutatus est literarum gloriam.” (Baudii Epistolae, p. 298. edit.
                    Lugd. Bat. 1650, 12mo.) See likewise p. 242. and Camdeni Epistolae, p. 71. Lond.
                    1691, 4to. His treatment of Lipsius is more strongly censured by Scaliger: “De
                    libro Georgii Thomson! gratias ago. Mitius illi cum Lipsio agendum, et alia via
                    cum illo congrediendum fuit. Nam praefractam illam et gladiatoriam violentiam
                    non laudo. Non enim tanquam vindex veritatis, ut ipse profitetur, sed tanquam
                    ultor offensae alicujus cum eo agit, quum tamen ab eo nunquam ne verbulo quidem
                    ullo laesus aut perstrictus fuerit.” (Scaligeri Epistolae, p. 809. Lugd. Bat.
                    1627, 8vo.) George Thomson was )orn at St Andrews, and studied in the university
                    of his native city. Here he took the degree of A. Μ. and was incorporated at
                    Oxford on the 30th of August 1605. (Wood’s Fasti Oxonienses, part i. col. 309.
                    Bliss’s edit.) He was appointed minister of the reformed church at Châtaigneraye
                    in Poitou. His command of the French language, and his eloquence as a preacher,
                    are celebrated by John Dunbar. (Epigrammaton centuriae sex decades totidem, p.
                    191. Lond. 1616, 8vo.) Under the date of 1617, we find the following obituary
                    notice by Robert Boyd: “Mr Thomson, pasteur de la Chaistaignoraye, demeurant à
                    la laiterie en Poytou; <pb corresp="kp-eb0713-6285-0374" xml:id="pbn7374"/>

                    (Bannatyne Miscellany, vol. i. p. 289.) Thomson is the author of a large volume
                    entitled “La Chasse de la Beste Romaine: où est réfuté le xxiii. chap, du

                    Some copies of the second edition likewise bear Rochelle. Some passages of this
                    elaborate work were attacked by René le Corvaisier, in “La Chasse au Loup
                    Cervier, contre les Calomnies de G. Thomson.’’ Paris, 1612, 8vo. Thomson
                    strenuously defended himself in “La Desroute de la Chasse du Loup Cervier; ou,
                    Refutation du Traicté du Ieusne, fait par Maistre René le Corvaisier, soi disant

                    commentary on the Revelation, under the subsequent title: “Ouverture de tous les

                    intercession he ascribed his recovery from a painful disease; and his votive
                    tablet was ornamented with an effusion in Latin verse, not remarkable for the
                    elegance of the composition. Here we very clearly discern the spirit of pagan
                    idolatry; and it was under the same cloud of superstitious delusion that he
                    awaited the approach of death. His biographer has deemed it worthy of record,
                    that, when the spark of life was nearly extinct, he prayed with great fervour to
                    the blessed virgin: of his reliance on the mercy of God through the atonement
                    and mediation of Christ, we find a less anxious commemoration. With his dying
                    breath he directed his wife to deposit his academical gown at the altar of the
                    virgin in the church of St Peter; and having now testified as much false and as
                    little true devotion as the five priests in attendance could require or expect,
                    he expired on the 23d of March 1606, in the fifty-ninth year of his age.
                    According to the direction of his testament, his remains were interred before
                    the altar of the virgin in the church of the Franciscan friars. His death was
                    lamented and his merits were extolled in prose and in verse by many different
                    writers. One of his admirers undertook to prove that he was a good catholic; and
                    of what materials a good catholic may be composed, we have already had occasion
                    to state. Another, Wower of Antwerp, thought himself well employed in defending
                    the propriety of his devout dedication of an old gown edged with fur; an act of
                    driveling imbecility which had exposed his memory to much sarcastic
                    animadversion.</p>

                <p>The personal appearance of Lipsius presented nothing very striking or dignified.
                    Le Mire, who abounds in rhetorical flourishes, is pleased to inform us that he
                    had a divine twinkle in his eye; but he does not attempt to disguise the fact,
                    that many of the strangers who came to visit him were not a little disappointed
                    at the meanness of his aspect. He had an ample forehead, and was of an ordinary
                    size and shape; but during the latter part of his life, his appearance was much
                    affected by the diseased state of his liver. He lived in a plain style, and
                    retained only one man servant, who likewise acted as his amanuensis. Nature had
                    denied him all relish for music; but from his literary toils he found an
                    agreeable relaxation in the cultivation of his garden, which was planted with a
                    variety of flowers, and was particularly rich in tulips. His biographer has
                    likewise thought it worthy of notice t*hat he was always fond of dogs, and that
                    during his last residence at Louvain he generally kept three, one of them being
                    of a Scotish breed.</p>
                <p>Lipsius was a great master of the Latin language and literature. He has evinced
                    much critical skill, as well as much erudition, in illustrating many of the
                    ancient authors, and many different branches of Roman antiquities. His
                    lucubrations on the poets are not in general very felicitous, nor did his taste
                    particularly qualify him for this department of classical criticism: of the
                    style and scope of historians, philosophers, grammarians, and rhetoricians, he
                    was a more competent judge. In the Greek language he was not eminently skilled;
                    and he has occasionally treated of subjects which required that knowledge in
                    which he was somewhat deficient. His treatise on the military affairs of the
                    Romans is fouŗtded on the Greek text of Polybius, which he transcribes and
                    expounds; but, according to the opinion of Casaubon, where that text was
                    formerly obscure, he has left it without any new elucidation. It is another
                    charge against the same work, urged by Scaliger and Salmasius,<note

                    downright plagiarism has been preferred against him: Muretus complained of his

                    indignant terms, averred that from his <hi rend="italic">Semestria</hi> Lipsius
                    had without acknowledgment borrowed the best part of the materials for his
                    treatise on the gladiators. Torrentius and other writers had similar charges to
                    prefer against him, nor is it easy to believe that these accusations were

                <p>The political writings of Lipsius possess little or no value, excep~ as a mere ’
                    collection of facts and quotations. Here he displays no liberality or
                    enlargement of mind; and beyond the limits of classical erudition, he appears to
                    have been a man of very slender judgment. His two treatises on the Stoic
                    philosophy are however of more interest and importance. His taste in composition
                    was singularly quaint and affected, nor does he seem to have retained the power
                    of conveying any information in plain and direct terms. This vitiated mode of
                    writing excited the disgust of some of his most learned contemporaries; and on
                    the Latinity of Lipsius a volume of 560 pages was published by H.

                    through an affected and vitiated taste. He had a few disciples, who imitated
                    him, and wrote ten times worse than he, because they had not his learning, and
                    his fancy, and vivacity; he was ingenious, and they were dull.'’<note

                    however added no illustrations. Of his critical treatises he published a

                    his edition of Seneca the philosopher, forming another volume of the same size.
                    Of his original works there is a more recent edition. Vesaliae, 1675, 4 tom.
                    8vo. The third volume contains seven very slight tracts on Roman antiquities,
                    which are not inserted in the folio edition, and which ought never to have been
                    printed. Lipsius contributed brief annotations on Catullus, Tibullus,
                    Propertius, Martial, the younger Pliny, Florus, Suetonius, and Valerius Maximus;
                    but his reputation as an editor chiefly depends on his emendations and
                    elucidations of Seneca, and more especially of Tacitus.<note anchored="true"

                    acquainted, that, according to the statement of De Rossi, he could repeat them
                    from beginning to end. (Erythraei Pinacotheca tertia, p. 2.) This morsel must
                    however be taken with a grain of salt.</p></note> (x.)</p>
