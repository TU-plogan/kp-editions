                    makes it hazardous either to enter or depart without the aid of skilful pilots.
                    Between the bar and the city the strong castle of Belem, under whose guns all
                    ships must pass, is a sufficient protection. Few finer objects can be seen than

                    under the Moorish yoke. It was regained from the African marauders in 1154, by
                    Alphonso, who had a few years before assumed the regal power, and who was
                    assisted by a fleet of adventurers bound on a crusade to the Holy Land. Since
                    that period it has continued the metropolis of Portugal, an independent kingdom,
                    except from the year 1580 to 1640, when it was united to the Spanish
                    monarchy.</p>
                <p>From the vicissitudes this city has experienced, we may expect to find it
                    abounding in Phoenician, Roman, and Moorish antiquities; but the tremendous
                    earthquake which it suffered in 1755 buried most of what then remained in a heap
                    of ruins. After the dismal catastrophe of that period, the city rose again with
                    unexampled rapidity, and with a beauty and splendour far exceeding its former
                    condition. The traces of this calamity are not, however, wholly obliterated.
                    Near the river, and the Praça di Commercio, large masses of ruined churches and
                    convents are visible amongst the modern buildings; and the fractured strata of
                    the rocks on which these stand, still show the nature of the concussion which
                    destroyed the former city. This city seems exposed to this calamity, as there
                    have been frequent shocks of earthquakes since; and indeed few years pass
                    without some slight indications of a tendency in the earth to similar <hi
                    rend="italic">tremblemens.</hi> The streets of Lisbon are of competent breadth,
                    and paved; but, owing to the inequality of the ground on which they stand, and
                    their slippery state, they are uncomfortable to walk or ride through. The
                    attention of a vigilant police is wanted to enforce a greater observance of
                    cleanliness. As few of the Portuguese nobility reside on their estates, their
                    residences within the city are very splendid; and some of the richer merchants
                    have houses, <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> which in appearance rival those of the
                    higher orders; but the habitations of the lower classes of the inhabitants are
                    miserable and disgusting by their excessive filthiness.</p>
                <p>The public buildings are very spacious; and some of the few which sustained the
                    concussion of 1755 exhibit fine specimens of ancient architecture. The church of
                    Belem is one of these, and though two of the columns which supported the roof
                    were then thrown down, and have since been replaced by two mis-shapen masses of
                    modern masonry, it exhibits the finest specimen of the Arabesque-Gothic style of
                    building. The royal palace is finely situated on the banks of the Tagus at
                    Belem, but, being composed of wood, is not equal to the general taste of the
                    other public buildings. The most imposing object near Lisbon is the aqueduct,
                    which conveys fresh water to the city, and which in grandeur yields to no work
                    of ancient or modern times. The cathedral is a large and magnificent building,
                    and endowed with a revenue estimated at more than L.100,000 sterling
                    annually.</p>
                <p>Lisbon is enriched with such establishments as usually adorn the capitals of
                    kingdoms. It possesses an academy of sciences, a botanic garden, a well arranged
                    cabinet of natural history, some public libraries, amongst which that of the
                    Regalia contains upwards of 80,000 volumes, a college for the nobles, and
                    several other seminaries. Amongst other charitable institutions, is an hospital,
                    where the sick of all countries are freely admitted and relieved.</p>
                <p>The climate of Lisbon is remarkably salubrious, and is sought after by invalids
                    from the more northern countries, for relief in pulmonary complaints. It is
                    thought that the water drunk in this city has a tendency to alleviate these
                    maladies. This water, which is brought from Montelavar by the aqueduct, is
                    strongly impregnated with carbonate of lime, and, on analysis, is like the water
                    of Clifton, but has a greater quantity of lime in a state of suspension.</p>
                <p>The markets of Lisbon are most profusely supplied with every article that can
                    administer to human appetite. The consμmption of animal food is small, that of
                    beef exceeding that of mutton in a very great degree; but, for the number of
                    inhabitants, the quantity of animal food consumed in Lisbon is only one eighth
                    of that which London requires to supply it. Fish, both from the sea and the
                    rivers, is abundant and cheap. Fruit of every kind, and flour of excellent
                    quality, are to be purchased; and garlic, which seems to be one of the articles
                    in most extensive demand, is furnished in prodigious quantities.</p>
                <p>Before the great earthquake of 1755, the city of Lisbon was calculated to contain
                    150,000 inhabitants; but, by the census taken in 1804, the number amounted to
                    240,000. The removal of the court to Brazil did not diminish the population, but
                    it has since declined, so that in 1830, by the last census, there were only
                    200,000, which, indeed, was both increased and enriched by this city having been
                    during the peninsular war the focal point through which communication with the
                    army was maintained, and the dépôt for the ammunition, provisions, and recruits,
                    destined to support the forces employed in the interior of Spain and
                    Portugal.</p>
                <p>There are few people in Lisbon occupied in manufactures. Some fine woollen cloths
                    are made, some linens, and a quantity of silk goods more than equal to that of
                    both the others. The greatest taste of this city is displayed in its jewellery
                    business, in which, though rather tawdry than elegant, they excel. The
                    goldsmiths and silversmiths are excellent workmen. As a specimen of the best
                    faculties exercised in that branch, it deserves to be noticed, that the splendid
                    service of plate presented to the Duke of Wellington by the government of
                    Portugal was wholly made in Lisbon; and no person was permitted to execute the
                    least part of the work who was not a native of the kingdom. This service, both
                    for value and for the exquisite workmanship, is the first collection that was
                    ever seen, and far exceeds that of any royal household in Europe.</p>
                <p>The foreign trade of Lisbon is second to no city in Europe excepting that of
                    London. Its domestic productions, wine, oil, fruits, and bay salt, are conveyed
                    to all the northern parts of the continent of Europe, but more especially to
                    England, with which is the principal commerce. It receives in return from every
                    country the articles in which it excels; from Russia, hemp, flax, and other
                    naval stores; from the other parts in the Baltic Sea, linens, iron, steel,
                    salted fish, timber, pitch, and tar; from Germany and Holland it obtains linens,
                    corn, and some other commodities. England makes returns in cloths, linens,
                    cotton, hardware, porcelain, and the various products of its looms, its forges,
                    and its kilns. France supplies some linens, and the more fanciful articles of
                    its tasteful industry. These varied commodities, received at Lisbon, are partly
                    consumed in Portugal, whilst a very considerable proportion of them are destined
                    for re-exportation to the transmarine settlements.</p>
                <p>The commerce of Lisbon is considerable with the Portuguese establishments in
                    China, in India, and on both sides of the continent of Africa. The latter
                    consists principally of such articles as are required to be given in exchange
                    for human beings, in that abominable traffic denominated the slave-trade, but
                    which deserves to be stigmatized as the commerce of cruelty and the stimulus to
                    murder and barbarism. Brazil furnished for a long period the great rudiments oí
                    the distant trade of Lisbon. Its sugars were distributed from hence to all the
                    continental ports, where they obtained the name of the port at which they had
                    first been received </p>

                <p>in Europe. The cotton from that country, before the recent encouragements to its
                    growth had given birth to its present enormous production, all centred in
                    Lisbon; and it was the entrepôt for the gold, the silver, and the precious
                    stones which the mines of Brazil yielded.</p>
                <p>The removal of the seat of the Portuguese government from the European metropolis
                    to its American dominions, caused a great revolution in the commercial relations
                    of both parts of the empire. Brazil, having quitted its colonial character, had
                    its ports opened to the commercial ships of all nations; the transit trade of
                    Lisbon was in some measure terminated; but the alteration communicated such a
                    stimulus to Brazil, and its population, its wealth, and its productions,
                    increased so much within the first ten years that elapsed after the emigration
                    of the court, that, after allowing for what passed direct to and from Brazil in
                    its intercourse with other countries, its transactions of commerce with Lisbon
                    were as great as before the removal of the government.</p>
                <p>We have no authentic accounts of the foreign imports and exports; but some
                    judgment may be formed from the eturns of the vessels that entered the port in
                    the years, 1829, 1830, and 1831, as furnished by the British consul :—</p>
                <p>The average number of vessels, and their tonnage, which belonged to the port of
                    Lisbon in the same three years, was, by the consular report, sixty ships, and of
                    9090 tons burden.</p>
                <p>Lisbon is situated in north latitude 38. 42. 20., and west longitude from London
                    8. 37. 25., as determined by trigonometrical observations.</p>
