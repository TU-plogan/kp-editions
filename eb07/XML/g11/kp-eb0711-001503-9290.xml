                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">GUARINI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Giovanni Battista</hi></label>,
                    a celebrated Italian poet, was born at Ferrara, on the lθth of December 1537. He
                    studied at the university of Padua, under the direction of his father,
                    Alexander, to whom he owed the greater part of his acquisitions in knowledge,
                    and more particularly his taste for poetry. Guarini succeeded his father in the
                    chair of humanity at Ferrara, though then scarcely twenty; but some lyrical
                    compositions already published by him had inspired such hopes of future eminence
                    as fully justified his promotion. Called to the court of the Duke of Ferrara, at
                    that period the resort of men of the first talents in Italy, he there became
                    acquainted with Tasso, who was seven years younger than himself, gained his
                    friendship, and afterwards became his most zealous defender and ardent
                    panegyrist. The duke having knighted Guarini, intrusted him with several
                    important missions to the different courts of Europe; but, during fourteen years
                    that he remained in the service of this prince, he never obtained the slightest
                    recompense,and in the meanwhile had expended the greater part of his fortune.
                    Guarini complained of this; the duke, conscious that his complaints were well
                    founded, became irritated; récrimination ensued, and the poet retired in disgust
                    from court. Some time afterwards, he passed into the service of Emanuel
                    Philibert, duke of Savoy, and next into that of Vincent, duke of Mantua; but as,
                    at both courts, he received much praise and no salary, he at length retired to
                    his estate of Guarina, near Reggio. Having lost his wife, he formed a design of
                    taking holy orders, and with this γiew repaired to Rome. But Guarini had too
                    much ambition to persevere in such a scheme, and, accustomed as he had been to
                    the gaieties of courts, he found himself but little disposed to relish the
                    sweets of retirement. He accordingly returned to Ferrara, and thence proceeded
                    to Florence, where the Grand Duke Ferdinand loaded him with presents and
                    honours. His good fortune, however, was not of long duration. The grand duke,
                    wishing to establish suitably a lady of Pisa to whom he had been attached,
                    induced one of the sons of Guarini to marry her without the knowledge of his
                    father, whose delicacy on the point of honour was <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    well known to him. When the latter was made acquainted with the marriage of his
                    son, his indignation knew no bounds, and, justly offended at the despotic
                    proceeding of the grand duke, he quitted Tuscany without the ceremony of taking
                    leave. But after passing some months with his protectress, the Duchess of
                    Urbino, he became reconciled to the Duke of Ferrara; and, in 1603, he was sent
                    by that prince to Rome as ambassador to Pope Paul V. Guarini, however, was
                    constantly the sport of fortune; for, besides the ingratitude of the great, of
                    which he had had painful experience, his life was embittered by domestic
                    misfortunes. He had lost in the flower of her age a wife whom he adored; and his
                    three sons frequently stirred up domestic quarrels about the division of a
                    fortune almost entirely exhausted. But the most severe blow he received was by
                    the tragical death of his daughter Anna. On returning from one of his journey's,
                    he went to visit his beloved child, and when he fondly expected to fold her in
                    his arms, he found only a bloody corpse. She had just fallen a victim to the
                    jealousy of a suspicious and violent husband. But all these misfortunes did not
                    prevent Guarini from occupying himself with his works, the principal of which
                    are, 1. Il Pastor Fido, a pastoral tragicoedy in five acts, and in verse, which
                    passed through forty editions during the lifetime of the author, and by which
                    his name has been rendered for ever famous; 2. Verrato Primo, Ferrara, 1588; 3.
                    Verrato Secundo, Florence, 1595; 4. Il Segretario, dialogo, Venice,
                    1594—1600;</p>
                <p>5. Idropica, a comedy in five acts, and in prose, Rome, 1614. A very beautiful
                    edition of the works of Guarini was published at Ferrara, in 1737, four vols.
                    4to, with superb engravings, and very beautiful vignettes. The second volume
                    contains the lyrical compositions of the author, some of which are highly
                    esteemed; the fourth is filled with annotations, and apologies or defences of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Pastor Eido,</hi> by different authors. Guarini also left
                    a treatise on public liberty, which reasons of state, however, prevented him
                    from publishing. His death took place at Venice, whither he had latterly
                    retired, on the 6th of October 1612, in the seventy-fifth year of his age.
                    Guarini’s claim to the character of a great poet must rest exclusively on his
                    <hi rend="italic">Pastor Fido,</hi> which, with all its faults, contains
                    innumerable redeeming beauties, and still maintains its place as an Italian
                    classic. His style, though it wants the purity, sweetness, and elegance, which
                    characterise that of Tasso, is full of rich and sparkling imagery; and his
                    sentiments, if not always natural or just, are seldom deficient in force and
                    vivacity. The greatest blemish of the <hi rend="italic">Pastor Fido</hi> is its
                    frequent indecency and exceptionable morality. It is no doubt true that Corisco
                    repents towards the conclusion of the piece, and that there is an apparent
                    conformity in this respect to the established rule; but this professed
                    repentance comes only after having displayed a character equally vile and
                    perfidious, and promulgated maxims of the most relaxed morality. Although the
                    <hi rend="italic">Pastor Fido</hi> had been represented in all the courts of
                    Italy, and even before popes, yet it was afterwards put into the <hi
                    rend="italic">Index</hi> by reason of the licentiousness which pervades it, and
                    particularly on account of the passage commencing <hi rend="italic">Sdlpeccar è
                    si</hi><hi rend="italic">dolce</hi><hi rend="italic">e</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >il</hi><hi rend="italic">non pec-car si</hi><hi rend="italic">necessario.</hi>
                    But with all these defects, it is a work of undoubted genius, and will continue
                    to maintain the reputation which it originally acquired for its author. <hi
