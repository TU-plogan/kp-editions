                    one of the new states into which the western world is divided. From the
                    circumstance of its position, it has assumed the name of Central America. The
                    constitution is modelled upon that of North America. This republic comprehends
                    that portion of territory which stretches from the southern extremity of Mexico
                    to the northern point of Colombia, from about the eighty-third to the
                    ninety-fourth degree of west longitude. It extends about eight hundred miles in
                    length, comprehending a great part of the isthmus of Panama, and embracing an
                    extent of surface computed at about twenty-two thousand square leagues. This
                    tract of country was subdued by Alvarado, who was sent thither by Cortes, the
                    Spanish general, at that time pursuing his career of conquest in Mexico Alvarado
                    arrived in the year 1524, at a time propitious for the success of his
                    enterprise, for two of the most powerful nations of the country were then at
                    war. Too jealous of each other to unite against a common enemy, the numerous
                    tribes or nations inhabiting Guatimala fell one by one under the dominion of the
                    Spaniards, notwithstanding that a formidable resistance was made to them in some
                    quarters. The methods resorted to by the Spaniards for reducing the Indians to
                    subjection were similar to those practised in other parts of the American
                    continent. The people whom they subdued by treachery and the sword were not at
                    all inferior to those of Mexicoand Peru. The conquerors found large cities, well
                    fortified by castles, and adorned with splendid palaces and other sumptuous
                    edifices. The Guatimalans were of course idolaters, and, with the missal in the
                    one hand and the sword in the other, the Spaniards succeeded in forcing them
                    reluctantly to substitute the Christian worship for their own. One part of the
                    country, however, called Vera Paz, which baffled the efforts of the Spaniards to
                    subdue it, received milder treatment at the hands of some pious ecclesiastics,
                    who employed persuasion instead of force, and thus succeeded in bringing then
                    also under the Spanish yoke. From the period of its conquest until it declared
                    its independence, the country, under the appellation of the kingdom of
                    Guatimala, was governed by a captain-general appointed by the court of Spain,
                    and a royal audiencia or prétorial court. The jurisdiction of this court
                    extended from eight to seventeen degrees north latitude, and from eighty-two to
                    ninety-five degrees west longitude, comprehending an extent of surface computed
                    at 26,152 square leagues, with a population of about 1,200,000 souls.<note

                    >Political Essay,</hi> vol. iv. p. 322.</p></note> The kingdom was divided into
                    fifteen provinces, which were governed by inferior officers, amenable to the
                    audiencia. There was scarcely any thing like a military force kept up, but
                    spiritual matters were managed by a competent number of ecclesiastics, under the
                    direction of the Archbishop of Guatimala, and four suffragans. Things continued
                    in this state until the political events which took place in various parts of
                    South America increased the discontent which had been generated in Guatimala by
                    some acts of despotism committed by the mother country. In the year 1821, when
                    the fate of Mexico was decided, several meetings of the most influential
                    individuals took place, at which it was agreed to shake themselves free of Old
                    Spain. Several of the provinces joined together and published a manifesto to
                    this effect; but San Salvador protested against it, and immediately formed a
                    provisional government of its own. The government of Guatimala dispatched troops
                    to attack San Salvador, but they were repulsed. In this emergency they solicited
                    support from Mexico which being granted, San Salvador yielded to General
                    Filisola in February 1823. In March the general congress was convoked, and in
                    the month following it met and assumed the name of Constituent Assembly. To this
                    congress all the provinces sent deputies, with the exception of Chiapa, which
                    continued firm in its adherence to Mexico One of the first acts of the
                    constituent assembly, after the nomination of an executive, was to publish a
                    decree, declaring “these provinces independent of Spain, Mexico and every other
                    power, either of the old or new world.” This decree is dated the 1st of July
                    1823. Towards the end of the same year was published the basis of its future
                    constitution, by which Guatimala was declared a federal republic, comprehending
                    five states, joined together under the denomination of the United Provinces of
                    Central America.</p>
                <p>It was ordained that the <hi rend="italic">legislative</hi> power should reside,
                    first, in a federal congress, composed of representatives elected by the people;
                    and, secondly, in a <hi rend="italic">senate,</hi> composed ol two senators
                    popularly elected by each state. The privileges of this body were, to sanction
                    the acts of the federal congress, to counsel the executive on important cases,
                    to nominate the individuals employed by the federation, and to watch over their
                    conduct. The <hi rend="italic">executive</hi> power was declared to be vested,
                    1. in a president popularly chosen; 2. in a vice-president; and, 3. in a supreme
                    court of justice. The internal affairs of each state were decreed to be
                    regulated by itself upon the following principles: 1. By an assembly of deputies
                    properly chosen; 2. by a council, similarly elected; 3. by a chief; 4. by a
                    vice-chief; and, 5. by a supreme court of judicature. These individuals or
                    bodies were invested with certain definite powers, by which, it was hoped, good
                    government would be obtained, and equal justice administered to the people. The
                    constituent assembly now began to form a constitution, leaving, in the mean
                    time, the different states to regulate their own concerns. The assembly
                    subsequently had various sittings, and drew up a great number of articles, by
                    which the government was to be regulated. Guatimala, however, like the republics
                    in the South American continent, has never remained at rest with itself since it
                    was erected into a free state. Continual insurrections have broken out; at one
                    time one party, at another time another party, predominating. Peace and good
                    order can scarcely be said to be as yet restored to it. The following table
                    exhibits the number of departments, towns, and villages, in each state :—</p>

                <p>These five states, taken together, exhibit the figure of an irregular triangle,
                    the vertex of which is in the province of Panama, and the base in the line that
                    separates the country from New Spain. They are bounded on the west and
                    north-west by Mexico on the south-east by the province of Veraguas, on the north
                    by the Atlantic, and on the south and south-west by the Pacific. Our knowledge
                    of the physical geography of Guatimala is imperfect. Generally speaking, the
                    face of the country is covered with mountains, but their elevations, or the
                    volcanic phenomena which they exhibit, are but little known. The mountains, in
                    some places bordering on the Atlantic, in others coasting the Pacific, and again
                    in situations traversing the middle of the isthmus, give their own peculiar
                    character to the country. The prevailing rocks are granite and porphyry; and in
                    crossing them the traveller often feels himself transferred from a hot to a cold
                    and chilling temperature. The productions, of course, vary in their nature,
                    according to the elevations where they grow. At a height of from twelve to
                    fourteen hundred feet, indigo, cotton, and cocoa flourish. At an elevation of
                    from four to five thousand feet the productions of the temperate zone exhibit
                    themselves. Wheat is cultivated upon lands from six to nine thousand feet above
                    the level of the ocean; and on the tops of the highest mountains the hardy pine
                    is to be found. There are a number of volcanoes, which have at different times
                    spread terror and destruction over the contiguous country. In the valley of
                    Guatimala stands the three-peaked Volcan de Fuego, from which the old city has
                    repeatedly suffered injury, and which still, by occasionally emitting smoke and
                    flame, seems to threaten an eruption. Other seven volcanoes exhibit the same
                    phenomena, and may be said to remain still in a state of activity. These are
                    Tajamulco, in the province Quezaltenango; Izalco, near Sonzonate; Momotombo and
                    Mazaya, in Nicaragua; St Vincent and St Salvador, in the state of the same name;
                    and Atitan, situated in one of the interior provinces, and which sent forth an
                    eruption 'in 1827. It was accompanied by an earthquake; and throughout Guatimala
                    earthquakes are frequent. The rivers are numerous, but not in general navigable,
                    except by canoes. They are, besides, rapid, owing to the steep acclivity of
                    their course, and their entrance is obstructed by bars. The largest river is the
                    Lempa, which runs chiefly through the province of San Salvador. At its lowest
                    ebb it is an hundred and forty yards in breadth, and its current is very rapid.
                    Of lakes there are three of considerable size and depth. The Lake of Nicaragua
                    is of vast extent; and should the proposal of a junction between the Pacific and
                    it take place, it will become of great importance in a commercial point of view.
                    Lake Peten is said to be twenty-six leagues in circumference, and in some parts
                    thirty fathoms deep. Lake Atitan covers eight leagues from east to west, and
                    four from north to south. Its depth has not been fathomed; and although several
                    rivers flow into it, there is no visible outlet for the waters which it thus
                    receives. These, and numerous other sheets of water, abound in fish; in many of
                    them there are little islands, picturesquely wooded, and in some instances
                    inhabited. On the banks of the rivers, and on the shores of one or two of the
                    lakes, salt is collected in, large quantities, and constitutes a considerable
                    branch of trade in some of the provinces. Medicinal and other springs, both cold
                    and hot, are found in various parts of the country.</p>
                <p>Of the zoology of Guatimala little is known. Of the quadrupeds usually found in
                    such climates there is abundance; and of the feathered tribes there is an
                    infinite variety, from the minute and beautiful humming-bird to the heavy-winged
                    vulture. The quezal, from the beauty of its plumage, is perhaps the most
                    remarkable. The guacamaya, or great macaw, the wild peacock, the raxon, the
                    chion, and the chulpilchoc, also attract the traveller of the woods by the
                    splendour of the colours which they exhibit. In the warmer provinces serpents
                    and reptiles infest every bush; and those smaller animals which .come under the
                    head of entomology are of every genus and species. In short, every branch of the
                    animal kingdom of Guatimala abounds in objects of interest. Nor is the vegetable
                    kingdom less productive. During the whole of the year the greater part of the
                    mountains and plains are covered with a profusion of beautiful flowers. Forty
                    genera of fruits are reckoned to grow spontaneously upon the hills. There are
                    numerous thick forests, in which valuable woods of great size are to be found in
                    abundance. Cedars are met with exceeding five fathoms in circumference, and
                    mahogany trees of little less magnitude. Resins, balsams, and medicinal herbs,
                    are also abundant. Of almost every production, both of a tropical and
                    intertropical climate, may be enumerated amongst grains, maize, producing in
                    some places three hundred fold, and sometimes two or three crops annually;
                    wheat, barley, and rice. Potatoes, greens, and all other kinds of vegetables,
                    are also abundant. Amongst fruits may be enumerated several species of
                    plantains, apples, pine-apples, peaches, and apricos; whilst pears, melons,
                    grapes, oranges, figs, cherries, pines, and a great many others little known in
                    Europe, are everywhere to be met with. To these maybe added, as productions of
                    the country, bark, sarsaparilla, cinnamon, hellebore, coffee, ginger, cassia,
                    tamarinds, aniseed, Brazil wood, indigo, cocoa, cochineal, vanilla, sugar, flax,
                    tobacco, cotton of various species, pepper, sulphur, saltpetre, musk, and a
                    multitude of other articles.</p>

                <p>We shall now give a brief account of the different provinces. Guatimala is the
                    central province, comprehending the great chain of volcanic mountains, and the
                    slope downwards from them to the sea. Within these mountains is situated what is
                    called the great valley of Guatimala, which consists properly of nine valleys.
                    There is great variety of climate, and the productions of the country are found
                    in the highest perfection. ∙ The city of Guatimala, the present capital of the
                    republic, is situated in the midst of the plain of La Virgen, which is five
                    leagues in diameter, and forms part of the valley of Mexico one of the nine
                    small valleys. The city lies in 14. 37. north latitude, and 90. 30. west
                    longitude, and is ninety leagues from the Atlantic, twenty-six from the Pacific,
                    and four hundred from the city of Mexico The valley is very fertile, being
                    watered by several streams; and the city is surrounded by numerous villages,
                    which supply its markets with fruits and vegetables. The houses consist only of
                    one storey, and occupy a great space of ground; so that, to the eye of a
                    European, the city, when viewed from a distance, appears to be much more
                    populous and extensive than it really is. It contains about sixty <hi
                    rend="italic">manaznas</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> or squares of
                    houses, formed by the intersection of streets at right angles, which vary in
                    extent from a hundred and fifty to three hundred and fifty yards in front; and
                    these are arranged so as to form one large square. On each side of the city, as
                    the suburbs have increased, other houses have been erected, without much regard
                    to uniformity. The streets are broad, but ill paved; and sloping downwards from
                    each side, they form a gutter in the middle. The market-place is a square
                    extending about one hundred and fifty yards each way, with a fountain in the
                    middle. Besides the daily market, there are numerous temporary stalls; and the
                    square is surrounded by buildings, offices, and shops. The public edifices are
                    numerous, consisting of a university with twelve professorships, five convents,
                    four nunneries, a cathedral, four parish churches, and fifteen other churches or
                    chapels of minor importance. There are also a treasury, mint, government
                    offices, and a spacious prison. The style of architecture is in general good,
                    and some of the buildings are handsomely decorated. The houses are well built
                    and commodiously arranged, and there is generally attached to them a stone
                    reservoir for containing water. The city is remarkably well supplied with water.
                    From a spring in the mountains it is conducted by pipes into twelve public
                    reservoirs, from which it is distributed to every private dwelling. There are
                    here two public or endowed schools for boys, and the girls are taught in the
                    convents; but the Guatimalans in general are very imperfectly educated.
                    Literature is at a very low ebb, although there are various printing
                    establishments, and several newspapers are published. The religious processions
                    which take place here are very numerous, but they partake more of buffoonery
                    than solemnity. Guatimala is situated at about five hundred feet above the ocean
                    level, in a temperate and salubrious climate, being neither exposed to the
                    intensity of a summer’s sun, nor to the stormy blasts of winter. The average
                    heat during the day is about 69 degrees in the shade; and throughout the year
                    the thermometer scarcely varies. The scenery of the surrounding country is
                    majestic and beautiful, and the soil is capable of producing all kinds of fruits
                    and vegetables; but it is very much neglected. The cultivation of the cochineal
                    insect has since 1821 been pushed to a great extent. Large plantations are
                    situated in the neighbourhood of the city. Earthquakes sometimes occur; but they
                    are not so destructive now, ås, from the accounts of the early historians, we
                    are led to believe that they previously were. The population has been estimated
                    at about 35,000, consisting of European Spaniards, white Creoles, Mulattoes, and
                    Indians.</p>
                <p>La Antigua, or Old Guatimala, is situated some leagues nearer to the Pacific
                    Ocean. It was formerly one of the handsomest cities in the new world, the seat
                    of an archbishop, and the metropolis of the kingdom. Previously to 1773, it had
                    been to a greater or less extent destroyed by earthquakes; and in that year
                    seven successive shocks were experienced, upon which the governor issued a
                    decree, commanding the citizens to quit their habitations, and remove farther
                    from the volcanoes. This they were compelled to obey; and the government was
                    accordingly transferred to New Guatimala. The old city remained in a deserted
                    and ruinous condition for some time, until at length many of its former
                    occupants resumed their old habitations; and again it has gradually become
                    peopled, and partially rebuilt. It is still, however, far inferior in size and
                    population to the new capital.</p>
                <p>There are few other towns in Guatimala of sufficient importance to require a
                    detailed description. The inhabitants of the province are employed, first, as
                    carriers, in which capacity they supply all the other states; secondly, in the
                    production of cochineal, a little indigo, about five hundred cargoes of cocoa,
                    and some flour; and thirdly, in the manufacture of some coarse woollens, of
                    which it is calculated a quantity equal in value to two hundred thousand dollars
                    is furnished to the other states.</p>
                <p>The province of Salvador, anciently called Cuscatlan, or the land of riches, is
                    bounded on the south by the Pacific Ocean, on the north by Honduras, on the east
                    by Nicaragua, and on the west by Guatimala. The natural productions of this
                    province appear to be similar to those of Guatimala. It possesses mines of
                    silver, iron, and other metals; and a considerable quantity of indigo is
                    produced, in which consists the chief trade of Salvador. Sugar and cotton are
                    also raised, and the inhabitants are principally employed in the cultivation of
                    these, particularly the former article. San Salvador, the capital, was founded
                    in 1528 by the Spaniards, who had conquered the country three years previously
                    to that period. This city, which now ranks second in the republic, is situated
                    in 13. 36. north latitude, and 89. 46. west longitude, at the distance of eight
                    leagues from the Pacific Ocean. It is surrounded by hills and mountains covered
                    with wood, and terminating on the north-east in a dormant volcano. The streets
                    run in right angles, the houses are commodious, and the market is well supplied.
                    It contains a population of about 16,000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The province of Honduras stretches east and west on the shores of the Atlantic.
                    It is bounded by the Bay of Honduras on the north, by Nicaragua on the
                    south-east and east, by San Salvador on the south, and by the department of
                    Chiquimula on the west. Its territory is for the most part rugged and
                    mountainous, but rich in metals. The whole coast is flat, marshy, hot, and
                    extremely unhealthy, although some parts of the interior rise into hilly and
                    temperate tracts. In consequence of the unpropitious nature of the climate, this
                    part of the country is thinly peopled. It abounds in thick forests, containing
                    the most valuable mahogany and logwood trees. Comayagua, the capital of the
                    province, is situated in a beautiful plain, in about 14. 50. north latitude, and
                    87. 46. west longitude, and is distant from Guatimala about a hundred and
                    forty-four leagues. Truxillo, formerly the capital of a province, stands on an
                    elevation of about thirty yards above the level of the sea, in latitude 15. 48.
                    north, and longitude 86. west. This place is well fortified, but the population
                    is small. Gracias a Dios, once a flourishing city, is situated about
                    thirty-eight leagues from Comayagua, in latitude 14. 40. north, and longitude
                    88. 30. west. At present the population is small, and the city itself is in a
                    state of great decay. The inhabitants of Honduras are principally employed in
                    the rearing of about forty thousand head of cattle, introduced annually into San
                    Salvador and Guatimala, and in the cultivation of tobacco. <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193639342" xml:id="kp-eb0711-9342-0019"/>The British settlement of
                    Honduras, situated in the province of Merida or Yucutan, belonging to Mexico is
                    uniformly, in works upon geography, described along with Guatimala; but as it is
                    now beyond the limits of that republic, an account of it will be given under the
                    head of <hi rend="smallcaps">Honduras.</hi></p>
                <p>The province of Nicaragua is bounded on the north by Honduras, on the east by the
                    Atlantic, on the south by Costa Rica and the Pacific Ocean, and on the west by
                    Tegucigalpa, a department of Honduras. From west to east it extends eighty-five
                    leagues, and from north to south about seventy-five. The chain of the volcanic
                    Andes here terminates, and the territory is in general low and moist. It is rich
                    in all the tropical fruits, but those peculiar to a temperate zone are not to be
                    met with. Here there are vast savannahs, covered with herds of cattle, some of
                    which are sent to the city of Guatimala. Leon, or San Leon de Nicaragua, is
                    situated in latitude 12.20. north, and long. 86. 16. west. It is four leagues
                    from the Pacific, and a hundred and eighty-three from Guatimala. Previously to
                    the revolution, it was one of the most beautiful cities of the kingdom, and was
                    rapidly advancing in prosperity when political animosities split the inhabitants
                    into parties; but the city was torn to pieces by the factions, and for a time
                    nearly deserted. Nicaragua is not very large, but occupies an advantageous
                    position on the north-western shore. It contains about 7000 inhabitants, of whom
                    about 1000 are Spaniards, with a college, which, in 1812, was converted into a
                    university. Mazaya, a village containing about 6000 inhabitants, almost entirely
                    Indian, is said to be the most trading place in the province, though
                    inconveniently situated at the bottom of a deep rocky dell, which is almost
                    destitute of water. The inhabitants of this province are chiefly employed in the
                    breeding of cattle, and in raising cocoa.</p>
                <p>Costa Rica, or Rich Coast, notwithstanding its name, is the poorest and most
                    destitute of all the provinces. It extends an hundred and sixty leagues from
                    west to east, and about sixty leagues from north to south. Its climate is warm
                    but healthy, and its population very widely scattered. It has however mines of
                    gold and silver, once said to have been rich, but now unproductive. Cartago, the
                    ancient capital, is situated in about 9. 10. north latitude, and 82.46. west
                    longitude, four hundred leagues east-south-east from Guatimala, thirty leagues
                    from the Atlantic, and thirty from the Pacific. San José, to which the seat of
                    government was transferred about the time of the revolution, has about the same
                    amount of population. There is little trade except in mahogany and cedar, which
                    is shipped from Peru, the inhabitants of this province raising little more of
                    any article than is necessarily consumed within itself. The growth of maize, and
                    the manufacture of panelas (small loaves of unrefined sugar prepared from the
                    cane), are common to all the states.</p>
                <p>To the east and south-east of the province of Honduras lies a tract of country
                    called Poyais and the Mosquito shore. It consists of a vast and savage forest,
                    beat by the burning rays of the sun, and occupied by a race of Indians, who
                    consider themselves as under the protection of Britain, although the British
                    government claims no territory in this part of the country. The Mosquito-men
                    possess great muscular strength. Tall and erect, and little encumbered with
                    clothing, with vacant countenances, and long greasy hair, they present a wild
                    and savage appearance, and afford fine specimens of the powerful barbarian.
                    Poyais is memorable on account of the unhappy issue of an attempt made by some
                    Englishmen to form a settlement in this quarter, whither they had been led by
                    the promises and representations of an adventurer, called, or calling himself, a
                    cacique.</p>
                <p>With regard to agriculture and commerce, Guatimala is still very far behind,
                    considering her natural resources« ∣ One great drawback to improvement in this
                    respect is, the great expense attending the transport of goods by land, and the
                    want of proper ports, upon the coast. On the Pacific, the only ports frequented
                    are Conchagua, situated a few leagues from San Salvador, which possesses an
                    excellent harbour; and Acajutla, an unsheltered bay, five leagues from
                    Sonzonate, which is used as the port of Guatimala. From this place it is
                    fifty-five leagues distant, and the road lies over a rough and mountainous tract
                    of country. Another point, however, has been fixed upon as an eligible spot for
                    a harbour. It has been called the Port of Independencia; and, as it is situated
                    nearer to the capital, and the road lying between the two places is better than
                    the other, it affords every convenience and advantage for carrying on an
                    extensive traffic in the Pacific Ocean. For some years previously to the
                    revolution, the commerce was retrograding; but since that event occurred, it has
                    certainly improved. The most important production of the country is indigo,
                    which is celebrated for its excellence. Of the exact quantity raised no idea can
                    be formed. The cultivation of cochineal has rapidly increased. In 1826, or about
                    five years after its introduction, the harvest was estimated at ninety thousand
                    pounds. Considerable quantities of tobacco and cotton are also raised; and sugar
                    and cocoa are likewise cultivated, but little coffee is grown. There are some
                    manufactures in the country; but articles of wearing apparel, and those for
                    domestic use, are principally imported from Europe. The only remaining source of
                    national wealth is the mines. Since the revolution some very exaggerated
                    statements have been published as to the mineral wealth of Guatimala, and
                    several of the mines are in the hands of companies, who are attempting to work
                    them; but, by all accounts, the speculation will not be so profitable as was
                    anticipated, the working of the mines being expensive. Of the amount of foreign
                    goods imported into Guatimala only a rude guess can be formed. It has been
                    estimated at about two millions of dollars, whilst the quantity of produce
                    exported does not amount to two thirds of that sum. The exports consist chiefly
                    of cochineal, indigo, cocoa, cotton, hides, and drugs. The imports are
                    principally made by the ports of Omoa and Yzabal. The former, which is about an
                    hundred leagues distant from Guatimala, is the principal depot for goods from
                    the Havannah and the peninsula, with which some small trade is carried on; and
                    the latter for British merchandise from Belize, in the British territory of
                    Honduras. The goods are transported from one place to another by means of mules,
                    which are rather scarce in the country. By the parliamentary papers for 1831, it
                    appears that during that year the official value of the imports from Guatimala
                    into Great Britain amounted to L.8065. 4s. 6d.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding all its advantages, the chief of which is the variety of its
                    productions, it is much to be doubted whether Guatimala will ever attain to any
                    very high pitch of prosperity as a nation. Indeed this will be nearly
                    impossible, until the present inhabitants, who have little enterprise, and are
                    very indolent, shall have their moral character elevated by a large infusion of
                    European intellect and industry. It would seem that at present the very
                    advantages which Guatimala possesses were the means of retarding its
                    improvement. For, in countries where the soil is so rich and the climate so
                    propitious as to produce spontaneously almost all the necessaries of life,
                    which, to a considerable extent, can be appropriated at pleasure by the natives,
                    there is an inducement held out to indolence which cannot well be resisted,
                    especially by a population at least two fifths of whom are of a low order of
                    intellect; individuals who are sufficiently satisfied with such articles as are
                    necessary for their own subsistence, without<pb break="no" facs="nls:193639355"

                    extension of individual power. Guatimala contains about one million and a half

                <p>A society consisting of four different classes, which are not only distinct from
                    one another, but which present nearly opposite characteristics, can scarcely be
                    supposed ever to become firmly knit together so as to constitute a strong
                    political body. Speaking generally, the strength of states results from the
                    union of the people; and union arises from congeniality of feeling, identity of
                    interests, similarity of habits and tastes, and such an equality of moral
                    character as is usually met with amongst the individual races of mankind. But in
                    Guatimala, the Europeans, proud of their Castillian blood, look with contempt
                    upon the natives, whom they place far below them in intelligence, which the
                    latter have no alternative but to acknowledge, though at the same time they
                    accuse the Spanish nation of being the cause of all he evils which have
                    distracted the country. The Europeans are chiefly composed of individuals who
                    left their own country young, and by their talents and industry acquired wealth
                    in Guatimala. The leading Americans, or white Creoles, are descendants of the
                    Spaniards, who at an earlier period acquired fortunes in the same place. The
                    latter are again divided into two parties, the liberals, and the serviles or
                    noblesse as they call themselves, both differing widely' in feeling and in
                    sentiment. The next class is the mulatto or mixed race, which forms as it were
                    the physical force of the nation; for whilst they would seem to equal or nearly
                    equal the Indians in numbers, they possess an energy and cunning, a sort of rude
                    intelligence, to which the latter have no pretensions. This mixed people are
                    always impressed into the service of either of the two former classes during
                    civil dissensions. The last class, or aboriginal Indians, are the lowest of all
                    in every respect; but they in some measure assist in balancing the other powers,
                    for they thoroughly hate the mixed race. The greater proportion of the Indians
                    live in villages built after the Spanish manner, and employ themselves variously
                    in raising maize and vegetables, manufacturing mats and baskets, or as porters
                    and carriers; a second portion live on farms, where they are regularly employed;
                    and both .these classes arc governed by officers chosen from amongst themselves.
                    There are other two classes, the Indians composing which either live in <hi
                    rend="subscript"> x</hi> huts or long straggling villages, or form, like the
                    Lazzaroni of Italy, a sori of half mendicant race, lounging in idleness during
                    the day, and sleeping at night under the piazzas of the squares. The Indians
                    have been known at times to display considerablehardihood and daring, but they
                    are generally characterised by pusillanimity. This, however, only applies to the
                    interior Indians; the unsubdued Mosquito-men are remarkable for their reckless
                    valour and invincible energy. The Indian of Guatimala, although incapable of
                    violent effort, can endure considerable fatigue. Of his capacity for improvement
                    by superior education, little can be said with certainty, as the experiment does
                    not seem to have been made upon a scale ample enough to entitle us to form a
                    correct judgment upon the subject. Some of those who have been admitted into
                    convents have displayed ability: and others in whom talent was apparent, have
                    been educated at the university, where they displayed some quickness of
                    apprehension; but after a few years, they became addicted to intoxication, and
                    relapsed into their original ( barbarism. The Indians excel in the imitative
                    arts, and mould waxen figures with taste, ingenuity, and correctness , to
                    nature. The only dress of the men consists of a cincture made of <hi
                    rend="italic">pita</hi> (the fibres of a plant, which, when twisted, resemble
                    the thread made of hemp); and the women wear merely a light cotton dress from
                    the middle downwards. The houses are nearly destitute of furniture; a mat spread
                    on the floor, or at best a small hammock, serves for a bed. Their food consists
                    chiefly of maize variously prepared. Thus, with his hut and his native corn, the
                    Indian passes his days in indolence, alike ignorant of intellectual enjoyment
                    and the luxuries and refinements of civilized life. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. r.
