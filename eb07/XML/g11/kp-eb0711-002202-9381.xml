                <p><label type="entry">GUIANA, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Guyana</hi></label>, a large
                    district of South America, in which the British, the Dutch, and the French, have
                    considerable settlements. This name was formerly given to the whole of that vast
                    tract of country which lies between the great rivers Orinoco and Amazons, but
                    the extent of the country distinguished by the name of Guiana is now
                    circumscribed to the land lying between the river Essequibo, which separates it
                    from Colombia on the west, and the river Carapury, which divides it from Brazil
                    on the east. It is bounded on the north by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the south
                    by Brazil, being about 600 miles in length, and having an average breadth of
                    about 250 miles. The settlements, however, do not extend nearly so far inland.
                    ’Those belonging to Great Britain, viz. Berbice, Demerara, and Essequibo, have
                    been described under these heads.</p>
                <p>Dutch Guiana, or Surinam, is the settlement situated in the middle of Guiana,
                    being bounded by Cayenne on the east, by British Guiana on the west, by the
                    Atlantic Ocean on the north, and by Brazil on the south. It comprehends a tract
                    of country of about 25,000 square miles, across the northern half of which runs
                    the fifth parallel of north latitude; whilst the meridian line, which indicates
                    the fifty-fifth degree of west longitude, traverses the eastern half. Like the
                    rest of Guiana, this coast is flat and alluvial, and is traversed by several
                    broad rivers, which come from a considerable distance in the interior. The
                    Surinam is a large and beautiful stream, having a channel about four miles wide;
                    but it is shallow and rocky, and can only be navigated by boats. The general
                    aspect of Dutch Guiana has been said in some respects to resemble that of
                    Holland and Lower Holstein. It presents' a vast plain covered with plantations
                    and enamelled with verdure, bounded on one side by a dark ridge of impenetrable
                    forests, and washed on the other by the azure billows of the ocean. The country
                    thus lying between the sea and the desert is irrigated by numerous streams,
                    confined by dykes, and separated from each other by excellent roads or navigable
                    canals. A number of small buildings are attached to each habitation, giving it
                    the appearance of a small village; and the natural beauties of the country form
                    a striking contrast with its rich cultivation. The Dutch have laboured most
                    industriously to improve it, and it is daily rising, in importance. Parmaribo,
                    the principal, indeed the only town, is built on the right side of the river
                    Surinam, at its mouth, where it affords excellent anchorage for vessels. The
                    streets are lined with rows of fruit trees, and the walks are covered with fine
                    gravel and sea-shells. The houses are fitted up. with considerable splendour,
                    the rooms being in general wainscotted with cedar, Brazilian, or mahogany wood.
                    The productions of this settlement, and the objects of natural history which it
                    presents, being similar to those already described under the heads <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Berbice</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Demerara,</hi> and in the
                    account which follows of Cayenne, it is not necessary to describe them here. The
                    amount of the population has been estimated at about 60,000, the greater part of
                    which consists of men of colour. The value of the exports is calculated at more
                    than L.1,000,000.</p>
                <p>The French settlement of Cayenne extends along the coast from the river Maroni,
                    which separates it from Dutch Guiana, to the river Carapury, which divides it
                    from Brazil. This boundary, however, has been much disputed, and the Brazilians
                    persist in occupying the country as far as the river Oyapock, which limits the
                    extent of the French territory on the coast to about 150 miles. By the treaty of
                    Amiens the French boundary had been extended to the river Arowari; but when the
                    government of Portugal was established in Brazil, a small force detached from
                    thence seized the province; and though, by the late treaties, it is restored to
                    France, the boundary has been considerably contracted towards the south. The few
                    settlements in the province are at the mouths of the rivers which water it, and
                    produce its fertility. These rivers, like those of the English and Dutch
                    settlements, have but short courses, their sources being in that range of
                    mountains which runs parallel to the coast, about 150 miles distant, in a region
                    which is denominated the country of the Caribb Indians, and which has not been
                    penetrated by any European. The two rivers which now bound Cayenne have their
                    sources in the Cordilleras, farther from the coast than the country of the
                    Caribbs; they have therefore much longer courses, and discharge into the ocean
                    much more copious waters than are contributed by those rivers which run through
                    the French settlements.</p>
                <p>The island of Cayenne, on which the capital is built, extends about eleven miles
                    from east to west, and eighteen from north to south; it is separated from the
                    main by a small river, which is fordable at low water, but at flood-tide is
                    navigable by boats. The city is built on the north-w est extremity of the
                    island, at the mouth of a river of the same name. It is strongly fortified, and
                    a hill within the enclosure commands the whole town and the anchorage of the
                    shipping. It is situated in north latitude 4. 56., and west longitude 52. 15.
                    from London. Both divisions of the town are ill built and badly paved; the
                    streets in the new part are wider, and the houses larger, than in the old one,
                    but neither is equal to the generality of even tropical towns in beauty and
                    cleanliness. With the exception of the officers of government, very few of the
                    inhabitants are of the unmixed white race, but are either mulattoes, quaderoons,
                    sambos, or negro slaves. Debauchery, indolence, and knavery, are the
                    characteristics of the greater part of the people of this city.</p>
                <p>This colony was first settled in the year 1550, by the celebrated Admiral de
                    Coligny, who, during the civil wars of France, wished to make it an asylum where
                    the Protestants, if unsuccessful, might retire, to follow, in security, their
                    worship and opinions. The course of events in Europe, after the return of
                    Coligny, was such as to prevent the colony from being long an object of
                    attention, and the few settlers were neglected by the government of France for
                    nearly two centuries. In the mean time neither the settlers nor the negro slaves
                    increased much, and the few descendants of the original Europeans were so
                    incorporated, by successive intermixtures with the coloured inhabitants, that
                    the difference of their race was with difficulty discoverable by their
                    complexions. The colony of Canada engrossed so large a portion of the regard of
                    the French court, that the establishment at Cayenne was only kept from sinking
                    by the accession of a few isolated settlers, who occasionally fixed themselves
                    there, as a last and desperate resource.</p>
                <p>But when, by the loss of Canada, the other colonial settlements became of more
                    value, an effort was made, upon a grand scale, to increase the population and
                    promote the cultivation of Guiana. Under the administration of Choiseul, a fleet
                    was equipped, which conveyed to Cayenne 15,000 persons. Few of them possessed
                    property, few of them were handicraftsmen or labourers, and of those still fewer
                    were disposed to work, supposing the climate would have enabled Europeans to
                    labour. The settlers were soon <pb break="no" facs="nls:193639394"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-9394-0023"/>visited with the dreadful fevers of the tropics,
                    and those who had the means of returning to Europe abandoned the country with
                    the utmost precipitation. In the year 1763, the number who landed was 13,060. Of
                    these, 2000 quitted it either for France, Canada, or the West India islands;
                    about 100 enlisted in the colonial battalion; and, at the end of the year 1765,
                    there were only in the colony 430 persons left of the expedition; so that more
                    than 10,000 must have perished in the first two years. The expense of this
                    equipment is supposed to have amounted to thirty-three millions of livres, the
                    whole of which, including a vast number of human beings, was sacrificed to a
                    plan in which the splendid rather than the useful was considered, though it was
                    sketched by the celebrated Turgot, and some other of the eminent economists of
                    France.</p>
                <p>From the period of this disastrous attempt, the colony continued to languish till
                    the American war broke out, when the predatory cruisers, both French and
                    Americans, carried in several valuable prizes. Many negro slaves were by these
                    captures conveyed to the settlement, and this enabled the planters to extend
                    their cultivation; so that, at the peace of 1783, the colony was in a more
                    thriving condition than it had been at any former period, and it continued to
                    increase in prosperity. The revolution of France extended its calamities to this
                    colony at a very early stage of its progress. As the rumour of the intention to
                    emancipate the negroes reached Cayenne, before the decree had passed in the
                    Convention, the richer proprietors, frightened by the menaces of the slaves,
                    fled from the colony; and the popular assembly, consisting principally of men of
                    colour, proclaimed them emigrants, and decreed the forfeiture of their estates.
                    When the decree was received and promulgated at Cayenne, the blacks supposed
                    that their labour was at an end, and that, on the principles of equality, the
                    whites, in their turn, should now be compelled to work for the majority. The
                    whites from the various plantations fled for security to the capital, where the
                    troops were so factious that they could scarcely obtain protection. The
                    miserable slaves in the plantations soon found this boon of freedom to be the
                    severest punishment which could have been inflicted. Cultivation became
                    neglected; provisions in consequence grew scarce; and a short period produced a
                    want of even the commonest aliments. Regulations for fixing the prices of labour
                    were in vain established, for those who could pay their labourers had fled from
                    the country. Though modifications of this decree were afterwards made, they
                    failed to restore the former abundance of provisions, and, during the whole
                    period of the war, scarcity continued to be experienced. During the agitations
                    in France, several of the leaders of the unsuccessful factions were banished to
                    this colony by the decrees of their triumphant opponents. But they were not a
                    class of men who were likely to benefit the settlement, and many of them died
                    from the effects of the climate, many from chagrin, and the few survivors who
                    returned to Europe had experienced the most severe and mortifying hardships. As
                    the military force had been neglected, the small body stationed at Cayenne very
                    readily submitted to the Portuguese armament. "When it was restored to the king
                    of France, the number of white inhabitants did not exceed 1300, whilst the black
                    and mixed races, including those of Indian origin, amounted together to between
                    10,000 and 11,000. Many negroes have since been introduced, both from Africa and
                    the other French settlements; and by the last census, 1829, the total population
                    is stated at 22,684.</p>
                <p>The climate and seasons in Cayenne are so nearly similar to those in Demerara as
                    to render any notice of them superfluous; but as the country is much less
                    cleared of underwood, and as very little draining has been practised, it is far
                    more unhealthy than any of the British or Dutch settlements on the same coast.
                    That the climate is totally unfit for European labourers was demonstrated’ in
                    1794. When the decree for giving freedom to the negroes was promulgated, the
                    soldiers of the regiment, of Alsace, then stationed in the province, were
                    induced, by high wages, to work in the plantations; but at the end of a month
                    one half of the regiment had died, and the remainder were so ill as to be
                    incapable of any duty.</p>
                <p>From the scanty population of Cayenne, it is evident that its productions must be
                    of inconsiderable magnitude; but the experiments which have been made
                    sufficiently show that its capabilities are equal to those of the best soils in
                    the tropical climate. The sugar-cane was, from the first, cultivated with
                    success; but the production of that plant was vastly improved by the
                    introduction of the canes of Otaheite, which the celebrated Bougainville brought
                    from the southern hemisphere; and its sugar is now equal to that of Dutch Guiana
                    or Demerara. A spirit called by the French taffia, an inferior kind of rum, is
                    distilled from the canes. The coffee of Cayenne is inferior to that of Dutch
                    Guiana; none of the plantations in it are extensive; and it is remarked that the
                    trees degenerate when planted in the lower grounds. The cocoa plant is a native
                    of Cayenne, and grows spontaneously on the borders of the Oyapock. Wild indigo
                    grows in great quantities, and the dye that has been obtained from it is equal
                    in quality to that which is extracted from the cultivated plant of the same
                    species. This induced the French government to promote the production of that
                    commodity in the soil which nature indicated to be well adapted for it. The
                    first results were in almost every instance flattering, but the plant soon
                    degenerated, and most of the indigo plantations, like those of St Domingo, were
                    converted into sugar estates, but not till the proprietors had suffered very
                    heavy losses. Cotton grows very luxuriantly, though not a native plant; or, if
                    it be, the species varies from that now cultivated, which was brought from
                    Guadaloupe when the ruinous project of colonization was attempted in 1763. This
                    plant yields two crops in the year; the second, called by the planters <hi
                    rend="italic">la petite</hi><hi rend="italic">récolte,</hi> in the month of
                    March, is frequently destroyed by a species of caterpillar which covers the
                    trees after a shower of rain. All the fruits peculiar to warm climates are most
                    abundant in Cayenne, and attempts have been repeatedly made to introduce the
                    clove and the cinnamon trees, with the other plants of the East Indies. The
                    seeds of the clove were distributed profusely by the government, which also
                    encouraged the cultivation of the bread-fruit, the mango, and the sago.</p>
                <p>The exportable article of greatest amount which Cayenne has lately furnished to
                    Europe, is the rocou, or roucou; better known in England by the name of annotta,
                    and which is extensively used as a dye, principally, however, for silks. The
                    tree which yields this substance <hi rend="italic">ÇBixa Orellana)</hi> grows
                    from twelve to fifteen feet in height, is very bushy, and bears a flower of a
                    pale pink, resembling in shape and colour the dog-rose. The fruit contains a
                    pulpy substance, intermixed with the seeds, of a very glutinous nature, which,
                    by frequent washings and filterings, is separated from them. It is then suffered
                    to ferment during eight or nine days, when it is placed in a vessel capable of
                    bearing heat, over a fire, and as soon as it forms bubbles on the surface, the
                    fire is withdrawn, and it is suffered to cool. The more gradually it cools, the
                    better the substance becomes. That which is dried in the shade is much more
                    valuable than that dried by the heat of the sun. When it is macerated in small
                    quantities, it is black and of little value; and it is only of the best quality
                    when the whole that is made at one time is a very great mass. Its purity is
                    ascertained by the whole dissolving in water, without leaving behind it any
                    extraneous substances. When in the state of a soft paste, it is moulded into,
                    the form of small cakes, and enclosed in the leaves of the <hi rend="italic"

                    The whole process of preparing this drug is most prejudicial to the health and
                    comfort of the labourers. The smell is offensive beyond the powers of
                    description; and during the preparation the workmen are afflicted with a
                    constant nausea, and most violent headach. Its offensive smell, however,
                    gradually subsides, and, by the time it reaches Europe, is changed into an
                    agreeable flavour, resembling that of the violet. On the continent of Europe
                    this commodity is extensively used in the dyeing of various kinds of clothing;
                    but in England it is almost exclusively applied as the colouring matter of
                    cheese, to which purpose it is well adapted, being nearly tasteless, and
                    perfectly harmless. The pepper to which this settlement has given a name, though
                    produced every where in the tropics, was first sent to Europe from hence. It is
                    the pod of a species of capsicum, gathered when ripe, and dried in the sun; it
                    is then, with a little flour and some salt, made into a kind, of paste, and
                    baked to a biscuit. When perfectly dry and cold, the pepper is made by rasping
                    them upon a grater. Some cassia and a small quantity of vanilla have been
                    produced here for exportation. As no wheat is grown, the dependence of the
                    inhabitants for flour rests on the United States of North America; but maize,
                    cassava, and rice, are cultivated to a sufficient extent to supply food to the
                    lower orders of the coloured inhabitants. The French seem to have exceeded other
                    nations in the success of their efforts to conciliate the aborigines; and a much
                    larger proportion of the natives have been reclaimed, and induced to labour on
                    their plantations, than in either the Dutch or English settlements on the coast
                    of Guiana. Though the soil of Guiana may be as prolific as that of Demerara or
                    Dutch Guiana, yet its future products can scarcely be so great as those
                    colonies. The coast is low, and dangerous to approach, on account of the great
                    number of shoals and sand-banks which border it; and the only good navigable
                    river on the whole line is that on which the capital is built. In the prevalence
                    of fogs, in the humidity of the atmosphere, and in the uniform high temperature
                    of the air, Cayenne is assimilated to the rest of Guiana.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The real value of the goods imported from Cayenne into France in the year 1831
                    amounted to 2,442,158 francs; and the exports from France to Cayenne to
                    1,736,792. The products of Cayenne imported into France, and entered for
                    consumption, with the duties charged on their introduction in 1831, are as
                    follow (the quantities are estimated by the kilogramme, which is equal to 2∙2
                    lbs. avoirdupois: Sugars of all kinds, 1,432,075 kilogrammes; coffee, 42,426
                    ditto; cacao, 22 ditto; cotton, 169,520 ditto; cloves and spices, 18,112 ditto;
                    annotta, 82,122 ditto; wood of all kinds, 68,729 ditto; custom duties, 851,408

                <p>That portion of Guiana which formerly belonged to Portugal has been incorporated
                    with Brazil, in the description of which country it has been included. Spanish
                    Guiana now constitutes a province of Colombia, under which head an account of it
                    will be found.</p>
