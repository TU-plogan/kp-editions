                <p><label type="entry">GUICCIARDINI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Francisco</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated Italian historian, was born at Florence in 1482, being descended of a
                    family which still subsists in that city. His ancestors had held the most
                    distinguished offices in the Florentine republic. Simon Zanuccio Guicciardini
                    was gonfalonier of justice in 1302; his grandfather, an able politician and a
                    great warrior, beat the Genoese near Sarzano in 1412, and defeated the troops of
                    Sixtus IV. in 1478; and Pietro, the father of the historian, acquired a great
                    reputation by his talents for the conduct of public affairs. Francisco
                    Guicciardini was originally intended for the bar, to which he was at length
                    called; and so great was his success that, at the age of twenty-three, he became
                    professor of jurisprudence, at a time when all the chairs in Italy were occupied
                    by the ablest jurisconsults. Although he had not yet attained the age required
                    by the law, he was appointed ambassador to Ferdinand the Catholic; and having
                    succeeded in gaining the favour of that prince, he thus secured a powerful
                    protector to the Florentine republic. Pope Leo X., a discriminating judge of
                    real merit, called Guicciardini to his court, loaded him with honours, and named
                    him governor of Modena and Reggio, at the same time conferring on him unlimited
                    powers. In this capacity he also served under the pontificate of Adrian VI.; nor
                    did his firmness, his beneficence, and his equity, fail to secure him the
                    attachment of the people over whom he had been placed. But as Romagna was
                    dreadfully distracted by the irreconcilable factions of the Guelphs and
                    Ghibelins, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193639433" xml:id="kp-eb0711-9433-0026"
                    />Clement VII. on succeeding to Adrian VI. sent thither Guicciardini, who in a
                    little time re-established tranquillity in that unhappy country, caused the most
                    rigid justice to be enforced, founded useful establishments, opened new roads,
                    and ultimately rendered himself the idol of all parties. Being afterwards
                    appointed lieutenant-general to the Holy See, he acquired much glory by his
                    defence of Parma, when besieged by the French; and after the death of John of
                    Medicis, the Florentine republic chose him to succeed that famous captain in the
                    command of the black bands, the <hi rend="italic">elite</hi> of the Italian
                    troops. But, as Clement VII. required a man of tried ability and courage, he
                    obtained the consent of the Florentines to retain Guicciardini some time longer
                    in his service. The city of Bologna was about to escape from the domination of
                    Rome; the senate had raised the standard of revolt; the great family of the
                    Pepoli openly aspired to the supreme power; the vindictive passions were
                    indulged without restraint, and assassinations multiplied. Guicciardini, in the
                    capacity of governor, presented himself in this city, whither his renown had
                    preceded him. His severe deportment, his activity, his eloquence, tranquillised
                    the people, disarmed the senate, and deprived the Pepoli of all hope of
                    obtaining the object they had in view. By his talents, prudence, firmness, and
                    justice, Bologna, which would otherwise have been lost for ever, was saved to
                    the patrimony of St Peter. After this expedition, Guicciardini, notwithstanding
                    the entreaties of Clement, returned to his own country, where he lived in
                    retirement, being wholly occupied with the composition of his history, which he
                    commenced about the end of 1534. But this did not prevent him from rendering the
                    most important services to Florence. His counsels moderated the prodigality and
                    ambition of Alexander of Medicis; and, at the suggestion of Naples, he effected
                    an advantageous arrangement between this pι <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> ince
                    and Charles V. Alexander having been assassinated in 1536 by one of his near
                    relatives, Lorenzino de’ Medicis, Cardinal Cibo immediately assembled the
                    council, when it appeared that all the other members were inclined for a
                    republican government. But Guiceiardini perceiving that by this means the
                    country would become a prey to civil war, declared in favour of a monarchical
                    government; and as his persuasive eloquence at length overcame the predilections
                    of the council, Cosmo de’ Medicis was proclaimed sovereign of Florence. From
                    this moment, Guicciardini took no further concern in public affairs; and after
                    having passed four years in study and retirement, he died in May 1540.</p>
                <p>The memory of this able and excellent person is endeared to men of letters by his
                    <hi rend="italic">History of Italy,</hi> Florence, 1561, in folio, or two vols.
                    in 8vo. The original edition, though much sought after, is incomplete; that of
                    Venice, 1567, in 4to, is augmented by four books, viz. from seventeen to twenty
                    inclusive; and that of Venice, 1738, in two vols. folio, has, besides, a life of
                    the author by Manni, with a fragment containing some passages previously
                    inedited. But the best and most complete edition is that of Friburg in Brisgau
                    (Florence), 1775, 1776, in four vols. 4to, printed from an autograph manuscript
                    in the Maglia-beechi library, under the auspices and care of the canon Bonso Pio
                    Bonsi, who has supplied the defects of former editions, and otherwise discharged
                    his editorial duties with fidelity and talent. The <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Italy</hi> commences in 1490, and terminates in the month of October 1534. It
                    consists of twenty books, sixteen of which are, in the opinion of the best
                    critics, of superior merit; but the last four are little more than draughts of
                    memoirs, death having prevented the author from bestowing on them all the care
                    and attention which the subject required. The historian commences by giving an
                    exposition of the tranquil condition of Italy before the breaking out of the
                    troubles which desolated its finest provinces. He then proceeds to describe the
                    bloody wars which the French carried on in that country, under three successive
                    kings. By these the face of Italy was almost entirely changed; the popes
                    aggrandised themselves by the ruin of several petty states; Naples and Milan,
                    torn from their respective princes, recognised the domination of Charles V.; and
                    Genoa, which had thrown itself into the arms of France, recovered its liberty
                    under the protection of the same monarch, who, on the other hand, gave a
                    sovereign to the republic of Florence. If, in this revolution, the greater part
                    of the princes of Italy maintained themselves, they owed their preservation to
                    their own weakness, and a timely submission to a conqueror, whom fortune seemed
                    to lead on, by rapid strides, towards universal monarchy. Sueh, in a few words,
                    is the grand spectacle presented by the <hi rend="italic">History of the Wars in
                    Italy,</hi> a production which has immortalised the name of Guicciardini. The
                    hatred of vice, which breaks out in every page of his work, satisfies the reader
                    as to the probity of' the historian, who was, moreover, concerned in most of the
                    events which he relates, and performed a brilliant part both in the cabinet and
                    in the field. His style, sometimes nervous and sublime, sometimes lively and
                    rapid, always noble, perspicuous, and appropriate to the subject, fixes the
                    attention and hurries along the mind of the reader. His reflections, equally
                    judicious and profound, show the wise republican, the able politician, the
                    enlightened philosopher; as the friend of humanity and justice, he unsparingly
                    attacks the abuses of the sovereign power, and vindicates that virtue which the
                    great so often profane for the gratification of their interests and passions. He
                    has left us faithful portraits of the celebrated men of his time; he has
                    represented with equal genius and accuracy the force and manners of the nations
                    which figure in his history; and he has made us acquainted with the real
                    interests of the princes of his time, as well as with the origin of those
                    jealousies which then divided the powers of Europe. Guicciardini has been
                    reproached with the length of the harangues which he puts into the mouths of his
                    characters; but these he has enriched with so much eloquence, with thoughts so
                    new and profound, with images so just and striking, that they are always
                    interesting, and never felt as impeding the progress of his narrative. He has
                    also been accused of prejudice against the French; yet he never exaggerates
                    their losses in battle, and Father Daniel, in his history, has merely copied the
                    narrative of Guiceiardini. If the latter, like several French authors, has
                    traced an unfavourable portrait of Charles VI1I., he has, on the other hand,
                    done ample justice to the equity and the virtues of Louis X1I., the valour and
                    prudence of La Tremouille, and the brilliant qualities of Gaston de Foix and
                    Francis I.; whilst, in speaking of the Italian and French militia, he always
                    declares in favour of the latter. These, and other facts of a similar
                    description, which might easily be produced or referred to, are sufficient to
                    show that the charge of partiality is groundless, and that what has been
                    mistaken for prejudice is nothing but the severity of truth. Guiceiardini is
                    also the author of <hi rend="italic">Advice and Counsel in matters of

                    where he obtained the favour of the Duke of Alba; but having reflected on this
