                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">GROTTO</label> ^ or <hi rend="smallcaps">Grotta,</hi> a large
                    deep cavern or den in a mountain or rock. The word is Italian, <hi rend="italic"
                    >grotto,</hi> formed, according to Menage, from the Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >crypta.</hi> Ducange observes, that <hi rend="italic">grotta</hi> was used in
                    the same sense in the corrupt Latin. The ancient anchorites retired into dens
                    and grottoes, to apply themselves the more attentively to meditation.</p>
                <p>Amongst the natural caverns or grottoes of England, Okey-hole, Elden-hole,
                    Peak’s-hole, and Pool’s-hole, are famous.</p>
                <p>The entrance to Okey-hole, on the south side of the Mendip Hills, is in the fall
                    of those hills, is beset all round with rocks, and has near it a precipitous
                    descent of near twelve fathoms deep, at the bottom of which there continually
                    issues from the rocks a considerable current of water. The naked rocks above the
                    entrance show themselves about thirty fathoms high, and the whole ascent of the
                    hill above is about a mile, and very steep. On entering this vault, you proceed
                    at first upon a level, but advancing farther, the way becomes rocky and uneven,
                    sometimes ascending and sometimes descending. The roof of this cavern, in the
                    highest parts, is about eight fathoms from the ground, but in many places it is
                    so low that a man must stoop to get along. The breadth is not less various than
                    the height, for in some places it is five or six fathoms wide, and in others not
                    more than one or two. It extends in length about two hundred yards. People talk
                    much of certain stones in it, resembling men and women, and other things; but
                    there is little that is curious in these, which are only shapeless lumps of
                    common spar. At the farthest part of the cavern there is a good stream of water,
                    large enough to drive a mill, which passes all along one side, and at length
                    glides down about six or eight fathoms amongst the rocks, and then pressing
                    through their clefts, discharges itself into the valley. The river within the
                    cavern is well stored with eels, and has in it some trouts; which can scarcely
                    have come from without, as there is a considerable fall near the entrance. In
                    dry summers, a great number of frogs are seen all along this cavern, even to the
                    farthest part of it; and on the roof of it, at certain places, hang vast numbers
                    of bats. The cattle that feed in the pastures through which this river runs have
                    been known to die suddenly sometimes after a flood; which is probably owing to
                    the waters having been impregnated, either naturally or accidentally, with lead
                    ore.</p>
                <p>Elden-hole is a huge profound perpendicular chasm, three miles from Buxton, and
                    ranked amongst the natural wonders of the Peak. Its depth is unknown. Cotton
                    tells us he sounded 884 yards, yet the plummet still drew. But he might easily
                    be deceived, unless his plummet was very heavy; for the weight of a rope of that
                    length might render the landing of the plummet scarcely perceptible.</p>
                <p>Peak’s-hole and Pool’s-hole are two very remarkable horizontal caverns under
                    mountains; the one situated near Castleton, and the other close by Buxton. They
                    seem to have owed their origin to the springs which flow through them; for when
                    the water had forced its way through the horizontal fissures of the strata, and
                    had carried the loose earth away with it, the loose stones would of course fall
                    down; but where the strata had few or no fissures, they remained entire, and
                    thus formed those very irregular arches, which are now so much admired for their
                    grotesque appearance. The water which passes through Pool’s-hole is impregnated
                    with particles of limestone, and has incrusted the whole cavern in such a manner
                    that it appears as one solid rock.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Grotto</hi><hi rend="italic">del Cam,</hi> a little
                    cavern near Pozzuoli, four leagues from Naples, the air of which is of a
                    mephitical or noxious quality; whence it is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >l&gt;occa</hi><hi rend="italic">venenosa,</hi> the poisonous mouth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Grotto</hi><hi rend="italic">del Serpi,</hi> is a
                    subterranean cavern near the village of Sassa, eight miles from the city of
                    Braccano in Italy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Milky</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Grotto,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Crypta Lactea,</hi> a mile distant from the ancient village of
                    Bethlehem, is said to have been thus denominated on occasion of the blessed
                    Virgin letting fall some drops of milk whilst suckling Jesus in this grotto; and
                    hence it has been commonly supposed that the earth of this cavern has the virtue
                    of restoring milk to women who have grown dry, and even of curing fevers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Grotto</hi> is also used to signify a little artificial
                    edifice made in a garden, in imitation of a natural grotto. The exterior of
                    these grottoes is usually adorned with rustic architecture, and the interior
                    with shell-work, fossils, and the like, finished likewise with jets d’eau or
                    fountains.</p>
