                    in Latin <hi rend="italic">Janus Gτu-terus,</hi> a celebrated philologist and
                    antiquary, was born at Antwerp on the 3d of December 1560. His father was
                    burgomaster of that city, but having been banished on account of religion, he
                    retired into England with his wife, who was a native of that country. This lady,
                    whose name was Catherine Tishem, had received an excellent education and made
                    considerable progress in learning; she spoke several of the living languages,
                    understood the Latin, and was so well acquainted with the Greek as to be able to
                    read Galen in the original. “There is perhaps not one physician in a thousand,”
                    says a panegyrist of Gruter, “who could do as much.” The English wife of the
                    Antwerp burgomaster was the first instructor of her son. Gruter continued the
                    studies in which he had thus been initiated, at the university of Cambridge; and
                    at the age of nineteen he quitted England, and proceeded to Leyden, where he
                    studied civil law, and took the degree of doctor in that faculty. In a short
                    time he began to make himself known by his poetical essays; and as works of a
                    more solid kind soon extended his reputation, he became successively attached to
                    different universities. In the capacity of professor, he taught at Rostock, at
                    Wittemberg, and at Heidelberg, in which last city he fixed his residence, and
                    had the charge of the palatine library, the manuscripts of which, transported to
                    Rome in the year 1622, had recently been restored to their original locality.
                    Gruter was called to France and to Denmark, but declined the invitations in both
                    instances. The university of Padua also made him advantageous offers; but as it
                    would have been necessary, in the event of accepting these, to renounce the
                    public exercise of the Protestant religion, he preferred remaining in Germany.
                    This circumstance proves that he has been unjustly accused of irréligion, and
                    that Pareus, who reproached him with being an atheist, and attaching more
                    importance to a single thought of Petronius or Apuleius than to all the precepts
                    of Jesus Christ, has published a calumny. Bayle cites another proof of the
                    religious sentiments of Gruter. “This pretended atheist,” says he, “replied to
                    those who proposed the alternative, <hi rend="superscript"> ζ</hi> You must
                    either leave your country or change your religion I prefer the former to the
                    latter; if I cannot pass my days in a town, I will pass them in the fields or
                    the woods; God will there supply me with some herbs or roots which will support
                    the little of life that remains to me.” For this Bayle refers the reader to the
                    panegyric of Gruter by Venator. But he is mistaken. It is not to Gruter, but to
                    Sched, his old and faithful servant, that Venator attributes this answer. Gruter
                    was very laborious, and exceedingly anxious to be productive; nor are there many
                    learned men to whom Roman literature owes so many obligations. We shall take a
                    short survey of his works. His essays in Latin poetry, which have already been
                    mentioned, appeared in 1587, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Pericula.</hi>
                    In the verses of Gruter there is more science than energy. His Elegies are
                    rugged and dissonant, from the affectation of employing polysyllabic words in
                    the end of his pentameters. This is an imitation of the manner of the Greeks,
                    and of that of Propertius, particularly in his first book; but it is not
                    executed with sufficient taste, or a due regard to the measure. He next
                    published, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Suspiciones,</hi> conjectures on
                    the Latin authors, in nine books, which he wished to extend to thirty; but he
                    had not time to execute his design, in which, however, he appears to have made
                    considerable progress. Burmann the second, whose library was so rich in works of
                    criticism, po⅛essed a large <pb break="no" facs="nls:193639238"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-9238-0011"/>portion of this inedited supplement. In 1594
                    Gruter published a commentary on Seneca the philosopher, in which,
                    notwithstanding the saucy remark of Scaliger <hi rend="italic">(labeur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d’escolier</hi><hi rend="italic">ou d’imprimeur'),</hi> he gave
                    proofs of great accuracy. Seneca the tragic poet, Titus Livius, Tacitus,
                    Martial, and Florus, of which author he published two editions; Statius, on
                    which he left inedited notes, cited by Taubmann <hi rend="italic">(ad</hi>
                    Plaut. <hi rend="italic">Amph.</hi> 1. i. p. 83); Plautus, which was the
                    occasion of a long and indecent quarrel between him and Pareus; Paterculus,
                    Pliny the younger, the Panegyrists, the writers of the Augustin History, Cicero,
                    and Publius Syrus, successively occupied his attention. In the edition of this
                    last author, published by Havercamp and Preyger, may be found a posthumous
                    commentary of Gruter, in which the text of Publius Syrus disappears amidst an
                    enormous assemblage of parallel passages. Gruter collected, under the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">Beliciae</hi><hi rend="italic">Poetarum Italorum, Gallorum,
                    Belgicoum,</hi> the best Latin poems of the Italians, the French, the Flemings,
                    and the Dutch, and, in the title-page of this collection, assumed the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Ranutius Gherus,</hi> which is the anagram of <hi
                    rend="italic">Janus Gruterus.</hi> When he published the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Deliciae</hi><hi rend="italic">Poetarum Germanorum,</hi> a collection of the
                    same kind as the preceding, he concealed himself under the initials A. F. G. G.,
                    which, read backwards, signify <hi rend="italic">Gruterus Gualthen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">filius,</hi><hi rend="italic">Antuer-pianus.</hi> Lamonnoie on
                    Baillet (tome iv. p. 184) has given a list of all the poets contained in the
                    fifteen volumes to which these collections extend. The <hi rend="italic">Lampas
                    sive</hi><hi rend="italic">Fax</hi><hi rend="italic">Artium Liberalium,</hi> is
                    another compilation, in six large volumes, wherein Gruter has collected a great
                    number of commentators and critics, who had become rare in his time, or whose
                    works had not been printed. A table of their names may be found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibliographia</hi><hi rend="italic">Antiquaria</hi> of Fabricius
                    (c. 3, sect. 7). In 1737 Palesi commenced a new edition of this collection, but
                    he died before it was completed, and only four volumes appeared. To the six
                    volumes of the original edition, Frankfort, 1603-1612, a seventh was. after the
                    death of Gruter, added by Pareus in 1634, containing remarks on Plautus, in
                    which Gruter, who had concealed his name under that of Pflug, in order to attack
                    Pareus, is, by way of reprisal, outrageously insulted. In publishing his <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronico</hi><hi rend="italic">Chronicoum</hi> he assumed the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">Johannes Gualterius</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but this
                    was a more honourable disguise; for the name he assumed was that of his father,
                    which he no doubt hoped to immortalise by means of that useful and excellent
                    work. We are also indebted to Gruter for other vast compilations, particularly a
                    continuation of the <hi rend="italic">Polyanthea</hi> of Langius; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibliotheca Eχulum,</hi> Strasburg, 1624, in 12mo; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Corpus</hi><hi rend="italic">Inscriptionum,</hi> Heidelberg, 1601,
                    in folio. This last work is one of great importance, and of itself would be
                    sufficient to sustain the literary reputation of Gruter. It is an immense
                    collection of Greek and Latin inscriptions, which had been begun by Smetius, and
                    which he considerably augmented, subjoining the <hi rend="italic">Notoe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Romanorum veterum Tullii Tironis</hi><hi rend="italic">et Annaei
                    Senecae;</hi> but the only edition now consulted is that of Graevius, 1707, in
                    four volumes folio. The Emperor Rodolph II., to whom Gruter had dedicated his
                    Inscriptions, wished to grant him, as a proof of his imperial satisfaction, the
                    privilege of publishing all his books, and the title of count palatine; but his
                    majesty died before having signed the “acts,” as they are called; and Gruter,
                    who had all the modesty of true learning, not choosing to bring his claims under
                    the notice of the new emperor, lost without regret the favours which he had so
                    well merited. The war which ravaged the palatinate disturbed .his last years,
                    and probably accelerated his end. His books were pillaged, and the palatine
                    library, where he might have consoled himself for the loss of his own, was
                    despoiled of its numerous manuscripts. Exiled, persecuted, and wandering from
                    town to town,</p>
                <p>Gruter died on the 20th of September 1627, at the moment when the university of
                    Groningen had offered him the chair of history and of Greek. <hi
