                <p><label type="entry">GYMNASTICS</label>, in the general acceptation of the term,
                    denotes every exercise which tends to develope and invigorate the bodily powers;
                    such as walking, running, riding, fencing, rowing, skating, dancing, and many
                    others. In a narrower sense gymnastics includes those manly and healthful games,
                    which have been encouraged by all high-minded nations, as calculated to improve
                    the physical strength, and to keep alive the martial spirit, of their
                    inhabitants. In a yet more limited sense, the term gymnastics has been employed
                    to denote that modern system of bodily exercises, some account of which will be
                    given in the sequel of this article.</p>
                <p>• In the rudest states of society, such as that which obtains amongst the
                    aboriginal tribes of America, the necessity of repelling the aggressions and
                    punishing the insults of hostile tribes naturally leads to the cultivation of
                    those physical powers the development of which is essential to the purposes of
                    self-defence. Hence, even in this stage, we discover the elements of a gymnastic
                    education. Want and invention, in the history of mankind, stand to each other in
                    the relation of parent and offspring. Under the operation of the law of
                    necessity, we find parents anxious to nerve their children for the labours which
                    in after-life must procure them sustenance, and to habituate them to the
                    watchfulness and agility which alone can enable them to baffle their foes. From
                    infancy the latter are accordingly trained, by progressive steps, to the
                    practice of archery; instructed to swim across the most rapid rivers; and
                    habituated not only to remain for a considerable time beneath the surface of the
                    water, but also to make their way to its lowest depths. Running over the
                    roughest ways, hurling missiles from the hand, and wielding clubs or hatchets
                    with effective force, are amongst the number of their accomplishments; and not
                    the least remarkable part of their training is that by which they are taught to
                    acquire a mastery over physical pain. Under this rigid system of discipline,
                    enforced· by the elders of die tribe, the savage has been found to acquire
                    qualities which the milder institutions of civilised life are not calculated to
                    unfold; the physical powers are developed with a symmetry and beauty which
                    remind the beholder of the finer forms of ancient sculpture; and the individual,
                    conscious of his strength, firmness, and resources in the midst of danger, walks
                    with a more independent tread, and indulges in the cheerfulness natural to a
                    fearless disposition.</p>
                <p>The Greeks, in the earliest period of their history, seem to have been little, if
                    at all, advanced beyond the state which we have here endeavoured to describe. It
                    appears from several passages in Homer, particularlyfrom the account given in
                    the twenty-third book of the Iliad, of the games celebrated at the obsequies of
                    Patroclus, that gymnastic exercises were not unknown at the time of the Trojan
                    war. From this description, which is the earliest monument extant on the
                    subject, we learn that, on the occasion referred to, there were Chariot-races,
                    foot-races, boxing, wrestling, gladiatorial combats, throwing the discus,
                    shooting with the bow, and hurling the javelin. At the period in question,
                    however, these exercises were no doubt equally rude and inartificial with those
                    of the Indian tribes to which we have alluded; but, in progress of time, when
                    their importance began to be fully perceived, areas and edifices were allotted
                    for their practice, masters were appointed to instruct the youth, and prizes,
                    contended for in the presence of assembled nations, were awarded to the victors
                    in the different contests, with all the pomp and solemnity of a religious
                    celebration. The exercises of the Greek athletae, namely, running, wrestling,
                    boxing, throwing the discus and the javelin, equitation, and charioteering, are
                    known to every classical scholar, and need not therefore be particularly
                    described. These were instituted originally with the view, no doubt, of
                    preparing the citizens, by a systematic course of training, for undergoing the
                    toils and fatigues of war. But, by degrees, the natural vanity of excelling in
                    that which all more or less cultivated, fostered by the preposterous adulation
                    bestowed on the victors in the Olympic games, introduced the habit of
                    cultivating one exercise alone, instead of seeking to develope equally all the
                    bodily powers. A good wrestler, an expert boxer, or one capable of carrying an
                    immense weight, became in some degree an article of luxury, or a subject of
                    speculation. Persons of this description were kept and fed like game-cocks, and
                    destined for purposes of equal dignity and importance. The object originally
                    contemplated by the patrons of the athletic exercises was completely lost sight
                    of; the real soldier learned to despise the bully of the gymnasium and the
                    palaestra; gymnastics lost repute by being at once perverted and degraded; and
                    the sarcastic remark of the great Theban commander decided their fate.</p>
                <p>Rome was from the first a species of camp, and war the principal occupation of
                    her people. The youth were trained to hardihood and exertion, but it was chiefly
                    in actual service, and as members of a great body, which moved as if animated by
                    only one soul. To act in concert and unison, to afford mutual support, to give
                    simultaneous impetus to the charge, to preserve order in retreat, and in all
                    circumstances to observe the law of a stern discipline; such was the great
                    object of their study. Their exercises were intended not so much to train the
                    individual as to form the mass; not to encourage isolated efforts, but to
                    produce unity and mobility. But when, in process of time, the military became a
                    distinct profession; when the army was composed of praetorian bands, and
                    legionary soldiers drawn from the conquered countries; Rome, having no efficient
                    academy for training her citizens to active exercises, began to decline. The
                    ancient discipline gradually relaxed; and her sons, instead of breasting the
                    Tiber in armour, or riding and hurling the javelin in the Campus Martius, sought
                    the cruel and debasing amusement of witnessing the massacre of slaves, or the
                    combats with wild beasts in the amphitheatre.</p>
                <p>Of the gymnastic exercises practised by the Teutonic nations who overthrew the
                    Roman empire no satisfactory account has reached us. But some of the later
                    historians of Rome speak with consternation of the manner in which the Germans,
                    by the aid of their <hi rend="italic">frameoe,</hi> bounded over the pikes of
                    the foremost ranks, or sprung upon the hostile battlements; and Tacitus alludes
                    to certain games in which the German youth, naked and unarmed, danced amidst
                    pointed spears and drawn swords, displaying wonderful quickness of eye,
                    elasticity of limb, and fearlessness of disposition. During the middle ages, the
                    peculiar mode of warfare introduced by the northern nations rendered it of the
                    utmost importance that the knights and men-at-arms should be subjected to a
                    system of severe physical training. Hence they were taught to sustain during the
                    heat of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193640330" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0330-0095"
                    />day a heavy load of armour, to carry huge burdens, to run for a length of
                    time, to climb tall ladders by the aid of their arms alone, to swim, to ride the
                    great horse, and to run with a spear against a target so arranged that he who
                    missed or struck foul received in return a blow from a pole attached to it.</p>
                <p>But when the organization and movement of armies had been reduced to system, when
                    the art of war became a subject of arithmetical calculation, and when the
                    invention of powder rendered bodily superiority in a great measure unavailing,
                    athletic exercises were less insisted on than formerly; and the cvil was
                    increased, partly by the separation of the military as a distinct class, and
                    partly also by the increasing sedentary habits of civilians. In short, physical
                    education was neglected in proportion as every other branch became more widely
                    diffused and more zealously cultivated; without considering the intimate
                    connection between the body and the mind, the former was suffered to degenerate,
                    whilst indolent and luxurious habits engendered nervous irritability, with a
                    consequent predisposition to mental disorders. Rousseau, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Emile,</hi> was the first to raise his voice against this
                    degeneracy; and although the world laughed at the ludicrous contradiction
                    between his practice and his precepts, yet the latter insensibly prevailed, and
                    in time a more rational regard began to be paid to the preservation of a firm
                    and robust habit of body. In all countries the manly amusements of an earlier
                    age had in some degree survived amongst the peasantry; in some, the pleasures of
                    the chase had stimulated even the higher classes to cultivate habits of
                    hardihood and exertion. By degrees, athletic exercises became once more
                    fashionable; and then was invented that system of gymnastics which is now taught
                    in the military and other schools.</p>
                <p>This system derives its immediate origin from the widely-ramified confederacy
                    which diffused throughout Germany a spirit of disaffection to the French, and
                    prepared the people of that country to co-operate in shaking off the yoke which
                    had been imposed on them. Convinced from the first that the deliverance of
                    Germany could only be effected by the sword, the leaders of this confederacy
                    directed their attention to the grand object of secretly training and preparing
                    soldiers for the approaching struggle. With this view, whilst Von Stein was
                    communicating to almost every individual in the Prussian territories some notion
                    of military discipline, and labouring to impress them with a notion of its
                    importance, Jahn and his followers were establishing gymnastic areas <hi
                    rend="italic">(turn-platze)</hi> throughout the whole of Germany. The youth of
                    different ages were encouraged and incited to attend. They were taught to take
                    pleasure in their exercises; a spirit of emulation was sedulously cherished;
                    peals of laughter and merriment resounded in each area; and national songs, sung
                    in chorus by the friendly antagonists as they repaired to or returned from the
                    <hi rend="italic">turn-platze,</hi> served at once to excite and sustain the
                    general enthusiasm. In addition to the usual routine of running, wrestling, and
                    leaping, a series of exercises with poles, bars, ropes, and ladders, was devised
                    and introduced into the <hi rend="italic">turn-platze.</hi> In these areas, the
                    youths were prepared for the toils and labours of the field; and, when the grand
                    crisis arrived, the means were found adequate to the end contemplated. For some
                    time after the overthrow of Napoleon, these exercises continued to be patronised
                    by the governments of Germany, and taught in all the public schools. But the
                    spirit which it had been found so easy to raise against the dominion of
                    Napoleon, and in support of the old hereditary governments, did not so readily
                    vanish when its immediate task was accomplished. In adversity and in danger
                    promises had been made, the performance of which was evaded in the hour of
                    triumph; and, as some of the chief patrons of physical education were amongst
                    the loudest in denouncing the faithlessness of their governments, the</p>
                <p>German rulers gravely alleged that gymnastic exercises necessarily engendered
                    democratical principles; and on this ingenious pretence all the public
                    institutions for their promotion were at once suppressed. A few private
                    establishments are still winked at, and, in some states, the military receive
                    regular instructions; but the day of gymnastics is for the present over in
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>In other countries, however, the political logicians have not yet discerned any
                    necessary connection between gymnastics and republicanism; and accordingly those
                    exercises which have been anathematised in Germany as generative of democracy,
                    have been warmly patronized in France and Switzerland, and are now steadily
                    making their way even in Britain, where innovations of all kinds, especially in
                    education, arc most cautiously entertained. The propriety of employing training
                    to develope the powers of the body is beginning in many parts to be as readily
                    acknowledged, as the necessity of education to cultivate the faculties of the
                    mind. But nothing is privileged from abuse; and empiricism, which has brought so
                    many other things into disrepute, has unluckily fastened upon gymnastics. In the
                    <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie</hi><hi rend="italic">Moderne</hi> we find the
                    subject divided into, 1. <hi rend="italic">Gymnastique</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >civile</hi><hi rend="italic">et industrielle;</hi> 2. <hi rend="italic"

                    ou</hi><hi rend="italic">funambulique.</hi> Nor is this all. Each of these
                    divisions is subdivided into four or five branches, as if the subject, forsooth,
                    admitted of the most systematic arrangement. Thus, under the head of <hi
                    rend="italic">Gymnastique medicale,</hi> are included, first, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gymnastique hygiénique ou prophylactique, pour conserver one santé
                    robuste;</hi> secondly, <hi rend="italic">Gymnastique thérapeutique, pour le
                    trait-mont des maladies;</hi> thirdly, <hi rend="italic">Gymnastique

                    >;</hi> fourthly, <hi rend="italic">Gymnastique orthopédique, qui a pour but la
                    guérison des</hi><hi rend="italic">deformites.</hi> This affectation of method
                    is exceedingly absurd, inasmuch as it confounds with the exercises themselves
                    certain hypothetical uses, and assumes as the very basis of the classification
                    results which have not been satisfactorily ascertained. But however this may be,
                    the importance of gymnastics, in another point of view, cannot possibly be
                    disputed. If persevered in, they are calculated to devclope cvery muscle of the
                    trunk, arms, and legs to its utmost extent; they give the student the most
                    perfect command of his whole bodily frame; they are the best preparatives for
                    the elegant and manly accomplishment of fencing, whether with the small or the
                    broad sword; and they afford excellent training for the amateurs of running,
                    leaping, wrestling, and sparring. Nor are the advantages derived from such
                    exercises confined to the soldier or the sailor; their usefulness is experienced
                    in many other situations of life. But their importance can only be fully known
                    when we arc called upon in emergencies of unexpected danger; amidst fire,
                    shipwreck, the destruction of bridges, or the fall of buildings; to evince the
                    superiority resulting from that presence of mind, and fertility of resources,
                    which are conferred by the consciousness of physical strength and nerve, and by
                    the habit of acting and moving where other men would be instantly paralysed.
                    Lastly, clear heads and light hearts, the natural concomitants of health, are
                    the unfailing rewards of a judicious and moderate prosecution of gymnastics.</p>
                <p>The elementary exercises in gymnastics are performed by means of the horizontal
                    pole, the parallel bars, the masts or poles, the ropes, the triangle and
                    trapezium, the ladder, the wooden horse, the inclined plane, and the flying
                    course or giant’s steps. The pupils, after being prepared by a course of
                    comparatively gentle but active exertion, proceed to take lessons on the <hi

                    which is to develope the strength of the hands and arms, though many other
                    exercises are performed on it. The <hi rend="italic">parallel bars</hi> are
                    usually made circular, and vary from six to eight feet in length, and from three
                    to four inches in diameter<pb break="no" facs="nls:193640343"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-0343-0096"/>; they are fixed about two feet apart, and placed
                    at a height of from three to four feet from the ground. Captain Clias gives
                    sixteen movements in this apparatus, and Colonel Amoros thirty-eight; but it is
                    obvious that the lessons are susceptible of great variety, and that the interest
                    may be increased by fixing the bars occasionally at the height of six or seven
                    feet from the ground. The exercises on the <hi rend="italic">masts</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">poles</hi> are varied by the latter being placed in different
                    positions, either vertically or angularly, and by the introduction of
                    rope-ladders or knotted ropes. The <hi rend="italic">ropes</hi> are used
                    sometimes plain, sometimes with large knots in them, and sometimes with a bar
                    across. They are placed vertically, horizontally, and angularly, to give variety
                    to the exercises, which is also increased by loosening and tightening them. The
                    <hi rend="italic">triangle</hi> and <hi rend="italic">trapezium</hi> are two of
                    the most amusing instruments in modern gymnasiums, and, from the lightness of
                    their construction, and their being constantly in motion, give an appearance of
                    ease and grace to all the revolutions performed on them. The invention of the
                    triangle has been claimed by Captain Clias, though of right it belongs to the
                    mountebanks of Italy, who employed it to amuse the public long before this
                    celebrated gymnast was heard of; the trapezium owes its origin, or at least its
                    introduction into the schools, to Colonel Amoros. The <hi rend="italic">wooden
                    ladder</hi> is usually fixed firmly between two walls, with the lower end just
                    high enough for the pupils to reach it with both hands. Sometimes it is also
                    placed perpendicularly with one end resting on the ground; but the exercises
                    admit of more variety when it is placed in the position first described. The
                    distance between the bars in the perpendicular ladder is commonly from eight to
                    twelve inches; but when its position is inclined the spaces should always be
                    wide enough to admit of the pupil passing easily through them. The <hi
                    rend="italic">rope ladder</hi> is susceptible of still greater variety of
                    position, and the bars are usually placed closer together, as few movements
                    beyond the different modes of ascending and descending are practised upon them.
                    The <hi rend="italic">wooden horse,</hi> although extremely interesting from the
                    number of exercises practised on it, both in vaulting and leaping, and in feats
                    of actual strength, appears as yet to be but little known in the small
                    gymnasiums of this country. It is necessary that there should be a graduated
                    succession of seizes, to suit the height and progress of the different classes.
                    The <hi rend="italic">inclined plane</hi> is ordinarily an unpolished board of
                    pine, varying from twenty-five to thirty feet in length, and about two feet in
                    breadth; it admits of some highly useful exercises, and has been recommended by
                    medical men as tending to strengthen the hands, arms, chest, abdomen, legs, and
                    feet. The same observation applies to the inclined pole. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >flying course,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gianis steps,</hi> is amusing to young
                    people; but it affords no advantages which are not fully attained by the
                    apparatus already described. For the detail of the exercises performed, with
                    figures illustrative of the different positions, we refer to the works of Clias,
                    Amoros, and Roland.</p>
                <p>Almost all the advantages which are generally supposed to result from gymnastic
                    exercises, may be attained by the practice of our own national games, which, if
                    not in every case British in their origin, are peculiarly so by their adoption
                    and continued improvement. They merit notice, therefore, first, by reason of
                    their nationality, and because, for the most part, they require in an eminent
                    degree the union of strength, perseverance, and courage. 1st, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wrestling,</hi> though conspicuously introduced into all foreign works on the
                    present system of gymnastics, is little more than theoretically known on the
                    Continent; whereas, in some of the English counties, the practical wrestlers are
                    unrivalled. We therefore claim this as one of our national games, and venture to
                    affirm that its champions will not hesitate to enter into competition with any
                    foreign gymnasium. 2d, <hi rend="italic">Boxing</hi> is an exercise which brings
                    the body into active and healthy exertion, increasing the elasticity of the
                    limbs, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> improving the play of the lungs, and
                    giving a firmness on the legs and a power in the arms not otherwise attainable.
                    Quickness of eye, and accuracy in measuring distances, are also acquired by the
                    practice of boxing; by which, be it observed, we mean <hi rend="italic"
                    >sparring,</hi> as practised by gentlemen, that graceful imitation battle, which
                    differs as widely from the brutalising exhibitions of prize-fighting, as the <hi
                    rend="italic">cestus</hi> with which Dares dashed out the teeth of Entellus
                    differs from the well-stuffed gloves of Mr Roland. 3d, <hi rend="italic">Piding,
                    walking,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">running,</hi> are exercises requiring
                    strength, perseverance, and activity; and, as a nation, our recorded equestrian
                    and pedestrian feats may challenge Europe. We have, indeed, heard of three
                    Frenchmen, Gervois, Labat, and Stumon, who are said to have run a French league
                    in ten minutes, an exploit which surpasses any thing in our sporting annals; but
                    the story is too improbable to be admitted without strong confirmation. 4th, <hi
                    rend="italic">Archery,</hi> one of our most ancient and manly recreations, is
                    still kept up in many parts of England and Scotland; and although its champions
                    would no doubt cut but a sorry figure in competition with the Lockesley of
                    Ivanhoe, or even with him whose grandsire “drew a good bow at Hastings,” yet the
                    spirit of emulation has produced no mean degree of excellence in this graceful
                    and healthy exercise. 5th, <hi rend="italic">Cricket,</hi> a noble game, is so
                    indisputably our own, that nothing need be said upon the subject, except that it
                    is yearly becoming a greater favourite in Scotland, where formerly it was seldom
                    played. 6th, <hi rend="italic">Singlestick</hi> has now but a small number of
                    admirers, and its professors are of course still more limited; in fact, it is
                    seldom practised except from motives which few are willing to avow. 7th, <hi
                    rend="italic">Putting the stone</hi> and <hi rend="italic">throwing the
                    hammer</hi> fall more appropriately under the head of Scottish gymnastics. In
                    the Highlands of Scotland there are instances of celebrity in throwing the
                    hammer descending from father to son for generations, as a family
                    characteristic. This is most graphically described in the account given by Sir
                    Walter Scott, of the contest between Norman nan Ord and Hal o’ Wynd, who is
                    represented as a perfect prince amongst the gymnasts of an age when such
                    accomplishments were in the highest repute. It may be added, that, at the
                    present day, the Scottish national games are kept up with great spirit, and that
                    dubs have been instituted in various parts of the country, for the purpose of
                    encouraging them, by awarding medals, and other honorary distinctions, to such
                    as excel in these pastimes. (See Roland’s <hi rend="italic">Gymnastics,</hi>
