                    Bernard</hi></label>, a celebrated chemist, known also as an advocate of
                    eminence, and less advantageously, in his political character, as a regicide,
                    was the son of Antony Guyton de Morveau and Margaret de Saulle his wife, and
                    born at Dijon, on the 4th of January 1737.</p>
                <p>His father was of a respectable family, and filled the situation. of professor of
                    the civil law in the university of Dijon. He was fond of building; and, from the
                    artificers who were frequently employed about his house, young Guyton appears to
                    have derived, almost in his infancy, a taste for mechanical pursuits, which led
                    to an astonishing development of premature talent. For when he was only seven
                    years old, he prevailed on his father to purchase, for his amusement, a clock
                    which was greatly out of repair, and, as is said, he actually put it together
                    and remedied its defects, without any assistance, so effectually, that it
                    continued to go extremely well for fifty or sixty years afterwards. The next
                    year he was equally successful in cleaning and repairing a watch belonging to
                    his mother. But, notwithstanding these remarkable exertions of ingenuity, it
                    does not appear that they depended on any particular bent of the genius to the
                    cultivation of the mechanical arts; at least no such bias was ever exhibited in
                    any of his subsequent pursuits. His education was conducted in the ordinary
                    manner at a provincial school or college, which he left at sixteen. Upon his
                    return home he applied, for a short time, to botany, and he was soon afterwards
                    admitted as a student of law in the university of Dijon, where he remained for
                    three years, and then removed to Paris, in order to continue his studies at the
                    bar. In 1756, he paid a visit to Voltaire at Ferney; and he seems to have
                    imbibed from this personage a taste for satirical poetry, which he soon
                    afterwards displayed, upon the occurrence of a trifling accident, in a ceremony
                    relating to a popular Jesuit of the day. Amongst his posthumous papers, he also
                    left some unfinished sketches of tragedies, which are said not to have been
                    deficient in poetical merit.</p>
                <p>At the age of twenty-four, when he made some progress <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193640265" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0265-0090"/>in the practice of his
                    profession as an advocate, his father procured for him, at the price of 40,000
                    francs, the appointment of advocate-general ôf the parliament at Dijon, so that
                    he had no farther solicitude for the acquisition of an income adequate to his
                    competent subsistence. His health was then considered as delicate; but the fears
                    which were entertained for it proved to be completely groundless.</p>
                <p>In January 1764, he was made an honorary member of the Academy of Sciences at
                    Dijon, then lately established under the patronage of the Prince of Condé. This
                    occurrence seems to have had considerable influence on the pursuits which
                    occupied his leisure hours; and he soon became by far the most distinguished
                    ornament of the academy which had paid him this compliment. His particular
                    application to chemistry arose in a great measure out of an accidental emulation
                    with Dr Chardenon, who afterwards very liberally undertook to assist him in the
                    cultivation of this branch of science. He studied the works of Macquer and of
                    Beaumé, and he was furnished by the latter with the materials necessary for the
                    establishment of a small laboratory for his own use.</p>
                <p>With regard to the more general cultivation of literature and science, he
                    displayed considerable talent in a memoir on public instruction, together with a
                    plan for a college, which he presented to the parliament of Burgundy, insisting,
                    with great force and success, in opposition to Diderot, on the importance of
                    early education in modelling the character of the human mind. About the same
                    time he also wrote a prize essay, an Encomium on Charles V. of France, surnamed
                    the Wise, which was afterwards inserted in the collection of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Discourses,</hi> published in three volumes.</p>
                <p>In July 1767, he visited Paris with a view to the advancement of his scientific
                    pursuits, and excited the admiration of the most celebrated chemists of the day,
                    by the facility which he had acquired in the manipulation of his experiments. He
                    entered, after his return, into the investigation of the great question
                    respecting the oxidation of metals, though he did not succeed in removing the
                    difficulties which then embarrassed it. In 1769, he pronounced, at the opening
                    of the parliament, an elegant oration upon morals. He was soon afterwards
                    engaged in some experiments respecting the communication of heat to different
                    substances, the results of which, though not published, were of some importance
                    to the theory of temperature. At the request of his friend Dr Durande, he
                    undertook to inquire into the nature of biliary calculi, which he found to be
                    readily soluble in ether; and it appears that a combination of ether and oil of
                    turpentine proved of advantage to several of Dr Durande’s patients, who were
                    suffering from these concretions.</p>
                <p>In the year 1773 he was employed in an interesting investigation of the mutual
                    adhesion of the surfaces of solids and fluids, a class of phenomena of which the
                    mathematical theory was never at all understood, until the publication of an
                    essay on the Cohesion of Fluids in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions,</hi> soon after the beginning of this cen- tury, in which the laws
                    of capillary action are extended to a complete analogy with all the experiments
                    of Μ. de Morvcau, as well as those of Taylor and Achard of a similar nature. He
                    succeeded, about the same time, in discovering a mode of destroying the
                    contagious vapours of pestilential diseases, by fumigation with the muriatic
                    acid gas; he afterwards found the oxymuriatic acid, or pure chlorine, still more
                    effectual; and it does not appear that the nitric acid, since proposed in
                    England, has any advantages over either of these substances.</p>
                <p>Μ. de Morveau’s anxious desire to co-operate in the promotion of chemical
                    knowledge induced him to make a new exertion in its favour, by undertaking, in
                    1776, to deliver a public and gratuitous course of lectures as a regular
                    professor of the science, authorized by the approbation and encouragement of his
                    brother magistrates at Dijon. He soon afterwards wrote some essays on the
                    peculiar characters of the carbonic acid; and he strenuously combated the
                    popular prejudice which prevailed, against the introduction of conductors, for
                    preserving buildings from lightning. He established a large manufactory of
                    nitre, which was afterwards conducted by Μ. Courtois, the father of the Μ.
                    Courtois who discovered iodine. From chemistry he naturally diverged into the
                    study of mineralogy; in 1777 he made a tour through the province of Burgundy,
                    with a view to the examination of all its productions; and he actually
                    discovered a rich lead mine, though, for want of coal, it was impossible to
                    derive much benefit from it. He also found a white variety of the emerald in the
                    same province, as well as some combinations of barita, and he invented a new
                    method of obtaining the pure barita from its sulphate.</p>
                <p>He had long been intimately acquainted with the Count de Buffon and with
                    Malesherbes, both persons distinguished by elegance of taste, the one in
                    science, the other in general literature. In 1779 and 1780 he enlarged his
                    connections among the men of letters resident at Paris; and he was induced by
                    Panckoucke, the bookseller, to undertake the chemical department of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Encyclopédie Méthodique;</hi> but it was six years before the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dictionary of Chemistry</hi> appeared; the articles relating to
                    pharmacy and metallurgy were supplied by Maret and Duhamel. In the progress of
                    this work he found himself compelled to disbelieve the existence of phlogiston
                    as a distinct principle of inflammability, though at the beginning he had
                    defended the doctrines of the old school. But he soon became one of the most
                    zealous advocates of the new theory; and he contributed very much to its general
                    introduction by the active part which he took in the arrangement of a new
                    nomenclature. His proposals were at first thought objectionable by many of the
                    members of the Academy of Sciences; but they soon became generally adopted
                    throughout Europe; and the system was without doubt of great use for a time, as
                    far as it assisted the memory and the imagination in retaining the discoveries
                    and comprehending the theories which had so much of novelty to make them
                    interesting. Among the original matter contained in the Dictionary, were some
                    researches on the nature of steel, which coincided in their results with those
                    of Monge, Vandermonde, and Berthollet, made about the same time, but published
                    somewhat earlier. The. whole volume was received in the most flattering manner
                    by all the lovers of chemistry; but it was not till 1791 that the author’s
                    ambition was gratified by the award of the Academy of Sciences, adjudging him a
                    prize of two thousand francs, which had been allotted to the most useful work
                    which should appear in the course of the year. The prize, however, he begged to
                    offer to the exigencies of the state, which were then very urgent. The
                    Dictionary was afterwards ably continued by Μ. de Fourcroy.</p>
                <p>In the mean time he condescended to appear as the translator of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Opuscula</hi> of Bergman, which he illustrated by notes. The
                    example was followed by Madame Picařdet, and by others of his friends, who were
                    zealous for the promotion of science; so that the French chemists were by these
                    means speedily made acquainted with the labours of al] their contemporaries in
                    different parts of the world. In the year 1787, Μ. de Morveau applied his
                    speculations to a practical purpose, in establishing a manufactory of sods from
                    common salt, exposed to the atmosphere, with a large proportion of lime, the
                    soda slowly efflorescing as a carbonate. It was in the same year that, having
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Collection of Pleadings,</hi> he finally
                    resigned his office at the bar, in order that the whole of his time might be
                    devoted to the pursuit of science.</p>
                <p>• His next undertaking was of a more adventurous nature<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193640278" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0278-0091"/>; for, in April 1784, he
                    ascended with the President de Virly in a balloon; and he repeated the
                    experiment in the month of June, hoping to be able to direct his aerial course
                    at pleasure. The balloon appears to have been about thirty feet in diameter;
                    and, when we consider the action of the wind upon a surface of such extent, we
                    must be aware that every attempt to oppose or modify it must have been perfectly
                    futile. He was visited soon afterwards by the ingenious and lamented Mr Tennant,
                    who went to Dijon purposely to become acquainted with him, and who had an
                    opportunity of performing some original experiments in his laboratory. He was
                    made a member of the Royal Academy of Medicine at Paris in 1786, as a compliment
                    to the merits of his labours for the preservation of the public health. He
                    received a visit, in the succeeding year, at once from Lavoisier, Berthollet,
                    and Fourcroy, together with Monge and Vandermonde; and our countryman, Dr
                    Beddoes, who was then travelling in France, had the good fortune to join this
                    interesting party, all of them deeply engaged in the discussion of the great
                    chemical questions which were then undecided. In April 1788, Μ. de Morveau was
                    placed on the list of the foreign members of the Royal Society of London; and
                    the same mark of respect was also paid him at different times by almost all the
                    scientific societies of Europe.</p>
                <p>In September 1791 he was unfortunately elected a member of the Legislative Body;
                    and having also been made solicitor-general of his department, he could no
                    longer continue the chemical lectures which he had delivered without
                    intermission for fifteen years, and he resigned his chair to Dr Chausier. It
                    must not be omitted by an impartial biographer, that, on the 16th of January
                    1793, he thought himself compelled to vote with the majority, for the death of
                    the king; and it is a poor compensation for this fatal error that, in the same
                    year, he resigned a pension of two thousand francs a year, in favour of that
                    republic to which he had already sacrificed the best feelings of humanity. He
                    afterwards became a commissary of the assembly attached to the army of the
                    Netherlands. In this capacity, besides many other instances of personal courage,
                    he is said to have rendered essential service to his countrymen, by the
                    construction of a balloon, in which he ascended, together with some of the staff
                    of General Jourdan, in order to observe the motions of the enemy during the
                    battle of Fleurus. After his return to Paris he was appointed professor of
                    chemistry in the <hi rend="italic">Ecole Polytechnique,</hi> and he was an
                    effective co-operator in the first establishment of that useful institution. In
                    1795 he was again chosen a member of the Council of Five Hundred; and he was
                    appointed by the government one of the forty-eight members of the National
                    Institute, then recently embodied. He had for some time been a correspondent,
                    but was never a member, of the Academy of Sciences. His political engagements
                    terminated in 1797, when he resolved once more to devote himself exclusively to
                    science. In 1798, he fulfilled the duties of director of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ecole Polytechnique</hi> during the absence of Monge, w ho was in Egypt, and
                    for whom he insisted that the salary should be reserved. The following year,
                    Bonaparte, then first consul, made him a general administrator of the mint. He
                    received the cross of the Legion of Honour in 1803, and obtained, two years
                    afterwards, still higher rank in the order, particularly as an acknowledgment
                    for the public benefits which had been derived from his methods of fumigation.
                    In 1811, he was elevated to the dignity of a baron of the French empire.</p>
                <p>From 1798 to 1813, he continued his labours as professor of chemistry in the
                    Polytechnic School; he then obtained leave to retire, but he survived only a few
                    years, and died of a paralytic affection, or rather of a total decay of
                    strength, the 21st of December 1815, at a period when he would shortly have had
                    to encounter the effects of a retribution, which would have been very severely
                    felt at so advanced an age. In stature he was rather below than above the middle
                    size; his conversation was animated and copious, his manners courteous and
                    obliging; he was full of anecdote, and always ready to communicate whatever
                    information he possessed. He married, late in life, Madame Picardet, the widow
                    of an academician of Dijon, whose tastes and pursuits were congenial with his
                    own, and who had distinguished herself by translating several works of science
                    and of literature from the different languages of the north of Europe. As to his
                    numerous publications, a bare catalogue of these will be amply sufficient to
                    show the extent of his researches and the variety of his pursuits. It is the
                    more necessary to do justice to his diligence and perseverance, as we cannot
