                <p><label type="entry">GUIGNES, <hi rend="smallcaps">Joseph de</hi></label>, a
                    learned orientalist, born at Pontoise on the 19th of October 1721, was, in 1736,
                    placed under the celebrated Fourmont by his cousin Μ. le Vaillant, professor in
                    the university. Being endowed with the happiest dispositions, and directed by an
                    able master, he, in a short time, acquired a knowledge of Chinese, and of the
                    different idioms of the East. When Fourmont presented to the king his Chinese
                    Grammar, in the year 1742, the young De Guignes accompanied him, and was
                    received in the most flattering manner by the monarch, who immediately conferred
                    on him a pension. On the death of his master, which took place in December 1745,
                    De Guignes succeeded him at the Royal Library in the office of
                    secretary-interpreter of the eastern languages. The Memoir on the Origin of the
                    Huns having given the learned world a foretaste of the talents and erudition of
                    De Guignes, he was admitted a member of the Royal Society of London in 1752, and
                    an associate of the Academy of Belles-Lettres the following year. About the same
                    time he was also appointed royal censor, and attached to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">des Savons.</hi> These different favours were the
                    just recompense of the important labours in which Μ. de Guignes was engaged. The
                    first two volumes of his History of the Huns appeared in 1756; and in 1757 the
                    chair of Syriac in the Royal College having become vacant by the death of Jault,
                    De Guignes was appointed to succeed him. Upon this occasion he pronounced a
                    Latin discourse, the principal object of which was to prove, what certainly
                    needed little demonstration, that the kings of France were much more friendly to
                    letters than the princes of Asia. In 1769 he became keeper of the antiquities in
                    the Louvre, and, in 1773, pensionary of the Academy of Belles-Lettres; in 1774
                    he resigned the chair of Syriac, not choosing to consent to the re-union of the
                    Royal College with the university; and, lastly, in 1785, he was named one of the
                    committee appointed by the academy for the publication of Notices of
                    Manuscripts. The Revolution did not deprive De Guignes of his pensions, for,
                    notwithstanding his great labours, he had never demanded them; but it deprived
                    him of his moderate allowance as pensionary of the academy, keeper of
                    antiquities in the Louvre, and rédacteur of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">des Savons.</hi> Faithful to his principles, and
                    to the cultivation of letters, however, he made no remonstrance, declined
                    accepting any favour, and consoled himself for the sufferings of his country,
                    and the personal privations he experienced, by applying with greater assiduity
                    to his favourite pursuits. These he continued, without intermission, until his
                    death, which took place at Paris on the 19th of March 1800. De Guignes left a
                    son, who had been consul at Canton, and who, on his return to France, published
                    a relation of his voyage in three volumes 8vo, and an excellent Chinese
                    Dictionary. The following is a list of the printed works of the father: 1.
                    Abrégé de la Vie d’Etienne Fourmont, with a notice of his works, Paris, 1747, in
                    4to; 2. Mémoire Historique sur l’Origine des Huns et des Tures, Paris, 1748, in
                    12mo; 3. Histoire Générale des Huns, des Tures, des Mogols, et des autres
                    Tartares occidentaux, avant et depuis J. C. jusqu’ à present, preceded by an
                    introduction containing historical and chronological tables of the princes who
                    have reigned in Asia, Paris, 1756, 1758, in five vols. 4to; 4. Mémoire dans
                    lequel on prouve que les Chinois sont one colonie Egyptienne, Paris, 1759, 1760,
                    in 12mo; 5. The <hi rend="italic">Chou-hing,</hi> or sacred book of the Chinese,
                    with a translation corrected from that of Father Gaubil, and most useful notes,
                    Paris, 1770, in 4to; 6. An edition of the <hi rend="italic">Eloge</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Monkden</hi> and of the <hi rend="italic">Art</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Militaire des Chinois,</hi> 1770, 1771; 7. Twenty-eight papers in
                    the Memoirs of the Academy of Inscriptions. These papers or memoirs may be
                    divided into three classes; the first of which has for its object to develope
                    more fully various points which are only treated cursorily in the History of the
                    Huns; the second includes the papers intended to establish his system of the
                    Egyptian origin of the Chinese; and the third comprehends those of a
                    miscellaneous character, such as the memoir on the commerce of the French in the
                    Levant before the crusades, that on the Oriental Zodiac, and observations on the
                    origin and antiquity of the Indians, as well as on the geography of their
                    country. Besides the works mentioned above, De Guignes left several manuscripts,
                    particularly, 1. Notices d’Ecrivains Arabes; 2. Mémoire sur le Commerce des
                    Chinois avec les Russes; 3. Histoire de la Chine, translated from the Chinese
                    Annals, and divided into three parts; 4. Mémoires Historiques et Géographiques
                    sur l’Afrique, d’après les auteurs Arabes.</p>

                <p>Such were the works which occupied the life of this scholar. Considered as a
                    learned man, he may be said to have possessed vast knowledge, and to
                    have'employed it in the most useful manner. Although he cannot be called an
                    elegant writer, his style is easy and clear; and even the paradoxes which he
                    defended prove, by his ingenious approximations and original views, that he was
                    endowed with a lively imagination and extraordinary sagacity. But he was still
                    more estimable for the excellence of his character than the extent of his
                    acquirements. Invariable in his principles, the enemy of all intrigue, and
                    having no other ambition than that of extending the boundaries of knowledge, he
                    never solicited pensions, places, or encomiums, and knew too well the real value
                    of time to waste it in the pursuit of objects so inglorious. He was a sincere
                    lover of truth, even when it seemed adverse to the system which he laboured so
                    strenuously to maintain; and the rectitude of mind which he uniformly displayed,
                    constitutes a prouder title of distinction than even his great talents and
                    unrivalled attainments.</p>
                <p>In his History of Huns, Turks, and Moguls (the first two volumes of which
                    appeared in 1756, and the others in 1758), the first part of volume first, which
                    contains the chronological tables, and may give an idea of the work, is divided
                    into eight books, the last of which contains the series of Christian princes
                    who, in consequence of the crusades, founded states in Syria. In the succeeding
                    volumes, the principal object of De Guignes has been to trace the history of the
                    Western Tartars; that of other nations being treated only in as far as it is
                    related to or connected with the fortunes of the race whose annals he had
                    undertaken to illustrate. Profoundly conversant with the Chinese, the Arabic,
                    and the ancient idioms of the East; and thoroughly acquainted with the Greek and
                    Latin historians, the chroniclers of the middle ages, and the annals of the
                    northern nations; he was the first who undertook to reconcile the recitals of
                    the occidentals with those of the Chinese, to explain the one in favour of the
                    other, to establish the origin and trace the route of the barbarous tribes who,
                    under the different names of Huns, Avares, or Turks, overthrew the Roman empire,
                    ravaged France, Italy, Germany, and all the countries of the north, destroyed
                    the empire of the Caliphs, and established themselves in Europe, Persia, Syria,
                    and a great part of Western Asia; and, lastly, to illustrate the events which
                    connect the history of the Huns with that of almost all other nations. If this
                    work be examined with critical severity, it will be found that the author has
                    been too negligent of style, that the facts have not been subjected to a
                    rigorous investigation, and that the monotony of the recital is not interrupted
                    by any reflections calculated to interest the reader. But the object of De
                    Guignes w¢s to collect facts rather than to digest them according to a rigorous
                    chronology; and the disorder which, in this respect, reigns in his work,
                    proceeds partly from the multitude of sources whence he derived his information,
                    and partly from the vice of the oriental writers amongst whom the irregular
                    method of computing dates renders it impossible to restore the precise
                    chronology of events. On this ground the writers in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">de Trévoux</hi> attacked the History of the Huns.
                    De Guignes replied to this criticism, in a letter inserted in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">des Savons</hi> for 1757, and also
                    at the end of the fifth volume of his History. The journalists rejoined; and the
                    dispute terminated by a note appended to the same volume, in which the author
                    refers to the <hi rend="italic">Annales Chinoises.</hi> The History of the Huns
                    has been translated into German by Daenhert, who appears to have done ample
                    justice to the original. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
