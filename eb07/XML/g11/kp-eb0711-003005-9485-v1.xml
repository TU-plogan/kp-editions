                    a very large province of Hindustan, situated principally between the
                    twenty-first and twenty-fourth degrees of north latitude. It has been computed
                    to be 320 miles long by abòut 180 broad. On the north it is bounded by the
                    province of Ajmeer, on the south by the sea and the province of Aurungabad, to
                    the east it has Malwah and Khandesh, and to the west portions of Moultan, Cutch,
                    and the sea. The southwestern quarter of this province is enclosed on the
                    southwest and north-east by the Gulfs of Cutch and Cambay, and has the form of a
                    peninsula. A considerable portion of the province, particularly towards the
                    eastern frontier, is hilly, and much covered with jungle. On the north-western
                    boundary, along the bank of the river Puddar or Bunass, the country in some
                    parts produces good pasture; in other parts it is either an arid plain, or a low
                    salt swamp, which, where it is dried up, is barren and unproductive, from the
                    saline nature of the soil and the water. The interior is hilly and rocky, but
                    with spots exhibiting strong powers of vegetation where water is accessible.
                    These are extremely fertile, especially in sugar and tobacco, and, besides,
                    yield all sorts of grain, oats excepted; also cotton, tobacco, indigo, gum, and
                    sugar. The country, notwithstanding its smoothness to the eye, is in many <pb

                    parts intersected by ravines, and much broken by the heavy rains; and some of
                    these chasms contain during the season of the rains a large volume of water, not
                    to be crossed without the assistance of rafts or boats; and accordingly the
                    natives, in these cases, establish temporary ferries. The climate is reckoned
                    one of the worst in India, being intensely hot during the greater part of the
                    year, with a heavy thickness in the atmosphere, which is extremely oppressive. A
                    hot wind blows fiercely all the day; and when it ceases at night, it is followed
                    by a still more close and oppressive calm. “I had certainly,” says Bishop Heber,
                    “no conception that anywhere in India the month of March could offer such a
                    furnace-like climate.” “It is,” he adds, “in the same latitude with Calcutta,
                    and seems to be what Bengal would be without the glorious Ganges.”<note

                    10.</p></note> During the hot and dry months, the surface of the country appears
                    mostly sand or dust, and in the rainy season a thick mire. In the north-western
                    parts, along the banks of the river Puddar, where there isgood pasturage, and in
                    various other parts of the province, they breed excellent horses and camels; and
                    the cattle are superior to those of any other part of India. Some of their
                    bullocks, which are in general white, with large bumps, are sixteen hands high,
                    and will trot in a carriage as fast, and perform as long a journey, as good
                    horses. This province is traversed by several large rivers, namely, the Puddar,
                    the Nerbuddah, Tuptee, Mahy, Mehindry, and Sabermatty, which, being navigable
                    from the sea to a considerable distance up the country, afford great facilities
                    for commerce. But there are many large tracts which experience a great scarcity
                    of water; and the inhabitants are forced to dig wells, which are in many parts
                    from eighty to a hundred feet deep. In some particular portions of this province
                    not a stone is to be met with, whilst in some others nothing else is to be
                    seen.</p>
                <p>In so extensive a province, never completely subdued by any of its numerous
                    invaders, a great diversity of population may be expected. The population of
                    Gujerat is accordingly very strangely diversified by numerous sects and castes,
                    under the various designations of Grassias, Catties, Coolies, Bheels, Mewassies,
                    Charons, Bhatts, Dheras, and others. In some parts of the province the Grassias
                    form a numerous class of landholders, and in others they merely possess a sort
                    of feudal authority over certain portions of land and villages. The origin of
                    their rights is a controverted point of Hindu history, which has never been very
                    satisfactorily explained. The common account of their title to the land is, that
                    they were robbers and plunderers, who inhabited the hills and jungles, and by
                    their incursions the country was so much infested, that after the decease of the
                    Emperor Akbar in 1605, the nabobs of Surat ceded to them certain lands in each
                    village in lieu of all demands. But it is asserted that, encouraged by this
                    success, they still continued their depredations; and the Zemindars, in order to
                    purchase peace, agreed to the payment, on certain lands, of what is called <hi
                    rend="italic">toda∙,</hi> or ready money; and the lands which are liable to this
                    payment have been continually increasing, owing to the anarchy which so long
                    prevailed in Gujerat. The proprietors of these claims never allow them to die
                    out; and it is seldom that they prosecute them in person, but, having retired to
                    some secluded residence, they rally round them a band of desperate adventurers,
                    to whom they farm out the Grassia claim, and depute them to levy it. Hence the
                    country, prior to the war of 1817, and before it was brought under the dominion
                    of the British, was a prey to the greatest disorders; it was ravaged by
                    predatory hordes, who acquired new rights, and in this manner it was plundered,
                    and the rent of the land misappropriated. These claims have been involved in
                    such complication and obscurity, that the British officers have found it
                    impossible to reduce them to any accurate standard of law or justice. On the
                    rugged margins of all rivers in Gujerat, many of these Grassias reside in a kind
                    of independence; and also all over the Gujerat peninsula, usually denominated
                    Cattywar by the natives. Their numbers are recruited by criminals from the
                    plains, who fly to their haunts for refuge, and are supposed to amount to one
                    half of the population north of the Mahy river. In 1814, an attempt was made by
                    the Bombay government to extinguish the Grassia claims by a payment from the
                    public treasury, and thus to prevent the crimes and disorders which they
                    occasioned.</p>
                <p>Of all the disorderly hordes which infest this country, the most bloody and
                    ferocious are the Coolies. The most barbarous are those in the vicinity of the
                    Runn, the salt morass which bounds the province on the west, and communicates
                    with the Gulf of Cutch. These are taught to despise every approach to
                    civilization; they are of the most filthy habits, and consider it a mark of
                    effeminacy to wear clean clothes; and the priests and other persons of note
                    exceed the laity in dirtiness. They consider cleanliness as indicative of
                    cowardice. That class of men named Bhatts, or Bharotts, abound more in Gujerat
                    than in any other province of India. They cultivate the land; but the greater
                    part of them are recorders of births and deaths, and beggars or itinerant bards,
                    and very frequently traders. They often stand forward as security for the public
                    revenue, and guarantee observance of agreements and rewards. They always
                    possess, however, an intimate knowledge of the person for whom they become
                    security, of his character and resources; and when they find that they have been
                    deceived, and are pressed for money for which they have become security, such is
                    their proud and obstinate character, that they sometimes sacrifice their own
                    lives, or some aged female or child of the family, in the presence of the person
                    for whom they have broken their word. They form, in the rude state of society
                    which prevails in India, a sort of middle-men between the contributors and the
                    government, every Grassia, Coolie, and Bheel, having his Bhatt, a class who are
                    rewarded by a small per-centage on the amount of the revenues for which they
                    have become surety, and for the security which they afford against the
                    importunity of the inferior agents of government, their persons being regarded
                    as sacred, and their influence over the persons of the natives very great. They
                    were chiefly employed under the Mahratta princes, between whom and the
                    landholders they stood as middle-men, being bound to the government for the
                    revenue, and acting as a security to the landholders against the oppressions of
                    the government Under the British rule this agency was entirely discontinued in
                    1817, being found inefficient as an instrument of control for the unruly tribes
                    of the country. The Charons are a sect of Hindus, allied in manners and customs
                    to the Bhatts. They are often possessed of large droves of cattle for carriage,
                    by means of which they carry on a distant inland traffic in grain and other
                    articles. They also often hire themselves out as protectors of travellers in the
                    wildest parts of the country; and so faithful are they to their charge, that
                    when a band of predatory horse appears, these persons take an oath to die by
                    their own hands, in case those whom they have engaged to protect are plundered;
                    and this threat is always found effectual to restrain those superstitious
                    thieves, who hold the Charons in great veneration. There is in Gujerat, as in
                    other <pb break="no" facs="nls:193639511?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-9511-0032"/> parts of Hindustan Proper, a race of people
                    called Ungreas, whose profession is that of money-carriers, which they contrive
                    to conceal in their quilted clothes. Although they are miserably poor, they
                    maybe trusted with large sums of money to carry many miles off, merely on the
                    responsibility of the superior, who is frequently richer than the other. They
                    are of all castes, and in general athletic and well armed; and they are of such
                    singular habits, that in performing distant journeys they form themselves into
                    parties, arid fight with desperation to defend a property for which their only
                    recompense is a mere subsistence.</p>
                <p>The Bheels are generally described as the original inhabitants of the country,
                    who have been driven to their present fastnesses and their miserable way of life
                    by the invaders of their country, whether Mahommedans or Hindus. They have been
                    in the north parts of India treated with extreme severity by the British.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Heber, vol. ii. p.
                    496.</p></note> But, by the influence of Sir John Malcolm, and his mild and
                    enlightened policy, they have been reclaimed in the south from their barbarous
                    habits, and formed into regiments, subject to such discipline as was suited to
                    their barbarous habits. They also received grants of land, and freedom from
                    taxes for a number of years; and they were in this manner trained to industrious
                    habits.</p>
                <p>The Dheras of this province are of a very degraded caste, and their employment is
                    to carry filth of every description out of the roads and villages. They are
                    miserably poor; they scrape bare the bones of every animal which dies within
                    their limits, and share out the flesh, which they cook in various ways, and feed
                    upon. They are obliged to serve travellers as carriers of their baggage to the
                    village nearest their own. In the course of their business they are always
                    committing petty thefts, and are much given to intoxication.</p>
                <p>The Vaneeya, or the merchants and traffickers, form a numerous class in Gujerat.
                    Many of them travel to remote parts of India, where they remain from one to ten
                    years, after which they return to their wives and children. Many also finally
                    settle in the towns of foreign countries, where their descendants continue to
                    speak and write the Gujerattee tongue. The Jains are also a more numerous class
                    here than in any of the contiguous provinces, and possess many handsome temples
                    adorned with well-wrought images. Besides its native hordes or castes, Gujerat,
                    along with Bombay, contains nearly all the Parsees, or fire-worshippers, to be
                    found in the continent of India, the feeble remains of the once numerous sect of
                    the Magi. In all the larger towns are to be found that remarkable race of men
                    named the Boras, who, though Mahommedans in religion, are Jews in features,
                    manners, and genius. They form a community amongst themselves, and are
                    everywhere noted for their address in bargaining, minute thrift, and constant
                    attention to lucre. The washermen are also considered as a degraded and cruel
                    class, on account of the numerous deaths which they involuntarily occasion to
                    the animalcula in the process of washing.</p>
                <p>The province of Gujerat flourished chiefly during the era of the Mogul
                    government, and even during the most convulsed periods it carried on a much more
                    extensive trade than ever it has done since. The principal trade is with Bombay,
                    and the chief exports are cotton, piece goods, and grain. The imports are
                    chiefly sugar, raw silk, pepper, cocoa nuts, cochineal, and woollens. The
                    inhabitants are industrious, and the Surat manufactures have been long famed
                    over India for their quality and cheapness. The principal towns in this province
                    are Surat, Ahmedabad, Broach, Cambay, Gogo, Bhownuggur, Chumpaneer, and
                    Junaghur. Gujerat contains populous districts, but in other parts the country is
                    extremely desolate. Surat and the neighbouring country is thickly planted with
                    inhabitants, and the north-western districts are equally naked and destitute of
                    people. The country has been so much exposed to the depredations of thieves and
                    banditti from the jungles and mountains, that, for the sake of security, the
                    great body of the people live, not in sequestered houses, but in villages; and
                    these villages are frequently visited by travelling companies, who exhibit
                    puppet-shows and histrionical representations. They arc also occasionally
                    frequented by musicians, dancing girls, singing men and women, wrestlers, expert
                    jugglers, dancing bears, goats, and monkeys. In the remote and savage districts
                    of the country, where there are no villages, fortifications are numerous; but in
                    all the parts to which the British influence extends, they are fast crumbling
                    into decay. In many parts the people are of savage and cruel manners; and
                    amongst the tribe of Jahrejahs the practice of female infanticide prevails, and
                    the united exertions of all the British officers and statesmen have been
                    employed to prevent it. There is another crime peculiar to this province, known
                    in the British courts of justice by the name of <hi rend="italic">jhansa,</hi>
                    which is the writing of threatening letters, the destroying of gardens or
                    plantations, and the burning of stacks, in order to extort money, or to enforce
                    a compliance with any other unjust demand. These offences were not formerly
                    confined to the Grassias, but were resorted to in village feuds, even by the
                    heads of villages. But since the regular administration of justice by the
                    British, such disorderly practices have become less frequent. There is a class
                    of persons, the Mahy Kaunta Coolies, who are so named from their residence on
                    the Mahy river, who are thieves by profession, and also very ingenious, active,
                    and courageous. They lurk on the highways, and intercept families and
                    individuals proceeding to distant pilgrimages and religious fairs. They
                    frequently visit Surat and other large cities in pursuit of their illicit
                    occupation, though, from the increasing vigilance of the British police, their
                    depredations are now more frequently checked. But, beyond the precincts of the
                    British authority, in the northern and western quarters, and the centre of the
                    Gujerat peninsula, the number of societies of armed and sanguinary thieves is
                    scarcely credible; and it is rather surprising that even the thinly scattered
                    population of the country should keep its ground amid the many excesses and
                    outrages which are committed.</p>
                <p>There are many remarkable wells and watering places in Gujerat. One near Baroda
                    is said to have cost nine lacks of rupees. There is another at Vadwa, in the
                    vicinity of Cambay, which, from the inscription, appears to have been erected in
                    1482.</p>
                <p>The province of Gujerat was first invaded about <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi>
                    1025, by Mahmood of Ghizni, who subverted the throne of its native prince, named
                    Jamund, and plundered his capital. After the establishment of the Delhi
                    sovereignty, Gujerat was subject for many years to the Patan conquerors. In the
                    fifteenth century it came under the dominion of a dynasty of Rajpoot princes,
                    converted to the Mahommedan religion, who removed the seat of government to
                    Ahmedabad; and under their rule it flourished greatly as a maritime and
                    commercial state. This race of princes was overthrown by the Emperor Akbar in
                    1572; and after the death of Aurungzebe in 1707, hordes of Mahratta depredators
                    overran the province, which in 1724 was finally separated from the Mogul
                    empire.</p>
                <p>Until 1818 the Mahratta Peshwa and the Guicowar possessed large tracts of
                    country, but at present only the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193639524?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0711-9524-0033"/> last remains,
                    the authority and dominions of the other having devolved to the British. The
                    establishment of the British dominions in this country experienced very serious
                    obstructions from the intermixture of their territories with those of the Peshwa
                    and the Guicowar; also from the nabob of Cambay, and the unsettled tributaries
                    of Cattywar and Mahy Kaunta; from the number of halfsubdued Grassias and
                    Mewassies; and still more from the predatory habits which a long course of
                    disorder had superinduced among a large proportion of the people, especially
                    beyond the Mahy river. But by the wise and conciliating policy of the local
                    functionaries, all these difficulties have been surmounted, and tranquillity has
                    gradually arisen from the confusion which at first overspread the country.</p>
                <p>The north-western frontier of the British dominions in this quarter is now formed
                    by the great salt-water lake or morass of the Runn, to the north of which is a
                    sandy desert. This desert tract, between the frontier of Jessel-merc, about lat.
                    26, and the Runn, is divided between the ameers of Sinde and the Joudpoor rajah,
                    whose respective limits might be indicated by a line drawn from Nuggur, in
                    Parkur, to Jesselmere. The Sinde territory, however, would cross the line near
                    its southern extremity, Bankasir; and as the whole of Parkur belongs to Sinde,
                    the frontier is still contested; the Joudpoor rajah claiming Amercote, and
                    having actually levied contributions as far as Sansur and Chaucra. Parkur is
                    partially cultivated, but the remainder is a desert of high sand hills, with
                    scattered spots of verdure; and the villages marked in the maps as towns only
                    contain a number of huts.</p>
