                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable

                <p><hi rend="italic">Horse</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Guards,</hi> in England,
                    were originally gentlemen chosen, for their bravery, to be intrusted with the
                    guard of the king’s person; and they were divided into four troops, called the
                    first, second, third, and fourth troop of Horse Guards. The first troop was
                    raised in the year 1660, and the command given to Lord Gerard; the second in
                    1661, and the command given to Sir Philip Howard; the third in 1693, and the
                    command given to Earl Feversham; the fourth in 1702, and the command given to
                    Earl Newburgh. Each troop had one colonel, two lieutenant-colonels, one cornet
                    and major, one guidon and major, four exempts and captains, four brigadiers and
                    lieutenants, one adjutant, four sub-brigadiers and cornets, and sixty private
                    men. But the four troops were afterwards turned into two regiments of Life
                    Guards.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Horse Grenadier</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                    Guards</hi> were divided into two troops, called the first and second troops of

                    given to Lieutenant-general Cholmondeley; the second in 1702, and the command
                    given to Lord Forbes. Each troop had a colonel, a lieutenant-colonel, a guidon
                    or major, three exempts and captains, three lieutenants, one adjutant, three
                    cornets, and sixty private men.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Yeomen of the</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Guard</hi>
                    were first raised by Henry VII. in the year 1485. They are a superior kind of
                    foot guards to the king’s person, and are generally called by the nickname of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Beef-Eaters.</hi> They were anciently two hundred and
                    fifty men of the first rank under gentry, and of larger stature than ordinary,
                    each being required to be six feet in height. Of this body there are about a
                    hundred on duty, and seventy more not on duty; and when any one of the hundred
                    dies, his place is supplied out of the seventy in non-activity. Their first
                    commander or captain was the Earl of Oxford.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foot</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Guards</hi> are
                    regiments of foot appointed for the guard of his majesty and his palace. They
                    were raised in the year 1660, when the command of the first regiment was given
                    to Thomas Lord Wentworth; that of the second to General Monk, then Duke of
                    Albemarle; and that of the third to the Earl of Linlithgow. The second regiment
                    is always called the Coldstream Guards, from a market-town in Berwickshire,
                    where it was first embodied. This regiment is older than the first, having been
                    raised sooner, and commanded by General Monk, from whom it derived its name of
                    Monk’s regiment or corps, and in compliment to whom it was made one of the three
                    royal regiments by Charles II.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotch</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Guards,</hi> a
                    celebrated band, which formed the first company of the ancient <hi rend="italic"
                    >gardes du corps</hi> of France. From the ancient intercourse between the two
                    countries, the natives of Scotland had often distinguished themselves in the
                    service of France. On this foundation the company of Scotch Guards, and the
                    company of Scotch Gendarmes, were instituted; both of them owed their
                    institution to Charles VII. of France, by whom the first standing army in Europe
                    was formed, in the year 1454.</p>
                <p>The ancient rights and privileges of the Scottish Life Guards were most
                    honourable. The author of the Ancient Alliance between France and Britain says,
                    “On high holidays, at the ceremony of the royal touch, the erection of knights
                    of the king’s order, the reception of extraordinary ambassadors, and the public
                    entries of cities, there must be six of their number next to the king’s person,
                    three on each side; and the body of the king must be carried by these only,
                    wheresoever ceremony requires. They have the keeping of the keys of the king’s
                    lodging at night, the keeping of the choir of the chapel, the keeping the boats
                    where the king passes the rivers; and they have the honour of bearing the white
                    silk fringe in their arms, which in France is the <hi rend="italic">coronne
                    coleur.</hi> The keys of all the cities where the king makes his entry are given
                    to their captain in waiting or out of waiting. He has the privilege, in waiting
                    or out of waiting, at ceremonies, such as coronations, marriages, and funerals
                    of the kings, and at the baptism and marriage of their children, to take duty
                    upon him. The coronation robe belongs to him; and this company, by the death or
                    change of a captain, never changes its rank, as do the three others.”</p>
                <p>This company’s first commander, who is recorded as a person of great valour and
                    military accomplishments, was Robert Patillock, or Patullo, a native of Dundee;
                    and the corps, ever ardent to distinguish itself, continued in great reputation
                    until the year 1578. From that period, the Scotch Guards were less attended to,
                    and their privileges came to be invaded. In the year 1612, they presented a
                    remonstrance to Louis XIII. on the injustice they had suffered, and placed
                    before him the services they had rendered to the crown of France. Attempts were
                    then made to re-establish them on their ancient foundation; but the negotiation
                    for this purpose proved ineffectual. The troops of France became jealous of the
                    honours paid to them; the death of Francis II., and the return of Mary to
                    Scotland, at a time when they had much to hope, were unfortunate circumstances;
                    the change of religion in Scotland proved an additional blow; and the accession
                    of James VI. to the throne of England altogether disunited the interests of
                    France and Scotland. The Scotch Guards of France had therefore latterly no
                    connection with Scotland except in the name.</p>
