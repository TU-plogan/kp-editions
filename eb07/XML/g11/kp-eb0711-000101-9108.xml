                <p><label type="entry">GROTIUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Hugo</hi></label>, one of the
                    most illustrious characters of modern times, was born at Delft on the 10th of
                    April 1583. His great-grandfather was Concille Cornets, a gentleman of
                    Franche-Comté, who settled in Holland, and married Ermengard the only daughter
                    of Diederik de Groot, a burgomaster of Delft. Her father stipulated that the
                    children born of this marriage should assume his own name, which literally
                    signifies the Great, and is pronounced like the English word <hi rend="italic"
                    >groat.</hi> Her son, named Cornelis de Groot, was distinguished by his
                    learning. By Eselina van Heemskerck, related to one of the first families in
                    Holland, he had two sons, Cornelis and Jan, or John. The younger of these
                    brothers married Alida van Overschie, who likewise belonged to a very genteel
                    family, and the issue of this marriage were three sons and a daughter. Jan de
                    Groot had studied the law, and with his juridical knowledge he united much
                    elegant erudition. He was four times burgomaster of Delft, and was one of the
                    three curators of the university of Leyden. His eldest son, Huig de Groot,
                    commonly known by the more classical appellation of Hugo Grotius, was a youth of
                    the most amiable disposition and of the most promising talents: so premature
                    indeed was his genius, that he seemed to pass immediately from the state of
                    infancy to that of manhood. He was indebted to his father for a pious as well as
                    a learned education; and one of the first fruits of it was a successful attempt,
                    at the age of twelve, to convert his mother from the Romish faith.</p>
                <p>At a very early age, he was sent to school at the Hague, where he was committed
                    to the domestic care of Uytenbogard, a clergyman of great note and influence
                    among the Arminians; and to his connexion with this individual, with whom he
                    contracted a lasting friendship, the colour of his subsequent life may to a
                    great extent be attributed. At the age of twelve, he was sent to the university
                    of Leyden, which about that period was the most learned seminary in Europe. Here
                    he continued for three years, residing in the house of Junius, a distinguished
                    professor of divinity, from whom he might perhaps imbibe his decided relish for
                    theological studies. Of that university Joseph Scaliger was then the brightest
                    ornament, and he may indeed be safely characterized as the most learned man in
                    modern times: he was greatly struck with the uncommon capacity of this young
                    scholar, and not only encouraged, but likewise directed his studies. In 1597,
                    when he had only reached the age of fourteen, he with much applause defended
                    public theses in mathematics, philosophy, and jurisprudence, and thus exhibited
                    a maturity of talents and attainments far beyond his years. He was speedily
                    regarded as a literary prodigy, and was celebrated as such by various poets and
                    scholars of that learned age. During the ensuing year, he accompanied count
                    Justin of Nassau and the grand-pensionary Oldenbarneveldt, who were sent on an
                    embassy to the court of France. Μ. de Buzanval, formerly ambassador to Holland,
                    presented him to the king, who received him in a gracious manner, and gave him
                    his portrait, together with a chain of gold. He had however to regret that he
                    did not find an opportunity of paying his respects to the illustrious president
                    De Thou; but on his return to Delft, he addressed to him a letter which produced
                    a very friendly correspondence between a venerable judge and a beardless lawyer.
                    In France he now resided for nearly twelve months; and it was at this period
                    that he took the degree of LL.D, in the university of Orleans. He had not then
                    attained the age of seventeen; but he had doubtless acquired a much larger fund
                    of learning than has fallen to the share of many, not to say most, of those who
                    have subsequently taken the same degree at a more mature age. On returning to
                    his native country, he was called to the bar, and he pleaded his first cause at
                    Delft in the year 1599.</p>
                <p>But the practice of the bar, and the study of jurisprudence, did not engage his
                    undivided attention. He continued to devote himself with great ardour to the
                    study of classical literature, and had already distinguished himself by the
                    spirit and elegance of his Latin verses. Among the earliest of his publications
                    was an edition of the Satyrico of Martianus Capella, which was printed at Leyden
                    the year 1599. When only fourteen years of age, he had received from his father
                    a manuscript of this author, and, on communicating it to Scaliger, had been
                    honoured with his injunctions to prepare a new edition. This task, which <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193639121" xml:id="kp-eb0711-9121-0002"/>was by no means
                    easy, he ventured to undertake, and he not only revised the text, but likewise
                    wrote elaborate annotations. His edition excited the admiration of those who
                    were most competent to judge of its merits or defects; and if he had not given
                    many other proofs of his early proficiency, we might have been induced to
                    suppose that he had received very material assistance from some scholar of riper
                    years. His <hi rend="italic">Syntagma</hi><hi rend="italic">Arateorum,</hi>
                    printed at the same place in 1600, increased his reputation as a classical
                    critic. This includes the Greek verses of Aratus, the Latin versions, so far as
                    they could be recovered, of Cicero, Germanicus Caesar, and Festus Avienus,
                    together with the annotations of the editor, who was then seventeen years of
                    age. As this metrical work relates to astronomy, it afforded him an opportunity
                    of displaying his science as well as erudition. His brief notes on Lucan,
                    accompanying an edition of the text, made their appearance in 1603. Some of his
                    Latin verses had been printed so early as the year 1598, and others followed in
                    1599 and 1600. “Adamus Exul, tragoedia,” was published in 1601; but this tragedy
                    he afterwards considered as too juvenile to be admitted into the general
                    collection of his poems. The use to which it was applied by Lauder, in his
                    dishonest attempt to convict Milton of plagiarism, is well known to the more
                    critical reader.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Lost, p. 50. Loud. 1750, 8vo.</p></note> His “Tragoedia, Christus patiens,” was
                    printed in 1608, and was received with great applause. It was translated into
                    English by George Sandys, and, at a more recent period, into German by D. W.
                    Triller. With the former version he appears to have been much pleased. His third
                    drama, “Sophompaneas, tragoedia,” was not published till 1617. It relates to the
                    history of Joseph, whom he thus describes by an Egyptian name. Of this tragedy a
                    Dutch version was undertaken by Vondel, a poet of great note. The literary
                    reputation of Grotius speedily procured him the appointment of historiographer
                    to the republic; an appointment which he did not himself solicit, though it was
                    eagerly solicited by several other scholars, and, among the rest, by Dominicus
                    Baudius, a well-known professor of eloquence in the university of Leyden.</p>
                <p>His first appearance at the bar produced a very favourable impression, and he
                    soon rose to eminence in a profession which in most countries is considered as
                    lucrative. In 1607, that is, at the age of twenty-four, he was promoted to the
                    important office of advocate general of Holland and Zeeland. During the
                    following year, he married Maria van Reygersberg, allied to one of the first
                    families in Zeeland; and, as one of his biographers has remarked, it is
                    sufficient commendation to add that she was a wife worthy of such a
                    husband.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Burigny, Vie de
                    Grotius, tom. i. p. 42. edit. Amst. 1754, 2 tom. 12mo.</p></note> Their nuptials
                    were commemorated in the verses of many learned poets. About this period, he was
                    occupied with a professional work, which appeared in 1609, under the title of
                    “Mare Liberum, sive de Jure quod Batavis competit ad Indicana Commercia,
                    Dissertatio,” and produced a controversy of no vulgar denomination. After an
                    interval of some years, it was opposed in the “Mare Clausum” of Selden, an
                    antagonist worthy of Grotius. The British cause was likewise maintained by
                    William Wellwood, who had been a professor of law in the university of St
                    Andrews; and his treatise “De Dominio Maris” was answered by Graswinckel, who
                    published three different tracts in support of his countryman’s positions. Other
                    learned writers engaged in the same controversy, which however must ultimately
                    be decided by the sword, rather than by the law of nature and nations. In 1610
                    he published a work “De Antiquitate Reipublicae Batavae” and in the same year a
                    Dutch translation, which was partly executed by his father. The book was
                    afterwards translated into French. In 1613 Grotius was appointed pensionary, or
                    syndic, of Rotterdam, and then fixed his residence in that city. In the course
                    of the same year, he was sent on a mission to the court of London, for the
                    purpose of remonstrating against the arbitrary proceedings of the English, who
                    claimed an exclusive right to the Greenland fisheries. His diplomatic exertion^
                    appear to have been attended with little or no success; but he was very
                    graciously received by the learned monarch, and likewise had the satisfaction of
                    forming a personal acquaintance with Isaac Casaubon, a man of great worth and
                    learning.</p>
                <p>The republic was at this time agitated by theological dissensions. Arminius, an
                    eminent professor in the university of Leyden, had publicly dissented from the
                    doctrines of Calvin respecting predestination and grace. He was immediately
                    opposed by Gomarus, another professor in the same university, and many
                    controversial proceedings flowed from this origin.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Brantii Historia Vitre Jacobi Arminii. Amst.
                    1724, 8vo.</p></note> Many of the magistrates were disposed to adopt the new
                    opinions, but the clergy, and the great body of the people, very generally
                    adhered to the established creed. Arminius died in the year 1609; and his
                    adherents soon afterwards obtained the name of Remonstrants, from the
                    circumstance of their having addressed to the states a remonstrance, subscribed
                    by forty-six ministers, and containing a summary of their distinctive tenets. It
                    was digested by Uytenbogard, and Grotius is supposed to have lent his
                    assistance. The Gomarists produced a counter-remonstrance, and thus obtained the
                    name of Counter-remonstrants. In order to allay the animosities that now
                    prevailed between the two parties, the states issued an edict which was prepared
                    by Grotius, but which was too favourable to the Arminians to prove satisfactory
                    to the Gomarists. It was attacked by Sibrand Lubert, a professor in the
                    university of Franeker, and was defended by Grotius, in a work published in
                    1613, under the title of “Ordinum Hollandiae Pietas, a calumniis multorum,
                    praesertim Sibrandi Luberti, vindicata.” The professor replied in 1614; and
                    before the close of the year, his antagonist produced “Bona Fides Sibrandi
                    Luberti, ex libro quem inscripsit Responsionem ad Pietatem Hugonis Grotii.”
                    During the same year he likewise published “Ordinum Hollandiae et Westfrisiae
                    Decretum pre Pace Ecclesiarum, munitum, S. Scripturae, Conciliorum, Patrum,
                    Confessionum, et Theologorum Testimoniis.” At this crisis, the learned author
                    was deeply engaged in theological studies; and in 1617 he printed his “Defensio
                    Fidei Catholicae de Satisfactione Christi, adversus Faustum Socinum Senensem,”
                    which was speedily attacked by Ravensperger, and was defended by Vossius, an
                    intimate friend of the author. It was afterwards attacked by Crellius. a person
                    of no small consideration among the Socinians.</p>
                <p>While he was thus exerting his powerful talents, the republic was torn by
                    intestine divisions. With the view of repressing the seditions which followed
                    these theological altercations, the grand-pensionary Oldenbarneveldt proposée to
                    the states of Holland that they should empower the magistrates of the province
                    to levy a military force; and although the proposal was strenuously opposed by
                    Amsterdam, Dordrecht, and other three towns where the Gomarists had the chief
                    influence, a decree to that effect was issued on the 4th of August 1617. Maurice
                    of Nassau considered such a step as this, taken without his concurrence, to be
                    highly derogatory to his authority as governoι <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193639134" xml:id="kp-eb0711-9134-0003"/>and captain general; and he
                    now found an opportunity of satiating the hatred which he had formerly conceived
                    against the grand-pensionary. Availing himself of the rancour of party-feeling,
                    he exerted all his influence in favour of the Gomarists; and before the close of
                    that year, they were emboldened to discontinue all communion with the Arminians.
                    His elder brother the prince of Orange died on the 21st of February 1618, and
                    Maurice thus became more formidable to his opponents. Supported by an armed
                    force, and accompanied by the deputies of the states general, he made a progress
                    through different provinces, and displaced the Arminian ministers and
                    magistrates. Grotius and Hoogerbeetz, pensionary of Leyden, were dispatched to
                    Utrecht by the states of Holland, for the purpose of encouraging the authorities
                    to oppose the prince in his violent attempt upon that city: they accordingly
                    made preparations for a vigorous defence, but some seditious move-, ments took
                    place among the soldiers as well as the citizens, and Maurice becoming master of
                    the city, introduced such changes as suited his particular views. Having
                    suddenly called together eight individuals, who described themselves as the
                    states general, he procured a decree for the arrest of Oldenbarneveldt, Grotius,
                    and Hoogerbeetz. On the 29th of August, the grand-pensionary was seized at the
                    Hague, as he was returning to his own house, after attending a meeting of the
                    states of Holland. The prince sent for Grotius and Hoogerbeetz, and when they
                    presented themselves, they were immediately taken into custody, and committed to
                    the castle of the Hague. The synod of Dordrecht was opened on the 13th of
                    November 1618: the five Arminian articles were there condemned, and sentence of
                    deposition was pronounced against the Arminian clergy. The fate of the
                    state-prisoners was next decided. Oldenbarneveldt, a man distinguished by his
                    talents and patriotism, was beheaded on the 13th of May 1619, all the principles
                    of justice having been signally violated to remove a formidable obstacle to the
                    ambition of the prince of Orange.</p>
                <p>The trial of Grotius was conducted in the most irregular manner; and on the
                    eighteenth day of the same month, being convicted of divers imaginary crimes, he
                    was condemned to perpetual imprisonment, and all his property was confiscated.
                    His wife’s fortune, and whatever he had saved from his public appointments, were
                    absorbed by this flagitious sentence; but as his father was still living, he was
                    not left in a state of destitution. On the 6th of June he was removed to the
                    fortress of Louvestein, near the town of Gorcum in South Holland. His father was
                    denied the consolation of visiting him in his prison. While he remained at the
                    Hague, his wife was refused all access to him, and was not even permitted to
                    attend him during a severe illness. She was at first admitted to Louvestein
                    under the express condition of remaining constantly in the fortress, but was
                    afterwards allowed to quit it on obtaining leave for each occasion, and it was
                    finally conceded that she might quit it twice a week. The presence of this
                    excellent woman was a great source of consolation; and a mind regulated like
                    that of Grotius was habitually sustained by the consolations of religion. In his
                    literary pursuits, which were so numerous and diversified, he likewise found
                    unabating delight, and he alternately applied himself to the study of
                    philosophy, jurisprudence, and theology. Sunday and a portion of the other days
                    of the week he devoted to his theological studies. He now wrote some short
                    annotations on the New Testament, and a work in Dutch verse on the truth of the
                    Christian religion. For the use of his daughter Cornelia, he composed a metrical
                    catechism in the same language. It was printed at the Hague in the year 1619,
                    and he afterwards translated it into Latin verse. Another of his labours during
                    his imprisonment was his introduction to the Dutch law, “Inleydinge tot de
                    Hollandse Rechtsgelehrtheyt.” It was published in 1631, or perhaps earlier, and
                    underwent many editions, several of which contain the additions of Groenewegen,
                    well known for his treatise “De Legibus abrogatis et inusitatis in Hollandia.”
                    The course of his literary studies led him to examine the fragments of Greek
                    poets preserved by Stobaeus, and these he now began to translate into Latin
                    verse, together with the reliques of Menander and Philemon. It is impossible to
                    contemplate these various occupations of a man condemned to perpetual
                    imprisonment, without being very deeply impressed with the value and importance
                    of sound learning, united with a religious frame of mind. To an ordinary lawyer
                    or statesman, under a similar sentence, the fortress of Louvestein would have
                    proved a very desolate habitation.</p>
                <p>After he had been imprisoned for about twenty months, his wife, who appears to
                    have possessed a mind not less firm than tender, devised and executed a plan for
                    his escape. On the 22d of March 1621, when the commander of the fortress had
                    gone to Heusden for the purpose of levying soldiers, she shut her husband in a
                    large chest, which had been in common use for sending clothes to Gorcum to be
                    washed: she had previously ascertained that he was able to endure this
                    confinement for the necessary length of time, and had taken the precaution of
                    boring several holes for the admission of air. During the first year of his
                    imprisonment, the guards had been accustomed to make a careful inspection of the
                    chest; but having always found that it contained nothing but books and linen,
                    they at length suffered it to pass without examination. She had taken occasion
                    to inform the wife of the commanding officer that she was about to send away a
                    chest full of books; and that her husband being in a very feeble state of
                    health, she was grieved to see him apply so closely to his studies. When two
                    soldiers took up the chest, they found the weight so great, that one of them
                    exclaimed, “There must be an Arminian in it an expression which for some time
                    became proverbial. Some demur however took place, but this precious load was at
                    length deposited in a boat, and was safely conveyed to Gorcum, under the
                    inspection of a female servant, to whom the secret had been confided. On
                    reaching the town, the master of the boat proposed to place it on a sledge; but
                    the servant informing him that it contained very brittle ware, and must be
                    conveyed with caution, it was supported on a kind of litter carried with two
                    poles, and was thus conveyed to the house of David Daet-zelaer, the friend of
                    Grotius, and the brother-in-law of Erpenius. Here he disguised himself as a
                    mason, and, with a rule and trowel in his hands·, hastened to embark in a boat,’
                    which landed him at Walwyck in Brabant. He there made himself known to some
                    Arminians, and hiring a carriage to Antwerp, alighted at the house of Nicoaus
                    Gre-vinchovius, who had formerly been a clergyman at Amsterdam. In the mean
                    time, his faithful wife had acted with much presence of mind. She at first
                    pretended that her husband was seriously indisposed; but when her servant
                    returned with the intelligence that he had been conveyed across the Rhine, she
                    boldly declared to the guards that their prisoner had escaped. On the arrival of
                    the commanding officer, she was committed to close confinement. On the 5th of
                    April she addressed to the states general a petition for her release; and
                    although some individuals had the baseness to propose she should be retained as
                    a prisoner, she obtained her liberty two days after this petition was presented,
                    and she was permitted to remove all her goods from Louvestein. The escape of
                    this illustrious man furnished a theme to some of the well-known poets of the
                    time, particularly to Heinsius and Barlaeus.</p>
                <p>Grotius remained for a short while in the city of Antwerp; where on the 30th of
                    March he wrote a letter to the states, informing them that he had effected his
                    escape without either violence or corruption, and that the persecution <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193639147" xml:id="kp-eb0711-9147-0004"/> to which he had
                    been subjected would never diminish his love of his native country. Having
                    resolved to seek an asylum in France, he was furnished with letters of
                    recommendation by his zealous friend Du Maurier, the French ambassador in
                    Holland; and from the president Jeannin he received a letter, which encouraged
                    him to expect the protection of the king, as well as the friendship of the most
                    distinguished persons in the kingdom. He reached Paris on the 13th of April
                    1621, and experienced a very kind reception from the president and other men of
                    rank and eminence. One of those who hastened to wait upon him was Peiresc, who,
                    without being himself an author, has enjoyed a degree of literary reputation to
                    which but few authors attain. The states general lost no time^in instructing
                    their ambassador to exert his diplomatic arts in depressing the credit of
                    Grotius, who still displayed his greatness of mind by speaking of his country as
                    became a good citizen. Such arts were attended with no ultimate success, but,
                    from the exhausted state of the treasury, a considerable interval elapsed before
                    he received any pecuniary aid; and his wife having joined him in the month of
                    October, he had been induced to take a house without having any adequate means
                    of supporting himself in credit and comfort. The king, who had been absent from
                    Paris, returned about the end of January 1622; and in the ensuing month of
                    March, Grotius was presented by the chancellor and the keeper of the seals. His
                    majesty received him very graciously, and bestowed upon him a pension of three
                    thousand livres. On this occasion, he was chiefly befriended by the keeper of
                    the seals, and by the prince of Condé.</p>
                <p>Being placed in a situation of comparative tranquillity, he now resumed his
                    literary labours. Before the close of the year 1622, he published an apology for
                    himself and the party with which he had acted. It bears the title of
                    “Apologeticus eorum qui Hollandiae, Westfrisiaeque, et vicinis quibusdam
                    Nationibus, ex legibus praefuerunt, ante mutationem anni cι□ ιoc xvili; quo ea
                    referuntur quae adversus Hugonem Grotium et alios acta judicatave fuerunt.” This
                    apology, which speedily passed through several editions, he likewise published
                    in the Dutch language. The statements which it contains are such as could not be
                    refuted; and, instead of attempting a refutation, the states general condemned
                    it as a most injurious libel on the sovereign authority of the provinces, and on
                    the character of the prince of Orange: they commanded the author to be seized
                    where-ever he could be found, and, under the pain of death, prohibited their
                    subjects from having the book in their possession. The violence of these
                    denunciations induced him to address a <hi rend="italic">requête</hi> or
                    petition to the king, from whdm he obtained a formal letter of protection, dated
                    on the 26th of February 1623. During this year he published a work which he had
                    commenced at Lou vest ein: “Dicta Poetarum quae apud Joannem Stobaeum exstant,
                    emendata et Latino carmine reddita: accesserunt Plutarchi et Basilii Magni de
                    Usu Graecorum Poetarum.” Another of a similar description, and likewise begun in
                    this prison-house, appeared in 1626, under the title of “Excerpta ex Tragoediis
                    et Comoediis Graecis, tum quae exstant, tum quae perierunt, emendata et Latinis
                    versibus reddita.” Both these works were printed at Paris in quarto. Although
                    the order of chronology is not strictly preserved, it may here be proper to add,
                    that in 1630 he published, at the same place, but in an octavo form, “Euripidis
                    Tragoedia Phoenissae, emendata ex manuscriptis et Latina facta.” This edition,
                    which is dedicated to the president De Même, is unaccompanied with notes, but
                    contains copious prolegomena. His poetical version is inserted in the very
                    elaborate edition of Valckenaer, published at Franeker in the year 1755.</p>
                <p>The president had offered him the use of one of his country houses; and at that
                    of Balagni near Senlis he spent the spring and summer of 1623. Here he was
                    engaged in the composition of the greatest of all his works, his treatise on the
                    rights of war and peace. Here likewise he was visited by several men of eminent
                    learning, and, among others, by Saumaise and Rigaut, more extensively known by
                    the names of Salmasius and Rigaltius. In his literary researches he was greatly
                    benefited by the liberality of François de Thou, who inherited the magnificent
                    library of his father, and permitted Grotius to use it as his own. His wife had
                    occasion to visit Zeeland in the summer of 1624, and during her absence he was
                    attacked by a violent dysentery. On hearing of his illness, she was so much
                    affected that a * strong fever supervened; but as soon as it had abated, and
                    without waiting to recover her strength, she hastened to Paris, and by her
                    presence, as well as by her tender care, he was restored to health after a
                    dangerous malady of two months. His first labour after his convalescence was
                    upon his version of the Phoenissae, of which he had lost some portion before he
                    quitted his prison at the Hague. He next devoted himself to the completion of
                    his great work, which was printed at Paris in quarto in the year 1625: “De Jure
                    Belli ac Pacis libri tres.” The plan of such a treatise appears to have been
                    suggested to him by Pciresc,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    his peculiar powers of mind. This work, which he gratefully inscribed to Louis
                    the Thirteenth, was crowned with the most signal success: it has passed through
                    a great variety of editions, and has been translated into many different
                    languages; it was at once received as a standard production, and a mere
                    enumeration of the writers who have illustrated it with notes or commentaries,
                    would occupy no small space. It was speedily translated into the Dutch language.
                    A Swedish version was executed by the command of Gustavus Adolphus. It was
                    likewise translated into English. There are two French versions, by Courtin and
                    Barbeyrac; and a German version was published by Schütz, with a preface by C.
                    Thomasius. Of all these translators, Barbeyrac is the most celebrated. He was a
                    professor of law in the university of Groningen, and to his juridical knowledge
                    he added no inconsiderable fund of general erudition. The notes which accompany
                    his translation are for the most part able and judicious; and he likewise
                    published an edition of the original work, accompanied with Latin notes. Grotius
                    may justly be considered as the founder of a new science, that of the law of
                    nature and nations; for the subject is much more extensive than the title of his
                    book. His treatise <hi rend="italic">De Jure Belli</hi><hi rend="italic">ac
                    Pacis</hi> will never cease to be regarded as a singular monument of his genius
                    and learning. The previous labours of AlbericoGentili, and some other writers of
                    inferior note, had but little effect in smoothing his path; but the resources of
                    his own talents and erudition were not easily exhausted; and if he has not
                    produced a perfect work, he has at least produced a work which in many respects
                    is still unrivalled. “Grotius,” says Dr Smith, “seems to have been the first who
                    attempted to give the world any thing like a system of those principles which
                    ought to run through and be the foundation of the laws of all nations; and his
                    treatise of the laws of war and peace, with all its imperfections, is perhaps at
                    this day the most complete work that has yet been given upon this subject.”<note

                    supposed to be equally relished by readers of every denomination, but they
                    certainly are not without their attraction to readers of classical learning and
                    taste; and it is necessary to distinguish between such as are introduced to
                    prove particular facts, and such as are merely introduced for the purpose of
                    illustration. “Of what stamp,” it has been asked by Bentham, “are the works of
                    Grotius. Pufendorf, and Burlamaqui? Are they political or ethical, historical or
                    juridical, expository or censorial? Sometimes one thing, sometimes another: they
                    seem hardly to have settled the matter with themselves.” In these suggestions we
                    perceive nothing very ingenious or original. The principles of natural law are
                    closely blended with the principles of ethical science, nor is it easy to make
                    an entire separation between the general principles of law and politics; and
                    examples, drawn from the history of mankind in various stages of society, may
                    certainly find a suitable place in a work intended to illustrate the law of
                    nature and nations.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Leyden in the year 1627, and the subsequent editions of this work are very
                    numerous. It has been translated into almost all the cultivated languages of
                    Europe, and into various languages of Asia. An Arabic version was executed by
                    the learned Dr Pococke.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, his residence in France was not entirely free from inquietude
                    and mortifications. His pension had never been paid with any degree of
                    regularity; and when the entire management of the state was entrusted to
                    Cardinal de Richelieu, Grotius had too much self-respect to recommend himself to
                    the good graces of that haughty and unprincipled politician. The death of
                    Maurice prince of Orange, which took place on the 23d of April 1625, naturally
                    inspired him with the hope of returning to his native country. Four months after
                    that event, Hoogerbcetz was permitted to leave the fortress of Louve-stein, on
                    finding security, to the amount of twenty thousand florins, that he would not
                    quit the United Provinces; but this liberty he did not long enjoy, having died
                    in the space of about three weeks after he was released from confinement.
                    Grotius, who relied on the favourable disposition of the new stathouder
                    Frederick Henry, found that, his enemies being still numerous and powerful, his
                    return to Holland was opposed by many obstacles. An action at law however
                    enabled him to recover his property, which had been unduly confiscated. The
                    advice of his beloved wife, and the encouragement of some distinguished friends,
                    at length induced him to take the hazardous step of returning to a country in
                    which he had received such unworthy treatment. He began his journey in the month
                    of October 1631, and soon presented himself at Rotterdam, where he met with a
                    reception less favourable than his former services had led him to anticipate.
                    Before the close of the year he went to Amsterdam, and was there better
                    satisfied with his treatment; but no city ventured to offer him an asylum, and
                    he found himself environed with difficulties. Conscious of his innocence, he
                    felt the utmost repugnance to solicit a pardon from the states general, nor did
                    he seem to have any prospect of obtaining it without solicitation. With the view
                    of occupying himself till his fate should be decided, he adopted the resolution
                    of betaking himself to practice as a chamber-counsel; but all his plans were
                    speedily disconcerted by an ordinance of the states general, which commanded all
                    bailifs to use their endeavour to seize his person. To this ordinance, issued on
                    the 10th of December 1631. little attention was however paid; and on the 10th of
                    March 1632 it was followed by another, promising a reward of two thousand
                    florins to any person who should deliver him into the hands of justice, and
                    containing a threat of deprivation against any functionary who should neglect to
                    make the attempt. On the 17th of the same month he left Amsterdam, and, taking
                    the route of Germany, halted near the banks of the Elbe. Having spent a few
                    months in a pleasant district, he fixed his residence at Hamburg before the
                    close of the year. As he had not brought his books along with him, he was
                    greatly indebted to the liberality of Lindenborg, who allowed him the free use
                    of his library. Here he formed an intimacy with Salvius, vice-chancellor of
                    Sweden, who was skilled in literature as well as politics, and who himself
                    conceiving a high esteem for the illustrious exile, contributed to strengthen
                    -the favourable opinion already entertained by the grandchancellor Oxenstiern.
                    Gustavus Adolphus was solicitous to engage him in the service of the Swedish
                    crown, but his own brilliant career was arrested at the battle of Lützen, fought
                    on the 6th of November 1632. During the minority of his daughter Christina, the
                    kingdom was chiefly governed by Oxenstiern, one of the first characters of the
                    age. One anecdote of this great statesman deserves to be repeated. When his son
                    had expressed great diffidence in accepting of some public employment which was
                    offered to him, the chancellor rejoined, “Go, my son, and see with how little
                    wisdom the world is governed.” It appears that several other princes, and the
                    king of Denmark among the rest, had signified a wish to obtain the services of
                    Grotius, but he finally listened to the invitation of the Swedish chancellor; to
                    whom he first paid his respects at Frankfort on the Main in the month of May
                    1634, and experienced a very gracious reception. After a short interval he was
                    nominated ambassador to the court of France; and as he had now entered into the
                    service of another state, he thought it expedient to make a formal renunciation
                    of all connexion with his ungrateful country.</p>
                <p>About the beginning of the year 1635, he took his departure from Germany, and
                    soon arrived at St Denis; but it was not till the 2d of March that he made his
                    public entry into Paris. The important functions of an ambassador he appears to
                    have discharged with equal zeal and ability. The part which he had to perform
                    was attended with no inconsiderable difficulties. The death of the victorious
                    king of Sweden had necessarily impaired the national energies, and the arms of
                    the protestant confederates experienced a great reverse in Germany. It had
                    therefore become highly important to secure the aid of the French monarch
                    against the formidable power of the emperor; and Grotius laboured with great
                    assiduity and perseverance to fulfil his instructions, but was frequently
                    exposed to the mortification which an honest man must feel in his transactions
                    with mere politicians, who in all ages of the world have set honesty at open
                    defiance. The Swedish finances were at this period in an exhausted condition,
                    and his salary was but irregularly paid. Neither his public business nor private
                    mortifications impaired his ardent love of letters; and during his diplomatic
                    residence at Paris, he engaged in a great variety of literary pursuits. His
                    brief annotations on Tacitus, who was one of his favourite authors, <pb

                    edition printed at Leyden in the year 1640. Reverting to his juridical studies,
                    he published a volume of more than 400 pages, under the title, of “Florum
                    Sparsio ad Jus Justinianeum.” Paris. 1642, 4to. Of this work, which is still
                    prized by civilians,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Amsterdam in the course of the following year. It contains a series of
                    annotations on the body of the civil law, and, as the title suggests, many of
                    them are philological. He had long contemplated a poetical version of the
                    Anthology, a task sufficiently formidable; and at the beginning of the year 1645
                    he had brought it so near a conclusion that he sent a specimen to Bleau, an
                    eminent printer of Amsterdam; but as he soon afterwards quitted France, and did
                    not long survive, this work was not then conducted through the press, nor indeed
                    did it make its appearance till a very recent period. Another of his labours was
                    the history of the Goths, likewise a posthumous publication; and a more
                    considerable undertaking was the history of his native country, which was also
                    published after the death of the author. To this latter subject he had naturally
                    directed his attention on being appointed to the office of historiographer. In
                    the composition of such a work he appears to have been engaged so early as the
                    year 1614, but it had probably been laid aside during a long interval.</p>
                <p>At this busy era of his life he completed most of his theological works. The
                    publication in 1640 of his “Commentatio ad Loca quaedam Novi Testamenti quae de
                    Antichristo agunt aut agere putantur,” exposed him to many severe
                    animadversions. Here he endeavours to prove that the pope is not Antichrist, and
                    thus departs from the common opinion of protestants, an opinion which seems to
                    be placed on a very solid foundation. His work was immediately assailed by
                    Des-Marets, Du Moulin, Cocceius, and Slichtingius. The last of these writers was
                    a Socinian, and published his tract under the assumed name of Joannes
                    Simplicius.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sandii

                    first two Grotius replied in an appendix to a new edition; and Des-Marets, or
                    Maresius, who soon afterwards became professor of divinity at Groningen,
                    defended his own dissertation in a very copious work, entitled “Concordia
                    discors, et Antichristus revelatus; id est, Hugonis Grotii Apologia pro Papa et
                    Papismo modeste refutata.” Amst. 1642, 2 tom. 8vo. Jacobus Laurentius, a
                    clergyman of Amsterdam, likewise assailed him with great fierceness in a work of
                    which the title sufficiently indicates the scope and spirit. “FIugo Grotius
                    papizans: hoc est, Notae ad quaedam Loca in H. Grotii Appendice de Antichristo,
                    Papam Romanam, et Doctrinam ac Religionem papisticam spectantia, et in quibus
                    via sternitur ad Papismum Anti-Christianum.” Amst. 1642,8vo. The censure which
                    he had thus incurred did not prevent Grotius from publishing another volume of a
                    similar tendency: it bears the title of “Via ad Pacem Ecclesiasticam.” Amst.
                    1642, 8vo. His professed object is to effect what is manifestly impossible, to
                    conciliate the differences between the protestants and the papists. The
                    principal portion of the volume consists of Cassander’s consultation on the
                    articles of religion controverted between the two parties, with the annotations
                    of the editor subjoined. Both of them were men of a pacific spirit, and under
                    almost every form the love of peace is entitled to commendation; but to expect a
                    union of protestants with catholics, the parties still remaining catholics and
                    protestants, is certainly to expect what is morally impossible. Is an infallible
                    church to acknowledge itself guilty of error; or is a reformed church to stifle
                    the clearest convictions of which the intellect is susceptible, in order to gain
                    a hollow and miserable semblance of peace? Grotius, like Bishop Forbes and other
                    learned individuals, was led by the spirit of conciliation to make unwarrantable
                    concessions to the Romanists, not considering, what however was abundantly
                    obvious, that all concessions short of the most absolute submission, must prove
                    utterly unavailing. Beside the common bond of Christian charity, protestants can
                    have no spiritual union with catholics. One of the most extraordinary projects
                    of union was that which Dr Wake, archbishop of Canterbury, discussed with Du
                    Pin, an eminent doctor of. the Sorbonne.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Blackburne’s Confessional, p. lxxvi. 3d edit. Lond.
                    1770» 8vo.</p></note> This union was to proceed on the principle of the
                    respective churches of England and France retaining the greatest part of their
                    peculiar doctrines: what portion either the one or the other was expected to
                    relinquish, does not so clearly appear. Any advances from a poor protestant
                    church, especially if it had renounced the name and forms of episcopacy, would
                    probably have been received with abundant coldness; but this popish church was
                    sufficiently rich and splendid to attract the regard of a primate who evinced no
                    particular inclination to conciliate the English dissenters.</p>
                <p>On the religion of Grotius, the following epigram was written by Menage:</p>

                <p>Although he was completely entangled in the cobwebs of Arminianism, the charge of
                    Socinianism seems to be destitute of foundation, nor do poets very strictly
                    confine themselves to what is true or probable. But with respect to the claim of
                    the Romanists, it must be admitted to be somewhat more plausible. Grotius had
                    found an asylum in a catholic country: he may in some degree have been misled by
                    his respect for antiquity, and attracted by the splendour of the popish
                    hierarchy. He expressed a great veneration for the church of England, which has
                    likewise dazzled the eyes of more modern presbyterians. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Via ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Pacem</hi> was immediately attacked by several
                    antagonists, the most formidable of whom was André Rivet, professor of divinity
                    in the university of Leyden. Grotius defended himself in a work entitled “Votum
                    pro Pace Ecclesiastica,” printed in 1642, and Rivet rejoined in the course of
                    the following year. In 1645 Grotius published “Rivetiani Apologetici, pro
                    Schismate contra Votum Pacis facti, Discussio,” and in 1646 Rivet endeavoured to
                    assert the genuine peace of the church against suspicious mediators. Grotius was
                    about this period engaged in a theological undertaking of much greater
                    importance, namely, his annotations on the different books of the Old and New
                    Testaments. His notes on the·Old Testament and the Apocrypha were printed at
                    Paris in 1644, in three volumes folio. His notes on the gospels had been
                    published in the same form three years earlier, but the concluding portions of
                    this great work do not appear to have been printed before the year 1648. This is
                    one of the works which have chiefly recommended his name to posterity; and
                    writers of every denomination have agreed in ranking him among the ablest of
                    biblical critics. “The learning,” says Dr Campbell, “as well as the critical
                    acumen and ingenuity of Grotius, has stamped <pb break="no" facs="nls:193639186"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-9186-0007"/>a value upon his commentaries, especially on the
                    gospels, which has hardly been equalled by any that has come after him. Yet I am
                    far from saying he is to be followed implicitly. He has fallen into gross
                    mistakes, which men of much inferior genius have detected and avoided.”<note

                    interpretations, upon the comparison, above Dr Clarke’s. So far as I am able to
                    judge, Grotius explains texts better than the professed Socinians. The reason
                    may be, that he had more learning, and particularly was better acquainted with
                    the Jewish style. But I am apt to think their late writers have borrowed from
                    him, and improved by him.” (Letter on the Logos, p. 43.)</p></note></p>
                <p>After having long discharged the functions of an ambassador, he at length
                    solicited and obtained his recall. He had encountered many discouragements in
                    the course of his negotiations; and the arrival of a Swedish agent, of whom he
                    entertained a very unfavourable opinion, seems to have confirmed his wish to
                    retire. This agent was Μ. de Cerisante, the son of Dr Duncan, a learned Scotish
                    physician residing at Saumur. Having embarked at Dieppe, the ambassador landed
                    once more in his native country, and was received with due honour at Amsterdam.
                    He proceeded by sea to Hamburg, where he arrived about the middle of May 1645.
                    On reaching Stockholm, he was very graciously received by the queen, who made
                    him ample promises, and was anxious to retain him in her service. He could not
                    however be induced to fix his residence in Sweden; and having been presented
                    with a large sum of money, said to have amounted to twelve or thirteen thousand
                    imperial crowns, he sailed for the port of Lubeck on the 12th of August. The
                    vessel was speedily overtaken by a storm, and on the 17th was driven ashore
                    within fourteen German miles'of Dantzig. Travelling in an open carriage, he
                    arrived at Rostock on the 26th, being then in a very feeble and exhausted
                    condition. Here he had recourse to the aid of a physician, who speedily
                    perceived that his case was hopeless. On requesting the attendance of a
                    clergyman, he was visited by Quistorpius, professor of divinity in the
                    university of Rostock, who has left an account of his last hours,<note

                    12mo. Next appeared “Historia Gotthorum, Vandalorum, et Langobardorum, partim
                    versa, partim in ordinem digesta.” Amst. 1655, 8vo. His history of his native
                    country was published not long afterwards: “Annales et Historiae de Rebus
                    Belgicis.” Amst. 1656, fol. Amst. 1658, 12mo. This very title at once suggests
                    Tacitus as the writer’s model, and his style is evidently formed on that of the
                    ancient historian. Whether this model was judiciously selected, may perhaps
                    admit of some doubt. Such a style necessarily partakes of the enigmatical; and
                    what may be admired in Tacitus is not so easily relished in his imitators.
                    Notwithstanding the grievous injuries which he had sustained from Prince
                    Maurice, he had the magnanimity to do justice to his character in this
                    work.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Gibbon has justly

                    by Salmasius under the assumed name of Simplicius Verinus. A very ample and
                    interesting collection of his letters, consisting of nearly one thousand pages
                    in double columns, was published by two of his grandsons: “Epistolae quotquot
                    reperiri potuerunt; in quibus praeter hactenus editas, plurimae theologici,
                    juridici, philologici, historici, et politici argumenti occurrunt.” Amst. 1687,
                    fol. The poetical version of the Anthology, on which he had bestowed so much
                    labour, was not communicated to the public till a century and a half after his
                    death. The manuscript at length came into the possession of De Bosch, a man of
                    learning and taste, who published the work in a splendid form, and added copious

                    integrity of his character, and the generosity of his sentiments. That he had
                    acquired uncommon stores of variegated learning, it seems scarcely necessary to
                    state in formal terms, after the details which have already been given; and it
                    was accompanied with those vigorous powers of mind, without which, learning
                    cannot be rendered very available. He was a man of original genius, aided by
                    unwearied industry. As a philosophical jurist, he has no equal, and among
                    historians he occupies a high rank. His merits as a theologian have been amply
                    acknowledged by writers of every communion. As a Latin poet, he is to be classed
                    among the best of the moderns, and his talents as a commentator on the ancient
                    classics are of no mean order. W <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> hat individual

                <p>His wife, who lived to deplore his loss, had borne him three sons and three
                    daughters. The eldest and the youngest of his sons, Cornelis and Diederik,
                    followed the profession of arms, without obtaining any considerable promotion.
                    Pieter, the second son, having chosen the profession of an advocate, became
                    pensionary of Amsterdam, and was employed as an ambassador to Sweden and France.
                    The only daughter who survived their father was the eldest, named Cornelia,
                    married to Jean Barthon, vicote de Mombas, a nobleman of Poitou.</p>
                <p>Gulielmus Grotius, or Willem de Groot, the brother of this illustrious man, must
                    not be passed in total silence. Being bred to the legal profession, he became
                    eminent at the bar, and was appointed advocate to the East India <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193639199" xml:id="kp-eb0711-9199-0008"/>Company. He was likewise a
                    man of erudition, and the author of several works. One of these is an
                    “Enchiridion de Principiis Juris Naturalis,” in which he illustrates the
                    principles of a science that was so deeply indebted to another member of the
                    same family. Another of his works, which was published after his death, and
                    which is still held in great estimation by civilians, bears the title of “Vitae
                    Jurisconsultorum quorum in Pandectis extant Nomina.” Lugd. Bat. 1690, 4to. He
                    appears to have been a most affectionate brother, and to have sympathized very
                    deeply in the fortunes of a kinsman whose moral and intellectual endowments
                    reflected so much lustre on the family to which he belonged. (x.)</p>
