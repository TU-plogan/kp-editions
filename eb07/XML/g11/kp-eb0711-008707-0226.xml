                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">GURWAL</label>, a province of Northern Hindustan, situated at
                    the foot of the Himalaya Mountains, principally between the thirtieth and
                    thirty-first degrees of north latitude. The great Himalaya range separates it
                    from Thibet on the north; on the south it has the plain of the Ganges; to the
                    east the Dauli, Alacananda, and Ramgunga rivers; andtothe west the Jumna. It
                    comprehends an area of9000 square miles. This country formerly included the
                    province of Kemaon; and in 1814 the Ghoorkhas had possession of the whole tract
                    which extended northward to the dependencies of China. Since the country was
                    conquered by the British, it has been divided into two distinct portions, the
                    British government having retained possession of the Dcyrah Doone, the passes of
                    the Ganges and Jumna, at either extremity of that valley, as also all the
                    country to the eastward of the Alacananda and Bhagirathi, which last tract has
                    been annexed to Kemaon, and the remainder restored to the expatriated rajah. The
                    present boundaries, therefore, of his territories are the Alacananda, from
                    Rudraprayag until its conjunction with the Bhagirathi, and thence to the plains
                    by the united streams of the Ganges, and above Rudraprayag, where the Alacananda
                    receives the Mandakini by the latter river. The territory to the east of that
                    line has been permanently annexed to Kemaon. This country being the commencement
                    of the Himalaya Mountains, presents to the southward, towards Lolldong, an
                    assemblage of hills jumbled together in many forms and directions; sometimes in
                    chains lying parallel to each other, but of no great extent, and often connected
                    at their termination by narrow ridges running across the valleys at right
                    angles. The summits of all are usually narrow, and of various shapes, and the
                    distance between each other short; and so confined are the valleys, that it is
                    scarcely possible within their narrow limits to accommodate a corps of 1000 men.
                    These ranges are occasionally covered with trees; others are naked and stony,
                    affording shelter for neither birds nor beasts. On the eastern borders of this
                    province, amongst the lower ranges of the mountains, are extensive forests of
                    oak, holly, horse-chestnut, and fir; and beds of strawberries are also seen
                    (denoting the temperate nature of the climate), which equal in flavour those of
                    Europe. From Lolldong to the Ganges the country forms, with very little
                    interruption, a continued chain of woody <pb break="no" facs="nls:193640239"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-0239-0088"/>hills, which extend eastward to an indefinite
                    extent. The elephant abounds in these forests, but is greatly inferior in size
                    and strength to the Chittagong elephant, on which account it is seldom
                    domesticated. On the eastern borders there are hill pheasants among the
                    mountains, which seldom, however, venture into the valleys, unless compelled by
                    heavy falls of snow. A small portion of the country is only cultivated, a great
                    proportion being left in the undisturbed possession of the wild animals. Gurwal
                    is tolerably well watered by the head streams of the Ganges. The Bhagirathi and
                    Alacananda, whose junction forms this great river, are the largest streams in
                    the country. The Bilhang, which falls into the Bhagirathi, the Mandakini, the
                    Finden, the Mandaioki, the Birke, and <hi rend="subscript"> +</hi> the Dauli,
                    all of which join the Alacananda, maybe considered as streams of the second
                    order. Most of these streams have their sources in the Himalaya Mountains; the
                    Dauli penetrates these mountains, and is the remotest source of the Ganges. None
                    of them are fordable; and they are crossed by rope and platform bridges, at the
                    most convenient points of communication, the rocks and stones which encumber
                    their channel preventing the use of boats. The roads are merely foot-paths,
                    carried along the slope of a mountain in the direction of the principal streams
                    and watercourses. Those leading to Bhadrinath are annually repaired for the
                    accommodation of pilgrims, who congregate in great numbers at this sacred
                    resort; but they are almost impracticable for cattle. This province abounds with
                    celebrated places of worship, which have been held sacred for many ages,
                    although the conversion of the inhabitants to the Brahminical faith is not of
                    any very ancient date. Four of the five places noted for the holy junctions of
                    rivers, and celebrated for their sanctity, are within the limits of this
                    province.</p>
                <p>Gurwal was a dependent province on some of the neighbouring and more powerful
                    hill states until the reign of Mohiput Shah, who declared himself independent,
                    and built Serinagur, where he resided. His son was his successor, and he was
                    succeeded by his uncle’s son, who considerably extended the Gurwal territories
                    to the north, penetrating into Thibet, and exacting a tribute from the rajah of
                    Deba, which continues to the present day. Gurwal was subdued by the Nepaulese
                    about the year 1803. The rajah sold the family throne for 150,000 rupees, and
                    retired into the British territories, where, having raised some troops, he
                    returned and fought a battle with the invaders of his territories, in which he
                    was defeated and slain. After the country was conquered by the British in 1814,
                    part of his dominions, with a revenue of 40,000 rupees, was restored to the
                    rajah. But Serinagur, the chief town, is within the territory reserved by the
                    British. The rajah has consequently fixed his residence at Bara-haut, where the
                    details of his civil government are conducted by his own officers, and he is
                    under the protection of the British government. The district over which he rules
                    was estimated by the Nepaulese, when they were in possession of the country, to
                    contain 25,720 inhabitants; a very scanty population for so extensive, and in
                    many places so fertile, a tract of country. (See Buchanan’s <hi rend="italic"
