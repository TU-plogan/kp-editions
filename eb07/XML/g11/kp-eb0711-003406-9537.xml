                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">GUN</label>. The word gun includes most of the species of
                    fire-arms; pistols and mortars being almost the only ones excepted from this
                    denomination. They are divided into τreat and small guns; the former including
                    what we commonly call cannon, ordnance, or artillery; the latter muskets,
                    carabines, musketoons, blunderbusses, fowling-pieces, and the like. Great guns
                    were those first used. They were originally made of iron bars soldered together,
                    and fortified with strong iron hoops; some of which are still to be seen. Others
                    were made of thin sheets of iron rolled up together and hooped; and on
                    emergencies they were made of leather, with plates of iron or copper. These
                    pieces were made in a rude and imperfect manner, like the first essays of many
                    new inventions. Stone balls were thrown out of them, and a small quantity of
                    powder was used, on account of the weakness of their construction. These pieces
                    had no ornaments, were placed on their carriages by rings, and were of a
                    cylindrical form. When or by whom guns were first made is uncertain. At the
                    siege of Claudia Jessa, now called <hi rend="italic">Chioggia,</hi> in 1366, the
                    Venetians used cannon, which were brought thither by two Germans, with some
                    powder and leaden balls; and they had likewise recourse to the same engines in
                    their wars with the Genoese in 1379. Edward III. made use of cannon at the
                    battle of Cressy in 1346, and at the siege of Calais in 1347. Cannon were
                    employed by the Turks at the siege of Constantinople in 1394, and in that of
                    1452; these guns threw a ball of 100 lbs., but they generally burst at the
                    first, second, or third discharge. Louis XII. had a cannon of the same size cast
                    at Tours, which threw a ball from the Bastille to Charenton.</p>
                <p>Formerly cannon were dignified with uncommon names. In 1503 Louis XII. had twelve
                    brass cannon, of an extraordinary size, called after the twelve peers of France.
                    The Spaniards and Portuguese named them after their saints. At present cannon
                    take their names from the weight of the ball they discharge. Thus a piece which
                    discharges a ball of twenty-four pounds is called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >twenty-four pounder.</hi></p>
                <p>Mortars are supposed to have been fully as ancient as cannon. They were employed
                    in the wars of Italy to throw balls of red-hot iron, stones, and the like, long
                    before the invention of shells. The latter are believed to be of German
                    invention, and the use of them in war was taught by accident. A citizen of
                    Venlo, at a certain festival celebrated in honour of the Duke of Cleves, threw a
                    number of shells, one of which fell on a house and set fire to it, by which
                    misfortune the greater part of the town was reduced to ashes. The first account
                    of shells used for military purposes is in 1435, when Naples was besieged by
                    Charles VIII. History informs us with more certainty that shells were thrown out
                    of mortars at the siege of Wachtendonk in Guelderland, in 1588. Malter, an
                    English engineer, first taught the French the art of throwing shells, which they
                    practised at the siege of Motte in 1634. The method of throwing red-hot balls
                    out of mortars was first put in practice at the siege of Stralsund in 1675, by
                    the elector of Brandenburg; though some say in 1653, at the siege of Bremen.</p>
                <p>Muskets were first used at the siege of Rhege in the year 1521. The Spaniards
                    were the first who armed part of their foot with these weapons. At first they
                    were very heavy, and could not be used without a rest. They had matchlocks, and
                    did execution at a great distance. On their march the soldiers carried only the
                    rest and ammunition, and had boys to bear their muskets after them. They were
                    very slow in loading, not only by reason of the unwieldiness of their pieces,
                    and because they carried the powder and ball separate, but from the time it took
                    to prepare and adjust the match. But a lighter matchlock-musket afterwards came
                    into use; and the musketeers carried their ammunition in bandeliers, to which
                    were hung several little cases of wood covered with leather, each containing a
                    charge of powder. The balls were carried loose in a pouch, and a priming-horn
                    was suspended by the side. The muskets with rests were used as late as the
                    beginning of the civil wars in the time of Charles I. The lighter kind succeeded
                    them, and continued till the beginning of last century, when they were also
                    disused, and the troops throughout Europe armed with firelocks.</p>
