                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">GYMNOSOPHISTS</label>, a set of Indian philosophers, famous
                    in antiquity. The word is formed from the Greek, <hi rend="italic"
                    >γ&gt;μvο6οφusrrις,</hi> a sophist or philosopher who goes naked.</p>
                <p>This name was applied to the Indian philosophers, whom the excessive heat of the
                    country obliged to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> naked; as that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Peripatetics</hi> was given to those who philosophised walking. The
                    Gymnosophists, however, did not go absolutely naked, but only clothed themselves
                    no further than modesty required. There were some of these sages in Africa; but
                    the most celebrated were those of India. The African Gymnosophists dwelt upon a
                    mountain in Ethiopia, near the Nile, and did not form themselves into societies,
                    like those of India; but each had his private recess, where he studied and
                    performed his devotions by himself. If any person had by chance killed another,
                    he applied to these sages for absolution, and submitted to whatever penances
                    they enjoined. They observed an extraordinary frugality, and lived only upon the
                    fruits of the earth. Lucan ascribes to these Gymnosophists several new
                    discoveries in astronomy.</p>
                <p>As to the Indian Gymnosophists, they dwelt in die woods, where they lived upon
                    the wild products of the earth, and never either drank wine or married. Some of
                    them practised <pb break="no" facs="nls:193640356" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0356-0097"
                    />physic, travelled from one place to another, and were particularly famous for
                    their remedies against barrenness. Others pretended to practise magic, and to
                    foretell future events.</p>
                <p>In general, however, the Gymnosophists were wise and learned men; for their
                    maxims and discourses, recorded by historians, do not in the least savour of a
                    barbarous education, but are plainly the result of great sense and deep thought.
                    They kept up the dignity of their character to such a degree, that they never
                    waited upon any one, not even upon princes. They believed the immortality and
                    transmigration of the soul; they placed the chief happiness of man in a contempt
                    of the goods of fortune and of the pleasures of sense; and they gloried in
                    having given faithful and disinterested counsels to princes and magistrates. It
                    is said, that when they became old and infirm, they threw themselves into a pile
                    of burning wood, in order to prevent the miseries of advanced age. One of them,
                    named Calanus, burned himself in the presence of Alexander the Great.</p>
                <p>Apuleius thus describes the Gymnosophists: “They are all devoted to the study of
                    wisdom, both the older masters and the younger pupils; and what to me appears
                    the most amiable thing in their character is, that they have an aversion to
                    idleness and indolence. Accordingly, as soon as the table is spread, before a
                    bit of victuals be brought, the youths are called together from their several
                    places and offices, and the masters examine them what good they have Ione since
                    the sunrise. Here one relates something he has iiscovered by meditation; another
                    has learned something ay demonstration; and as for those who have nothing to
                    fliege why they should dine, they are turned out to work Pasting.”</p>
