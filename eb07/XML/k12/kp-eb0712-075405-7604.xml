                <p><label type="entry">KOEMPFER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Engelbert</hi></label>, was
                    born in 1651 at Lemgow, in Westphalia. After studying in several towns, he went
                    to Dantzig, where he gave the first public specimen of his proficiency, in a
                    dissertation <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Majestatis
                    Divisione.</hi> He then w ʹ ent to Thorn, and thence proceeded to the university
                    of Cracow, where he took his degree of doctor in philosophy; after which he went
                    to Königsberg in Prussia, and staid there four years. He next travelled into
                    Sweden, where he soon began to make a figure, and was appointed secretary of the
                    embassy to the sophi of Persia. He set out from Stockholm with the presents for
                    that emperor, and went through Aaland, Finland, and Ingermanland, to Narva,
                    where he met Mr Fabricius the ambassador, who had been ordered to take Moscow in
                    his way. The ambassador having ended his negotiations at the Russian court, set
                    out for Persia. During their stay two years at Ispahan, Dr Koempfer, whose
                    curious and inquisitive disposition suffered nothing to escape him unobserved,
                    took all the advantage possible of remaining so long in the capital of the
                    Persian empire. When, towards the close of 1685, the ambassador prepared to
                    return into Europe, Dr Koempfer chose rather to enter into the service of the
                    Dutch East India Company, in quality of chief surgeon to the fleet, then
                    cruising in the Persian Gulf. He w ent on board the fleet, which, after touching
                    at many Dutch settlements, reached Batavia in September 1689. Dr Koempfer here
                    applied himself chiefly to natural history. From Batavia he set out for Japan,
                    in quality of physician to the embassy which the Dutch East India Company send
                    once a year to the Japanese court. He quitted Japan to return to Europe in 1692.
                    In 1694 he took his degree of doctor of physic at Leyden; on which occasion he
                    communicated, in what are called <hi rend="italic">Inaugural Theses,</hi> ten
                    very singular and curious observations made by him in foreign countries. He
                    intended to digest his memoirs into proper order, but was prevented by being
                    made physician to the Count la Lippe. He died in 1716. His principal works are,
                    1. <hi rend="italic">Åmaenitates Exoticae,</hi> in 4to, a work including many
                    curious and useful particulars in relation to the civil and natural history of
                    the countries through which he passed; 2. <hi rend="italic">Herbarium
                    Ultra-</hi><hi rend="italic">Gangeticum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> 3. The
                    History of Japan, in German, for which the public is indebted to Sir Hans
                    Sloane, who purchased for a considerable sum of money all our author’s
                    curiosities, both natural and artificial, as likewise all his drawingsand
                    manuscript memoirs, and prevailed on Dr Scheuchzer to translate the Japanese
                    history into English.</p>
