                    commanding a view as far south as the Lammermuir Hills; and the hill of Fare,
                    the scene of the battle of Carrichie, in 1562, between the Earls of Murray and
                    Huntly, when the latter was slain.</p>
                <p>The only streams deserving the name of rivers are, the Dee, which, as before
                    mentioned, flows through the northern part of Kincardineshire for nine or ten
                    miles, and forms the boundary for thirteen miles between this county and
                    Aberdeenshire; and the North Esk, which divides Kincardineshire from Forfarshire
                    on the south and west. The other streams are the Cowie, the Carron, and the
                    Bervie, which fall into the German Ocean; the Luther, which joins the river
                    North Esk; the Dye, the Avon, the Feugh, the Canny, and the Shiach, whose waters
                    run into the Dee. These streams, although of inconsiderable magnitude, abound
                    with trout and par; and their banks, with the adjoining braes and overhanging
                    trees, are, in many places, highly picturesque and beautiful. There are no lakes
                    of magnitude in this county. The Loch of Leys is the largest, being about two
                    miles in circumference, and well stored with pike. In this lake are the ruins of
                    an ancient edifice, built upon an artificial island, supported by piles of
                    oak.</p>
                <p>The wild animals found in this county are, the fox, the badger, the otter, the
                    wild cat, the polecat, the weasel, and the hedgehog. Roe-deer are frequently
                    found in the woods, and hares and rabbits are incredibly numerous. The muirs
                    abound with grouse, and black game is not uncommon. Wild geese, and occasionally
                    swans, are seen about the beginning of winter. Woodcock, snipe, wild duck,
                    partridge, plover, curlew, heron, teal, and landrail, are common. Pheasants have
                    been introduced, and their numbers are increasing. The sparrow-hawk and the
                    falcon are frequently met with. There are but few reptiles. Adders are
                    occasionally seen in the hilly districts. Seals breed in the caverns along the
                    coast.</p>
                <p>No coal has yet been discovered; but limestone is found in several places; at
                    Tilly whilly, in the Dee-side district; near Fettercairn, in the Howe of the
                    Mearns; and at Mathers, on the Coast-side; from which last place limeshells are
                    sold in considerable quantity, both for building and for manure. Native iron has
                    also been found in a field at Balnakettle; and indications of iron ore are met
                    with in various parts of the county. Granite, basalt, whinstone, sandstone, and
                    plum-pudding stone, are the prevailing kinds, of rock. Blocks of granite are
                    scattered over the surface in the neighbourhood of the Grampians, both of a
                    whitish colour like the granite of Aberdeen, and of a reddish colour like that
                    of Peterhead. Part of the granite exported from Aberdeen is taken from the hill
                    of Nigg in this county. At Stonehaven and at Laurieston, in the Coast-side
                    district, quarries of sandstone afford excellent and durable materials for
                    building. At Whistleberry, in the parish of Kinneff, millstones of valuable
                    quality are manufactured from the pudding-rock found on the sea-coast. Jasper,
                    quartz, and porphyry, are likewise found in many places; and specimens of
                    asbestos have been found at Balnakettle. Zeolite is also found; and some of the
                    caverns upon the shores near Stonehaven abound with stalactites. Pebbles of
                    great variety and beauty of colour are found in many parts of the county,
                    particularly in the parishes of Arbuthnot and St Cyrus. Scotch topazes, or
                    cairngorums, are sometimes found in the mountain-streams of the Grampians. In
                    the neighbourhood of Cowie, pipe-clay is dug, and sold for household
                    purposes.</p>
                <p>The towns and villages in Kincardineshire are more numerous than important.
                    Stonehaven, the county town, is situated in a fine bay at the confluence of the
                    waters of the Cowie and Canon, nearly midway between Aberdeen and Montrose, and
                    contains upwards of 3000 inhabitants. The harbour, lately improved at an expense
                    of L.8000, is more accessible than almost any harbour on the eastern coast. The
                    sheriff and other county courts have been held at Stonehaven since 1660, when
                    they were transferred by act of parliament from Kincardine, then the county
                    town, by reason, as the act states, that in that town, “there was neither ane
                    tolbuith, nor any house for parties to lodge into for their entertainment.”
                    Inverbervie is the only royal burgh within the county, and contains about 900
                    inhabitants. Johnshaven, four miles south of Inverbervie, contains a population
                    of upwards of 1000. Laurencekirk, celebrated for its elegant manufacture of
                    snuff-boxes, contains nearly 1400 inhabitants. Luther-muir, a manufacturing
                    village, which has sprung up∙within these few years in the parish of Marykirk,
                    has acquired a population of about 700 souls. The village of Banchory,
                    beautifully situated on the north bank of the Dee, is rapidly increasing in
                    size. The other villages in the inland part of the county are Drumlithie,
                    Auchinblae, Fettercairn, Marykirk, and St Cyrus. Along the coast there are
                    thirteen or fourteen fishing villages, inhabited by about 1500 individuals,
                    solely supported by catching and curing fish. Of these villages, Findon is
                    celebrated for its haddocks, prepared in a manner peculiar to this district.</p>
                <p>The climate of Kincardineshire is different in the different districts of the
                    county. In the mountainous parts, the weather, in winter and spring, is
                    excessively severe. The climate in the low country has of late years been
                    meliorated by the increase of wood and the draining of bogs and mosses, and is
                    not inferior to the climate of other parts of Scotland in nearly the same
                    latitude.</p>
                <p>The elegant mansions of many of the proprietors, erected in the finest situations
                    on their estates, and generally surrounded by trees, add much to the beauty and
                    cheerfulness of the country. The principal country-seats are Inglismaldie, one
                    of the seats of the Earl of Kintore; Arbuthnot House, the seat of Viscount
                    Arbuthnot; Fasque, Mr Gladstoun; Durris, Mr Mactier; Fetteresso Castle, Mr Duff;
                    Crathes, Sir Robert Burnett; Fettercairn House, Sir John Stuart Forbes;
                    Drumtochty Castle, Mr Gam-mell; Ury, Captain Barclay; Netherley, Mr Silver;
                    Dunnottar House, General Forbes. The farm-houses throughout the county have,
                    during the last fifty years, been greatly improved; and many of them are not
                    only commodious, but handsome. The steadings of offices have also of late been
                    much improved. The mode of living, both of the landlords and tenants,
                    corresponds with their enlarged and improved accommodation. It may be doubted,
                    however, whether the custom, now adopted in many places, of lodging the farming
                    servants in <hi rend="italic">bothies,</hi> out of the family, has a tendency to
                    add either to their comfort or good conduct.</p>
                <p>In 1807, this county was divided amongst eighty proprietors. The number of
                    separate estates is now eighty-three. Some of the larger estates have long been
                    in the same families; but within the last fifty years one half of the land has
                    changed hands, some of it two or three times. Of the present proprietors,
                    twenty-seven are resident in the county<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192947188?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-7188-0722"/>; the others
                    are absentees, or only resident occasionally. Of the estates, two or three are
                    above L.5000 of yearly rent; nine or ten above L.8000, and under L.5000; about
                    twenty from L.1000 to L.3000; twenty-three from L.500 to L.1000; and the rest
                    under L.500. The valued rent is L.74,921. Is. 4d. Scots. The real rent,
                    according to the property-tax returns in 1815, was L.94,861 sterling. Those
                    returns, however, must have been considerably under the truth; and the real rent
                    of the county cannot at present, according to a moderate calculation, be less
                    than L. 120,000.</p>
                <p>The farms in the cultivated districts are in general under 200 acres in extent.
                    Many do not extend to more than thirty or forty acres, and others are still
                    smaller. In the hilly districts the pasture farms are necessarily of much
                    greater extent. A considerable proportion in number of the tenants pay less than
                    L.50 a year of rent each; but the number of small tenants will no.doubt be
                    lessened, through the operation of the act for reforming the parliamentary
                    representation.</p>
                <p>During the present century, agricιdture in this county has made great progress.
                    The example of improvement on a great scale was set by the late Robert Barclay
                    Allar-dice of Ury, who, as stated by Sir John Sinclair, in his Statistical
                    Analysis, “is entitled to have his name transmitted to posterity as the first,
                    the most extensive, and the most systematical improver of land in the north of
                    Scotland.” The improvements begun in the latter part of-the last century have
                    been continued with much spirit down to the present time; and the greater part
                    of the arable land of the county is now managed according to the most approved
                    systems of modern husbandry, producing wheat, barley, bear, oats, peas, beans,
                    clover, and turnips. Mangel-wurzel and ruta-baga are also cultivated.
                    Improvements by draining, trenching, planting, and enclosing, are at present in
                    progress on different estates to a considerable extent, especially the estate of
                    Kingcausie, and on the extensive estate of Durris since the latter became the
                    property of the present proprietor, Mr Mactier. Great facility has been given to
                    agricultural improvements, by making new roads. There are now in this small
                    county about eighty miles of turnpike road, which, with the other roads of
                    communication, afford easy access to every part of the county. Lime, since the
                    county was opened up by good roads, has been used as a manure to a great extent,
                    upwards of 20,000 bolls being yearly imported at Stonehaven alone for that
                    purpose. Both the improvement of land and the breed of stock have been
                    encouraged by premiums given by agricultural associations. On almost every farm,
                    the rearing and feeding of cattle is united with the raising of corn; and in
                    some parts of the county the tenants depend more on cattle than on corn for the
                    payment of their rents. The kinds of stock reared are the same as in the
                    adjoining counties of Aberdeen and Forfar. The pure short-horn breed has been
                    introduced by Captain Barclay of Ury, whose superior stock, both of cattle and
                    sheep, is well known. In the mountainous district the pasturage of sheep is
                    extensive, almost uniformly of the black-faced species. Pigs have of late years
                    been fed in almost every part of the county, with advantage to the farmers.
                    Butter and cheese, especially the former, are made to a greater extent than the
                    home supply requires. On some farms cheese is made equal in quality to the best
                    Stilton. The cheese made at Canterland is well known, and highly prized.</p>
                <p>There are no extensive manufactures in Kincardineshire. At Stonehaven the woollen
                    manufacture is carried on upon a small scale, and there are two flax-spinning
                    mills. There are also mills for spinning flax at Bervie, Auchinblae, and
                    Caldhame. There is an extensive whisky-distillery at Glenury; and porter and ale
                    are brewed both at Stonehaven and Laurencekirk. Kelp is manufactured on the
                    sea-coast. There is little direct foreign commerce, the inhabitants being
                    supplied with articles of foreign produce through Aberdeen and Montrose. The
                    principal articles of export are grain, potatoes, cattle, pork, butter, and
                    eggs. Whisky and ale are also exported; and, in 1827, there was an exportation
                    of herrings from Stonehaven, to the extent of 3500 barrels. Since that time the
                    herring fishery has not been successfully, perhaps because not vigorously,
                    prosecuted. The principal exportation of grain from the county is at the port of
                    Montrose; but the exportation at the small port of Gourdon now amounts to about
                    20,000 quarters annually; and nearly that quantity was last year exported at
                    Stonehaven. The principal articles of direct import are lime, coals, timber,
                    slates, and salt. Two banking establishments have branches at the county
                    town.</p>
                <p>Kincardineshire contains eighteen entire parishes, and parts of three other
                    parishes. The thirteen parishes in the south part of the county form the
                    presbytery of Fordoun; the rest are attached to the presbyteries of Kincardine
                    O’Neil and Aberdeen. The places of worship within the county are, nineteen
                    parish churches, two chapels of ease connected with the establishment, four
                    chapels of the Scotch Episcopal communion, three of the United Associate Synod,
                    three of the Congregational Union, one of the Berean communion, one of the
                    Wesleyan Methodists, and one Roman Catholic chapel; the last being connected
                    with the Roman Catholic college at Blairs, where the chapel is situated.
                    According to the returns made in consequence of the resolution of the House of
                    Commons, 3d April 1835, the number of “examinable persons” belonging to the
                    established churches was 19,539; and of those belonging to the other religious
                    denominations 1975. The poor of this county are supported by voluntary
                    contributions; no legal assessment for the support of the poor has yet been
                    made.</p>
                <p>The county of Kincardine, before the union, returned two members to parliament;
                    it now returns one member. The number of voters forming the constituency,
                    according to the corrected lists of 1835, is 910, of whom seventy-two are
                    freeholders from the old roll, forty county proprietors not formerly enrolled,
                    581 agricultural tenants, 195 town and village proprietors and householders, ten
                    parochial clergymen, and twelve parish schoolmasters. In conjunction with
                    Forfarshire, this county furnishes a regiment of militia, and it raised by
                    itself a regiment of local militia, containing 816 men. Along the coast there
                    are three preventive or coastguard stations, with suitable accommodation for the
                    officers and men, erected by government. Smuggling, formerly prevalent to a
                    considerable extent, is at present unknown.</p>
                <p>Amongst the remains of antiquity in Kincardineshire, the most conspicuous is
                    Dunnottar Castle, formerly the principal seat of the earls marisehal, now an
                    extensive ruin. It is built on a high peninsular rock, projecting into the
                    German Ocean, about a mile south from Stonehaven. The regalia of Scotland were
                    deposited in this castle for safety in the time of the commonwealth. The ruins
                    of the Castle of Fenella, with the remains of a vitrified wall, are still to be
                    seen near Fettercairn. Part of the Kame of Mathers, an ancient place of
                    strength, pitched like an eagle’s nest on the point of a projecting rock, in the
                    parish of St Cyrus, still remains for the inspection of the lover of antiquity.
                    Green Castle, Whistleberry Castle, the Castle of Morphie, the Castle of Kinneff,
                    the Thane of Cowie’s Castle, and the Castle of Kincardine, are yet pointed out
                    to visitors, or rather, in regard to some of them, the ground on which they
                    stood, for the vestiges of these edifices are now nearly obliterated. Near the
                    mansion-house of Fordoun are to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192947201?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-7201-0723"/> be seen the
                    remains of a Roman camp. In the vicinity of Stonehaven, traces of a Roman
                    encampment are also observable; and at Raedykes, about three miles inland, an
                    ancient camp, whether Roman or Caledonian it is difficult to say, is distinctly
                    marked by an extensive foss, and wall or embankment. Here was dug up some years
                    ago a chariot wheel composed entirely of massive iron. On the hill of Garvock is
                    pointed out the Sheriff’s Kettle, where the sheriff of the Mearns was boiled in
                    a caldron by certain of the barons of the county, in the reign of James I.
                    Druidical circles of rude stones are also to be seen at Auquhorthies, and on the
                    hill of Garrol, upon the estate of Durris.</p>
                <p>Amongst the celebrated writers connected with this county may be mentioned Dr
                    Arbuthnot, Barclay, the author of the Apology, Bishop Burnett, Lord Monboddo, Dr
                    Reid, and Dr Beattie.</p>
                <p>The population of the county in 1811, 1821, and 1831, is shown in the following
                    table. The total population in the last-mentioned year amounted to 31,431, of
                    which number the towns and villages contained nearly one third. In 1831, the
                    agricultural male servants were 2147 in number; other male servants 109, and
                    female servants 2246. The population from 1801 to 1811 increased at the rate of
                    four per cent.; from 1811 to 1821, at the rate of five per cent.; and from 1821
                    to 1831, at the rate of eight per cent.</p>
