                <p><label type="entry">KING</label>, a monarch or potentate who rules singly over a
                    people. Camden derives the word from the Saxon <hi rend="italic">cyning,</hi>
                    which signifies the same thing; and that from <hi rend="italic">can,</hi> power,
                    or <hi rend="italic">ken,</hi> knowledge, with which every monarch is supposed
                    to be invested. The Latin <hi rend="italic">rex,</hi> the Scythian <hi

                    rend="italic">rey,</hi> and French <hi rend="italic">roi,</hi> come all,
                    according to Postel, from the Hebrew <hi rend="smallcaps">באש,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">rosch,</hi> signifying chief, head. Kings were not known amongst
                    the Israelites till the reign of Saul. Before his time they were governed at
                    first by elders, as in Egypt; next by princes of God’s appointment, as Moses and
                    Joshua; then by judges till the time of Samuel; and lastly, by kings. Most of
                    the Grecian states were governed at first by kings, who were chosen by the
                    people to decide differences, and to execute a power which was limited by laws.
                    They commanded armies, presided over the worship of the gods, and executed other
                    functions. This royalty was generally hereditary; but if the vices of the heir
                    to the crown were odious to the people, or if the oracle had so commanded, he
                    was cut off from the right of succession; yet the kings were supposed to hold
                    their sovereignty by the appointment of Jupiter. The ensign of majesty was the
                    sceptre, which· was made of wood adorned with studs of gold, and ornamented at
                    the top with some figure, commonly that of an eagle, as being the bird of Jove.
                    At first Rome was also governed by kings, who were elected by the people, with
                    the approbation of the senate and concurrence of the augurs. Their power
                    extended to religion, the revenues, the army, and the administration of justice.
                    The monarchical form of government subsisted 244 years in Rome, under seven
                    kings, the last of whom was Tarquinius Superbus. Amongst the Greeks the king of
                    Persia had anciently the appellation of the Great King; the king of France now
                    has that of the Most Christian King, and the king of Spain has that of Catholic
                    King. The king of the Romans is a prince chosen by the emperor, as a coadjutor
                    in the government of the empire. The king of England, by the Lateran council,
                    held under Pope Julius II., had the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Christianissimus</hi> conferred on him; and that of Defender of the Faith was
                    added by Pope Leo X. though it had been used by them some time before. The title
                    of Grace was first given to our kings about the time of Henry IV., and that of
                    Majesty was first bestowed on Henry V1II., before whose time our kings were
                    called Grace, Highness, and the like. In all public instruments and letters, the
                    king styles himself <hi rend="italic">nos,</hi> we; though till the time of King
                    John he employed the singular number. The definition of king above given is
                    according to the general acceptation of the term. It will not therefore strictly
                    apply to the sovereign of Great Britain. The power of our king is subject to
                    great limitations; but these are the limitations of wisdom <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192947214" xml:id="kp-eb0712-7214-0724"/>and the sources of dignity,
                    being so far from diminishing his honour, that they impart an additional glory
                    to his crown.</p>
                <p>The oath taken by the king at his coronation is conceived in these terms :—“<hi
                    rend="italic">The archbishop or bishop shall say,</hi> Will you solemnly promise
                    and swear to govern the people of this kingdom of Britain, and the dominions
                    thereto belonging, according to the statutes in parliament agreed, and the laws
                    and customs of the same? <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >hing</hi><hi rend="italic">or queen shall say,</hi> I solemnly promise so to
                    do. <hi rend="italic">Archbishop or bishop.</hi> Will you to the utmost of your
                    power cause law and justice, in mercy, to be executed in all your judgments? <hi
                    rend="italic">King or queen.</hi> I will. <hi rend="italic">Archbishop or
                    bishop.</hi> Will you, to the utmost of your power, maintain the laws of God,
                    the true profession of the gospel, and the Protestant reformed religion
                    established by the law? And will you preserve unto the bishops and clergy of
                    this realm, and to the churches committed to their charge, all such rights and
                    privileges as by law do or shall appertain unto them, or any of them? <hi
                    rend="italic">King or queen.</hi> All this I promise to do. After this the king
                    or queen, laying his or her hand upon the holy gospel, shall say, The things
                    which I have here before promised, I will perform and keep, so help me God; and
                    then shall kiss the book.” This is the form of the coronation oath, as it is now
                    prescribed by law. The principal articles appear to be at least as ancient as
                    the Mirror of Justices, and even as the time of Bracton; but the wording of it
                    was changed at the Revolution, because, as the statute alleges, the oath itself
                    had been framed in doubtful words and expressions, with relation to ancient laws
                    and constitutions at that time unknown. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >England.</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> King</hi><hi rend="italic">at
                    Anns,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">of Arms,</hi> is an officer of great antiquity,
                    and anciently of great authority, whose business it is to direct the heralds,
                    preside at their chapters, and exercise the jurisdiction of armoury. In England
                    there are three kings of arms, namely, Garter, Clarencieux, and Norroy.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Garter principal</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                    King</hi><hi rend="italic">of Anns</hi> was instituted by Henry V. His business
                    is to attend the knights of the garter at their assemblies, to marshal the
                    solemnities at the funerals of the highest nobility, and to carry the garter to
                    kings and princes beyond the sea; on which occasion he used to be joined in
                    commission with some principal peer of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Clarencieux KiNGat Arms</hi> is so called from the Duke of
                    Clarence, to whom he first belonged. His office is to marshal and dispose the
                    funerals of all the inferior nobility, as baronets, knights, esquires, and
                    gentlemen, on the south side of the Trent.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Norroy</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> King</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">at Arms</hi> is an officer whose duty it is to do the same thing

                <p>The two last are also called <hi rend="italic">provincial heralds,</hi> because
                    they divide the kingdom into provinces between them. By charter they have power
                    to visit noblemen’s families, to set down their pedigrees, to distinguish their
                    arms, to appoint persons their arms, and with the garter king to direct the
                    other heralds.</p>
                <p>Anciently the kings at arms were created and solemnly crowned by the kings of
                    England themselves; but in later times the earl marshal has a special commission
                    at every creation to personate the king.</p>

                    rend="italic">at Arms for Scotland</hi> is the second king at arms for Great
                    Britain, and he is invested and crowned with great solemnity. To him belong the
                    publishing of king’s proclamations, the marshalling of funerals, the reversing
                    of arms, and the like.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Kings</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Lord Advocate for
                    Scotland.</hi> The first in this office noticed by our writers was Sir John de
                    Ross of Mountgreenan, who was appointed advocate to King James III. about the
                    year 1483. Till his time there does not appear to have been any permanent
                    officer named as king’s advocate, but temporary appointments for particular
                    causes only; as was likewise the case in early times in England, where the
                    attorneys-general were not otherwise constituted till the end of the fourteenth
                    century. Thus, in the claim set up in the parliament of Scotland to the
                    forfeited estates of the Earl of March, appearance was made “procuratoribus et
                    praelocutoribus excellentissimi principis et domini nostri actoris ab uno
                    prosequentis,” 1436, c. 135; and in the prosecution for treason in parliament
                    against the Earl of Douglas in 1455, Lancelot de Abernethie was “proloquitor
                    domini nostri regis.” It was the clerk-register that raised and prosecuted in
                    parliament the indictment for treason against Lord Boyd, November 1469; in the
                    process of forfeiture in parliament against the Earl of Ross, 1475, it was the
                    lord chancellor who conducted the prosecution and led the evidence; and in a
                    process of treason, 1479, the king asked the award of parliament “be his
                    chanceler and advocats.” As respects the court of the lord-justiciar of
                    Scotland, which, prior to the institution of the College of Justice, was the
                    highest court next to the parliament, and possessed of both civil and criminal
                    jurisdiction, it is well known that the clerk of court, or justice clerk, was
                    long the only public prosecutor.</p>
                <p>Sir John de Ross was succeeded in the office of king’s advocate by Henryson of
                    Fordel, who continued therein from 1494 till 1507, when he was made
                    justice-clerk in the room of Lawson of Hierigs, appointed king’s advocate. Both
                    these offices of justice-clerk and king’s advocate having become vacant in
                    September 1513, by the fall of Lawson and Henryson on the fatal field of
                    Flodden, Wischeart of Pittarrow was nominated to both places, and he continued
                    to hold them till his death, when thejoffice of king’s advocate was given to Sir
                    William Scot of Bahreary and Adam Otterburn of Redhall, both lords of council.
                    In December 1528, Bahreary was despatched to England in a diplomatic capacity;
                    and having in consequence resigned, he was succeeded by Sir James Foulis of
                    Colinten, a lord of the session, who, however, on the institution of the College
                    of Justice, accepted the place of clerk-register. Otterburn then became sole
                    king’s advocate, with the privilege of pleading within the bar of the new
                    erected court, a privilege till then unknown in our juridical practice; for
                    heretofore all pleaded within the bar, as indeed is still the case in the court
                    of justiciary, where much of the old common law proceedings remain to this day;
                    and in criminal cases the bar was occupied by the prisoner, who was thence
                    styled the <hi rend="italic">panel,</hi> a synonyme for <hi rend="italic"
                    >bar.</hi></p>
                <p>To the same period may perhaps be traced the title of Lord Advocate: for, as
                    early as the 2d April 1573, the king’s advocate is so styled;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Pitcairn’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Criminal</hi><hi rend="italic">Triait.</hi></p></note> and in the statute 1587,
                    c. 115, the title is given him as his accustomed designation. It had no doubt
                    its origin in the circumstance of his being, from the erection of the court, a
                    lord of session. This latter circumstance may seem the more remarkable of the
                    two, but it admits of easy explanation, and it had its parallel in the old
                    parliament of Paris. The constitution of the court of session, like the
                    ecclesiastical tribunals after which it was modelled, was secret, and all its
                    deliberations took place with closed doors. Provision was therefore to be made
                    to secure to the crown a knowledge of its proceedings. Accordingly, at the
                    institution of the court, the king’s advocate, the king’s treasurer, the clerk
                    register, and the justice-clerk, were all made lords of session; and when no <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192947227" xml:id="kp-eb0712-7227-0725"/> vacant seat
                    existed, as was the case when Henry Lauder was appointed to officiate as king’s
                    advocate during Otterburn’s absence in England in 1533, or where the party was
                    precluded from taking it “be reason of his less age,” as was the case tvhen Sir
                    Lewis Bellenden was appointed justice-clerk in 1578, the course adopted was to
                    issue a royal warrant to remain in court during its deliberations. Where more
                    than one individual held the office, as was commonly the case till the time of
                    Sir Thomas Hope, the end in view was sufficiently attained if one only had right
                    to remain in court; and this principle, it is believed, will be found to have
                    been acted upon.</p>
                <p>It was in the beginning of 1626 that Hope was appointed king’s advocate, along
                    with the aged Sir William Oliphant, a lord of session. The king then also
                    conferred on Hope the honour of knighthood; and the court of session, by act of
                    sederunt passed at the king’s desire, allowed him to plead covered. This last
                    ordinance has been strangely misapprehended by our writers; but, as Oliphant had
                    just been removed from the bench, and Hope had no seat on it, there seems little
                    reason to doubt that its object was to assert and clear the equality of the
                    king’s advocate with the judges, who then usually sat on the bench with their
                    hats on, and of the number of whom the king’s advocate had till now been one. It
                    was not a personal but an official privilege, and was accordingly, with the
                    other honours and privileges which had been enjoyed by Hope, confirmed to his
                    successors by the act of sederunt dated the 2d of June 1649. Hope’s learning and
                    astuteness are well known; and as he held the office for no less a period than
                    twenty years, and at a time when the king resided permanently in England, we
                    need not be surprised at the very large powers enjoyed by him and his successors
                    in his high office.</p>
                <p>When Hope was appointed king’s advocate, he was also appointed advocate to the
                    Prince of Wales; but the latter office has since been always held separate, as
                    it ought to be. In France, the advocate for the crown was also advocate for the
                    church; but in Scotland, since the Reformation, this has never been the case. On
                    the contrary, when Grant of Prestongrange accepted the office of king’s
                    advocate, the General Assembly voted the offices of their procurator and clerk,
                    then held by him, vacant by such acceptance, and filled them up accordingly.
                    Grant, however, had held the office of procurator to the church while he was
                    solicitor-general, as did likewise some of his predecessors; and the learned Mr
                    Thomas Craig seems to have been at the same time procurator to the church and
                    advocate-depute.</p>
                <p>The office of solicitor-general seems to be of no older origin in Scotland than
                    about two centuries ago; and it Avas not till the time of Charles Erskine of
                    Tinwald, in the beginning of last century, that this officer had right to sit
                    and plead within the bar of the inner-house; for certainly by the act of
                    sederunt of 28th February 1662, renewed 6th November 1690, the solicitor-general
                    and one deputy of the lord advocate were allowed to remain within “the innermost
                    bar” of the outer-house. The advocates-depute arc of much older standing, though
                    it was not till towards the end of the sixteenth century that the office was
                    permanent. They are now four in number, appointed to attend the sc.eral
                    circuits, and the Glasgow winter assize, the lord advocate has also a deputy in
                    the court of exchequer. (<hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> ∙ <hi rend="superscript"

                    bishop, born at Worwall about 1559, was educated at Westminster School and at
                    Oxford, and appointed chaplain to Queen Elizabeth. In 1605 he was made dean of
                    Christ Church; for several years he was vice-chancellor of Oxford; and in 1611
                    he was advanced to the bishopric of London. Besides his Lectures upon Jonah,
                    delivered at York, he published several sermons. King James I. used to style him
                    “the king of preachers;” and Lord Chief-Justice Coke often declared that “he was
                    the bestspeaker in the star-chamber in his time.” He died on the 30th of March
                    1621, and was interred in St Paul’s cathedral. ’ Soon after his death it was
                    reported that he had died a member of the Catholic church. But the falsehood of
                    this story was sufficiently exposed by his son Dr Henry King, who was created
                    bishop of Chichester, in a sermon delivered soon afterwards at St Paul’s Cross;
                    by Bishop Godwin in the Appendix to his <hi rend="italic">Commentarius</hi><hi

                    English writer, born at London in 1663, was allied to the noble families of
                    Clarendon and Rochester. He was elected a student of Christ Church from
                    Westminster School in 1681. He afterwards entered upon the study of law, and
                    having taken the degree of doctor of civil law, soon acquired a considerable
                    reputation as a civilian, and obtained great practice. He attended the Earl of
                    Pembroke, lord-lieutenant of Ireland, into that kingdom, where he was appointed
                    judge-advocate, sole commissioner of the prizes, keeper of the records, and
                    vicar-general to the lord-primate of Ireland. He died on Christmas day 1712, and
                    was interred in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey. His writings are pretty
                    numerous. The principal are, 1. Animadversions on a pretended Account of
                    Denmark, written by Mr (afterwards Lord) Molesworth; 2. Dialogues of the Dead;

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">King,</hi><hi rend="italic">Dr William,</hi> archbishop of
                    Dublin, was descended from an ancient family in the north of Scotland, but born
                    at Antrim in the north of Ireland on the 1st of May 1650. In 1674 he took
                    priest’s orders, and in 1679 was promoted by his patron, Dr Parker, archbishop
                    of Dublin, to the chancellorship of St Patrick. In 1687 Peter Manby, dean of
                    Londonderry, having published at Loudon a pamphlet entitled Considerations which
                    obliged Peter Manby, dean of Londonderry, to embrace the Catholic Religion, our
                    author immediately wrote an answer. Mr Man by, encouraged by the court, and
                    assisted by the most learned champions of the church of Rome, published a reply
                    under the title of a Reformed Catechism, in two Dialogues, concerning the
                    English Reformation, in reply to Mr King’s Answer. Our author soon rejoined in a
                    Vindication of the Answer. Mr Manby dropped the controversy, but dispersed a
                    loose sheet of paper, artfully written, with the title of a Letter to a Friend,
                    showing the Vanity of this Opinion, that every Man’s Sense and Reason arc to
                    guide him in Matters of Faith. This Dr King refuted in a Vindication of the
                    Christian Religion and Reformation against the Attempts of a Letter to a Friend.
                    In 1689 he was twice confined in the Tower by order of King James II., and the
                    same year created doctor of divinity. In 1690, upon King James’s retreat to
                    France after the battle of the Boyne, he was advanced to the see of Derry. In
                    1692 he published at London, The State of the Protestants of Ireland under the
                    late King James’s Government, in 4to; “a history,” says Bishop Burnet, “as truly
                    as it is finely written.” He had by him at his death attested vouchers of every
                    particular fact alleged in this book. However, it was soon attacked by Mr
                    Charles Lesly. In 1693, our author, finding the number of Protestant Dissenters
                    in his diocese of Derry increased by a vast addition of colonists from Scotland,
                    in order to persuade them to conformity to the established church, published a
                    Discourse concerning the Inventions of Men in the Worship of God. Mr Joseph
                    Boyse, a dissenting minister, wrote an answer.</p>

                <p>The bishop answered Mr Boyse. The latter replied, and the bishop rejoined. In
                    1702 he published at Dublin, in quarto, his celebrated treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">De Origine</hi><hi rend="italic">Mali.</hi> Mr Edmund Law, fellow
                    of Christ’s College in Cambridge, afterwards published a complete translation of
                    this work, with very valuable notes, in 4to. In the second edition he has
                    inserted, by way of notes, a large collection of the author’s papers on the same
                    subject, which he had received from his relations after the publication of the
                    former edition. In this excellent treatise the author has made many curious
                    observations. He asserts and proves that there is more moral good in the earth
                    than moral evil. A sermon by our author, preached at Dublin in 1709, was
                    published, under the title of Divine Predestination and Foreknowledge consistent
                    with the Freedom of Man’s Will. This was attacked by Anthony Collins, in a
                    pamphlet entitled a Vindication of the Divine Attributes; in some Remarks on the
                    Archbishop of Dublin’s Sermon entitled Divine Predestination, &amp;c. He
                    published likewise a Discourse concerning the Consecration of Churches, showing
                    what is meant by dedicating them, with the Grounds of that Office. He died in
                    1720. Archbishop King, as appears by his correspondence with Swift, was a man of
                    humour, and many of his witty sayings were at one time current.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">King,</hi><hi rend="italic">Dr William,</hi> principal of St
                    Mary’s Hall, Oxford, son of the Reverend Peregrine King, was born at Stepney in
                    Middlesex, in the year 1685. He was made doctor of law’s in 1715; became
                    secretary to the Duke of Ormond and Earl of Arran, as chancellors of the
                    university; and was made principal of St Mary’s Hall on the death of Dr Hudson
                    in 1719. When he stood as candidate for member of parliament for the university,
                    he resigned his office of secretary, but retained his other preferment, and it
                    was all he did enjoy, till the time of his death. Dr Clarke, who opposed him,
                    carried the election; and after this disappointment, he, in the year 1727, went
                    over to Ireland, where he is said to have written an epic poem called <hi
                    rend="italic">The Toast,</hi> which was a political satire, printed and given
                    away to his friends, but never sold. On the dedication of Dr Radcliffe’s
                    library, in 1749, he spoke a Latin oration in the theatre of Oxford, which was
                    received with the highest acclamations; but it was otherwise treated when
                    printed, for he was attacked in several pamphlets on account of it. Again, at
                    the contested election for Oxfordshire in 1755, his attachment to the old
                    interest drew on him the resentment of the new, and he was libelled in
                    newspapers and pamphlets, against which he defended himself in an Apology, and
                    warmly retaliated on his adversaries. He wrote several other things, and died in
                    1762. He was a polite scholar, an excellent orator, an elegant and easy writer,
                    and was esteemed by the first men of his time for his learning and wit.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">King,</hi><hi rend="italic">Peter,</hi> lord high chancellor
                    of Great Britain, the son of an eminent grocer and salter, was born at Exeter in
                    1669, and bred up for some years to his father’s business; but his inclination
                    to learning proved so strong that he laid out all the money he could spare in
                    books, and devoted every moment of his leisure hours to study. He thus became an
                    excellent scholar before the world suspected any such thing; and gave the public
                    a proof of his skill in church history, by his Inquiry into the Constitution,
                    Discipline, Unity, and Worship of the Primitive Church, that flourished within
                    the first three hundred years after Christ (London, 1691, in 8vo). This was
                    written with a view to promote the scheme of a comprehension of the Dissenters.
                    He afterwards published the second part’ of the Inquiry; and having desired, in
                    his preface, to be shown, either publicly or privately, any mistakes he might
                    have committed, that request was first complied with by Mr Edmund Elys, between
                    whom and our author there passed several letters upon the subject, in</p>
                <p>1692, which were published by Mr Elys in 1694, under the title of Letters on
                    several Subjects. But the most formal and elaborate answer to the Inquiry
                    appeared afterwards, in a work entitled Original Draught of the Primitive
                    Church.</p>
                <p>His acquaintance with Mr Locke, to whom he was related, and who left him half his
                    library at his death, was of great advantage to him. By the advice of that great
                    philosopher, after he had been some time in Holland, he applied himself to the
                    study of the law, in which profession his learning and diligence soon made him
                    noticed. In the two last parliaments of the reign of King William, and in five
                    parliaments during the reign of Queen Anne, he served as burgess for Beer-Alston
                    in Devonshire. In 1702, he published at London, without his name, his History of
                    the Apostles’ Creed, with critical observations on its several articles; a work
                    which is highly esteemed. In 1708 he was chosen recorder of the city of London;
                    and, in 1710, he was one of the members of the House of Commons at the trial of
                    Dr Sacheverel. In 1714 he was appointed lord chief justice of the common pleas;
                    and the April following he was made one of the privy council. In 1715 he was
                    created a peer, by the title of Lord King, Baron of Ockham in Surrey, and
                    appointed lord high chancellor of Great Britain, in which situation he continued
                    till 1733, when he resigned. He died at Ockham, in Surrey, in the year 1734.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Books of</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Kings,</hi> two
                    canonical books of the Old Testament, so called because they contain the history
                    of the kings of Israel and Judah, from the beginning of the reign of Solomon
                    till the Babylonian captivity, that is, for the space of nearly six hundred
                    years. The first book of Kings contains the latter part of the life of David,
                    and his death; the flourishing state of the Israelites under Solomon, his
                    building and dedicating the temple of Jerusalem, his shameful defection from the
                    true religion, and the sudden decay of the Jewish nation after his death, when
                    it was divided into two kingdoms. The rest of the book is occupied in relating
                    the acts of four kings of Judah and eight of Israel. The second book, which is a
                    continuation of the same history, is a relation of the memorable acts of sixteen
                    kings of Judah, and twelve of Israel, and the end of both kingdoms, by the
                    carrying off the ten tribes captive into Assyria by Shalmanasar, and the other
                    two into Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar. It is probable that these books were
                    composed by Ezra, who extracted them out of the public records which had been
                    kept of what passed in that nation.</p>
