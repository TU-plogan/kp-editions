                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">KENNICOTT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Dr Benjamin</hi></label>,
                    well known in the learned world for his elaborate edition of the Hebrew Bible
                    and other valuable publications, was born at Totness, in Devonshire, in the year
                    1718. His father was the parish clerk of Totness, and once master of a charity
                    school in that town. At an early age young Kennicot succeeded to the same
                    employment in the school, being recommended to it by his remarkable sobriety and
                    premature knowledge. It was in this situation he wrote the verses on the
                    recovery of the honourable Mrs Courtney from a dangerous illness, which
                    recommended him to her notice, and that of many neighbouring gentlemen, who,
                    with laudable generosity, opened a subscription to send him to Oxford. In
                    judging of this performance, they may be supposed to have considered not so much
                    its intrinsic merit, as the circumstances under which it was produced. For
                    although it might justly claim praise as the fruit of youthful industry
                    struggling with obscurity and indigence, yet as a poem it never rises above
                    mediocrity, and generally sinks below it. But, in whatever light these verses
                    may be considered, the publication of them was soon followed by such
                    contributions as procured for the author the advantages of an academical
                    education. In the year 1744 he entered himself at Wadham College: and it was not
                    long before he distinguished himself in that particular branch of study in which
                    he afterwards became so eminent. His two dissertations, on the Tree of Life, and
                    the Oblations of Cain and Abel, came to a second edition as early as the year
                    1747, and procured him the singular honour of a bachelor’s degree conferred upon
                    him gratis by the university a year before the statutable time. The
                    dissertations were gratefully dedicated to those benefactors whose liberality
                    had opened his way to the university, or whose kindness had made it a scene not
                    only of manly labour, but of honourable friendship. With such merit and such
                    support, he proved a successful candidate for a fellowship of Exeter College;
                    and soon after his admission into that society, he distinguished himself by the
                    publication of several occasional sermons. In the year 1753 he laid the
                    foundation of that stupendous monument of learned industry, at which the wise
                    and the good will gaze with admiration, when the cavils of prejudice, and envy,
                    and ingratitude, shall no longer be heard. This he did by publishing his first
                    dissertation, on the state of the printed Hebrew text, in which he proposed to
                    overthrow the then prevailing notion of its absolute integrity. The first blow,
                    indeed, had been struck long before by Capelins, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Critica</hi><hi rend="italic">Sacra,</hi> published after his death by his son,
                    in 1650; a blow which Buxtorf, with all his abilities and dialectical skill, was
                    unable to ward off. But Capellus having no opportunity of consulting
                    manuscripts, though bis arguments were supported by the authority of the
                    Samaritan Pentateuch, and that of parallel passages and the ancient versions,
                    could never absolutely prove his point. Indeed the general opinion was that the
                    Hebrew manuscripts contained none, or at least very few and trifling variations
                    from the printed text; and with respect to the Samaritan Pentateuch, the most
                    opposite opinions were entertained. Those who held the Hebrew verity, of course
                    condemned the Samaritan as corrupt in everyplace where it deviated from the
                    Hebrew; and those who believed the Hebrew to be incorrect, did not think the
                    Samaritan of sufficient authority to correct it. Besides, the Samaritan itself
                    appeared to very great advantage; for as no Samaritan manuscripts were then
                    known, the Pentateuch itself was rashly condemned for errors which ought rather
                    to have been ascribed to the incorrectness of the editions. In this
                    dissertation, therefore, Dr Kennicot proved that there were many Hebrew
                    manuscripts extant, which, though they had hitherto been generally supposed to
                    agree with one another, and with the Hebrew text, yet contained many and
                    important various readings; and that from those various readings considerable
                    authority was derived in support of the ancient versions. lie announced the
                    existence of six Samaritan manuscripts in Oxford alone, by which many errors in
                    the printed Samaritan might be removed; and he attempted to prove, that even
                    from the Samaritan, as it was already printed, many passages in the Hebrew might
                    undoubtedly be corrected. This work, as might reasonably be expected, was
                    examined with great severity both at home and abroad. In some foreign
                    universities the belief of the Hebrew verity, on its being attacked by Capellus,
                    had been insisted on as an article of faith. “Ista Capelli sententia adeo non
                    approbata fuit fidei sociis, ut potius Helvetii theologi, et speciatim
                    Genevenses, anno 1678, peculiari canone caverint, ne quis in ditione sua
                    minister ecclesiae recipiatur, nisi fateatur publice textum Hebraeum, ut hodie
                    est in exemplaribus Masoreticis, quoad consonantes et vocales, divinum et
                    authenticum esse.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>λV
                    olfii <hi rend="italic">Biblioth.</hi><hi rend="italic">Heb.</hi> tom. ii. p,
                    27«</p></note> And at home this doctrine of the corrupt state of the Hebrew text
                    was opposed by Comings and Bate, two Hutchinsonians, with as much violence as if
                    the whole truth of revelation had been at stake.</p>
                <p>The next three or four years of Dr Kennicot’s life were principally employed in
                    searching out and examining Hebrew manuscripts, though he found leisure not only
                    to preach, but also to publish several occasional sermons. About this time Dr
                    Kennicot became one of the king’s preachers at Whitehall; and in the year 1759
                    we find <pb break="no" facs="nls:192946811" xml:id="kp-eb0712-6811-0693"/>him
                    vicar of Culliam in Oxfordshire. In January 1760 he published his second
                    dissertation on the state of the Hebrew text, in which, after vindicating the
                    authority and antiquity of the Samaritan Pentateuch, he disarmed the advocates
                    for the Hebrew verity of one of their most specious arguments. They had observed
                    that, the Chaldaic Paraphrase having been made from Hebrew manuscripts near the
                    time of Christ, its general coincidence with the present Hebrew text must evince
                    the agreement of the latter with the manuscripts from which the paraphrase was
                    taken. Dr Kennicot demonstrated the fallacy of this reasoning, by showing that
                    the Chaldaic Paraphrase had been frequently corrupted, in order to reconcile it
                    with the printed text; and thus the weapons of his antagonists were successfully
                    turned against themselves. He appealed also to the writings of the Jews
                    themselves upon the subject of the Hebrew text, and gave a compendious history
                    of it, from the close of the Hebrew canon down to the invention of printing;
                    together with a description of a hundred and three Hebrew manuscripts which he
                    had discovered in England, and an account of many others preserved in various
                    parts of Europe. A collation of the Hebrew manuscripts was now loudly called for
                    by the most learned and enlightened friends of biblical criticism; and in the
                    same year, 1760, Dr Kennicot issued his proposals for collating all the Hebrew
                    manuscripts prior to the invention of printing, which could be found in Great
                    Britain and Ireland, and for procuring at the same time as many collations of
                    foreign manuscripts of note as the time and money he should receive would enable
                    him to procure. His first subscribers were the learned and pious Archbishop
                    Secker, and the delegates of the Oxford press, who, with that liberality which
                    has generally distinguished them, gave him an annual subscription of L.40. In
                    the first year the money received was about five hundred guineas; in the next it
                    rose to nine hundred, at which sum it continued stationary till the tenth year,
                    when it amounted to one thousand. During the progress of this work, the industry
                    of our author was rewarded by a canonry of Christ Church. He was also presented,
                    though we know not exactly when, to the valuable living of Mynhenyote, in
                    Cornwall, upon the nomination of the chapter of Exeter. In 1776 the first volume
                    was published, and in 1780 the whole was completed. If we consider that above
                    six hundred manuscripts were collated, and that the whole work occupied twenty
                    years of Dr Kennicot’s life, it must be owned that sacred criticism is more
                    indebted to him than to any other scholar of his age. Within two years of his
                    death he resigned his living in Cornwall, from conscientious motives, on account
                    of his not having a prospect of ever again being able to visit his parish.
                    Although many good and conscientious men may justly think, in this case, that
                    his professional labours, carried on elsewhere, might properly have entitled him
                    to retain this preferment, and may apply this reasoning in other cases, yet
                    conduct so signally disinterested certainly deserves to be admired and
                    celebrated. Dr Kennicot died at Oxford, after a lingering illness, on the 18th
                    of September 1783; and he left a widow, who was sister to Mr Edward Chamberlayne
                    of the treasury. At the time of his death he was employed in printing Remarks on
                    Select Passages in the Old Testament, which were afterwards published, the
                    volume having been completed from his papers.</p>
