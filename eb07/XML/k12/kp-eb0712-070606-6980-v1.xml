                <p><label type="entry">KEY</label>, an instrument for the opening of locks. Molinus,
                    in his treatise of keys, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">clavibus
                    veterum,</hi> printed at Upsal, derives the Latin name <hi rend="italic"
                    >clavis</hi> from the Greek %λs∕ω, <hi rend="italic">claudo,</hi> I shut, or
                    from the adverb <hi rend="italic">clam,</hi> privately; and adds, that the use
                    of keys is yet unknown in some parts of Sweden. The invention of keys is due to
                    one Theodore of Samos, according to Pliny and Polydore Virgil; but this must be
                    a mistake, as the use of keys was known before the siege of Troy, whilst mention
                    is even made of them in the nineteenth chapter of Genesis. Molinus is of opinion
                    that keys at first served only for untying certain knots wherewith they
                    anciently secured their doors; but the Laconic keys, he maintains, were nearly
                    akin in use to our own, consisting of three single teeth, and made in the figure
                    of an E; a form of which there are still some to be seen in the cabinets of the
                    curious. There was another key called <hi rend="italic">βaλavaγga,</hi> made in
                    the manner of a male screw, whieh had its corresponding female in a bolt affixed
                    to the door. <hi rend="italic">Key</hi> has hence become a general name for
                    several things serving to shut up or close others.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Key,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Key-stone, of an Arch or
                    Vault,</hi> is the last stone placed on the top thereof, which, being wider and
                    fuller at the top than bottom, wedges, as it were, and binds together all the
                    rest. The key is different in the different orders. In the Tuscan and Doric it
                    is only a plain stone projecting; in the Ionic it is cut and waved, somewhat
                    after the manner of consoles; in the Corinthian and Composite it is a console
                    enriched with sculpture, foliages, and other ornaments.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Key</hi> is also used for ecclesiastical jurisdiction,
                    particularly for the power of excommunicating and absolving. The Romanists say
                    the pope has the power of the keys, and can open and shut paradise as he
                    pleases, grounding their opinion on that expression of Jesus Christ to St Peter,
                    “I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.” In St Gregory we read that
                    it was the custom for the popes to send a golden key to princes, in which they
                    enclosed a little of the filings of St Peter’s chains, kept with a world of
                    devotion at Rome; and that these keys were worn in the bosom, as being supposed
                    to contain some wonderful virtues.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Key,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Music,</hi> a certain
                    fundamental note or tone, to which the whole piece, be it in cantata, sonata, or
                    concerto, is accommodated, and with which it usually begins, but always
                    ends.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Key,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Quay,</hi> a long wharf,
                    usually built of stone, by the side of a harbour or river, and having several
                    storehouses for the convenience of lading and discharging merchant ships. It is
                    accordingly furnished with posts and rings, by which the latter are secured;
                    together with cranes, capstans, and other engines, to lift the goods into or out
                    of the vessels which lie alongside. The verb <hi rend="italic">cojare,</hi> in
                    old writers, according to Scaligcr, signifies to <hi rend="italic">keep in</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">restrain</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and hence came our
                    term <hi rend="italic">key</hi> or <hi rend="italic">quay,</hi> the ground where
                    they are made being bound in with planks and posts.</p>
