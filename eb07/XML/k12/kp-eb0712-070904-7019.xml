                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">KIAKHTA</label>, a town of Asiatic Russia, in the government
                    of Irkoutsk, and district of Verschnei-Oudinsk. It is situated in a uniform and
                    rather elevated plain, traversed by a river of the same name, and is surrounded
                    by a lofty range of granitic and wooded mountains of a bleak aspect. It was
                    visited in 1822 by Captain Cochrane, the celebrated pedestrian traveller, who
                    mentions that it is a neat and regularly-built town, containing 450 houses, with
                    4000 inhabitants. Owing to the narrow and jealous policy of the Chinese, no
                    stone buildings are by the treaty allowed to be erected, excepting only a church
                    for public worship. Beyond the fortress, and immediately opposite Maimatchin, is
                    the Chinese town Old Kiakhta, the residence only of the merchants; no officer or
                    stranger being permitted to sleep in it, according to an article in the treaty.
                    The old town contains, according to Cochrane, forty-five dwellings, many of
                    which are very superior edifices, and have within them very rich stores. Though
                    situated in a dreary and sterile oasis, Kiakhta, by means of its commerce,
                    possesses many comforts. It is 330 miles south of Irkoutsk. On one of the
                    mountains by which the place is surrounded are seen the boundaries of the
                    Russian and Chinese empires, placed opposite each other; the Russian boundary
                    being marked by a hillock of stones, with a cross at the top; whilst that of the
                    Chinese is marked by a kind of pyramid. This place is remarkable as the centre
                    of all the trade which is carried on between the Russian and Chinese empires;
                    the Chinese, by the jealous policy of their rulers, being prohibited from
                    trading with Russia through any other place. It was fixed upon by the treaty
                    concluded between these powers in 1728, as the only medium of their mutual
                    intercourse; and a great fair is accordingly held in December, when merchants
                    flock thither from the most distant parts of the Russian empire. At this great
                    commercial rendezvous are exchanged cloths; furs, namely, those of foxes,
                    sables, river and sea otters, wild cats, beavers, and millions of squirrels,
                    this latter fur, from its lightness, warmth, and durability, being a favourite
                    with the Chinese; Russia and Morocco leather; for nankeens, silk stuffs, tea,
                    rhubarb, &amp;c. Woollen cloths and copper money are also exported to China, as
                    well as many articles of curiosity and ingenuity, and some trinkets. The Russian
                    and Chinese towns are quite separate from each other.</p>
