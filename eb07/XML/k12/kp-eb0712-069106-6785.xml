                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">KENNET, <hi rend="smallcaps">White</hi></label>, a learned
                    English writer, and Bishop of Peterborough in the eighteenth century, bred at St
                    Edmund Hall, Oxford, where he soon distinguished himself by his vigorous
                    application to his studies, and by his translations of several works into
                    English, and other pieces which he published. In 1695 Kennet published his
                    Parochial Antiquities. But a sermon preached by him on the 30th of January 1703,
                    at Aidgate, exposed him to great clamour. It was printed under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">A compassionate Inquiry into the Causes of the Civil War.</hi> In
                    1706 he published his Case of Impropriations, and two other tracts upon the same
                    subject. In 1706 he brought forward the third volume of the Complete History o.
                    England, the two former volumes having been compiled by Mr Hughes. In 1709, he
                    published a Vindication o. the Church and Clergy of England from some reproaches
                    rudely and unjustly cast upon them; and a true Answer to Dr Sacheverel’s Sermon.
                    When the great point in Dr Sacheverel’s trial, namely, the change of the
                    ministry, was gained, and strange proceedings took place upon it, an artful
                    address by the bishop and clergy of London was to be prepared, and they who
                    would not subscribe it were to be represented as enemies to the queen and the
                    ministry. Dr Kennet fell under this imputation. He was exposed to great odium as
                    a low churchman, on account of his conduct and writings. When he was Dean of
                    Peterborough, an uncommon method was taken to expose him by Dr Walton, rector of
                    the church of Whitechapel. In the altar-piece of that church, which was intended
                    to represent Christ and his twelve apostles eating the passover and last supper,
                    Judas the traitor was drawn sitting <pb break="no" facs="nls:192946798"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-6798-0692"/>in an elbow chair, dressed in a black garment,
                    with a great deal of the air and appearance of Dr Kennet. It was generally said
                    that the original sketch was intended for a bishop under Dr Walton’s
                    displeasure; but the painter being apprehensive of an action of <hi
                    rend="italic">scandalum magnatum,</hi> leave was given to drop the bishop and
                    paint the dean, zks this gave general offence, however, the Bishop of London
                    ordered the picture to be taken down. In 1713 he presented the Society for
                    Propagating the Gospel with a great number of books suitable to their design;
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Bibliothecae A mericanoe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Primordia</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and founded an antiquarian and
                    historical library at Peterborough. In 1715 he published a sermon entitled the
                    Witchcraft of the present Rebellion, and afterwards several other pieces. In
                    1717 he was engaged in a dispute with Dr William Nicholson, bishop of Carlisle,
                    relating to some alterations in a sermon by the Bishop of Bangor; and he
                    disliked the proceedings of the convocation against that bishop. Upon the death
                    of Dr Cumberland, bishop of Peterborough, he was promoted to that see, to which
                    he was consecrated in the year 1718. He sat in it more than ten years, and died
                    in 1728. He was an excellent philologist, a good preacher, and well versed in
                    the history and antiquities of our nation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Kennet,</hi><hi rend="italic">Basil,</hi> a learned English
                    writer, brother of the preceding, was educated in Corpus Christi College, in the
                    university of Oxford, where he became fellow. In 1706 he went as chaplain to the
                    English factory at Leghorn, where he met with great opposition from the Papists,
                    and was in danger from the inquisition. Kennet died in the year 1714. He
                    published Lives of the Greek poets, Roman Antiquities, a volume of Sermons
                    preached at Leghorn, and a translation into English of Puffendorf’s Treatise of
                    the Law of Nature and Nations. He was a man of most exemplary integrity,
                    generosity, piety, and modesty.</p>
