                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">KOORANKOO</label>, a considerable kingdom of Western Africa.
                    It is bounded on the west by the Bullom, Limba, and Timmance countries; on the
                    north by Limba, Tamisso, and Soolimana; on the east by Kissi, the Niger, and
                    countries little known; and on the south by those countries which border on the
                    coast. These limits include a very extensive tract of country, but the boundary
                    lines are somewhat indefinite; indeed they are continually fluctuating,
                    according to the fortunes of war as it is practised amongst savage tribes of
                    men. For our knowledge of Koorankoo we are indebted to the enterprise of Major
                    Laing, by whom is was visited and has been described. A chain of hills, sixty
                    miles in length, runs in a north-easterly direction throughout the whole of the
                    country. These are for the most part clothed at their base with the camwood
                    tree, which constitutes the staple article <hi rend="italic">of</hi> trade. The
                    range is composed of micaceous granite and mica slate, interspersed with veins
                    of quartz and laterite, so strongly impregnated with iron as sensibly to affect
                    the needle at some inches distance. The principal rivers appear to be the
                    Rokelle and the Kamaranka. The source of the former is set down in Major Laing’s
                    map as in latitude 9. 45. north, longitude 9. 55. west, a parallel which lies in
                    the Soolima country. It issues from the foot of a hill, by barometrical
                    measurement 1470 feet above the level of the Atlantic; and after receiving
                    several tributaries, and traversing Koorankoo and. other countries, falls into
                    the sea at Sierra Leone, to which colony it is of great importance. The Rokelle
                    is the only river, says Major Laing, which bears one name from the source to the
                    sea. The rivulets and longer streams which discharge themselves into it are
                    picturesquely beautiful, dashing over rugged granite rocks several hundred feet
                    in elevation. One of the tributaries, called Ba-Jafana, had a bed of about
                    fifteen yards in breadth, though only about three miles from its source, which
                    is in a mountain named Balakonko, where the natives procure the camwood in great
                    abundance. The banks of the river are likewise lined with this wood, which grows
                    to the height of about sixty feet. The Tongolelle, a rapid stream about thirty
                    yards broad, also joins the Rokelle. It takes its rise in a sort of basin,
                    surrounded with thick brushwood, and gives birth to a rich and luxuriant growth
                    of wild canes in its centre, affording a cool retreat to the leopards which
                    infest this part of the country. To such an extent are these rapacious animals
                    dreaded, that Major Laing “observed the sites of several towns now in ruin, the
                    inhabitants of which had been forced to move to the westward to avoid their
                    attacks.” The Kamaranka appears to be a river of the same size and general
                    character as the Rokelle. It has also numerous tributaries. All the rivulets
                    running south through the mountain chain already mentioned collect behind a
                    lofty hill called Botato, and fall into it. About a mile from Nyiniah, one of
                    the largest and best-built towns in Koorankoo, is the source of a fine stream,
                    which joins the Kamaranka. The spring forms a basin ten yards in diameter,
                    embanked with masses of granite, and overhung with lofty trees, clad with a
                    foliage so thick as to bid defiance to the rays even of a vertical sun. Major
                    Laing describes the scenery in this quarter as occasionally very picturesque and
                    beautiful. After crossing a range of hills to the eastward of Nyiniah, there
                    presented itself to the eye of the traveller “an extensive valley, partly
                    cultivated, and partly covered with long natural grass about five feet high, the
                    cultivated part newly <hi rend="subscript"> u</hi> u <hi rend="superscript">
                    r</hi> n; lines of stately palm trees, as regular as if laid out by art, with
                    here and there a cluster of camwood trees, their deep shade affording a relief
                    to the lighter hue of the smaller herbage; these, with a murmuring rivulet
                    meandering through the centre, exhibited the appearance of a well-cultivated and
                    tastily-arranged garden, rather than a tract amid the wilds of Africa; whilst,
                    in the distance, mountain towered above mountain in all the grandeur and
                    magnificence of nature. There was also seen an extensive plain covered with
                    short, thin grass; and our traveller having crossed a mountain ridge which
                    separates the head streams of the Kamaranka, flowing southward, from those which
                    reach the Rokelle, he ascended a lofty erninencö called <hi rend="italic">Sa
                    Wolle.</hi> The summit of this mountain, according to barometrical measurement,
                    was 1900 feet above the level of the sea, and the view from it was grand and
                    extensive in the highest degree. A capacious circle of nearly two degrees in
                    diameter, interrupted only by a hill to the eastward, which rose considerably
                    higher, presented a landscape of the most rich and varied scenery.</p>
                <p>Camwood is the staple article of trade, and it is sent down the Rokelle and the
                    Kamaranka to be bartered for various articles, chiefly salt. There is also a
                    considerable advantage derived from the extensive manufacture of cloth. The loom
                    in which this is wove is very narrow. The artisan sits under an open shed, from
                    the roof of which are suspended two frames of equal breadth with the roof,
                    nicely divided with perpendicular strings. ' By a motion of the feet, these are
                    made to cross one another alternately, and at each motion the shuttle is cast
                    through. In this manner of working they exhibit much dexterity, and make good
                    progress. Women are employed in spinning thread, but the sowing and weaving are
                    performed by men.</p>
                <p>Major Laing observes, “Koorankoo is the first country <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192947669" xml:id="kp-eb0712-7669-0759"/>to the eastward of Sierra
                    Leone where the manufacture of cloth is common; but it is generally of a coarse
                    quality. As the traveller advances eastward, he finds the natives improve both
                    in the texture of the cloth and the size of the loom. In Sangara, very large and
                    handsome cloths are manufactured.” The Koorankoos also cultivate a considerable
                    portion of their ground; and in general intelligence and industry they rank
                    above the neighbouring tribes. Each house has its enclosed garden, where are
                    raised cassada, in the cultivation of which they bestow great care; spinach,
                    small onions, and tankana, an herb which, when dried and beaten, answers as a
                    cheap substitute for snuff. In religion they are for the most part pagans, and
                    they exercise unlimited faith in <hi rend="italic">gree-grees</hi> (a sort of
                    protecting spirits), for whom they have houses consecrated at the entrances of
                    the towns. The head men are clothed in a long gown, trousers, cap, and sandals,
                    but the women are contented with more scanty habiliments. They are great adepts
                    in the art of dressing hair, and ornament each other’s heads with great skill.
                    Dancing is a favourite amusement; and on the night of a funeral, which always
                    takes place the day after the demise of the individual, they exhibit their skill
                    in this art, brandishing hatchets or spears in both hands. The laws of this
                    people are few and inartificial. Murder is the only crime punishable with death,
                    and even this can be compensated by property.</p>
                <p>There is a portion of the Koorankoo country inhabited by the tribe called the
                    Soolimas. They have a territory of their own, which Major Laing describes as
                    picturesque in the extreme, being diversified with hills, extensive vales, and
                    fertile meadows, belted with stripes of wood, and decorated with clumps of trees
                    of the densest foliage. The soil is remarkably fertile, producing chiefly rice,
                    yams, which are planted like potatoes in England, and ground nuts, which are
                    cultivated like our field peas. Bananas, pines, and oranges, are the principal
                    fruits; but the first only are found in any degree of perfection. The Soolimas
                    have numerous herds and flocks, and a diminutive kind of poultry. The elephant,
                    the buffalo, a species of antelope, monkeys, leopards, and wolves, are the wild
                    animals. The principal towns of the Soolimas are all situated in the Koorankoo
                    country. These are Falaba, the capital; Sangonia, a very large town on the
                    borders of Footah Jallou, surrounded with a strong and lofty wall; Semba, a
                    large, populous, and rich town near the southern frontier, situated on a very
                    lofty eminence; Mousaiah and Koonko-doogore, a stage from Semba, in the hills.
                    In all, these places contain a population of about 25,000 souls. Falaba derives
                    its name from the river Fala, on which it stands. It is nearly a mile and a half
                    in length, by a mile in breadth, and closely built compared with the generality
                    of African towns. It was built in 1768 by the Soolima king, as a stronghold to
                    protect him against his enemies theFoolahs; and the site is well chosen as a
                    place of defence, being on a gently-rising eminence in the centre of a large
                    plain. The town is surrounded by a strong stockade of hard wood, and a deep and
                    broad ditch, which renders it quite impregnable according to the military
                    tactics of the Africans. It contains about four thousand circular clay huts,
                    having pyramidal roofs of thatch; and, being neat and clean, they present a very
                    respectable appearance. The palaver or court-house stands in an open space,
                    towards the southern extremity of the town, and is a place of recreation as well
                    as of business. In the centre of the town a large piece of ground is left
                    vacant, for the purposes of exercise, of receiving strangers, and of holding
                    palavers. Formerly the Soolimas chiefly occupied themselves in war, but this is
                    less practised amongst them now than heretofore. In person they are short and
                    muscular, and well adapted to endure privation and fatigue. Their military
                    weapons are the spear, the musket, the sling, and the bow: in the management and
                    use of the two latter they are most expert. Where their predatory habits do not
                    interfere, they seemed to Major Laing both mild and inoffensive in disposition.
                    In their domestic occupations the men and women appear to have changed places.
                    The men attend to the dairy; they also sow and reap; but all the other cares of
                    husbandry devolve upon the female sex. They are masons, plasterers, surgeons,
                    and the like; whilst the men employ themselves in sewing, and not unfrequently
                    in washing clothes. In religion, government, dress, customs, and the like, the
                    Soolimas resemble the Koorankoos, so that these do not require a separate
                    description.</p>
