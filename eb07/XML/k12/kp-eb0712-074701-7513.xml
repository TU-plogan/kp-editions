                <p><label type="entry">KNOX, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, the great
                    reformer of Scotland, was born at the village of Gifford in Haddingtonshire in
                    the year 1505. His father is said, though perhaps without foundation, to have
                    been descended from the family of Ranferly, in the same county. The name of his
                    mother was Sinclair; and some of his letters, written in seasons of danger, were
                    subscribed John Sinclair. Whatever might be the lineage or the situation of the
                    father, the son was enabled to obtain the benefit of a liberal education, such
                    as his native country could then afford. After having been instructed in the
                    Latin language at Haddington school, he was in the year 1521 sent to the
                    university of Glasgow, where philosophy and divinity were taught by John Mair, a
                    celebrated schoolman. The Greek and Hebrew languages were not then publicly
                    taught in Scotland; but the former of these he acquired when he was yet in the
                    vigour of life, and the latter during the period of his continental exile. It is
                    not sufficiently ascertained that he took a degree; but if it be correctly
                    stated that he publicly taught philosophy in this university, and afterwards at
                    St Andrews, we are perhaps to infer that he was a master of arts.</p>
                <p>He soon felt himself dissatisfied with the dry and barren speculations of
                    scholastic philosophy and scholastic theology, and was gradually conducted to a
                    more edifying course of enquiry. Not contented, as his excellent and lamented
                    biographer has stated, with the extracts “from ancient authors, which he found
                    in the writings of the scholastic divines and canonists, he resolved to have
                    recourse to the original works. In them he found a method of investigating and
                    communicating truth, to which he had hitherto been a stranger, and the
                    simplicity of which recommended itself to his mind, in spite of the prejudices
                    of education, and the pride of superior attainments in his own favourite, art.
                    Among the fathers of the Christian church, Jerom and Augustine attracted his
                    particular attention. By the writings of the former, he was led to the
                    Scriptures as the only pure fountain of divine truth, and instructed in the
                    utility of studying them in the original languages. In the works of the latter,
                    he found religious sentiments very opposite to those taught in the Romish
                    church, who, while she retained his name as a saint in her calendar, had
                    banished his doctrine, as heretical, from her pulpits. From this time, he
                    renounced the study of scholastic theology; and although not yet completely
                    emancipated from superstition, his mind was fitted for improving the means which
                    Providence had prepared, for leading him to a fuller and more comprehensive view
                    of the system of evangelical religion. It was about the year 1535 when this
                    favourable change commenced; but it does not appear that he professed himself a
                    protestant before the year 1542.” The reformed doctrines had been preached to
                    his benighted countrymen by Patrick Hamilton, abbot of Ferme, who was allied to
                    the royal family, and who had the higher honour of being the proto-martyr of
                    Scotland to the protestant faith. On the last of February 1528, he was most
                    inhumanly committed to the flames in the archiepiscopal city of St Andrews. But
                    the seed which he had thus moistened with his blood, sprung from the ground with
                    a degree of vigour which the foulest blasts of persecution were found incapable
                    of withering. The new opinions were gradually adopted by men of learning as well
                    as of rank. Between the years 1530 and 1540, a considerable number of victims
                    was doomed to a cruel death, while others escaped the fangs of their
                    persecutors, and sought refuge in England and on the continent. Several of these
                    exiles, and among the rest George Buchanan and Alexander Aless, were men
                    distinguished by their talents and learning, who obtained preferment in foreign
                    universities, and there reflected credit on their native country.</p>
                <p>During those times of persecution, Knox was engaged in teaching philosophy in the
                    university of St Andrews, though it does not clearly appear that he held the
                    office of a regent or professor. Several individuals of his acquaintance had
                    embraced the reformed doctrines: the force of truth gradually affected his own
                    mind, and he arrived at complete conviction in the year 1542, having then
                    attained the age of thirty-seven. As he began to recommend to his pupils a more
                    rational and edifying method of study, he excited some suspicions of heretical
                    pravity; but when he proceeded so far as to expose ce» tain corruptions of the
                    church, he speedily found it necessary to change his place of residence. Having
                    retired to the south of Scotland, and there avowed his adherence to the cause of
                    reformation, he was declared a heretic, and was degraded from his orders. Nor
                    was Cardinal Beaton satisfied with this more canonical form of procedure: he
                    employed assassins to co-operate in the same design of supporting the church,
                    but his intended victim found shelter and protection in his native county, under
                    the roof of Hugh Douglas of Longniddry, a gentleman who had adopted the same
                    opinions. Here he was retained in the capacity of a domestic tutor; and the son
                    of another protestant, John Cockburn of Ormiston, was likewise committed to his
                    charge. He communicated religious instruction, not only to his pupils, but also
                    to the other members of the family, and to the people of the immediate
                    neighbourhood. He was accustomed to catechise them in a chapel at Longniddry,
                    and there at stated times to read and explain a portion of the Scriptures. When
                    religious instruction was so scanty, and access to the fountain of sacred
                    knowledge so difficult, the services of so faithful a labourer must have been of
                    no small value. About this period, he received a new impulse from the public and
                    private instructions of George Wishart, who returned to his native country in
                    the year 1544. He had been driven into exile by the bishop of Brechin, for the
                    crime of reading lectures on the Greek Testament at Montrose, and during several
                    years had resided in the university of Cambridge. “Excelling all his countrymen
                    at that period in learning, of the most persuasive eloquence, irreproachable in
                    life, courteous and affable in manners, his fervent piety, zeal, and courage in
                    the cause of truth, were tempered with uncommon meekness, modesty, patience,
                    prudence, and charity. In his tour of preaching through Scotland, he was usually
                    accompanied by some of the principal gentry; and the people, who flocked to hear
                    him, were ravished with his discourses. To this teacher Knox attached himself,
                    and profited greatly by his sermons and private instructions. During the last
                    visit which Wishart paid to Lothian, Knox waited constantly on his person, and
                    bore the sword, which was carried before him from the time that an attempt was
                    made to assassinate him in Dundee. Wishart was highly pleased with the zeal of
                    his faithful attendant, and seems to have presaged his future usefulness, at the
                    same time that he laboured under a strong presentiment of his own approaching
                    martyrdom.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>M‘Crie’s

                <p>Wishart was brought to the stake at St Andrews on the 1st of March 1546, and his
                    persecutor, the blood-stained cardinal, was not long permitted to survive. On
                    the 29th of the ensuing May, he was surprised in his castle by a small and
                    resolute band of conspirators, whom his misdeeds had roused to acts of
                    desperation. Having put him to death, they kept possession of his strong-hold,
                    and procuring assistance from England, they sustained a regular siege from an
                    army collected by the regent Arran. Many protestants, who had no participation
                    in the conspiracy, sought refuge in the castle; and among these were Sir David
                    Lindsay and Henry Balnaves, whose names arc familiarly known to all who are
                    acquainted with the literary history<pb break="no" facs="nls:192947526"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-7526-0748"/> of that age. Knox, being among the number of the
                    proscribed, was persuaded by Douglas and Cockburn to follow the example. He was
                    accompanied by his pupils, and continued his religious as well as his literary
                    instructions. In the chapel of the castle, he read lectures on portions of the
                    Scriptures; and so favourable an opinion was formed of his talents and
                    attainments, that he was earnestly solicited to officiate as the colleague of
                    John Rough, chaplain to the garrison. It was not without much reluctance that he
                    obeyed the call; but having undertaken this office, he acquitted himself with
                    equal ability and zeal. He occasionally preached in the parish church, as well
                    as in the chapel of the castle, and the popish clergy were at length roused to
                    some degree of counter-exertion: it was arranged that the most learned men of
                    the abbey and university should every Sunday preach in their turn, partly with
                    the view of excluding the protestant ministers from the pulpit, and partly with
                    that of conciliating the affections of the people, whose edification they had
                    too long disregarded. Knox and his colleague were summoned to a public
                    disputation, held in the presence of Winram the sub-prior, who was vicar-general
                    during the vacancy of the see, and who was secretly inclined to the reformed
                    doctrines. He did not himself enter into much discussion, and he was very feebly
                    supported by a Franciscan friar, named Arbuckle, who was finally driven to the
                    desperate averment “that the apostles had not received the Holy Ghost when they
                    wrote the epistles, but they afterwards received it, and ordained ceremonies.”
                    It was more easy for this father to abandon the inspiration of the holy
                    Scriptures, than to relinquish the vain ceremonies of the church: so customary
                    has it generally been for mankind to adore the bungling work of their own
                    hands.</p>
                <p>During the short period of his ministrations at St Andrews, many of the citizens
                    renounced the errors of popery, and publicly testified the change of their
                    religious opinions, by partaking of the communion according to the rite of the
                    reformed church. But the protestants could not long retain possession of the
                    castle. At the end of June 1547, a considerable reinforcement arrived from
                    France, and enabled the regent to invest the place by sea and land: the garrison
                    made a brave resistance, but after an interval of a month was reduced to the
                    necessity of accepting terms of capitulation from Leo Strozzi, the commander of
                    the foreign auxiliaries. It was stipulated that their lives should be spared,
                    that they should be removed to France, and that such of them as declined
                    entering into the French service should be conveyed to any other country except
                    Scotland. Rough had previously emigrated to England, and there he suffered
                    martyrdom in the year 1557. Knox, sharing the fate of his companions, was
                    conveyed on board one of the French ships, which cast anchor before Rouen; but
                    the terms of the capitulation were grossly violated, and, at the instigation of
                    the pope and the Scotish clergy, they were treated as prisoners of war. The
                    principal gentlemen were com mitted to close custody in Rouen, Cherbourg, Brest,
                    and Mont St Michael; while Knox and some others were sent on board the galleys,
                    and after being loaded with chains, were compelled to labour at the oar. Here
                    they were subjected to many other indignities; but in spite of every hardship
                    and every threat, not one of their number could be impelled to renounce his
                    faith. During the ensuing winter, the galley in which he was confined lay in the
                    river Loire; and, in the summer of 1548, it sailed for Scotland, and during a
                    considerable period lingered on the eastern coast, for the purpose of
                    intercepting English vessels. The hardships to which he was now subjected
                    produced a very serious effect upon his health: he was seized with a violent
                    fever, and no hope was entertained of his recovery. He however regained his
                    strength, and during his captivity had sufficient energy of mind to compose more
                    than one religious treatise. His treatise on prayer, written during this season
                    of affliction, was afterwards published. Having endured a captivity of nineteen
                    months, he was restored to liberty in February 1549∙ Of the circumstances which
                    led to this event, various accounts have been given; but according to Dr M‘Crie,
                    “it is more than probable that he owed his deliverance to the comparative
                    indifference with which he and his brethren were now regarded by the French
                    court, who, having procured the consent of the parliament of Scotland to the
                    marriage of Queen Mary to the dauphin, and obtained possession of her person,
                    felt no longer any inclination to revenge the quarrels of the Scottish
                    clergy.”</p>
                <p>Knox immediately directed his course to England, where his merits and his
                    sufferings were neither unknown nor unregarded. Soon after he made his
                    appearance in London, he received an appointment to officiate at Berwick, where
                    he began to preach with his characteristic fervour and zeal. He exposed the
                    errors of popery with an unsparing hand, and his labours seem to have been
                    attended with no inconsiderable success. The tendency of his zeal was not
                    however calculated to recommend him to the bishop of the diocese, Dr Tonstall,
                    who, although a man of elegant learning, was deeply infected with the ancient
                    superstition. Having been accused of asserting that the sacrifice of the mass is
                    idolatrous, the preacher was cited to appear at Newcastle on the 4th of April
                    1550, before the bishop of Durham, and to give an account of his doctrine. This
                    prelate was attended by several of his clergy, as well as by various laymen, and
                    a large number of spectators was attracted by the peculiar circumstances of the
                    investigation. Knox entered into a copious defence of his opinions, and with the
                    utmost boldness proceeded to demonstrate that the mass is a superstitious and
                    idolatrous substitute for the genuine sacrament of the Lord’s supper. The
                    bishop, though he probably listened with surprize and indignation, did not
                    venture to inflict any ecclesiastical censure; and the fame of the obnoxious
                    preacher was extended by this attempt to restrain the boldness of his attacks on
                    the errors of the falling church. Having remained at Berwick till the close of
                    the year, he was afterwards removed to Newcastle. In December 1551, he was
                    appointed one of King Edward’s chaplains in ordinary, with an annual salary of
                    forty pounds, which at that period was no mean provision. The chaplains were six
                    in number; two of whom were to be in constant residence at court, while the
                    other four were employed in preaching in different parts of the kingdom. In the
                    course of this year, the Book of Common Prayer was subjected to a révisai, of
                    which it stood in considerable need; and Knox having been consulted among other
                    divines, was chiefly instrumental in procuring a material alteration in the
                    communion service, which at first was too favourable to the doctrine of the real
                    presence. One deep vestige of this doctrine is still preserved in the kneeling
                    posture of the communicants, which manifestly derives its origin from the popish
                    adoration of the host.</p>
                <p>The freedom of his discourses in the pulpit gave offence to various individuals,
                    and among others to the duke of Northumberland, warden general of the northern
                    marches; and having been accused of high misdemeanours, he was cited to appear
                    before the privy council, which at that period possessed an extensive and
                    ill-defined jurisdiction. But the malice of his enemies was altogether
                    ineffectual, and this call to the metropolis was followed by consequences very
                    different from those which they anticipated. He was fully cleared from every
                    imputation of blame; and having been employed to preach at court, he made so
                    favourable an impression on the young king that he expressed his anxiety to
                    promote him in the church. It was resolved by the council that during the
                    following year he should preach in London and the southern counties. Having
                    returned for a short time to Newcastle, he accordingly repaired to the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192947539" xml:id="kp-eb0712-7539-0749"/> metropolis in the
                    beginning of April 1553. Archbishop Cranmer had previously been directed by the
                    council to present him to the rectory of All-Hallows; but Knox declared that in
                    the existing state of the church he could not conscientiously accept of any
                    preferment. He was again summoned before the council, where he gave an
                    unreserved explanation of his sentiments on that subject. Nor could the promise
                    of much higher promotion induce him to disregard the admonitions of a scrupulous
                    conscience: the king, with the advice of his council, made him an offer of a
                    bishopric; but instead of availing himself of so favourable an avenue to worldly
                    honours, he declared the office of a bishop, as exercised in the English church,
                    to be destitute of divine authority. It is sufficiently evident that he
                    considered that establishment as but imperfectly reformed from the errors of
                    popery; and that, in his estimation, the new prelacy, retaining all the proud
                    trappings, as well as the political character of the old, was very widely
                    removed from the simplicity of an evangelical church. The premature death of the
                    king, on the 6th of July 1553, was fatal to the further progress of reformation,
                    and a cloud of spiritual darkness again overshadowed the land.</p>
                <p>During his residence at Berwick, Knox had formed a lasting attachment to Marjory
                    Bowes. Her father was Richard, the youngest son of Sir Ralph Bowes of
                    Streat-lam; her mother was Elizabeth, a daughter and coheiress of Sir Roger Aske
                    of Aske. The match was cordially approved by the mother of the young lady, but
                    having been opposed by her father, it was not concluded till after a
                    considerable interval. After the king’s death, he had some intention of settling
                    at Berwick, or in the immediate neighbourhood; but he speedily discovered that
                    he could not safely reside in a kingdom ruled by so bigoted and cruel a
                    sovereign. He therefore sailed for France, and landed at Dieppe on the 20th of
                    January 1554. Having lingered there till the last day of February, he pursued
                    his solitary way through France, and arrived in Switzerland; but in the
                    beginning of the ensuing month of May, he retraced his steps to Dieppe with the
                    view of obtaining intelligence from his friends in England. At that period, the
                    intercourse between different countries was slow and precarious; nor was this
                    the only occasion on which he returned to the same place for the same purpose.
                    While he continued to reside on the continent, he received remittances from his
                    friends in Scotland as well as in England, but his provision was neither certain
                    nor ample. Geneva became for some time the chief place of his abode, and here
                    his exile was cheered by the friendship of one of the most illustrious men of
                    the age. Calvin had now attained to the summit of his reputation. They embraced
                    the same opinions with respect to the leading doctrines of the Christian faith,
                    and in their personal character they exhibited several conspicuous points of
                    resemblance. In their notions of ecclesiastical polity they preserved the same
                    agreement; and the authority of Knox, supported by that of Calvin, has
                    contributed to establish in this country a simple mode of discipline and
                    worship, to which our ancestors adhered with unconquerable resolution, and in
                    support of which many of them were found ready and willing to shed their
                    blood.</p>
                <p>The leisure which he enjoyed at Geneva was profitably spent in study, to which he
                    devoted himself “with all the ardour of youth, although his age now bordered
                    upon fifty. It seems to have been at this time that he made himself master of
                    the Hebrew language, which he had no opportunity of acquiring in early life.”
                    Many pious and learned men had now been driven from England by the unrelenting
                    cruelty of Queen Mary, and most of them sought refuge in the protestant states
                    of Germany and Switzerland. Those who resorted to the imperial city of
                    Frankfort, were allowed the joint occupancy of a place of worship; and it was
                    unanimously resolved to discontinue the use of the surplice, the litany, the
                    audible responses, and some other superfluities which might rather excite the
                    surprize than the approbation of their foreign brethren. Having determined to
                    elect three pastors, they sent a letter of invitation to Knox, subscribed by
                    twenty-one of their number, at the the head of whom stands John Bale, the exiled
                    bishop of Ossory. It was not without some degree of reluctance that he consented
                    to leave his retreat at Geneva; he however repaired to Frankfort in the month of
                    November 1554, and entered upon the duties of his new charge, but his connexion
                    with this congregation proved a source of great uneasiness and mortification.
                    Various dissensions which arose among its members, were chiefly occasioned by a
                    difference of opinion as to the propriety of adhering to the English service;
                    and those dissensions were greatly fomented by Dr Cox, who had been preceptor to
                    King Edward, and who afterwards became bishop of Ely. In the progress of the
                    controversy, Knox appears to have acted with dignity and moderation, but the
                    ardent votaries of the liturgy were not easily diverted from their purpose; for
                    when all other expedients failed, two of their number, with the approbation of
                    others, sought a private interview with the magistrates, and accused him of
                    treason against the emperor Charles, his son Philip, and his aunt the queen of
                    England. This extraordinary charge was founded upon certain passages in his
                    tract published in 1554, under the title of “A Faythfull Admonition unto the
                    Professours of Gods Truthe in England.” Of the futility of such an accusation
                    the magistrates were sufficiently aware; but they nevertheless deemed it
                    advisable for him to withdraw from Frankfort, and he availed himself of the
                    suggestion which they conveyed to him. On the evening of the 25th of March 1555,
                    he delivered a farewell discourse to about fifty members of the congregation;
                    and on the following day they accompanied him several miles on his journey. He
                    immediately returned to Geneva, and he experienced a cordial welcome from
                    Calvin. There he continued till the month of August, when he again proceeded to
                    Dieppe; and having embarked in a vessel bound for Britain, he landed near the
                    eastern border of the two kingdoms about the end of autumn. On reaching Berwick,
                    he found his wife and mother living in comfortable circumstances. With them he
                    remained for some time, and afterwards pursued his journey to Edinburgh, where
                    he took up his abode with a citizen named John Syme, to whose house the friends
                    of reformation repaired as soon as they were aware of Knox’s arrival. Z</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the rigour of the penal laws, the votaries of the protestant
                    cause were not entirely extirpated or dispersed. The queen dowager, Mary of
                    Loraine, having succeeded in her attempt to supplant the earl of Arran, had been
                    appointed regent on the 10th of April 1554. She was sufficiently disposed to
                    continue the corruptions of the church, but several prudential considerations
                    restrained her from pursuing more violent measures. Some of the protestants who
                    were driven from England by the atrocities of Mary, a worthy daughter of Henry
                    the Eighth, were permitted to live in Scotland without molestation, and even to
                    meet, though with some degree of privacy, for the purpose of worshipping God
                    according to the dictates of their own conscience. William Harlow, who
                    afterwards became minister of St Cuthbert’s, is mentioned as the first preacher
                    who returned from the south at this critical period; and, in different parts of
                    the country, he continued his ministrations till the final establishment of the
                    reformation. His endeavours were ably seconded by John Willock, whom Knox found
                    residing at Edinburgh as an envoy from Anne duchess of Friesland; for he had
                    been entrusted with a commission for arranging the commercial relations between
                    the two countries. He was born in Ayrshire, and had originally been a Franciscan
                    friar; but speedily quitting his <pb break="no" facs="nls:192947552"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-7552-0750"/>monastery and renouncing the mass-book, he sought
                    refuge in England, where he was appointed chaplain to the duke of Suffolk. After
                    the death of the young king, he was again compelled to change his place of
                    residence, and he then settled in the town of Embden, and followed the practice
                    of physic. He thus, became known to the duchess, who was favourably inclined to
                    the reformation of religion; and his mission to his native country afforded him
                    peculiar opportunities of promoting that cause in which he felt so deep an
                    interest. He became known to the leaders of the protestant party, who privately
                    resorted to him from the desire of religious edification. At this period, few
                    individuals had openly renounced the Romish creed; and of those who were most
                    inclined to the protestant doctrines, very few had ventured to discontinue their
                    attendance at mass. Knox was deservedly scandalized at this want of firmness and
                    consistency: a meeting, attended by William Maitland of Lethington and other
                    leaders of the party, was held for the avowed purpose of discussing the
                    lawfulness of such compliances; and Knox succeeded in his attempt to convince
                    them that all participation in the worship of the Romish church was to be
                    avoided by those who were convinced of her gross errors. Nor were his exertions
                    confined to the metropolis. He accompanied John Erskine of Dun to his seat in
                    the neighbourhood of Montrose; and during a visit of a month he preached every
                    day, being attended by the principal persons of the adjacent district. On his
                    return to the south, we find him residing at Calder-house, the seat of Sir James
                    Sandilands, afterwards Lord Torphichen, an early, zealous, and consistent friend
                    of the reformation. In the hall of this baron, who was preceptor in Scotland of
                    the knights of St John of Jerusalem, he preached and administered the communion.
                    Here his ministrations were attended by several persons of distinction; and
                    among these were Archibald, Lord Lome, afterwards earl of Argyle, John, Lord
                    Erskine, afterwards ’ earl of Mar, and James Stewart, prior of St Andrew's,
                    afterwards earl of Moray; all of whom received religious impressions which
                    influenced the future course of their lives. Early in the subsequent year, 1556,
                    he was accompanied to the district of Kyle by Lockhart of Bar and Campbell of
                    Kinc-ancleuch. This division of Ayrshire had been the principal seat of the
                    Lollards in Scotland, and it then contained many friends of the purer religion.
                    They were not therefore unprepared for his reception: he preached not only in
                    the town of Ayr, but likewise in the houses of Bar, Kinean clench, Carn ell,
                    Ochiltree, and Gadgirth, and in several of these places the holy communion was
                    now dispensed. Before Easter, he paid a visit to Finlayston, the residence of
                    Alexander carl of Glencairn, one of the most strenuous friends of the
                    reformation. In this baronial castle he also preached and administered the
                    sacrament. Returning to Calder-house, he next determined to visit his friends in
                    the north; and during his second residence at Dun, he was emboldened to preach
                    in a more public manner. Many gentlemen of that vicinity made an open profession
                    of the reformed faith; and, in order to strengthen their cause, they entered
                    into a solemn engagement to renounce the communion of the popish church, and, to
                    the utmost of their ability, to. promote the pure preaching of the gospel.
                    “This,” says Dr M‘Crie, “seems to have been the first of those religious bonds
                    or covenants, by which the confederation of the protestants in Scotland was so
                    frequently ratified.”</p>
                <p>As he now begun to preach more openly, the ecclesiastics felt a natural alarm for
                    the safety of a tottering church; and the friars testified their zeal by urging
                    the bishops to proceed with rigour against such an offender. He was accordingly
                    cited to appear before an assembly of the clergy, to be held at Edinburgh in
                    Blackfriars church, on the 15th of May; but when they found that he did not
                    shrink from this discussion, and that he was supported by some persons of
                    influence, they sought a pretext for superseding the citation, on the ground of
                    its informality. On the very day which had been appointed for his appearance, he
                    preached in the bishop of Dunkeld’s house to a much larger auditory than had
                    previously attended him in Edinburgh; and during the ensuing ten days, he
                    regularly preached twice a-day in the same place, without being exposed to any
                    molestation. About this period the Earl Marischal attended one of his evening
                    discourses; and it may be regarded as a proof of his favourable impression that
                    he united with the earl of Glencairn in an earnest request, that Knox would
                    address to the queen regent such a letter as might induce her to extend her
                    protection to the protestant preachers. A letter was accordingly addressed to
                    her, and it was delivered by the earl of Glencairn, but it does not appear to
                    have produced any change in her sentiments. This letter he afterwards published,
                    with some additions. In the mean time he received from the English congregation
                    at Geneva an invitation to become one of their pastors. He readily listened to
                    their call, and made arrangements for removing thither, accompanied by his wife,
                    as well as by her mother, who had now lost her husband. He embarked them on
                    board a vessel bound for Dieppe, and paid another visit to the several places
                    where he had disseminated the truth of the gospel. He visited the earl of Argyle
                    at Castle Campbell, and there he repeatedly preached to such an auditory as
                    could be assembled. Having thus made no inconsiderable progress in preparing his
                    countrymen for a more general reception of the reformed doctrines, he took his
                    leave in the month of July 1556, and joining his family at Dieppe, he again
                    directed his course to Geneva. His colleague in his new office was Christopher
                    Goodman, B.D., an Englishman, who afterwards became a clergyman of the church of
                    Scotland.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Brook’s Lives

                    consisted of the exiles who had withdrawn from Frankfort in consequence of the
                    dissensions already mentioned. The two pastors lived together on terms of the
                    greatest cordiality. Knox likewise enjoyed the friendship of Calvin and Beza;
                    and the two years which he spent in this vocation are described as the most
                    tranquil of his public life. At this period was published a directory for
                    worship and discipline, frequently described as the Order of Geneva; but it had
                    been composed at Frankfort by Knox, Whittingham, Fox, Gilby, and T. Cole. The
                    same directory was afterwards adopted by the reformed church of Scotland.<note

                    facs="nls:192947565" xml:id="kp-eb0712-7565-0751"/>quitted the kingdom, they
                    renewed the citation for his appearance; and those who had no inclination to
                    encounter such a disputant, now found themselves at liberty to proceed against
                    him as a contumacious heretic. He was accordingly condemned to suffer death by
                    fire; and as the sentence could not be executed on his person, it was executed
                    on his effigy, which was in due form committed to the flames at the cross of
                    Edinburgh. From this sentence he prepared an appeal, which was afterwards
                    printed under the title of “The Appellation of John Knoxe from the cruell and
                    most unjust sentence pronounced against him by the false Bishoppes and Clergie
                    of Scotland.” In the course of the year which followed his return to Geneva, two
                    citizens of Edinburgh, James Syme, and James Baron, were the bearers of an
                    invitation for him to resume his evangelical labours in his native country. They
                    were furnished with credentials from the earl of Glencairn, and the lords
                    Erskine, Lome, and James Stewart. After consulting Calvin and the other
                    ministers of Geneva, he determined to devote himself to this honourable and
                    dangerous service; and he again pursued his way to Dieppe, where he arrived in
                    October 1557. He had however the mortification of receiving letters which
                    entirely disconcerted his plan; for he was informed that some of the protestants
                    already repented of the invitation which had been sent to him, and that the
                    great body of them seemed to waver in their purpose. He lost no time in
                    addressing a letter to the noblemen who had subscribed the credentials; and it
                    may easily be supposed that he did not fail to upbraid them for their want of
                    firmness and consistency. In a similar strain, he likewise wrote to Erskine of
                    Dun, Wishart of Pittarow, and to some other individuals of the protestant party.
                    He lingered in France to await the course of events; and as he was familiarly
                    acquainted with the French tongue, his talents as a preacher were not in the
                    mean time unemployed. About this period, he paid a visit to Lyon, and he is
                    known to have preached at Rochelle. A protestant congregation had recently been
                    formed at Dieppe; and he was now elected one of its pastors, being associated
                    with Delaporte. So successful were their exertions, that some of the principal
                    persons of the town were induced to renounce popery, and a general improvement
                    began to be produced in the morals of the inhabitants. Discouraged by the aspect
                    of affairs in Scotland, he at length determined to revisit Geneva, where he
                    again made his appearance in the beginning of the year 1558. It was at this
                    period that some of the most learned members of his congregation were engaged in
                    preparing an English version of the Bible, and he is said to have had some share
                    in so laudable an undertaking.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Archbishop Newcome’s Historical View of the English
                    Biblical Translations, p. G8. Dublin, 1732, 8vo.</p></note> The New Testament
                    was printed at Geneva in 1557, and the entire Bible in 15β0. This version,
                    commonly called the Geneva Bible, is allowed by competent judges to possess
                    great merit; and, in the opinion of Dr Geddes, it is generally superior to the
                    version executed under the authority of King James. Of the former version, says
                    Dr M‘Crie, it is evident that his translators made great use; “and if they had
                    followed it still more, the version which they have given us would, upon the
                    whole, have been improved.”</p>
                <p>In the course of the year 1558, Knox published three different works. One of
                    these was the Appellation. Another, which has also been mentioned in a former
                    page, was “The copic of a Lettre delivered to the Ladie Marie, Regent of
                    Scotland.” The third and most remarkable of these tracts bears the title of “The
                    first Blast of the Trumpet against the monstruous Regiment of Wemen.” This
                    anonymous work, directed against the political government of females, attracted
                    a very considerable degree of attention. It was speedily answered by John
                    Aylmer, who in due time became bishop of London. The doctrine of Knox as to the
                    inexpediency of female rule was afterwards controverted by David Chalmers of
                    Ormond, and by John Lesley, bishop of Ross. Whatever opinion may be formed of
                    his theory, it must at least be admitted that, either in England or Scotland, he
                    had seen nothing to reconcile him to the practice; and, in one of those
                    countries, the regimen of a woman might with too much justice be termed
                    monstrous. His literary labours were interrupted by the renewal of an invitation
                    from the Scotish protestants; and at the beginning of the year 1559, he bade a
                    final adieu to Geneva, having previously been presented with the freedom of the
                    city. Leaving his family behind, he once more proceeded to Dieppe, where he
                    arrived in the month of March; and having ascertained that he would not be
                    permitted to pass through England, he embarked for Leith on the 22d of April,
                    and was safely landed on the 2d of the following month.</p>
                <p>The popish church of Scotland was now approaching its crisis, which the presence
                    of Knox had no small tendency to hasten. The queen regent, who for some time
                    thought it necessary to dissemble her real sentiments, had lately evinced a
                    fixed resolution to oppose the reformation with all the weight of her authority;
                    and the fires of persecution had been rekindled by Hamilton, the profligate
                    archbishop of St Andrews. Walter Mill, a venerable priest, who had attained the
                    age of eighty-two, was brought to the stake on the 28th of August 1558. This
                    atrocious execution had such an effect in rousing the popular indignation, that
                    the dread of the civil or ecclesiastical authority could no longer restrain the
                    people from making an open avowal of their adherence to the reformed doctrines;
                    while their spiritual guides, Harlow, Douglas, Methven, and a few others, began,
                    with less fear of detection, to preach and to administer the sacraments. In the
                    month of October, Willock again returned from Embden, and brought a new
                    accession of talent and zeal. The death of the English queen, which took place
                    on the 17th of November 1558, was another event that produced considerable
                    influence on the affairs of the neighbouring states. The queen regent was
                    however prepared to adopt the most violent measures. Several of the preachers,
                    Willock, Harlow, Methven, and Christison, were cited to appear at Stirling
                    before the high court of justiciary on the 10th of May, that is, eight days
                    after Knox’s return; and very soon after his arrival had been announced to Mary,
                    he was proclaimed a rebel and an outlaw. The four preachers -were outlawed for
                    non-appearance, and a fine was levied on their sureties. After remaining a
                    single day in the metropolis, he hastened to Dundee, where the chief protestants
                    of Angus and Mearns were then assembled. They proceeded to Perth, and there he
                    preached a sermon against the idolatry of the mass and of image-worship. After
                    the conclusion of the service, a riot was casually excited among the common
                    people; and, before it was terminated, the monasteries of the Dominican and
                    Franciscan friars, with that of the Carthusian monks, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192947578" xml:id="kp-eb0712-7578-0752"/>were totally demolished. The
                    queen, who was probably glad of such a pretext, collected a considerable army,
                    and advanced upon Perth; but she found the protestants so well prepared for
                    resistance, that she did not hazard an attack. She proposed and ratified terms
                    of accommodation, which she speedily shewed a strong disposition to disregard.
                    In order to ascertain the strength of their party, and to consolidate its union,
                    they formed a religious bond or covenant, which received many signatures in
                    different parts of the kingdom. From this period, they began to be distinguished
                    by the name of the Congregation, and their noble leaders were commonly described
                    as the Lords of the Congregation.</p>
                <p>Òn his return from Perth, he preached at Anstruther and Craill. Disregarding the
                    admonitions of his friends, and the threats of the archbishop, he next preached
                    in the cathedral of St Andrews, having selected the appropriate subject of our
                    Saviour’s driving the profane traders from the holy temple. On the three ensuing
                    days he lifted up his warning voice in the same place; and so signal was the
                    success which attended his efforts, that the magistrates and the inhabitants
                    resolved to establish the reformed worship in that city; the pictures and images
                    were removed from the churches, and, on the 14th of June, the monasteries were
                    defaced. He reached the capital in the end of the same month: on the day of his
                    arrival he preached in St Giles’s, and on the following day in the Abbey church.
                    On the 7th of July, the body of the protestant inhabitants of Edinburgh elected
                    him as their minister, nor did he decline the invitation. His wife followed him
                    from Geneva; and her mother, after visiting her relations in England, likewise
                    came to end her days in Scotland. But he was soon disturbed in his new
                    functions, in consequence of the military occupation of the city by the troops
                    of the queen regent. He now made an extensive circuit in the southern and
                    eastern districts of the kingdom, visiting Kelso, Jedburgh, Dumfries, Ayr,
                    Stirling, Perth, Brechin, Montrose, Dundee, and St Andrews; nor can we doubt
                    that the impressions produced by such a missionary were great and beneficial.
                    After this period he was deeply engaged in the political as well as the
                    ecclesiastical transactions of the Congregation; and the vigour of his talents,
                    with the decision of his character, was conspicuously displayed in the steps
                    which led to the establishment of the reformed religion. Knox, as well as
                    Willock, concurred in advising the suspension of Mary from the office of regent.
                    For the space of twelve months, the kingdom was infested with a civil war, in
                    which French and English troops supported their respective allies. The contest,
                    which had not been marked by many of the usual atrocities of intestine warfare,
                    terminated in the month of July 1560. Parliament soon afterwards assembled; and
                    in the course of a few days the reformed religion was established by the
                    authority of the legislature.</p>
                <p>Knox, after officiating for several months at St Andrews, had returned to
                    Edinburgh at the end of April, and continued to exercise his functions during
                    the siege of Leith. Before the close of the year, he was visited with a severe
                    domestic affliction in the loss of his wife, who left two children of tender
                    years. The young queen returned from France on the 21st of August 1561. Not many
                    days after her arrival, she sent for the reformer, of whose powerful influence
                    she must have been fully aware; but neither this nor any of their subsequent
                    interviews produced the effects which she seems to have anticipated. Such topics
                    as Mary introduced he discussed with undaunted freedom, though it cannot with
                    justice be affirmed that he treated her with incivility. She certainly did not
                    overawe him with her royal presence, or render him less disposed to use his
                    utmost endeavour in destroying the fabric of ancient superstition. The Scotish
                    reformation differed in many respects from that of the neighbouring kingdom. In
                    the one case, the most essential trappings of a proud popish prelacy were left
                    uncurtailed, nor was the church sufficiently purified from popish devices and
                    observances.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The genuine
                    high-churchmen seem to feel some lingering regret for the discontinuance of the
                    popish prayers for the dead. “In truth,” says Mr Waddington, “to pray for the
                    souls of our departed friends is the most natural and pardonable error of piety;
                    and although it be dangerous and improper to inculcate as a church doctrine the
                    efficacy of such prayers, it would neither be right to discourage their private
                    and individual effusion, nor easy to disprove the possibility of their
                    acceptance.” (Present Condition and Prospect» of the Greek or Oriental Church,
                    p. 37∙ Lond. 1829, 8vo.) “Some persons,” remarks Mr Palmer, “will perhaps say
                    that this sort of prayer is unscriptural; that it infers either the Romish
                    doctrine of purgatory, or something else which is contrary to the revealed will
                    of God, or the nature of things. But when we reflect that the great divines of
                    the English church have not taken this ground, and that the church of England
                    herself has never formally condemned prayers for the dead, but only omitted them
                    in her liturgy, we may perhaps think that there are some other reasons to
                    justify that omission.” <hi rend="italic">{Origines</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    with a considerable degree of propriety have been entitled “The Conformity of
                    the Church of England with the Church of Rome.” Among other important facts, he
                    is pleased to state that “the bishops who rule the churches of these realms were
                    validly ordained by others, who by means of an unbroken spiritual descent of
                    ordinations derived their mission from the apostles, and from our Lord. This
                    continual descent is evident to any one who chooses to investigate it. Let him
                    read the catalogues of our bishops ascending up to the most remote period. Our
                    ordinations descend in a direct unbroken line from Peter and Paul, the apostles
                    of the circumcision and the Gentiles. These great apostles successively ordained
                    Linus, Cletus, and Clement, bishops of Rome; and the apostolical line of
                    succession was regularly continued from them to Celestine, Gregory, and
                    Vitalianus, who ordained Patrick bishop for the Irish, and Augustine and
                    Theodore for the English. And from those times an uninterrupted series of valid
                    ordinations have carried down the apostolical succession in our churches, even
                    to the present day. There is not a bishop, priest, or deacon amongst us, who
                    cannot, if he pleases, trace his own spiritual descent from Saint Peter and
                    Saint Paul.” (Vol. ii. p. 249.) To this last assertion it is only necessary to
                    oppose another; namely, that there is not a single bishop, priest, or deacon,
                    who can trace his own spiritual origin for one half of the requisite period. But
                    what advantage could possibly result from their tracing it with the utmost
                    certainty? Till they make an unequivocal display of their miraculous powers, we
                    must totally disregard their extraordinary pretensions. By arguments equally
                    logical and cogent, the bishop of Rome undertakes to prove that he inherits all
                    the spiritual gifts and graces of St. Peter, and to these is fully entitled to
                    add all the temporal power and possessions to which he can extend his impious
                    hand. This delirious dream of apostolical succession is disgraceful to the
                    protestant name; and all those whom it bewilders would best maintain their
                    consistency by returning to the bosom of their mother chruch.</p></note> The

                    tinctured with popery; insomuch that she was dissatisfied with the twenty-ninth
                    article, as implying a denial of the doctrine of the real presence. She
                    reluctantly permitted the crucifix and tapers to be removed from the altar in
                    her chapel. It seems to have been by her private authority that a clause,
                    unsanctioned by the convocation, was added to the twentieth article;<note

                    church; and thus a protestant body might have, and in more instances than one
                    has actually had, a popish head. Pluralities and non-residence, two manifest
                    remnants of popery, have been closely interwoven with an establishment, in which
                    the idle splendour of one class of ecclesiastics is placed in so indecent a
                    contrast with the laborious poverty of another.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bishop Lowth has stated that “there were some
                    in England who, by the pope’s authority, possessed at once twenty ecclesiastical
                    benefices and dignities, with dispensation moreover for holding as many more as
                    they could lawfully procure, without limitation of number.” (Life of William of
                    Wykeham, Bishop of Winchester, p. 28, 3d edit. Oxford, 1777, 8vo.) In what
                    protestant country, except England and Ireland, is the system of pluralities and
                    non-residence maintained to any extent? They are an intolerable nuisance, which
                    even there must very speedily be abated. Even the regius professor of divinity
                    at Oxford is convinced that there is a great and general “demand for church
                    reform and as Dr Burton is a man of sense as well as learning, he must likewise
                    be aware that, when there is a great and general demand for any commodity, it
                    can in most cases be supplied. His notions of reform, as the reader may easily
                    conjecture, are not extravagant; and some of his suggestions are not deficient
                    in worldly wisdom. It is notorious, as he avers, that many clergymen enjoy the
                    income of their benefices, because the presentations have been bought and sold;
                    and “if any legislative enactment should reduce their incomes, the patrons must
                    in all fairness refund part of the purchase money·” (Thoughts upon the Demand
                    for Church Reform, p. 38. Oxford, 1831, 8vo.) All the lay-dealers in such
                    articles must therefore perceive the dangerous tendency of a reform in the
                    church.</p></note></p>
                <p>At this period, the metropolis of Scotland contained only one parish church. Knox
                    was at first assisted by a reader, named John Cairns. It was then his regular
                    practice to preach twice every Sunday, and thrice on other days of the week; but
                    in the year 1563, John Craig, minister of Canongate, was appointed his
                    colleague. In 1562, he had for three successive days been engaged at Maybole in
                    a public disputation with Quintin Kennedy, abbot of Crossragwell; and in the
                    course of the following year, an account of it was printed at Edinburgh, under
                    this title: “Heir followeth the coppie of the Ressoning which was betuix the
                    Abbote of Crosragucll and John Knox.” Another learned catholic, Ninian Winzet,
                    addressed to him a “Buke of fourscoir thre Questionis,” to which it was his
                    intention to publish an answer, though he seems to have been prevented by his
                    other avocations, which were sufficiently numerous. After this period he
                    incurred the hot indignation of the queen for having, in one of his public
                    discourses, animadverted with great freedom on her intended marriage. During one
                    of their interviews, she wept bitter tears of anger; and some modern historians
                    have been not a little scandalized at his want of gallantry. In the month of
                    December 1563, he was summoned before the privy council on a charge of high
                    treason, for having written a circular letter to the protestant gentlemen, in
                    reference to the trial of two persons who had been indicted for a riot in the
                    chapel royal. Of this charge he was fully acquitted, to the great disappointment
                    of Mary and the popish party.</p>
                <p>After having continued a widower for more than three years, he married Margaret
                    Stewart, daughter of the good Lord Ochiltree. This marriage took place in March
                    1564, when he had attained the age of fifty-nine. The noble family with which he
                    thus became connected was descended from Robert duke of Albany, second son of
                    King Robert the Second. Knox was again brought before the privy council, for
                    having, in a sermon preached in St Giles’s on the 19th of August 1565, used
                    certain expressions, or rather quoted certain texts, which gave great offence to
                    the king, who was present, and applied them to himself. He was for a short time
                    prohibited from preaching. Early in the following year, Mary subscribed the
                    catholic league for the extirpation of the protestants; and if she had not been
                    controlled by several prudential considerations, she seemed sufficiently
                    prepared to adopt extreme measures. When she returned from Dunbar, soon after
                    the death of Rizzio, he retired from Edinburgh, and sought refuge in Kyle; nor
                    does he appear to have resumed his pastoral care till after the final overthrow
                    of her authority. Towards the close of the year he prepared to visit England,
                    where his two ⅛ons were residing with some of their mother’s relations for the
                    purpose of receiving their education.</p>
                <p>He appears to have returned home soon after the queen had plunged herself into
                    ruin by her marriage with Bothwell. He was a member of the general assembly
                    convened at Edinburgh on the 25th of June 1567; and he preached a sermon at the
                    coronation of the young king, which took place at Stirling on the 29th of the
                    ensuing month. The assassination of the regent Moray, and the civil troubles
                    which ensued, depressed his mind and affected his health: in October 1570 he
                    felt a stroke of apoplexy, which however was of so mitigated a kind that he was
                    able to appear in the pulpit; but his strength was greatly impaired by his
                    unceasing exertions, and he never recovered any considerable degree of vigour.
                    Before the end of that year, the freedom of his animadversions in the pulpit
                    gave such deep offence to Kirealdy, governor of the castle, that at length he
                    found it expedient to change his habitation. He quitted the metropolis on the
                    5th of May 1571, and retired to St Andrews, the scene of his early labours. Here
                    in the following year he published “An Answer to a Letter of a Jesuit named
                    Tyric.” In a state of great debility he returned to Edinburgh towards the end of
                    August 1572; and on the 24th of November he closed his most laborious and most
                    honourable career, after having attained the age of sixty-seven. He left two
                    sons by the first, and three daughters by the second marriage. Both his sons
                    studied at St John’s College, Cambridge, and both of them became fellows.
                    Nathaniel, the cider of the two, took the degree of A. Μ., and died in the year
                    1580. Eleazer, the younger son, proceeded B. D., and was one of the preachers of
                    the university. Having been collated to the vicarage of Clacton-Magna, he died
                    in 1591, and was buried in the college chapel. The three daughters, named
                    Martha, Margaret, and Elizabeth, were married to three clergymen, James Fleming,
                    Zachary Pont, and John Welsh. The widow of Knox became the wife of Sir Andrew
                    Ker of Fadounside, who is described as a strenuous supporter of the
                    reformation.</p>
                <p>The vigorous and ardent mind of Knox was lodged in a diminutive and feeble body,
                    which had been wasted by various hardships, and by intense mental exertion. His
                    natural talents were improved by no mean attainments of learning, and he was
                    eminently distinguished by an impetuous and impressive eloquence, which gave him
                    a great ascendency among his countrymen. That he was a man of fervent and
                    habitual piety, will not be disputed by any one whose prejudices do not prevent
                    him from forming a correct estimate of his character. From an early period of
                    his life, he devoted his entire energies to the best of all causes; and, in the
                    hand of Providence, he was the great instrument which rescued his countrymen
                    from the fangs of papal tyranny and superstition; nor is any other name entitled
                    to be mentioned with equal honour in the annals of Scotish history. Of civil as
                    well as ecclesiastical tyranny he was a decided enemy; and his writings contain
                    some bold speculations on the subject of government. No man was more upright in
                    his intentions, or more disinterested in his motives. That the impetuosity of
                    his character occasionally impelled him beyond the bounds of moderation may be
                    fully admitted without any diminution of the respect<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192947604" xml:id="kp-eb0712-7604-0754"/> due to his name: he was
                    placed in a situation which required great energy and decision; and a person
                    chiefly distinguished by the gentler virtues, would have been very indifferently
                    prepared to encounter the boisterous elements with which he was destined to
                    contend. It is not to be concealed that he was not exempted from that spirit of
                    intolerance which, in a greater or less degree, belonged at that period to every
                    sect and denomination of Christians. He was as little disposed to tolerate the
                    mass as the mass priests were to tolerate those whom they termed heretics. The
                    principles of mutual toleration were little understood or relished; and almost
                    every one who possessed the power betrayed the inclination of imposing, by very
                    ungentle means, his own creed upon his neighbours.</p>
                <p>Beside the works which have already been mentioned, he composed various others,
                    which are accurately enumerated by his biographer, “His practical treatises,”
                    says Dr M‘Crie, <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">are</hi> among the
                    least known, but most valuable, of his writings. In depth of religious feeling,
                    and in power of utterance, they are superior to any works of the same kind which
                    appeared in that age. The thoughts are often original, and always expressed in a
                    style of originality, possessing great dignity and strength, without affectation
                    or extravagance.” The work by which he is best known as an author is “The
                    Historie of the Reformatioun of Rcligioun within the Realm of Scotland.” So
                    early as the year 1586, an octavo edition of it, to the extent of twelve hundred
                    copies, was undertaken in England by Vautrollier, a well-known printer; but when
                    ready, or nearly ready for publication, it was seized by the command of
                    Archbishop Ŵhitgiñ. Some imperfect copies, all of them wanting the beginning and
                    the end, have however survived this visitation of the protestant inquisitor. An
                    edition was afterwards published by David Buchanan, who has taken very
                    unwarrantable liberties with the text. Lond. 1644, fol. Edinb. 1644, 4to. He has
                    suppressed various passages, and interpolated others; and the fifth book, which
                    has not been found in any manuscript, is perhaps his sole composition. A genuine
                    edition, “taken from the original manuscript in the university library of
                    Glasgow,” was at length published by Matthew Crawford, professor of
                    ecclesiastical history in the university of Edinburgh. Edinb. 1732, fol. A
                    collective edition of his works, executed with fidelity and elegance, might be
                    preferable to any monument of bronze or marble that could be erected to the
                    memory of this great benefactor of his native country. (x.)</p>
