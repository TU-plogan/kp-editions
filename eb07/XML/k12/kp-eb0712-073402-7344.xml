                <p><label type="entry">KIRCUDBRIGHT</label>, a county in Scotland, situated between
                    54. 43. and 55. 19. north latitude, and 3. 33. and 4. 34. west longitude from
                    Greenwich, is bounded on the north by the shires of Dumfries and Ayr, on the
                    east and south by the Solway Frith and the Irish Sea, and on the est by the
                    county of Wigtown. It derives its name from <hi rend="italic">Caer,</hi> a fort,
                    the Anglo-Saxons having erected a fort in honour of St Cuthbert, near the site
                    of the present Kirkcudbright (originally <hi rend="italic">Caer Cuthbert),</hi>
                    the county town. It is in length from east to west about forty-eight miles, it
                    varies in breadth from thirty to seventeen miles, and it contains 882^ square
                    miles, or o64,480 English acres. This district is commonly called the <hi
                    rend="italic">stewartry,</hi> not the shire, of Kirkcudbright; and its judge,
                    whose powers and duties are the same as those of a sheriff, is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">steward.</hi> The appellation of stewartry had its rise in the
                    ancient tenure by which it was held, and the subsequent forfeiture of its lords;
                    but the distinction between stewartry and sheriffdom is in this case purely
                    nominal. Kirkcudbright is one of the two counties comprehended under the general
                    name of Galloway, Wigtownshire on the west being the other.</p>
                <p>About two thirds of the surface is mountainous. A range of mountains stretches
                    along the whole northern boundary, in the form of a vast amphitheatre, embracing
                    nearly half the county; on the boundary with Ayrshire they are not much inferior
                    in height to any in the south of Scotland. There are also some considerable
                    mountains on the southern extremity, such as Criffel, 1831 feet in height;
                    Cairnsmore, 2597; and Cairnharrow, 1110. The high lands are for the most part
                    covered with heath, except on a part of the northern boundary, where a narrow
                    tract of green hills runs out between the counties of Ayr and Dumfries; and many
                    of them are wet and mossy. In the middle of the district, the declivity is so
                    gentle that the river Dee, at thirty miles from its mouth, is only 150 feet
                    above the level of the sea; yet, even in the interior, there is no great extent
                    of level ground, the greater part of the surface being occupied by rocky knolls,
                    steep banks, and hills of a moderate elevation. On the coast, also, hills rise
                    almost everywhere to the height of several hundred feet. The district is studded
                    with a great number of lakes, of which there is one or more in almost every
                    parish, though few of them are considerable. As there is not much full-grown
                    wood, and the plantations are but partial, and for the most part not of many
                    years’ growth, the general appearance of the stewartry is that of a bleak,
                    exposed country, on which labour has been but recently employed, and where its
                    efforts must always be confined to a comparatively small field. Yet it contains
                    many spots of great natural beauty, particularly on the coast, where the sea has
                    in several places formed deep bays, surrounded with high grounds, some of which
                    are fringed with coppice.</p>
                <p>The soil of the lower grounds is, for the most part, of a hazel colour, sometimes
                    inclining to red, and seems to be chiefly composed of argillaceous schistus in a
                    state of decomposition. It is seldom of any great depth, and the rock, often
                    rising above the surface, gives a rugged and sterile appearance to much even of
                    the arable land. This soil is, however, in many instances possessed of great
                    natural fertility, not soon injured by wet seasons, and affords plentiful crops
                    and fine natural herbage. Clay is of no great extent, and found chiefly on the
                    banks of the rivers. The smooth round hills accessible to the plough have, for
                    the most part, a close subsoil, here called <hi rend="italic">till,</hi> and do
                    not, therefore, admit of being profitably cultivated but after an interval of
                    several years pasturage. Tracts of moss, commonly from four to eight feet deep,
                    extend over a tenth or twelfth part of the whole county.</p>
                <p>Much of the mountainous district is composed of granite. According to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Agricultural Survey,</hi> there are three several districts of
                    this rock, which occupy nearly a fourth of the surface. Strata of very
                    dissimilar substances, to which Dr Hutton has given the general name of
                    schistus, prevail in the lower parts. Some are of a hard, compact grain, of a
                    blue or grayish-brown colour, for the most part breaking irregularly, but often
                    in parallel plates, of which coarse slates have been made. With these are
                    intermixed layers of a soft argillaceous stone, which readily yields to the
                    weather, and is popularly known by the name of <hi rend="italic">slate
                    band.</hi> These rocks, which also occupy a large part of the district, are
                    sometimes traversed by dykes of porphyry, and also by granite. In the
                    neighbourhood of Dumfries the prevailing rock is sandstone. Limestone is found
                    at Kirkbean, on the Nith, theonlyplace in thecounty whereitis wrought; and there
                    are also some promising indications of coal on the estate of Arbigland, near
                    Dumfries. In the parish of Colvend, on the Solway Frith, there is a quarry which
                    affords millstones. Lead mines were wrought in Minnι-gaff, on the western
                    boundary, for many years, but have <pb break="no" facs="nls:192947357"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-7357-0735"/>been discontinued. Iron ore abounds, but, from the
                    want of coal and wood, it is of little value. On the estate of Mr Murray of
                    Broughton, near Gatehouse, copper has lately been discovered, and is now being
                    wrought by an English company.</p>
                <p>The rivers are, the Nith, which separates this county from Dumfriesshire for
                    about nine miles on the northeast; the Urr, which flows south-east by the
                    village of Dalbeattie, and is navigable five or six miles for small vessels; the
                    Dee, the largest river, which enters Loch Ken, a lake almost in the centre of
                    the county, about eight miles in length, and in some places a mile in breadth,
                    and, giving its name to the river which issues from the lake, falls into the
                    Solway Frith about five miles below the town of Kirkcudbright. It is navigable
                    for two miles above this town for vessels of 200 tons. In spring-tides the water
                    rises about thirty feet at Kirkcudbright, where there is a well-sheltered
                    natural harbour, of easy access. For the last seven or eight miles of its course
                    the banks of the Dee are planted. St Mary’s Isle, near Kirkcudbright, is a
                    highly ornamented spot; and the Little Ross, a beautiful island, is situated at
                    its mouth. There are other small islands, as those of Fleet, Knockbrex, and
                    Heston, scattered along the coast. The salmon fishery on this river was rented,
                    some years ago, at L.900. The Fleet is remarkable for the picturesque scenery on
                    its banks; but, as its stream is circuitous, and it often changes its course, a
                    canal of about a mile in length has been cut, at the sole expense of Mr Murray
                    of Broughton, by means of which the navigation to Gatehouse, a village about
                    four miles from the sea, has been rendered easy. The Cree, a more considerable
                    river, separates this county from Wigtonshire, and flows into the bay of Wigton,
                    from whence it is navigable to the small harbour of Carty, a little below
                    Newton-Stewart. The stewartry is everywhere supplied with pure springs and
                    rivulets. Chalybeate springs are also numerous, one of which, Lochenbreck, in
                    the parish of Balmaghie, seven miles from Gatehouse, is said not to be inferior
                    in medicinal virtues to any in the kingdom.</p>
                <p>The landed property is not divided into large estates. Out of 1043, their number
                    in 1808, as given in the <hi rend="italic">Agricultural Survey,</hi> 972 are
                    stated to have been below L.500 a year. The valued rent, which was taken in
                    1642, is L.l 14,637. 2s. Scots; the real rent, in 1808, was estimated at
                    L.167,125 sterling, and in 1831 at L.213,308. Many of the smaller proprietors
                    cultivate their own estates. According to the work just referred to, almost half
                    the county is held under deeds of entail, many of which have been executed very
                    lately. “The condition of the peasantry, at a period not very remote, seems to
                    have been much depressed, and the state of husbandry rude and barbarous in the
                    extreme.” (Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Survey</hi>.) Referring to the year 1720,
                    John Maxwell of Munshes observes that “the tenants in general lived very meanly,
                    on kail, groats, milk, graddon ground in querns turned by the hand, and the
                    grain dried in a pot, together with a crock ewe now and then about Martinmas.
                    They were clothed very plainly, and their habitations were most uncomfortable.
                    Their general wear was of cloth made of waulked plaiding, black and white wool
                    mixed, very coarse, and the cloth rarely dyed. Their hose were made of white
                    plaiding cloth, sewed together, with single-soled shoes, and a black or blue
                    bonnet, none having hats but the lairds In</p>
                <p>1725 potatoes were first introduced into this stewartry by William Hyland, from
                    Ireland, who carried them on horses’ backs to Edinburgh, where he sold them by
                    pounds and ounces. During these times, when potatoes were not generally used in
                    this country, there was for the most part a great want of food, bordering on
                    famine; for, in the stewartry of Kirkcudbright, there was not as much victual
                    produced as was necessary for supplying the inhabitants. The pròduce of the
                    country in general was gray corn; and you might have travelled from Dumfries to
                    Kirkcudbright, which is twenty-seven miles, without seeing any other grain,
                    except in a gentleman’s croft, which in general produced bear or big for one
                    third part, another third in white oats, and the remaining third in gray oats.
                    At that period there was no wheat raised in the country; what was used was
                    brought from Teviot, and it was believed that the soil would not produce wheat.
                    In the year 1735 there was no mill for grinding that sort of grain; and the
                    first flour mill that was constructed within these bounds was built at Clouden,
                    in the parish of Irongray, some years after that date.” (Murray’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Literary History of Galloway,</hi> 2d edition, 1832, pp. 337-9.)
                    Yet it was in this county that the improvements of modern husbandry were
                    adopted, at a time .when they were entirely unknown in the greater part of the
                    kingdom. As early as the year 1750, Mr Craik of Arbigland practised the drilling
                    and horse-hoeing of the celebrated Tull, which he ever afterwards continued to
                    follow in the culture of beans and turnips. He enclosed and drained his estate,
                    cleaned his fields by fallowing, applied calcareous manures, introduced sown
                    grasses into his course of crops, and worked his plough with two horses. A few
                    of the other proprietors followed in his steps, but their efforts were not
                    seconded by the tenantry at large. It is only since the end of last century that
                    modern husbandry has made any considerable progress, but it is now quite
                    general. The chief crops arc oats and barley, with wheat on the better
                    soils.</p>
                <p>A great impetus has lately been communicated to agriculture in this county, by
                    the regular and cheap communication with Liverpool by means of steam-navigation.
                    The farmers have thus a ready outlet for their disposable produce, corn, cattle,
                    and sheep, and receive cash payments. Instead of being, as formerly, far from a
                    market, and forced in consequence to sell to corn-dealers, a class of men with
                    whom bankruptcy was any thing but uncommon, the farmers are now, as it were,
                    placed in the very vicinity of the best market, and are freed from all risk of
                    non-payment. By these favourable circumstances, a spirit of improvement and
                    enterprise has been roused, which promises, ere long, to change the face and
                    character of the county. Nothing, indeed, has ever effected so important a
                    change in the circumstances of this county, as the introduction of
                    steamnavigation. The first steam-boat seen on its shores was in 1830 <hi
                    rend="subscript"> fc</hi>; and there are now three that ply regularly between it
                    and the English coast, particularly Whitehaven and‘Liverpool. Their decks are
                    covered with sheep and black cattle, whilst their holds are filled with corn.
                    Nor is this all. These vessels have opened up channels of industry before quite
                    unknown. Poultry, eggs, and butter, by being sent to the ready market of
                    England, form a new and pretty productive source of income. Salmon, instead of
                    being sent as formerly round to England by the expensive mail-carriage, is now
                    transmitted thither byģ steam more directly, and at much less expense; whilst
                    commodities required from England are obtained under the most favourable
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>Unlike other hilly tracts in Scotland, the land is almost universally enclosed,
                    chiefly with stone walls, called <hi rend="italic">Galloway Dykes.</hi> These
                    dykes are built close, or double as it is called, for part of their height, and
                    afterwards single, the stones in the latter part being laid in such a manner as
                    to allow the passage of the light through the wall. But it is now becoming a
                    common practice to build the whole of the wall double, and, after laying a
                    course of stones that project a little beyond its breadth on both sides, it is
                    completed by a coping of stones laid on edge, and closely pinned.</p>
                <p>This county is chiefly celebrated for its cattle, which form by far the most
                    important part of its agricultural produce<pb break="no" facs="nls:192947370"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-7370-0736"/>. They are known in every part of Britain by the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Galloway cattle.</hi> (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Agriculture.)</hi> Sheep are confined to the mountainous districts, where they
                    are kept in great numbers. They are’ of the heath or blackfaced variety, with
                    coarse wool, and yield a very small return for the extent of their pastures,
                    which, however, are in general 'of the very worst description in the south of
                    Scotland, some large tracts being rented so low as 6d. an acre, or even lower.
                    It is now becoming the practice to combine the rearing and fattening of ⅛heep
                    with the culture of arable land, by which the light soils of the other border
                    counties have been rendered so productive. A small, hardy, and active race of
                    horses, called <hi rend="italic">Galloways,</hi> was formerly reared here and in
                    Wigtonshire, the other division of Galloway; but a larger breed being required
                    for the labours of modern husbandry, especially since two-horse ploughs have
                    become general, the old race is very rarely to be found in a pure state. The
                    name, however, is frequently applied to horses below full size, wherever they
                    may have been reared.</p>
                <p>The first road act for the stewartry of Kirkcudbright was obtained in 1779. At
                    that period there was scarcely any thing that deserved the name of a road,
                    except the military road from Dumfries to Portpatrick, which had been made about
                    fifteen years before; but at present very few districts are better provided in
                    this respect. The first good roads were made on the estate of the Earl of
                    Selkirk, under the direction of his son Basil William Lord Daer, to whom this
                    county owes many other improvements. In 1796, by another act of parliament, the
                    assessments were allowed to be increased, and tolls erected; and soon afterwards
                    a new road was made from Dumfries to Castle-Douglas, a distance of eighteen
                    miles, through a hilly, broken country, with so much attention to preserve the
                    level, that it has seldom a rise of more than one foot in forty, and much of it
                    is nearly a perfect level. All the principal roads made since have been done
                    with equal judgment. The turnpike roads, in 1834, extended to 216 miles; and the
                    annual income obtained from tolls amounted to L.2557. The district is also well
                    accommodated with bridges, of which the most considerable is one over the Dee at
                    Tongland, about two miles above Kirkcudbright, which has aa arch of 110 feet
                    span. It is built of sandstone, brought partly from Annan in Dumfriesshire, and
                    partly from the Isle of Arran. It was finished in 1808, and cost upwards of
                    L.7000.</p>
                <p>Kirkcudbright, the county town, which was erected into a royal burgh in 1455,
                    contained, in 1831, a population of 3511. It is pleasantly situated on the Dee,
                    and is noted for the information and urbanity of its inhabitants. Societies have
                    been formed here for a purpose rather unusual, namely, the building of houses,
                    not for sale, but for the use of the members who compose them. Every member
                    makes a small monthly payment into a general fund, which is employed in erecting
                    the houses, and these, as they are finished, are assigned to the members by lot,
                    those to whom they fall paying five per cent, on the money which their houses
                    have cost, in addition to their monthly payments; and this arrangement continues
                    till all the members are supplied, and the societies dissolved. New Galloway,
                    which was erected into a royal burgh in 1633, is situated at the head of Loch
                    Ken, and contains onlv about 400 inhabitants. The principal villages are
                    Creetown, at the mouth of the river Cree, on the bay of Wigtown; Gatehouse,
                    twelve miles east from the former, on the river Fleet; and Castle-Douglas,
                    formerly called Carlinwark, an inland place, about nine miles north-east of
                    Kirkcudbright. The Galloway Bank, now discontinued, was established at
                    Castle-Douglas in June 1806. A branch of the Bank of Scotland had been
                    introduced into the burgh of Kirkcudbright about twenty years previously. These
                    three villages seem to be in a thriving state; the houses are for the most part
                    of two stories, and, in other respects, they are superior to villages of the
                    same extent in many other parts of Scotland. The others are Dalbeattie on the
                    river Urr; Keltonhill, noted for its great cattle fairs in June and November;
                    and Maxwellton, on the Nith,which, though in this county, belongs by its
                    situation to the town of Dumfries, from which it is separated only by the bridge
                    over that river. By the reform act, indeed, it is included within the
                    parliamentary boundaries of that town.</p>
                <p>There are no regular assessments for the poor in the country parishes, but the
                    ordinary kirk-session funds have been much augmented in some parishes by
                    charitable donations. In some instances voluntary assessments upon the part of
                    the heritors take place, particularly in unfavourable seasons.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of the stewartry have few traits of character peculiar to
                    themselves. Living remote from the capital, or any large town, they are a
                    simple, unsophisticated people, feudal and superstitious in their sentiments. A
                    belief in witchcraft, and in the more popular superstitions, still obtains. They
                    think no character superior to the minister or the laird. These peculiarities,
                    however, are beginning to give way. Education has attained a most respectable
                    footing; and the collision of sentiment which the people experience by the
                    intercourse now opened up by the facilities of communication with strangers has
                    had a most salutary and liberalizing influence. They are an enterprising people.
                    They send, on an average of the last ten years, about forty young men to the
                    university yearly; and the number of those who annually cross over to England to
                    push their fortune, or emigrate either to our own colonies or to foreign states,
                    is extremely great. Of these, not a few, after experiencing success in life,
                    return to their native country with a respectable competency; and thus, by their
                    example, stimulate others to follow their steps. Of the extent to which
                    emigration from this county is carried, a correct estimate may be formed from
                    the fact that, though the number of males born is about five per cent, above
                    that of females, the latter in the stewartry exceed the former by 2642. A great
                    number of Irish, of the lowest grade, are settled here.</p>
                <p>Education, as mentioned above, is in a respectable state. Some of the schools are
                    excellent; few of them are bad; and when a vacancy now takes place, the utmost
                    pains are taken to get the best teacher to fill it. Several sums have been
                    bequeathed by individuals for the support of schools, particularly in the
                    parishes of Balmaclellan, Dairy, and Borgue. In addition to the parish schools,
                    there are many voluntary seminaries, which are in a highly respectable and
                    efficient state.</p>
                <p>It has already been mentioned that the people are distinguished for their
                    religious character. The reformation began here at a peculiarly early date,
                    namely, the begin-ing of the fifteenth century <hi rend="italic">{Literary
                    History of Galloway,</hi> p. 61), and some of the most eminent reformers and
                    covenanters were connected with this <hi rend="smallcaps">cop</hi>.ty. The
                    persecution in the times of Charles I. and his son Charles II. raged most hotly
                    here. The graves of martyrs are to be found, not only in almost every
                    churchyard, but even in many of the wildest moors. Presbyterianism still
                    continues predominant. In addition to the twenty-eight parish churches, there
                    are one chapel of Ease at Maxwellton; one church of the Cameronian persuasion at
                    Urr; and six of the United Associate Synod at Urr, Castle-Douglas, Dairy,
                    Kirkcudbright, Creetown, and House of the Hill. There is no Episcopalian chapel,
                    but there are two belonging to the Roman Catholics, one at New Abbey and another
                    at Dalbeattie; and one Independent meeting-house at Gatehouse.</p>
                <p>The stewartry could boast of a greater number of monasteries<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192947383" xml:id="kp-eb0712-7383-0737"/> than any other county in
                    Scotland. These were, Dundrennan, St Mary’s Isle, and Tongland, founded in the
                    twelfth century, by Fergus, lord of Galloway; Lincluden, by his son Uchtred; and
                    Sweetheart, or New Abbey, founded in the thirteenth century, by Dervorgille,
                    daughter of Alan, last lord of Galloway, and mother of John Baliol, the
                    competitor for the throne. Of the three first of these buildings, the remains
                    are comparatively entire; of the other two, all vestiges have disappeared.</p>
                <p>The bishopric of Galloway, both in Catholic and in Protestant times, comprehended
                    the stewartry and Wigtonshire. It formed the most ancient see in Scotland; and
                    in dignity was inferior only to the archbishopric of St Andrews and Glasgow,
                    till in 1633, when Edinburgh was erected into a bishopric, and obtained the
                    preference over Galloway. The bishops of Galloway were <hi rend="italic">ex
                    officio</hi> deans of the chapel royal of Stirling.</p>
                <p>Some very eminent men have been connected with the stewartry as monks or bishops,
                    such as David Panther of St Mary’s Isle, afterwards bishop of Ross; William
                    Melville of Tongland, afterwards a lord of session, under the title of Lord
                    Tongland; Gilbert Brown of Sweetheart, well known as the author of a small but
                    learned work against the famous John Welsh, minister of Kirkcudbright; and the
                    following bishops of Galloway, Alexander Gordon (known in history as archbishop
                    of Athens); William Cowper, an eminent and learned theological writer; and
                    Thomas Sydscrff. Nor in more modern times has this county been less
                    distinguished for eminent literary characters. Robert Maxwell, author of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Practical Husbandman,</hi> and several other excellent works
                    on agriculture; Thomas Gordon, the translator of <hi rend="italic">Tacitus,</hi>
                    and author of <hi rend="italic">The Independent Whig,</hi> and other works;
                    Robert Heron, author of a <hi rend="italic">History of Scotland</hi> in six
                    volumes, and numerous other publications; Dr Alexander Murray, the celebrated
                    linguist; Dr Thomas Brown; Thomas earl of Selkirk, author of an able work on
                    emigration; not to mention many others, such as John Welshand Samuel Rutherford,
                    who were connected with this district by office and residence. In 1835 a
                    monument to the memory of the late Dr Alexander Murray was erected near the
                    place of his birth, in the parish of Minnigarf. The funds (L.450) were raised by
                    subscription; the height of the pillar is eighty feet.</p>
                <p>The occupations of the people, according to the population returns in 1831, were
                    as follows:</p>
                <p>Occupiers of land employing labourers...., 871</p>
                <p>Occupiers of land not employing labourers 490</p>
                <p>Labourers employed in agriculture 2648</p>
                <p>Employed in manufactures 529</p>
                <p>Employed in retail trade and handicraft 2299</p>
                <p>Capitalists, bankers, &amp;c 44θ</p>
                <p>Labourers not agricultural 1076</p>
                <p>Other males twenty years of age 805</p>
                <p>Male servants ∏)8</p>
                <p>Female servants 2378</p>
                <p>The county, as is evident from this table, is not remarkable for manufactures;
                    but it contains a larger number of men employed as weavers than home consumption
                    would require. They weave to a limited extent for the Glasgow, Paisley, and
                    Kilmarnock markets. The number of weavers was altogether above 500. But since
                    1831 the cotton mills at Gatehouse have been revived under the best management,
                    and in this way perhaps 200 more are added to the manufacturing class. There are
                    also stocking-makers, doggers, and nailers. The chief exports of the county are
                    the produce of the soil; grain, black cattle, sheep, and wool; the chief imports
                    are coals, lime, groceries, timber, iron, and slate.</p>
                <p>It has already been stated, that the mountainous districts of the stewartry are
                    composed <hi rend="italic">of</hi> granite. A granite quarry was opened in 1830,
                    on the estate of Cas-sencarrie, in the parish of Kirkmabreck, by the Liverpool
                    Dock Company. This is at present the most important work of the kind carried on
                    in Scotland. About 300 workmen are daily employed in it; machinery of a kind
                    previously unknown in Galloway has been introduced:; a railway has been
                    constructed connecting the quarry with Wigton Bay, a distance of about half a
                    mile; and a new harbour has been built at the expense of the company, the
                    vessels belonging to which transport the stone from thence to Liverpool. Besides
                    defraying surface damage for the line of the railway, the company pay to the
                    landlord a sum proportional to the produce of the quarry; and thus a piece of
                    land, which was previously covered with rock and heath, and literally worth
                    nothing, certainly not twenty shillings, now realizes an annual rent of about
                    L.400.</p>

                    to 1166. In the election for the burghs, Kirkcudbright (which contains 111
                    electors) joins with Dumfries, Sanquhar, Annan, and Lochmaben; and New Galloway
                    (which contains sixteen electors) with Wigton, Stranraer, and Whithorn. It is
                    divided into twenty-eight parishes, of which sixteen belong to the presbytery of
                    Kirkcudbright, and two to that of Wigton, both in the synod of Galloway, and ten
                    to the presbytery and synod of Dumfries.</p>
