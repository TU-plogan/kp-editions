                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">KANT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Immanuel</hi></label>, a very
                    eminent metaphysician, and the author of that theory which has been
                    distinguished by the name of the <hi rend="italic">Critical</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Transcendental Philosophy,</hi> was born at Königsberg, in
                    Prussia, on the 22d of April 1724. Of his paternal ancestors little is known
                    with certainty; but tradition represents them as having sprung from an emigrant
                    Scotchman of the name of Cant; and the philosopher himself, who frequently
                    alluded to this traditionary extraction, is said to have been the first of his
                    family who changed the initial letter of his name to K, with a view to adapt it
                    to the German pronunciation.</p>
                <p>The father of Kant, who exercised the humble profession of a saddler or
                    harness-maker, in the suburbs of Königsberg, was distinguished rather for his
                    integrity and respectability than for his wcaltb. His mother appears to have
                    been a woman of considerable talent, and of a more decided character. She was
                    exceedingly pious, and much attached to the strict religious tenets and
                    discipline of Dr Schultz, a divine who at that period enjoyed a high reputation
                    for learning, eloquence, and piety.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>He was professor of theology at the university of
                    Königsberg, and the author of several works which were much esteemed in their
                    day; amongst others, of a work on the <hi rend="italic">Elements of Metaphysical
                    Science.</hi></p></note> Kant uniformly spoke of both his parents, but
                    especially of his mother, with feelings of the warmest affection.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Kant had several sisters, and
                    an only brother several years younger than himself, who took orders, and had a
                    living in Courland, where he continued to reside until his death.</p></note></p>
                <p>Although far from being in affluent circumstances, his parents resolved to bestow
                    upon their son Immanuel every advantage that could result from a liberal
                    education. Accordingly, after having been taught to read and write at the
                    charity school of the suburbs, he was sent, in the year 1732, to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Collegium Fridericianum,</hi> at the suggestion, it is believed,
                    of Dr Schultz, who, even at that early period, had the penetration to discover
                    the talents of the boy. At this school he contracted an intimate friendship with
                    Ruhnkenius, afterwards so celebrated for his philological attainments, which was
                    maintained by occasional correspondence during the remainder of their lives, and
                    which, in their early years, may naturally be supposed to have had a salutary
                    influence on the studies of both. They were both indefatigable students; and
                    they not only mutually assisted each other in their school exercises, but read
                    together, during their leisure hours, whatever books their inclination led them
                    to peruse, or their circumstances permitted them to purchase. It is rather a
                    remarkable circumstance, however, that at this early period Kant devoted his
                    attention principally to philological studies; whilst his friend Ruhnkenius
                    seemed to be attracted, by an apparently natural tendency of disposition, to the
                    cultivation of philosophy. In their maturer years, as is well known, these early
                    predilections were precisely reversed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Throughout every period of his life, however, Kant retained
                    a great fondness for classical literature. He was particularly partial to the
                    study of the Roman writers; and, even in his old age, he delighted to have an
                    opportunity of reciting and applying passages from the works of his favourite
                    authors.</p></note></p>
                <p>Having completed his preliminary education, he repaired, in the year 1740, to the
                    university of his native town, where he applied himself with great ardour to the
                    study of the mathematical, philosophical, and theological sciences. Amongst the
                    professors of Königsberg, several of whom were men of considerable talents and
                    attainments, he appears to have attached himself particularly to Professor
                    Martin Knutzen, well known, at that period, as the author of several useful
                    works, to whose instructions in mathematics and philosophy Kant acknowledged
                    himself to have been greatly indebted.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Knutzen died in the year 1756, as extraordinary professor of
                    philosophy at Königsberg.</p></note> To the great diligence and success with
                    which he prosecuted his studies at this period, his early writings bear ample
                    testimony. The youth who, at the age of twenty-two, could boldly and
                    successfully impugn the doctrines of Leibnitz and Wolf, and skilfully wield the
                    weapons of dialectics against the authority of the most eminent metaphysicians
                    of his day, must have bestowed no common pains in the acquisition of scientific
                    knowledge, and in cultivating the powers of his understanding. From the earliest
                    period of his career, too, he was left almost entirely to the resources of his
                    own talents and prudence, and compelled, at every step, to struggle against the
                    depressing influence of poverty. When scarcely arrived at manhood, he had the
                    misfortune to lose both his parents, who had not the satisfaction of living to
                    witness the fruits of their son’s talents and industry. They, indeed, had never
                    been able to afford him much pecuniary assistance; but he was fortunate in
                    meeting with some relations of his family, who were in more affluent
                    circumstances, and by whose liberality, combined with his own exertions and
                    economy, he was enabled to continue the prosecution of his studies.</p>
                <p>After a residence of about three years at the university, he acted in the
                    capacity of private tutor in several families, and lived about nine years with
                    the Count de Hüllesen at Arnsdorf. During this period he embraced the
                    opportunities which his retirement afforded him, of collecting a vast store of
                    general knowledge in almost every department of science and literature, and of
                    sketching the outlines of several of those philosophical treatises, which were
                    soon afterwards published in rapid succession.</p>
                <p>It is rather unfortunate that no record seems to have been preserved of the
                    course of his studies during this most interesting period of his life; nor has
                    he himself, so far as we know, left any memorials which might enable us to trace
                    the gradual progress of his mind in the acquisition of knowledge. It is certain,
                    however, that he both read and thought much. According to his own confession, he
                    was not particularly well qualified to discharge the duties of a tutor; being
                    always too deeply engaged in acquiring and digesting knowledge in his own mind,
                    to be capable of communicating the rudiments of it to others. His mind seems to
                    have originally entertained a strong bias towards mathematical and physical
                    researches; and <pb break="no" facs="nls:192946590" xml:id="kp-eb0712-6590-0676"
                    />he exhibited some specimens of knowledge, acuteness, and originality of
                    investigation, in the latter branch of science, from which much eminence might
                    have resulted had his views been exclusively confined to that department.</p>
                <p>It was probably during the period of his retirement at Arnsdorf that he was led
                    to engage in a laborious investigation of the various metaphysical theories or
                    ancient and modern times. With this view, he made himself master of the living
                    languages, especially the French and English, the latter of which he acquired
                    without the aid of a master, in order to enable him to examine into the merits
                    of the British philosophers, particularly Lockc, Berkeley, and Hume. To the
                    sceptical conclusions of the last-mentioned writer, according to Kant’s own
                    confession, the world is indebted for the <hi rend="italic">Critical
                    Theory.</hi></p>
                <p>Having attained his thirtieth year, and already distinguished himself as the
                    author of several tracts, exhibiting great originality of thought, Kant resolved
                    to devote himself to the profession of public teacher. With this view, he
                    returned to the university of Königsberg, and took his degree of master of arts,
                    according to the usual forms, in the year 1755. It was upon this occasion that
                    he produced, in the form of an inaugural dissertation, his tract entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Principiorum primorum Cognitionis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Metaphysicae nova dilucidatio</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the first of his
                    works, it is believed, which contained any hints respecting his peculiar views
                    of metaphysical science. In the same year he published his celebrated treatise
                    on the <hi rend="italic">Universal Natural History and Theory of the
                    Heavens</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">or an Essay on the
                    Constitution and Mechanical Structure of the whole Globe, according to the
                    Newtonian System.</hi> In this treatise, by follow-ingout the principles of
                    Newton, he was led to anticipate, in theory, some of the subsequent discoveries
                    of the great practical astronomer Herschel.</p>
                <p>Soon after he had taken his degree, he began to avail himself of the privilege
                    attached to the character of a <hi rend="italic">Doctor</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >docens,</hi> by delivering lectures publicly on logic, metaphysics,
                    mathematics, and natural philosophy; to which, at a subsequent period, he added
                    the law of nature, moral philosophy, natural theology, and physical geography.
                    He had not long commenced the discharge of his duties as a public teacher, when
                    the concourse of students, whom the reputation of his profound and extensive
                    learning attracted, was so great, that his <hi rend="italic">auditorium,</hi> or
                    lecture-room, although large and commodious, could scarcely contain the numbers
                    who eagerly flocked to hear him. His affable manners and social talents, at the
                    same time, rendered him a most acceptable guest at the tables of the most
                    respectable inhabitants of Königsberg, with several of whom he lived on habits
                    of intimate friendship.</p>
                <p>But notwithstanding his acknowledged talents as a philosopher, and his popularity
                    as a lecturer on scientific subjects, it was long before Kant obtained any
                    preferment. With a mind constantly and intensely engaged in the pursuit of
                    knowledge, he appears to have possessed no ambition beyond that of being useful
                    in the sphere he had chosen for the exercise of his abilities; and he had too
                    much simplicity of character to resort to any of those arts by which other men,
                    more emulous of distinction, frequently endeavour to advance their worldly
                    interests. Upon the death of Knutzen, in the month of April 1756, he solicited
                    the vacant extraordinary professorship of philosophy, but without success. The
                    ordinary professor of logic and metaphysics having died in 1758, Dr Schultz,
                    who, as we have already observed, discovered at an early period the talents of
                    Kant, and continued to patronise him so long as he lived, exerted all his
                    influence to obtain that situation for <hi rend="italic">his protege'.</hi> But
                    Kant was again disappointed. Not discouraged, however, by the repeated failure
                    of his attempts to attain independence, he continued to deliver his lectures,
                    and to meditate his writings. In the month of February 1766 he accepted the
                    unsolicited situation of second keeper of the royal library, to which a small
                    salary was attached; and at the same time he undertook the management of a
                    private cabinet of curiosities. But these offices he resigned in 1772, on
                    account of the interruptions to which he was exposed in showing the books and
                    rarities to strangers.</p>
                <p>In the year 1770, Kant at length attained the highest object of his ambition, on
                    his advancement to the ordinary professorship of logic and metaphysics in the
                    university of Königsberg; a situation which, while it placed him far above the
                    fear of want, afforded him, at the same time, the best opportunity of employing
                    his talents in a manner satisfactory to himself and advantageous to his country.
                    Upon this occasion, he produced his celebrated inaugural dissertation, <hi
                    rend="italic">De Mundi</hi><hi rend="italic">Sensibilis atque</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Intelligibilis Forma</hi><hi rend="italic">et Principiis,</hi> in
                    which he propounded some of the fundamental principles of that metaphysical
                    theory to which he was afterwards indebted for his great reputation.</p>
                <p>From this period, the life of Kant affords no very remarkable incidents for the
                    pen of the biographer. His time appears to have been chiefly occupied in the
                    faithful and zealous discharge of the duties of his office; in the composition
                    of those philosophical works, by which he hoped to accomplish an important and
                    beneficial reform in metaphysical science; and in cultivating the society of a
                    select number of friends. At this time, too, he maintained a philosophical
                    correspondence with several of the first literary characters of the age, and
                    particularly with the celebrated Lambert, then president of the Royal Academy of
                    Sciences at Berlin, whose views of philosophy were, in some respects, coincident
                    with his own. His letters to Lambert, indeed, are peculiarly interesting, as
                    they contain frequent allusions to the gradual development of his metaphysical
                    ideas.</p>
                <p>In the year 1780, he became a member of the <hi rend="italic">Senatus
                    Academicus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in 1787 he was admitted a member of
                    the Royal Academy of Sciences at Berlin. Never, perhaps, did there exist a mind
                    so ardently and so entirely devoted to the cultivation of science, and so
                    utterly divested of all interested motives in the pursuit of know ledge. Having
                    once attained independence, his ambition, as to worldly objects, seems to have
                    aspired no higher. Although he received, at different times, various
                    invitations, with most advantageous proposals, to induce him to transfer his
                    talents and his reputation to other universities, he could never be prevailed
                    upon to leave his native town; being perfectly satisfied with the advantages he
                    already enjoyed, and with the sphere of usefulness which had been assigned him.
                    For many years previous to his death, he was the senior professor of Königsberg;
                    and he enjoyed that high degree of respect and veneration which was due alike to
                    his advanced age, his eminent talents, and conspicuous virtues. He died, by a
                    gradual decay of nature, on the 12th of February 1804, in the eightieth year of
                    his age. His funeral was attended by, the most respectable inhabitants of
                    Königsberg, and by a numerous train of his friends and disciples; and, to
                    express the public regret for the loss of so distinguished a character, the
                    whole city put on mourning. On his coffin there was placed a sepulchral urn,
                    with the inscription, <hi rend="italic">Cincres mortales immortalis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Kantii.</hi> A beautiful commemorative medal was also executed
                    upon this occasion, by Μ. Abramson of Berlin. On one side is a striking likeness
                    of the philosopher, with the inscription, <hi rend="italic">Immanuel Kant,
                    nat.</hi> 1724. On the reverse, the artist has attempted to express the services
                    of Kant in assigning limits to the province of speculative philosophy, by
                    representing a Minerva seated, and holding an owl in her right hand, which she
                    prevents from flying, with the inscription, <hi rend="italic">Altins</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">volantem arcuit.</hi></p>
                <p>In his person, Kant was rather below the middle stature, of a slender and
                    delicate form, and. with a very narrow and <pb break="no" facs="nls:192946603"

                    to pro. mise longevity; nor would he, in all probability, have attained so great
                    an age, had not his constitution been preserved by his regular and temperate
                    mode of living. In his external appearance, strangers found nothing
                    prepossessing, or indicative of any uncommon talents; on the contrary, his
                    features are represented by a gentleman who visited him at Königsberg, as “a
                    reproach to physiognomy.” Others, however, describe his countenance as full of
                    dignity, and expressive of benevolence. His natural disposition was cheerful and
                    social, and his manners were polite and affable. He exhibited none of that
                    awkwardness or reserve which is frequently generated or increased by habits of
                    recluse meditation, and which is often thought to be characteristic of the
                    scholar and man of science. He loved company, and was both inquisitive himself,
                    and fond of communicating his own knowledge and opinions upon all subjects.
                    There was nothing, however trifling it might appear at first sight, which did
                    not suggest to his mind some interesting reflections; and he could talk as
                    fluently with a lady on the minutiae of female dress, the mjsteries of the
                    kitchen, or the common occurrences of the day, as he could with a philosopher on
                    the most abstruse points of science. He was very regular in his habits. He rose
                    early, and his mornings were generally devoted to study and professional duties,
                    his evenings to society. As he never entered into the married state, he was not
                    encumbered with the cares of a family. He used to say, that when he would have
                    married, he had not fortune sufficient to maintain a wife; and when he possessed
                    the requisite fortune, he had no inclination to marry. It has been remarked that
                    he was fond of society; and during the earlier part of his life, when otherwise
                    disengaged, he used to dine at the ordinary of the principal tavern, by which
                    means he had an opportunity of acquiring an extensive knowledge of human
                    character, and, at the same time, of gratifying his inquisitive disposition, by
                    eliciting from travellers of different countries many curious and valuable
                    observations on the manners, habits, and literature of various nations. He
                    possessed an intimate knowledge of geography, and even of minute topography,
                    probably in a great measure derived from this last-mentioned source, as well as
                    from his private reading of books of travels, to which he was always extremely
                    partial; and he frequently entered into local details with a degree of
                    correctness which could not fail to astonish those who learned that he had never
                    moved fifty miles from his native town. At a later period of his life, when more
                    easy in his circumstances, he generally invited a few of his friends to dinner,
                    with whom he relaxed from his graver studies, frequently enlivening his
                    discourse with sallies of wit and humour, of which he possessed no small share,
                    and occasional irony and satire, of that good-natured species which inflicts no
                    wound on the object against whom it is directed.</p>
                <p>Kant’s intellectual faculties were of a high order. He had a wonderful power of
                    reflection, which enabled him to unfold the most abstruse principles, and to
                    pursue, in his own mind, a long train of conclusions. He possessed great
                    quickness of observation, and clearness of conception; insomuch that, in
                    conversation, he could describe any object which he had seen, or of which he had
                    read, with admirable precision and accuracy. His memory was exceedingly
                    retentive. He kept no library, but made a contract with a bookseller to send him
                    all new publications, which he perused, and afterwards returned; and the
                    knowledge thus acquired he had always at his command. The most remarkable
                    feature in the moral character of Kant was an utter abhorrence of every species
                    of falsehood, however in nocent, and a love of perfect honesty and sincerity in
                    word and action, flowing no less from his natural disposition, than from those
                    high principles which he had early imbibed, of the value of truth, and the
                    dignity of man. In this respect he was ever consistent with himself; and the
                    whole tenor of his long life may be regarded as a practical commentary on his
                    writings, and an exemplification of his moral maxims.</p>
                <p>The peculiar doctrines of the critical or transcendental philosophy were not the
                    offspring of impressions accidentally received, and hastily adopted, but the
                    fruit of long, patient, and systematic investigation. Kant, indeed, was well
                    advanced in years before he attempted that reform in metaphysical science which
                    he seems to have long meditated. In several of his earlier productions, and in
                    his letters to Lambert, he evidently appears to have been dissatisfied with the
                    prevailing theories; and his inaugural dissertations, as already mentioned,
                    exhibited some of those peculiar views, which were afterwards more fully
                    developed in his great work, the <hi rend="italic">Critik der reinen
                    Vernunft.</hi> This work was published in 1781. For several years it appears to
                    have attracted little or no attention; and the publisher, it is said, was on the
                    point of destroying the sheets as waste paper, when a sudden demand rapidly
                    carried off several impressions. From that period, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transcendental Theory</hi> began to excite an extraordinary sensation, and to
                    be regarded as a new and wonderful discovery in metaphysical science; the
                    philosophers of Germany were divided into professed partisans and determined
                    antagonists of the doctrines of Kant; and a multitude of publications issued
                    yearly from the press, for the purpose of confirming or refuting the new
                    principles.</p>
                <p>It was not long, however, before the <hi rend="italic">Critical Philosophy</hi>
                    bore down all opposition, and obtained a complete ascendency over the theories
                    inculcated by its adversaries. It was publicly taught in the schools, to the
                    almost total exclusion of the doctrines of Aristotle, Descartes, Locke,
                    Leibnitz, and Wolf; it gave a fresh impulse to the spirit of metaphysical
                    inquiry; and men of the first note in the scientific world felt a conscious
                    pride in being able to comprehend, to explain, to illustrate, to apply, or to
                    extend its principles. It not only effected an entire revolution in German
                    metaphysics, but exerted a powerful influence on works of taste, and the lighter
                    literature of the country. It is impossible, indeed, to comprehend, or to
                    relish, many passages in the works of the more recent poets, novelists, and
                    fugitive writers of Germany, without some previous acquaintance with the
                    doctrines of Kant.</p>
                <p>Owing to what has been already said upon the subject in another part of this
                    work,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi
                    rend="italic">Dissertation First,</hi> Part Second, Section Seventh.</p></note>
                    we shall avoid entering into any discussion respecting the merits of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Critical Philosophy</hi> in the present article; but we shall
                    present our readers with a very concise abstract of its objects and
                    results.,.</p>
                <p>Mr Hume proved very satisfactorily, that our ideas of <hi rend="italic">cause and
                    effect</hi> are not derived from experience ;^but he rashly concluded, as Kant
                    observes, “that they^are the spurious offspring of the imagination impregnated
                    by custom.” Kant discovered that Hume had been led to this hasty inference in
                    consequence of having taken too limited a view of the great problem which he had
                    thus partially attempted to solve. He perceived that the idea of <hi
                    rend="italic">cause and effect</hi> is by no means the only one which the mind
                    makes use of with the consciousness of its necessity, yet without being derived
                    from experience; but that the science of metaphysics is altogether founded on
                    ideas of a similar nature. He endeavoured, therefore, to ascertain the precise
                    number of these abstract or transcendental ideas; and having succeeded in this
                    to his own satisfaction, he <pb break="no" facs="nls:192946616"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-6616-0678"/>found himself in possession of the whole of those
                    connecting acts of the mind, which constitute the very elements of the
                    understanding itself, which are indispensable to its exercise, and without which
                    the whole of our experience would exhibit nothing but a number of insulated
                    facts, without order or consistency.</p>
                <p>The three original faculties, through the medium of which we acquire knowledge,
                    are, <hi rend="italic">sense, understanding,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">reason.
                    Sense</hi> is a passive or receptive faculty. In the objects presented to our
                    senses, we distinguish <hi rend="italic">matter</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >form.</hi> The forms or conditions of sense are <hi rend="italic">space</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">time</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the former of the
                    external, the latter of the internal sense. All our knowledge is limited by
                    space and time; for we can perceive nothing that does not exist under these
                    conditions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Understanding</hi> is an active or spontaneous faculty, and
                    consists in the power of forming conceptions. In every conception of the
                    understanding, also, we distinguish the <hi rend="italic">matter</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">form</hi>. The matter is the sensible intuition; the form is
                    the unity, or connection, established by means of the synthetic powers of the
                    understanding, or the categories. Kant was at great pains in endeavouring to
                    ascertain the number of these synthetic powers or categories; and he found them
                    to be all comprehended under the four classes of <hi rend="italic">quantity,
                    quality, relation,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">modality.</hi> The categories
                    themselves are twelve in number. Under the first head are comprised <hi
                    rend="italic">unity, multitude, totality</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> under the
                    second, <hi rend="italic">reality, negation, limitation</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> under the third, <hi rend="italic">substance</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >accident, cause</hi> and <hi rend="italic">effect, action</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">re-action</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> under the fourth, <hi
                    rend="italic">possibility, existence, necessity.</hi></p>
                <p>This synthetic power of the understanding is called, in the critical philosophy,
                    its <hi rend="italic">original</hi> use. The <hi rend="italic">logical</hi> use,
                    both of understanding and reason, is to be found in the faculty of <hi
                    rend="italic">judgment.</hi> Logic, however, has only to do with the form of our
                    conceptions, and not with their matter; which last inquiry belongs to
                    transcendental philosophy, or metaphysics.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Reason</hi> is the third or highest degree of mental
                    spontaneity, and consists in the power of forming ideas. As it is the province
                    of the understanding to form the intuitions of sense into conceptions, so it is
                    the business of reason to form conceptions into ideas. The ideas of reason are
                    absolute and unconditional, and totally independent of space or time;
                    consequently, we can neither obtain nor extend our knowledge by means of reason
                    alone. For these ideas are nothing more than certain representations of the
                    unconditional, that is, of the highest unity and totality, which spring from the
                    essential constitution of our reason, which serve to render the field of
                    experience a comprehensible whole, and which, therefore, arc merely conditions
                    of the exercise of our reason, and not real external objects of which it is
                    possible to acquire any knowledge by intuition.</p>
                <p>The results of the critical theory may be stated, we conceive, in a very few
                    words. The first principles, or conditions, of our speculative knowledge, are
                    mere <hi rend="italic">subjective</hi> forms, or forms derived from the
                    constitution of the thinking being: First, the forms of sense, or pure
                    intuitions (space and time); and, secondly, the forms or notions of the
                    understanding (the categories). These intellectual forms or notions, however,
                    only acquire reality by their application to our perceptions, with reference to
                    possible experience, and therefore we can have no speculative knowledge of
                    things beyond the sphere of experience.</p>
                <p>Besides the critical investigation of pure reason in its speculative exercise,
                    Kant instituted a similar inquiry into the nature and laws of our <hi
                    rend="italic">practical reason,</hi> and of the faculty <hi rend="italic">ç£
                    judgment</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, in the spirit of his own theory, he
                    published the <hi rend="italic">Metaphysical Elements of Natural
                    Philosophy,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Law,</hi> and of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ethics.</hi> His <hi rend="italic">Logic, Physical Geography,</hi> and some
                    other works, were published by his friends, from his papers, and the marginal
                    notes to his textbooks. Towards the latter end of his life, he meditated a work,
                    which was intended to be the key-stone of his whole system, and which was to
                    have been entitled <hi rend="italic">The Transition from Metaphysics to
                    Physics</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in which he proposed tq demonstrate the
                    general application of the principles of the transcendental theory. The decline
                    of his faculties, however, prevented the execution of this projected work.</p>
