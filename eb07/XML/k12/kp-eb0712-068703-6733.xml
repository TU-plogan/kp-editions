                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">KELSO</label>, a town of Roxburghshire, is delightfully
                    situated, partly on a plain, and partly on a declivity on the north bank of the
                    Tweed, opposite to its junction with the Teviot, in long. 1. 20. λV. and in lat.
                    55. 38. N. When the town was first built cannot now be ascertained; but, from
                    various ancient records, in which the name is written Calchow, Calco, and
                    Kellsowe, it appears to have been of considerable antiquity and importance.</p>
                <p>During the border conflicts, Kelso was frequently exposed to the ravages of war,
                    and was thrice burned down by the English. It was also destroyed by an
                    accidental fire in the year 1686, and at different subsequent periods of its
                    history.</p>
                <p>The Duke of Roxburghe, whose magnificent mansion is situated about a mile to the
                    west, and commands one of the most delightful prospects, is superior of the
                    town, and lord of the manor. Kelso was first incorporated into a burgh of barony
                    in the year 1605, under a charter granted by King James I. to Sir Robert Ker of
                    Cessford; and it is governed by a baron bailie and fifteen stentmasters, who
                    compose the town council, eight of whom are nominated by the bailie, and seven
                    by the different incorporated bodies.</p>
                <p>The town, which has of late been greatly improved by the erection of many elegant
                    houses, consists of four principal streets, branching at right angles from a
                    spacious square or market-place, extending in length 800 feet, and in breadth
                    200. On the east side stands the townhall, a chaste modern structure, two
                    stories in height. But the most attractive object to the eye of the stranger is
                    the ruins of the venerable abbey, which present one of the finest specimens of
                    Saxon or early Norman architecture that this country can produce. It is built in
                    the form of the Latin cross, with the principal entrance to the west, of which
                    only a segment remains. Some years ago, the modern part of the building, which
                    was used from the time of the reformation till 1773 as the parish church, was
                    taken down, and the interior of the structure, disclosing two lofty pointed
                    arches, exposed to view. The abbey was <hi rend="subscript"> β</hi> founded on
                    the 3d of May 1128, by David I., by whom it was richly endowed; but it was
                    destroyed during an incursion of the English in the year 1545, under the Earl of
                    Hertford. Contiguous to the abbey is the bridge over the Tweed, founded in the
                    year 1800. It is a handsome and elegant structure, consisting of five bold
                    elliptical arches of nearly equal span.</p>
                <p>Kelso being in the centre of a rich and fertile agricultural district, has,
                    besides a weekly market on Fridays, two fairs in the year, as well as different
                    other markets at fixed seasons for the sale of stock, horses, and the like.
                    Notwithstanding many facilities for carrying on manufactures, Kelso is without
                    any. There are, however, a distillery and a brewery, four public banks, and a
                    gas-work; and it is in contemplation to carry into execution a rail-road from
                    Berwick, by Kelso, to Hawick, for which an act of parliament was obtained some
                    years ago. There are six places of worship in the parish, including an
                    established church and an Episcoplian chapel. There are two parochial schools,
                    one for Latin, and the other for reading, writing, &amp;c., besides several
                    private seminaries of education, a subscription school for the poor, and another
                    for the instruction of girls, founded and principally supported by the Duchess
                    of Roxburghe. Kelso possesses a public dispensary, three public subscription
                    libraries, two reading rooms, a debating society, and another called the
                    Tweedside Physical and Antiquarian Society. In 1821, the population amounted to
                    4000, and in 1831 to 4700.</p>
