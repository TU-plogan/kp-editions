                    Romans, a person of the second degree of nobility, following immediately that of
                    the senators.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Knight</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Cnecht,</hi> Germ.), in
                    feudal history, was originally an appellation or title given by the ancient
                    Germans to their youth after being admitted to the privilege of bearing arms.
                    See <hi rend="smallcaps">Chivalry.</hi></p>
                <p>There is scarcely a prince in Europe who has not thought fit to institute an
                    order of knighthood; and the simple title of <hi rend="italic">knight,</hi>
                    which the kings of Britain confer on private subjects, is a derivation from
                    ancient chivalry, although very remote from its source.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Knight-</hi><hi rend="italic">Service</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(servitium militare,</hi> and in law French <hi rend="italic"
                    >chivalry),</hi> a species of feudal tenure. The knights created by this tenure
                    differed most essentially from the knights of chivalry, though the difference
                    seems not to have been accurately attended to by authors. The one class of
                    knights was of a high antiquity, the other was not heard of till the invention
                    of a fee. The adorning with arms and the blow of the sword made the act of the
                    creation of the ancient knight; the new knight was constituted by an investment
                    in a piece of land. The former was the member of an order of dignity which had
                    particular privileges and distinctions; the latter was the receiver of a feudal
                    grant. Knighthood was an honour, knight-service a tenure. The first communicated
                    splendour to an army, the last gave it strength and numbers. The knight of
                    honour might serve in any station whatever, the knight of tenure was in the rank
                    of a soldier. By the tenure of knight-service the greater part of the lands in
                    England were ht&gt;lden, and that principally of the king <hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi><hi rend="italic">capite,</hi> till the middle of the seventeenth
                    century; and it was created, as Sir Edward Coke expressly testifies, for a
                    military purpose, viz. for defence of the realm by the king’s own principal
                    subjects, which was judged to be much better than to trust to hirelings or
                    foreigners. The description here given is that of knightservice proper, which
                    was to attend the king in his wars. There were also some other species of
                    knight-service, so called, though improperly, because the service or render was
                    of a free and honourable nature, and equally uncertain as to the time of
                    rendering as that of knight-service <pb break="no" facs="nls:192947500"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-7500-0746"/>proper, and because they were attended with
                    similar fruits and consequences. Such was the tenure by <hi rend="italic">grand
                    serjeanty, per magnum</hi><hi rend="italic">servitium,</hi> whereby the tenant
                    was bound, instead of serving the king <hi rend="italic">generally</hi> in his
                    wars, to do some special honorary service to the king in person, as to carry his
                    banner, his sword, or the like, or be his butler, champion, or other officer, at
                    his coronation. It was, in most other respects, like knight-service, only he was
                    not bound to pay aid or escuage; and when tenant by knightservice paid five
                    pounds for a relief on every knight’s tee, tenant by grand serjeanty paid one
                    year’s value of his land, were it much or little. Tenure by <hi rend="italic"
                    >cornage,</hi> which was to wind a horn when the Scotch or other enemies entered
                    the land, in order to warn the king’s subjects, was, like other services of the
                    same nature, a species of grand serjeanty.</p>
                <p>These services, both of chivalry and grand serjeanty, were all personal, and
                    uncertain as to their quantity or duration. But the personal attendance in
                    knight-service growing troublesome and inconvenient in many respects, the
                    tenants found means of compounding for it, by first sending others in their
                    stead, and in process of time making a pecuniary satisfaction to the lords in
                    lieu of it. By the degenerating of knight-service, or personal military duty,
                    into escuage or pecuniary assessments, all the advantages, either promised or
                    real, of the féodal constitutions were destroyed, and nothing but the hardships
                    remained. Instead of forming a national militia composed of barons, knights, and
                    gentlemen, bound by their interest, their honour, and their oaths, to defend
                    their king and country, the whole of this system of tenures now tended to
                    nothing else but a wretched means of raising money to pay an army of occasional
                    mercenaries. The military tenures, with all their heavy appendages, were at
                    length destroyed at one blow, by the statute 12 Charles II. c. 24; a statute
                    which was a greater acquisition to the civil property of this kingdom than even
                    <hi rend="italic">magna charta</hi> itself, since that only pruned the
                    luxuriances which had grown out of the military tenures, and thereby preserved
                    them in vigour; but the statute of King Charles extirpated the whole, and
                    demolished both root and branches.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">KNIGHTS-Errant.</hi> During the prevalence of chivalry, the
                    ardour of redressing wrongs seized many knights so powerfully, that, attended by
                    esquires, they wandered about in search of objects whose misfortunes and misery
                    required their assistance and succour. Andas ladies engaged more particularly
                    their attention, the relief of unfortunate damsels was the achievement they most
                    courted. This gave birth to knights-errant, whose adventures produced romances.
                    These were originally told as they happened. But the love of the marvellous came
                    to interfere; fancy was indulged in the wildest exaggerations; and poetry lent
                    her charms to the most monstrous fictions, and to scenes the most unnatural and
                    grotesque.</p>
