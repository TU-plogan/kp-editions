                    rend="smallcaps">Caffraria</hi></label>, a territory extending along the eastern
                    shores of South Africa, from the eastern boundary line of the Cape of Good Hope
                    to Delagoa Bay, a distance of between 600 and 700 miles. It extends inwards to
                    the country of the Boshuanas, between 200 and 300 miles from the sea; but this
                    frontier has never been properly explored, and consequently cannot be correctly
                    defined. To this coast the Portuguese gave the name of Natal, which has been
                    followed by navigators, but is of course not in use amongst the natives as a
                    designation of their territory. Of this region of the globe, either as regards
                    its physical aspect or natural productions, little is known, and that little is
                    confined to isolated parts, and not to the country as a whole. In some
                    portionsof itsandy plainsspread out in unfruitful barrenness for many miles; but
                    others are exceedingly fertile, consisting of fine savannahs, intersected with
                    small clumps of trees, and carpeted with a rich variety of herbaceous plants,
                    whilst excellent streamlets, meandering amongst the shrubbery in the centre of
                    the valleys, give life and beauty to the landscape. These are chiefly to be met
                    with at the base of a chain of high mountains stretching into the vicinity of
                    Delagoa Bay. The ridge was recently crossed by one of the missionaries resident
                    in this quarter, who says, that on reaching the summit, fine grassy plains,
                    thickly inhabited, were seen spreadingout in every direction, it being the
                    summer residence and grazing-place of those clans who live along the base of the
                    mountain. The pasturage was good and abundant, the climate remarkably fine, and
                    the general aspect of the country, the trees, and shrubs, and other features,
                    strikingly resembled those in many parts of England, whilst the whole appeared
                    watered by numerous rills. The mountainous range which divides the sea-border
                    from the interior is in some parts 6000 feet in height; and the most
                    distinguishing geological feature which they possess is the presence of a
                    superincumbent stratum of sandstone. High detached masses are found in many
                    places standing some feet above the surface of the earth. The upper part of a
                    mountain visited by the individual alluded to, presented to the eye immense
                    precipices capped with large rhomboidal tables, and projecting angles forming a
                    sort of cornice to the face. On the side of the declivities there was a
                    description of prismatic quartz crystals in a corroded state, and evidently
                    undergoing the process of decomposition; a circumstance which is observable in
                    all the mountains of South Africa, and will no doubt yearly give rise to an
                    increasing extent of soil. Iron-stone is everywhere found in Kaffraria, and also
                    considerable quantities of ochre of various kinds, presenting itself under
                    different circumstances. The coast of Natal has been described by one of the
                    most recent authorities as looking like a large park, varied with hill and dale,
                    displaying occasionally through a luxuriant valley the distant prospect of blue
                    mountainous ridges. On other parts of the coast the landscape was equally
                    beautiful; clusters of trees, hills, vales, and glens composing the foreground,
                    whilst in the distance, divided by a deep valley or chasm, a range of craggy
                    mountains extended in a parallel direction to the limits of vision. There are a
                    great many rivers on the Kaffraria coast, of which the Kai or Ky, and Keiskamma,
                    are amongst the largest. The entrance of the former is one of the most
                    picturesque and extraordinary in the world, as it forms, by its abrupt and
                    perpendicular heights, a natural lock, “wanting only a flood-gate to make it a
                    wet dock.” That part of the coast where Port Natal is situated possesses so many
                    advantages, that proposals have been lately made to the British government to
                    have it regularly settled. The memorial of the merchants and other inhabitants
                    of the Cape of Good Hope embodies various reasons for laying the case before the
                    “king in council and as it likewise conveys a description of the country, we
                    shall give an abstract from it.</p>
                <p>The arguments brought forward are, that the country in the vicinity of Port Natal
                    was originally purchased by the Dutch, and held by them as a dependency of the
                    Cape of Good Hope, and, of course, along with the latter colony, was ceded to
                    Great Britain in 1814; that since the year 1824, Port Natal has been almost
                    constantly occupied by British subjects, by permission of the governor of Cape
                    Colony; that these persons had succeeded in opening a trade with the natives,
                    which has gradually increased in extent, from the encouragement offered by the
                    Zoolas, who are favourable to Europeans, but whose residence there is attended
                    with great risk in the absence of a government establishment, which would be a
                    protection to the trader, and likewise prevent the frequent collision of the
                    Zoola and Kaffre tribes. The pastures of the country between these tribes are of
                    a highly favourable description. It is well wooded with large timber, and
                    watered by upwards of one hundred rivers and running streams, some of which are
                    larger than the chief rivers of Cape Colony. The soil is fertile, and has
                    produced three crops of Kaffre and Indian corn in the year. The rains are
                    periodical, and the climate is cooler than that of the Cape, and highly
                    salubrious. The bay of Port Natal is an exceedingly fine harbour, but the
                    entrance is narrow, and has a bar of shifting sand. There are six feet of water
                    on the bar, with a run of six feet, and at spring-tides the depth is fourteen.
                    “There are a considerable number of natives, a laborious and well-conducted
                    people, who are the remains of the tribes who formerly occupied the country
                    purchased and ceded by the Dutch, and who, having attached themselves to the
                    white inhabitants, are living in its vicinity under their auspices, unmolested
                    by the Zoolas.” The memorial goes on to state, that such an establishment as
                    that contemplated would prevent the irregular trading which is carried on at
                    Port Natal, and advance the civilization and moral improvement of the
                    neighbouring tribes, besides protecting the Kaffres. The ceded territory is said
                    to extend about two hundred miles along the coast to the westward, and one
                    hundred miles inland; and, from the capabilities of the country for maintaining
                    a large population, and carrying on an extensive trade, a comparatively small
                    military force is ail that is required.</p>
                <p>The name Kaífre (in Arabic Kafir, signifying an unbeliever or pagan) was given by
                    the early Portuguese navigators to the natives of the entire eastern coast of
                    Africa. The <pb break="no" facs="nls:192946382" xml:id="kp-eb0712-6382-0660"
                    />Dutch settlers at the Cape, therefore, when, in their migrations eastward,
                    they discovered a race of men entirely different from the Hottentots, called
                    them Kaffres. This name, in its most extensive application, designates several
                    African tribes, who are again distinguished by other appellations; and colonial
                    usage has almost appropriated the generic term Kaffre to the tribe in closest
                    contact with the colony, and who call themselves Amakósa. Their northern
                    neighbours are called the Amatêmbu, which the Dutch have metamorphosed into
                    Tembooger, and the English into Tam-bookies. Farther east is located the
                    Amaponda or Amambo, which has been corrupted into Mambookies. The latter are the
                    most industrious of the three nations, but the Amakósa arc considered the most
                    warlike. Still farther to the east of the Amaponda are the Zoolas, to whom
                    reference has already been made. The descent of these races of men has been
                    attributed to the Bedouins or wandering Arabs; and this conjecture is by no
                    means improbable, for they are distinct from both negroes and Hottentots; whilst
                    the people above mentioned, having penetrated into every part of Southern
                    Africa, may have reached this country by skirting the Red Sea, and journeying
                    southward by the sea-coast, so as to avoid the great desert of sand by which
                    Africa is divided into two parts. Their character, manners, modes of building,
                    and other circumstances, also favour the assumption. The middle of the
                    seventeenth century has been assumed as the period when they first acquired
                    territory here from the native tribes. The Amakósa Kaffres have been frequently
                    described by individuals who have visited their country. Their features are
                    Asiatic, their physical endowments considerable, and their intellectual
                    qualities respectable, although, from their remaining still in an uncivilized,
                    and almost entirely savage state, the latter have not had a fair opportunity of
                    developing themselves. But we shall recur to the subject of their character and
                    future prospects at the close of this article.</p>
                <p>One of the principal articles of trade amongst the Kaffres is the barter of
                    cattle for young women of the Tam-bookie tribe, who are short, Stoutland
                    muscular; and these are preferred by the chiefs to females of their own people.
                    In the warm season a thin apron constitutes their sole bodily attire; but in
                    winter a cloak is used, made of the skins of wild beasts, admirably curried. The
                    head, even in the hottest weather, is never protected by any covering; and they
                    seldom use shoes, except on undertaking a long journey, when they condescend to
                    wear a rude substitute for them. The bodies of both sexes are tatooed; and those
                    of the young men who correspond to the fops of more civilized nations paint
                    their skins and curl their hair. Their arms are the javelin, a large shield of
                    buffalo hide, and a short club. The women exhibit taste in the arrangement of
                    their dress, particularly for the head, which consists of a turban made of skin,
                    and profusely ornamented with beads. A mantle of skin, variously bedecked with
                    beads and other showy trinkets, is worn; and the only distinction between the
                    dress of the chieftain’s wives and those of the lower ranks consists in the
                    greater profusion of ornaments possessed by the former, but of which all are
                    alike vain. There is no change, the whole wardrobe of the female being that
                    which she carries about with her, and sleeps in; for bed-clothes they have none.
                    Their huts arc generally about twelve feet diameter, with a raised floor, and a
                    gutter for a drain. They are constructed by setting up poles erect, then bending
                    the tops till they meet, when they are tied together with fibres. This skeleton
                    of a dwelling is then thatched outside with rushes, and plastered inside with
                    clay or cow dung. Little time is spent in these primitive abodes, for the
                    excellence of the climate admits of the people living much in the open air. The
                    Kaffre hamlet generally consists of about a dozen of such huts; and the sites of
                    these, as well as the cattle folds, are chosen with reference to the pasturage
                    ground, as the safety and multiplication of their flocks is the chief care of
                    these modern Arcadians. Horses have lately been brought amongst them, previous
                    to the introduction of which the ox was their only beast of burden. Sheep and
                    goats have greatly multiplied with them.</p>
                <p>The grain which they chiefly cultivate is a kind of millet, <hi rend="italic"
                    >holcus</hi><hi rend="italic">sorgium</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a small
                    quantity of Indian corn, and some pumpkins, arc likewise grown; but a species of
                    sugar-cane called mifi is produced in great abundance, and of this they are
                    extremely fond. Their diet, however, is chiefly milk in a sour, curdled state.
                    They abhor swine’s flesh, keep no poultry, are averse to fish, but indulge in
                    eating the flesh of their cattle, which they prepare in a very disgusting
                    manner. They are nearly strangers to spirituous liquors, but have as substitutes
                    a kind of mead, and a tolerably good beer prepared from malted millet. Although
                    naturally brave and warlike, they prefer an indolent, pastoral life, hunting
                    being an occasional pastime. They arc excellent herdsmen, and extremely expert
                    in the management of their oxen, which they train to obey with perfect docility
                    the will of their masters. They are carefully sheltered and secured in pens, and
                    milked morning and evening in their folds. The hides are made into garments by
                    the men, who also exhibit some dexterity as artisans in fashioning weapons,
                    axes, and the like. The women, however, officiate as the architects of the
                    dwellings; and they also weave a superior sort of mat from a fine rush, which
                    displays some taste in the execution. Their whole household .utensils consist of
                    a sleeping mat, a leathern milk sack, a calibash, and an earthen pot for
                    cooking.</p>
                <p>Their form of government is that of hereditary chieftains, or clansmen. The
                    chiefs are legislators as well as judges, but the old men of the tribe assemble
                    on necessary occasions, forming a sort of jury, and they have also a voice in
                    decisions, which are generally founded on precedents, orally and faithfully
                    transmitted from sire to son. Their laws are few and simple. The courts, which
                    all have the privilege of attending, are held in the open air, and each party to
                    a suit pleads his own cause. In their religion, although no regular system of
                    idolatry exists amongst them, they are addicted to sorcery, spells, and charms.
                    They reverence a Supreme Being, and believe in the immortality of the soul, yet
                    never associate with it the idea of future rewards and punishments. With the
                    exception of a few unimportant matters connected with the burying of the dead,
                    their religious or solemn ceremonies present nothing worthy of particular
                    notice.</p>
                <p>Much light has recently been thrown on the present condition and future prospects
                    of this people, by papers relative to the Cape of Good Hope, which were laid
                    before government in 1835. From these it appears that a system of aggression,
                    and an unjustifiable appropriation, on the part of the whites, have from time to
                    time roused the savage energies of the Kaffres, and impelled them to make severe
                    reprisals on their European spoilers. The longing of the colonists for the
                    well-watered valleys of the Kafffes, and of the latter for the colonial cattle,
                    which are much superior to their own, still are, as they have always been, the
                    sources of irritation. The Dutch boors, an unscrupulous race of men, seem from
                    time to time to have treated the aboriginal population very unceremoniously. In
                    the year 1834, matters arrived at a crisis. A portion of land on the western
                    side of the Keiskamma had, for many years, been occupied by the herds of the
                    Kaffres, by permission of the colonial government. This indulgence was said to
                    have been abused, and the immediate expulsion of the transgressors took place.
                    This happened in November 1833. The Kaffres retaliated, and, at the close of
                    1834, the depredations in the colony had reached an alarming height. The savages
                    poured into the colony in great numbers, <pb break="no" facs="nls:192946395"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-6395-0661"/>wasted the farms, drove off the cattle, and
                    murdered not a few of the inhabitants. An army of 4000 men was marched against
                    the invaders, who were driven far beyond the boundary line which formerly
                    separated Kafferland from Cape Colony, and not only forced them to confine
                    themselves within the new limits prescribed, but to pay a heavy fine. Treaties
                    have been entered into between some of the native chiefs and the colonial
                    government, by which the river Ky is constituted the boundary of the colony; an
                    arrangement which deprives the Amatêmbu people, who did no harm, of their
                    independence. Tractsof country have been assigned to the Kaffre chiefs of
                    several families, who acknowledge themselves to be subjects of Great Britain,
                    and who are to pay a fat ox annually as a quit-rent for the lands which they
                    occupy. They are now, so far at least, brought within the pale of the English
                    government; but how the plan will succeed is still a matter of uncertainty and
                    speculation. (For further particulars on this subject, see <hi rend="italic"
