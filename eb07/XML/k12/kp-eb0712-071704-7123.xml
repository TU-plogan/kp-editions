                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">KILLICRANKIE</label>, a noted pass of Perthshire, Scotland,
                    within about two miles of Blair-Athole. It is formed by lofty mountains
                    impending over the river Garry, which rushes through in a deep channel beneath.
                    In the last century this pass was one of some danger and difficulty, and a path
                    hanging over a tremendous precipice threatened destruction at the least false
                    step of the traveller. At present it is traversed by a beautiful road, forming
                    part of the Highland line between Dunkeld and Inverness, and all danger or even
                    difficulty has completely vanished. The finest portion of the pass is at the
                    southern extremity, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:192947136"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-7136-0718"/>nearly opposite to the house of Faskally, which is
                    situated on a level paddock at the foot of the precipice, on the right bank of
                    the Garry, which sweeps round the beautiful green spot on which it stands.</p>
                <p>Near the northern extremity of this pass, in its open and unimproved state, was
                    fought, in the year 1689, the battle of Killicrankie, between the adherents of
                    James II. under Viscount Dundee, and those of William III. under General Mackay.
                    Dundee’s army was inferior in numbers to that of Mackay. When he came in sight
                    of the latter, he found them formed in eight battalions ready for action. They
                    consisted of 4500 foot, and two troops of horse. The Highlanders under Dundee
                    amounted to little more than half that number. At five of the clock in the
                    afternoon, a kind of slight skirmish took place between the right wing of the
                    Highlanders and the left of the enemy. But neither army wishing to change their
                    ground, the firing was discontinued for three hours. Dundee in the mean time
                    passed from clan to clan, and animated them to action." About eight o’clock he
                    gave the signal for battle. The Highlanders in deep columns rushed suddenly down
                    the hill, reserving their fire until they were within a pike’s length of the
                    enemy; when, having discharged their muskets, they fell upon the red-coats sword
                    in hand. Mackay’s left wing, unable to sustain the shock, were driven by the
                    Macleans with great slaughter from the field. But the Macdonalds, on the left of
                    the Highlanders, were not equally successful. Colonel Hastings’s regiment of
                    foot stood their ground, and even forced the Macdonalds to recoil. Maclean,
                    however, with a few of his tribe, and Sir Evan Cameron at the head of his clan,
                    fell suddenly on the flank of this gallant regiment, and forced them to give
                    way. The slaughter ended not with the battle. Two thousand men fell in the field
                    and in the flight. The tents, baggage, artillery, and provisions of the enemy,
                    and even King William’s Dutch standard, borne by Mackay’s regiment, fell into
                    the hands of the conquerors. The victory was now complete. But the Highlanders
                    lost their gallant leader, who, as he was raising his arm, and ordering the
                    Camerons to advance, received a ball in his side. The wound proved mortal; and
                    with Dundee perished all the hopes of King James.</p>
                <p>The battle of Killicrankie, or of Renrorie as the Highlanders call it, was fought
                    to the westward of the great pass, on a level space, in the form of a small
                    amphitheatre, immediately below the house of Urrard, and bounded on the one side
                    by the heights, on a terrace of which that house stands, and on the other by the
                    river Garry, which at this place runs close by the modern road. In the middle of
                    this little plain stands a rude block of stone, which is said to mark the spot
                    where Viscount Dundee received the wound which put a period to his earthly
                    career; but this is most probably a mistake; for, in the first place, if he had
                    descended to the level ground, he could not have commanded a full view of the
                    attack, whereas, by remaining at or near Urrard House, he must have perceived at
                    a glance every movement that took place in the plain below; and, secondly, the
                    tradition is uniform and uncontradicted, that he was mortally wounded by a ball
                    which entered between the joinings of his armour, whilst his horse was stooping
                    to drink at a well on the heights, and at the moment when he was ordering the
                    Camerons to advance. Before the onset, the Highland army was drawn up on the
                    face of the hill, a little above the house of Urrard; a position which gave them
                    the entire command of the pass, and enabled them to attack to the greatest
                    advantage.' As Mackay was observing his adversaries, on the hill above, he
                    turned round to young Locheil who stood next him, and pointing to the Camerons,
                    “There,” said he, “is your father and his wild savages; how would you like to be
                    with him ?” “It signifies little,” replied the other, “what <hi rend="italic"
                    >I</hi> would like; but I recommend it to you to be prepared, or perhaps my
                    father and his wild savages may be nearer to you before night than <hi
                    rend="italic">you</hi> would like.” And it happened as young Cameron had
                    foreseen. Dundee delayed his attack until near sunset, “when,” according to an
                    eye-witness, “the Highlanders advanced on us like madmen, without shoes or
                    stockings, covering themselves from our fire with their targets. At last they
                    cast away their muskets, drew their broadswords, and advancing furiously upon
                    us, broke us, and obliged us to retreat; some fled to the water, some another
                    way.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The author of the
                    Memoirs of Dundee, speaking of this battle, says, “Then the Highlanders fired,
                    threw down their fusils, rushed in with sword, target, and pistol upon the
                    enemy, who did not maintain their ground two minutes after the Highlanders were
                    amongst them; and I dare be bold to say, there were never such strokes given in
                    Europe as were given that day by the Highlanders.” What follows seems to partake
                    a little of the marvellous. “Many of General Mackay’s officers and soldiers were
                    cut down through the skull and neck to the very breast; others had skulls cut
                    off above their ears like night-caps; some soldiers had both their bodies and
                    cross-belts cut through at one blow; pikes and small swords were cut like
                    willows; and whoever doubts of this may consult the witnesses of the tragedy.”
                    The whole, indeed, seems to have been, in more senses than one, a very <hi
                    rend="italic">cutting</hi> affair.</p></note> In short, the charge was like a
                    torrent, and the rout immediate and complete. Some regiments, indeed, withstood
                    the first onset, and regaining their formation, made some show of resistance;
                    but seeing themselves at length turned and abandoned, they soon joined in the
                    flight. It has generally been believed that Dundee fell towards the close of the
                    action; but a letter, which has been preserved, from James VII. to Stewart of
                    Balle-chin, who commanded the Athole men, proves the reverse. " If their courage
                    and yours, and the rest of the commanders under you, were not steady,” says
                    James, “the loss you had in a general you loved and confided in, <hi
                    rend="italic">at your entrance into action,</hi> with so great inequality of
                    numbers, were enough to baffle you.” The consternation occasioned by the death
                    of Dundee, however, prevented an immediate pursuit through the great pass. Had
                    the discomfited troops been closely followed, and had a few Highlanders been
                    placed at the southern entrance, not a man of them would have escaped. His
                    uninterrupted retreat caused General Mackay to conclude that some misfortune had
                    befallen Dundee. “Certainly,” said he, “Dundee has been killed, or I should not
                    thus be permitted to retreat unmolested.” (Stewart’s <hi rend="italic">Sketches
                    of the Highlanders,</hi> vol. i. pp. 66, 67.)</p>
