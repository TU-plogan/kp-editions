                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">KILLIGREW, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>, was the
                    eldest son of Sir Robert Killigrew, and born at Han worth, Middlesex, in theyear
                    1605. At the age of seventeen, he became a gentleman commoner of St John’s
                    College, where he remained about three years; he then travelled into foreign
                    parts, and, after his return, was made governor of Pendennis Castle and of
                    Falmouth Haven in Cornwall. At a subsequent period, he attended Charles I. as
                    gentleman-usher of the privy chamber; and, upon the breaking out of the civil
                    war, he commanded one of the two troops of horse which were appointed to guard
                    the royal person. He was in attendance upon the king when the court resided at
                    Oxford; in 1642, he was created doctor of the civil law by the university of
                    that place; and when the king’s affairs were completely ruined, he suffered like
                    the other cavaliers, and was obliged to compound with the republicans for his
                    estate. But the Restoration made him some compensation for the losses he had
                    sustained in the royal cause. He was appointed gentleman-usher of the privy
                    chamber to Charles II.; and, upon the king’s marriage, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192947149" xml:id="kp-eb0712-7149-0719"/>he was created
                    vice-chamberlain, an office which he held for twenty-two years. Killigrew died
                    in 1693, four years after the Revolution. He was the author of four plays,
                    printed at Oxford, 1666, in folio, and which have been commended by some eminent
                    judges of dramatic merit, particularly b} Waller. Another play, called the
                    Imperial Tragedy, 1690, in folio, is also ascribed to him; and a little poem of
                    Ins, set to music by Henry Lawes, is likewise extant. Wood informs us that, in
                    his declining age, after he had retired from court, he wrote The Artless
                    Midnight Thoughts of a Gentleman at Court, 1684, in 8vo, the second edition of
                    which he dedicated to Chari es II.; and another work, entitled Midnight and
                    Daily Thoughts, in prose and verse, 1694, in 8vo. <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Killigrew,</hi><hi rend="italic">Thomas,</hi> brother of the
                    preceding, was born in 1611, and also distinguished for uncommon natural
                    abilities. He was page of honour to Charles I., and afterwards groom of the
                    bed-chamber to Charles II., with whom he had passed many years in exile. During
                    his residence abroad, he visited France, Italy, and Spain, and was sent on a
                    mission to Venice in August 1651. But the chief occupation of his leisure hours
                    consisted in the cultivation of poetry and the composition of plays. Of the
                    latter, Denham mentions only six; but it appears that he wrote nine during his
                    travels, and two after his return, all of which were printed at London, 1664, in
                    one vol. folio. Kiljigrew died in 1682, and was interred in Westminster Abbey.
                    Possessing a vein of wild humour, to which he gave unlimited scope, he became a
                    great favourite with Charles II., who, diverted by his sallies, paid more
                    attention to Killigrew than to his ministers, and allowed the former access to
                    the royal presence when that favour was denied to the latter. When he attempted
                    to write, he was nothing. It was in conversation, and, above all, in light
                    repartee, that he showed to advantage; being, in this respect, the reverse of
                    Cowley, who made no figure in company, though he excelled in composition. Hence
                    Denham, who knew them both, has thus characterised their respective excellencies
                    and detects:</p>
                <l part="N">Had Cowley ne’er spoke, Killigrew ne’er writ,</l>
                <l part="N">Combin’d in one, they’d made a matchless wit. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(a.)</hi></l>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Killigrew,</hi><hi rend="italic">Anne,</hi> “a grace for
                    beauty, and a muse for wit,” as Mr Wood says, was the daughter of Dr Henry
                    Killigrew, brother of the two foregoing, and was born a little before the
                    Restoration. She gave early indications of genius, and became eminent in the
                    arts both of poetry and painting. She drew the Duke of York and his duchess, to
                    whom she was maid of honour, as well as several other portraits and history
                    pieces; and crowned all her other accomplishments with unblemished virtue and
                    exemplary piety. Mr Dryden seems quite lavish m her praise, though Wood assures
                    us he has said no more of her than she was equal if not superior to. This
                    amiable young woman died of the small-pox in 1685; and, the year after, her
                    poems were published, in a thin quarto volume.</p>
