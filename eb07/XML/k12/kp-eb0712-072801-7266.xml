                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">KINGHORN</label>, a small burgh in Fife, which joins with
                    Kirkcaldy, Dysart, and Burntisland in sending a member to parliament. For its
                    constituency, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Kirkcaldy.</hi> It has charters from King
                    Alexander III. dated 26th June 1284; from King David II. dated 2d July 1364;
                    from King James V. dated 30th August 1541; and from King James VI. dated 12th
                    December 1611. By these charters its privileges as a burgh, and its right to the
                    harbours of Pettycur and Kinghorn, with its lake, lands, and mills, are
                    confirmed. The revenue of these amounted in 1832 to L.670. They were then valued
                    at L.13,114, and the debts upon them amounted to L.5836. 2s. 5d. The various
                    projects for improving the harbours are mentioned in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Forth,</hi> and a negotiation is at present (1836) going on for
                    their execution, by a joint-stock company. The extent of the lake of Kinghorn is
                    about twenty imperial acres, and the length of the stream flowing from it to the
                    sea is nearly 1000 yards. The« height of the mill-sluice upon it above the level
                    of the high-water mark is about 178 feet ten inches. Six mills were, within the
                    last thirty years, driven by the waters flowing from it, and there might have
                    been a seventh. There are at present upon it a meal and barley mill, and three
                    flax spinning-mills, turning, with the aid of powerful steam-engines and their
                    water-wheels, 3660 spindles. The other waterfalls are at present unemployed.
                    Flax spinning is the principal trade of the town. The shipping trade, besides
                    that of the ferry, is of little importance, consisting only of one large brig
                    and two coasting vessels. The government of the town is vested in a provost, two
                    bailies, a treasurer, thirteen councillors, and five police commissioners,
                    chosen by the inhabitants, under the act 5 and 6 William IV. cap. 63. It has
                    also five incorporated trades. The principal buildings are the townhouse,
                    erected on the site of an old Saxon building called St Leonard’s Chapel, and the
                    schools. Both buildings are from plans by Mr Hamilton of Edinburgh. The prison,
                    with its airing ground, annexed to the town-house, is, with the exception of the
                    jails at Kirkcaldy and Cupar, the best in the county. The schools belong to the
                    burgh, but were erected by private subscription; and the gardens were
                    gratuitously laid out chiefly by the working classes. The principal teacher is
                    chosen by the burgage and landward heritors; the burgage heritors pay half of
                    his salary, <pb break="no" facs="nls:192947279" xml:id="kp-eb0712-7279-0729"
                    />•and the landward heritors the other half. There is an infant school-room, a
                    geological museum and library-room, and a drawing school-room, within the
                    buildings. Upwards of an acre of ground is laid out with shrubbery, and the
                    borders of the walks contain a selection of plants, arranged with tallies
                    bearing their names, and classes, and orders; a portion of the ground forms a
                    bowling-green, and another contains the usual erections for gymnastic exercises.
                    Besides the parish church, there is in the burgh an Associate Secession
                    meeting-house and a Baptist chapel, both of which are well attended. This little
                    town, from its ample revenue and increasing trade and population, bids fair soon
                    to become one of the most prosperous in the county. Much has been done within
                    the last ten years in opening up streetsand removing ancient deformities; .and
                    the operations at present in progress, under the police commissioners, to carry
                    water in pipes through all the streets, and to light them with gas, will add
                    further to the comfort of its inhabitants. Population in 1831, 2579.</p>

                    rend="smallcaps">Forth).</hi> This has been a public ferry from the earliest
                    period of Scottish history. By an act of parliament passed in 1474, the freight
                    for the portage of man and horse at Kinghorn was to be six pennies Scotch, and
                    for the man separately two pennies Scotch. In 1551, parliament raised the
                    freight for the portage of the man and horse to twelve pennies Scotch, and for
                    the man separately to six pennies Scotch; and also provided that the ferrymen
                    were never to charge more, under pain of death, and confiscation of all their
                    goods. On the 20th of May 1800, the ferrymen were allowed by the justices at
                    their quarter-sessions to charge passengers, of freight ninepence sterling for
                    the best seats in their boats, and sixpence for the seats before the mast. At
                    present (1836) the freights of passengers are as high as two shillings sterling
                    for the best and eighteenpence for the inferior sittings on board the steamers
                    navigating these ferries.</p>
