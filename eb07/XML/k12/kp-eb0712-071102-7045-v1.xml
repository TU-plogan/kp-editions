                <p><label type="entry">KILDARE</label>, an inland county in the province of
                    Leinster, in Ireland, is bounded on the north by the county of Meath, on the
                    east by those of Dublin and Wicklow, on the south by that of Carlow, and on the
                    west by the King’s and Queen’s counties. In shape it somewhat resembles a
                    truncated cone, having its base resting on Meath, and its vertex cut off' by the
                    intervention of Carlow. In its greatest length, measured from north to south, it
                    extends forty miles, and twenty-six in its greatest breadth from east to west,
                    comprehending an area of 392,435 acres, or 6132 square miles, of which 325,117
                    acres are cultivated ground, and 66,447 are unprofitable mountain or bog.</p>
                <p>According to some writers, the Eblani were the inhabitants of this county in the
                    time of Ptolemy; others, amongst whom is Whitaker, make it the habitation of the
                    Coriundi. Afterwards it formed part of the territory of Cealan or Galen, which
                    likewise extended over some parts of Wicklow and Carlow. Its present name is
                    derived from Chille or Kill Dara, the forest or church of oaks, the country
                    being formerly covered with trees. The principal family in this district,
                    previously to the arrival of the English, was that of the O’Kellys, whose
                    residence was at the Moat of Ardscull, near Athy. On the death of Dermod M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> Murrough, the last king of Leinster, which occurred
                    shortly after the settlement of the English in it, the county formed part of the
                    palatinate of Leinster, granted by Henry II. to Strongbow. When this extensive
                    inheritance was distributed into five portions, amongst the daughters of
                    William, carl marshal, who derived from Strongbow, by intermarriage, through his
                    only daughter, Kildare fell to the lot of Sybilia, the fourth daughter, who
                    married William de Ferrers, earl of Derby, from whom it descended by marriage to
                    the family of De Vesci, and thence by attainder to that of the Fitzgeralds or
                    Geraldines. The principal families which held under Strongbow and his
                    descendants were those of De Hereford, Fitzhenry, Phepoe, Pippard, d’Angulo or
                    Nangle, and Bermingham. The Fitzgeralds ultimately became possessed of the
                    greater part of it. It was one of the twelve counties into which King John, on
                    his arrival as lord of Ireland, divided that part of the island which
                    acknowledged the English jurisdiction, but was not finally separated from the
                    adjoining county of Dublin, to which it had been attached as a liberty, until
                    the close of the reign of Edward I., when it was empowered to have sheriffs and
                    courts of its own. The county is now divided into the fourteen baronies of
                    Carbery, Ćlane, Connell, Ikeathy and Oughter-any, Kilcullen, Kilkca and Moone,
                    North and South Naas, East and West Narragh and Rheban, East and West Opha-ley,
                    and North and South Salt. These baronies are subdivided into seventy-nine entire
                    parishes, and seven parts of parishes, the remaining parts of which are in some
                    of the adjoining counties.</p>
                <p>According to the ecclesiastical arrangements, the county contains 113 parishes,
                    fifty-six of which are in the diocese of Kildare, and fifty-seven in that of
                    Dublin, besides a part of a parish which extends into the diocese of Meath.
                    Kildare diocese extends also into the King’s and Queen’s counties. The bishopric
                    was founded in the sixth century, by St Conleth, who was buried near the great
                    altar of his own church. The chapter consists of a dean, precentor, chancellor,
                    treasurer, four canons, and seven prebendaries. The bishop takes precedence of
                    every other except Meath; all the rest rank according to the dates of their
                    consecrations. Notwithstanding the elevated position he holds, his episcopal
                    income, in consequence of the dilapidations of his predecessors, is extremely
                    small, amounting only to L.520 <pb break="no" facs="nls:192947058?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-7058-0712"/> a year; neither has he any episcopal residence,
                    so that, in order to supply the deficiency of his revenue, he holds the deanry
                    of Christ Church in commendaro. The city of Kildare is a small, poor place,
                    wholly unworthy of notice, except from the circumstance of being the seat of the
                    bishopric, and from the cathedral, and some monastic remains still existing.
                    This bishopric is one of those to be extinguished. After the demise of the
                    present incumbent it is to merge into the archbishopric of Dublin.</p>
                <p>By much the greater part of the county is a flat, interrupted only by a range of
                    low hills in the centre, the most northern of which is the hill of Allen, and
                    the southern those of Dunmurry; the land on the eastern boundary, toward Dublin
                    and Wicklow counties, gradually rises as it approaches the adjoining mountain
                    tracts. The general surface stands at an elevation of from 200 to 300 feet above
                    the level of high water, giving birth to several rivers. The Boyne, with its
                    tributary the Blackwater, rises in the bog of Αllen in the northern part, as
                    does the Lesser Barrow, which unites with the Greater Barrow near Ratbangan. The
                    Grces and Lane are small branches of this latter river, joining it near the
                    southern extremity of the county. The Barrow forms the western boundary of the
                    county, except in the neighbourhood of Athy, where the Mearing embraces some
                    land to the west of this river, which should more properly form part of the
                    Queen’s county. The Liffey enters the county from the west near
                    Ballymore-Eustace, and after sweeping through it, at first in a western and then
                    in a northern direction by Kilkullen Bridge, Clane, and Celbridge, receiving in
                    its course the Morrel and the Ryewater, it quits the county at Leixlip. Numerous
                    lesser streams, rising in the more elevated tracts, fall into one or other of
                    these rivers. A great part of the bog of Allen lies in the northern part of the
                    county. This bog is not an interrupted morass, but is intersected in many places
                    by elevated tracts of firm ground, the largest of which, lying in its southern
                    part, has obtained the name of the Island of Allen, in consequence of its being
                    surrounded by an unproductive and half fluid mass. To the south of the town of
                    Kildare is a tract , of undulating ground, covered with fine sward, of a vivid
                    green, uninterrupted by any plantation. It is called the Curragh. It extends
                    nearly five miles in a south-eastern direction, having an average breadth of a
                    mile, and containing 8000 acres. It is used principally as a sheep walk, for
                    which it is peculiarly adapted, from the quality of its herbage and the dry
                    elastic nature of its soil. The pasturage is held by the farmers of the
                    surrounding lands, who pay large rents for the exclusive privilege of grazing
                    sheep on it, in numbers proportioned to the quantity of land without its limits.
                    The most celebrated race-course in Ireland is on the Curragh. The softness and
                    elasticity of the turf render it peculiarly suitable for this sport. Races are
                    held here periodically, at which two plates of L.100 each are granted by the
                    government, to encourage the breeding of running horses. The climate is moister
                    than most other parts of the great limestone plain of Ireland. The soil of the
                    county is generally a rich, heavy loam, on a bottom of limestone or limestone
                    gravel, except in some insulated spots in the hilly districts. Copper ore is
                    said to have been found in the central hills; but, either from deficiency of
                    quality or quantity, or from a still more marked deficiency of fuel, none is now
                    raised. The hill of Allen consists of a gritstone of which millstones are
                    made.</p>
                <p>The population was as follows, according to the authorities stated beneath, at
                    the respective dates.</p>
                <p>1760 De Burgo 51,726</p>
                <p>1772 Beaufort 56,000</p>

                <p>1831 Ditto 108,401</p>
                <p>The parliamentary return of 1834 being made according to dioceses, an accurate
                    inference of its population at that period cannot be deduced from it. From these
                    returns it appears that the population doubled itself in seventy years. When
                    compared with the acreable contents of the county, it also exhibits an average
                    of one inhabitant to every three acres, or of one family to every eighteen
                    acres, and of 177 inhabitants to every square mile. The proportion of
                    Protestants to Catholics maybe estimated as about one to seven.</p>
                <p>This population was represented in the Irish parliament by ten members, two for
                    the county and two for each of the boroughs of Athy, Kildare, Naas, and
                    Harristown. All these boroughs were deprived of the right of returning members
                    by the act of union, and as the reform act has made no alteration in this point,
                    the representation is at present confined to the two county members.</p>
                <p>The state of the constituency before and since the alterations made in 1829, and
                    subsequently, respecting the qualifications for exercising the elective
                    franchise, is as follows:</p>
                <p>Date. L.50. L.20. L.10. 40s. Total.</p>

                <p>The constabulary consists of five chief constables, forty-five constables, and
                    179 sub-constables, total 229, who are maintained at an expense of L.9644, being
                    at an average of somewhat more than L.42 each.</p>
                <p>The number of children receiving instruction in public schools, according to
                    returns made under parliamentary authority in 1821 and 1824-26, are as
                    follows:</p>

                <p>1824-6, 5118 3578 161 .8857</p>
                <p>Of the number in the latter return, 1425 were of the established church, 7276
                    were Catholics, thirty-one dissenters, and 125 whose religious persuasion was
                    unascertained. The number of schools was 214, of which twenty-five containing
                    1623 pupils, were maintained by grants of public money; twenty-nine, containing
                    1707 pupils, by voluntary contributions; the remaining 160 schools, containing
                    5527 pupils, were wholly supported by the fees paid by the parents or guardians
                    of those receiving instruction. The diocesan school for the see of Kildare is
                    held in Naas. The head master receives a salary of L.60 per annum from the
                    bishop, in addition to the pupils’ fees.</p>
                <p>The lands are very unequally portioned out. There are a few large estates. That
                    of the Duke of Leinster extends over nearly oη,e third of the county. Many of
                    the farmers hold large tracts; many others quantities scarcely sufficient for
                    the sustenance of a family. The general average of farms is from 200 to ten
                    acres. The former are well cultivated according to the most approved systems,
                    though not with all the neatness and precision which mark the operations of the
                    English agriculturist. The small farmers manage their land in a slovenly manner,
                    and with a persevering attachment to the customs of their forefathers. Oxen are
                    worked along with horses in the plough. Mules are to be often seen about the
                    farm-yards. Tillage in partnership is very usual. Wheat is grown in large
                    quantities, the strong loam being well adapted for it. The lands not subjected
                    to the plough are very rich, fattening grounds; but when exhausted by
                    injudicious courses of cropping, the pasture is poor and light. Dairies of any
                    extent are seldom to be met with, except for the purpose of raising veal for the
                    Dublin market. Large flocks of sheep are uncommon. The breeds both of black
                    cattle and sheep are good; that of horses is injured by an excessive passion for
                    breeding racers. The dwellings of the middling farmers generally consist of a
                    long building of a single story, the lower <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192947071?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-7071-0713"/> part formed of
                    stone and mortar, the upper of clay thatched with straw, and divided in the
                    inside into a kitchen and two sleeping rooms, one at each end. In the front is a
                    yard or bawn, enclosed at each side by the stables, barn, and cow-houses, and
                    used as a repository for all the manure collected from the dwelling-house and
                    offices, and for the feeding of the cattle. In the anxiety to collect manure,
                    little attention is paid to neatness; the pile of it is generally heaped up in
                    front, and a trough or cess for collecting the liquid is formed near the family
                    door, to which the pigs have usually free access. The habitations of the
                    labourers or cottiers are very wretched, particularly those living in or near
                    the edges of the bogs. The cabin is sunk beneath the surface of the soil, in
                    order to diminish the quantity of wall to be built. The roof, thatched with sods
                    of turf pared oft" the surface of the bog, is but a few feet above the ground,
                    and assimilates so closely with the appearance of tlιe surrounding fields as to
                    be nearly imperceptible at a short distance, except from the smoke rising out of
                    its openings, or the ingress and egress of children and domestic animals through
                    the hole in the side intended for a door. The food of the peasantry is potatoes,
                    with some milk and butter occasionally. The use of flesh meat is little known,
                    except on a few high holidays. The fuel is universally turf, which may be said
                    to be the only thing the poor man here has in plenty. The clothes are made of
                    home-manufactured frize, or cheap cottons. The English language is in general
                    use.</p>
                <p>Manufactures can scarcely be said to exist here. That of cotton was attempted at
                    Prosperous, near Clane, but failed. An extensive woollen factory has been for
                    several years at work near Celbridge, and still continues to produce large
                    quantities of the coarser woollen cloths. Paper is also manufactured in some
                    places, and tanning is carried on to a considerable extent. The county affords
                    many fine sites for water-mills. The beautiful falls of the Liífey, at the
                    salmon-leap near Leixlip, offer a perennial command of water adequate to move
                    very extensive machinery. Many other falls are to be met with on the same river
                    in its course through the county. The locks of the canals also could supply
                    water for many lesser works. The Grand Canal enters the county from the Dublin
                    side, at Hazelhatch, eight miles from the harbour at Portobello, and passes
                    through it in a south-western direction to Sallins, where there is a short
                    branch to the town of Naas. The main trunk proceeds in a western direction to
                    Lowtown, at which place it divides into two branches, the one, proceeding
                    westward to the Shannon, near Banagher, quits the county at Edenderry; the
                    other, which takes a more southern direction, joins the Barrow at Monasterevan,
                    the western bank of which river it follows as far as Athy, where it ceases, the
                    river navigation from that point to the sea being deemed sufficient for the
                    purposes of inland navigation. The summit-level, commencing at the distance of
                    seven miles from Dublin, and extending four miles, is 264 feet above the level
                    of the sea at high water. The Royal Canal, which skirts the northern boundary of
                    Kildare, enters the county at Leixlip, and proceeding by Maynooth, Kilcock, and
                    Cloncurry, quits it for the county of Meath at the Boyne. Both these carry to
                    Dublin large quantities of turf, which is much used for fuel by the lower
                    classes in the metropolis; also bricks, stone, flags, slate, grain of every
                    description, and potatoes; and bring back chiefly manufactured goods, timber,
                    and foreign groceries. The vicinity of the two canals during their transit
                    through the county diminishes considerably the general extension of the benefits
                    that ought to accrue both to the metropolis and to the line of country which
                    they traverse: in one part of their course they approach within four miles of
                    each other.</p>
                <p>The remains of antiquity are numerous. There are five round or pillar towers.
                    That at Kildare is said to be the most perfect in Ireland; it is 130 feet high.
                    At Tag-hadoe there is another seventy-one feet high. The third, at Kilcullen,
                    has only forty feet standing. The fourth, at Oughterard, has suffered still more
                    severely from the ravages of time; its height is but twenty-five feet. The
                    fifth, which stands at Castledermot, is used as a belfry, and by a casual
                    spectator might be mistaken for the trunk of a lofty tree, in consequence of its
                    being enveloped with a covering of ivy from its base to its summit. Several of
                    the upright stones, supposed to be relics of the worship of Baal, are also to be
                    seen. One at Punch’s Town stands twenty feet above the ground; another, with a
                    conical top, is at Harristown; two others, situated at Jigginstown, are known by
                    the name of the long stones; another, called the Gobhlan, is near the hill of
                    Carmen or Mullamast, where is also to be seen a large rath, situated on the
                    summit of a hill of some elevation, near which are sixteen smaller raths or
                    hillocks. These are said to have been the seats of the elders when the assembly
                    of the states of Southern Leinster, under the name of Naasteighan, was held on
                    this eminence. At a later period it became more memorable from a tragedy acted
                    upon it by some of the English settlers, who, having invited the neighbouring
                    Irish chieftains to a conference there, for the amicable settlement of their
                    disputes as to territorial boundaries, fell upon them unexpectedly, and
                    slaughtered them to a man. The pit into which the heads of the victims of this
                    murderous act of treachery were flung is still shown; and the place thence
                    acquired its name of Mnllamast, or the Hill of Decapitation. The other raths of
                    most note are those of Ardscull, near Naas, where the English, under Hamo de
                    Gras, were totally defeated by Edward Bruce in 1315; and that of Rheban, to the
                    north of the same town. Others are still to be seen at Naas, Kilkea, Moone,
                    Clane, and Lyons, and at Rathsallagh. The abbey of Kildare is one of the oldest
                    in Ireland. It is said to have been founded by St Brigid, and was the place
                    where the sacred fire was kept, which, after being extinguished by Henry de
                    Loundres, archbishop of Dublin, in 1220, was again lighted and kept burning till
                    the reformation. The ruins of the building in which it was kept are still shown.
                    There were, besides this, an abbey of gray friars, and another of Carmelites or
                    white friars, in the town. Castledermot had also three great monasteries. A
                    parliament was held in one of them in the year 1499. Naas had an Augustinian and
                    a Dominican abbey. The fine abbey of Monasterevan was converted into a
                    mansion-house for the Moore family. Of that of St Woolstan’s, near Celbridge,
                    nothing now remains but two towers and gateways. The commander}'of Tully,
                    formerly belonging to the knights-’templars, is now held in commendam with the
                    bishopric of Kildare. At old Kilkullen, the site of the monastery is marked by
                    some curious stone crosses. The principal castles are those of Kilkea, said to
                    be built by De Lacy in 1180; those of Athy and Castledermot were built by the
                    eighth Earl of Kildare. Timolin Castle was erected in the reign of King John, by
                    the Lord of Norragh. Rhc-ban, on the Barrow, gave the title of baron to the
                    family of St Michael. The castles of Narraghιnore and Harristown also gave
                    baronial titles to their possessors. Amongst the modern seats, the most
                    remarkable are Carton, belonging to the Duke of Leinster, a princely residence,
                    near the town of Maynooth; Castletown, the seat of the Conolly family, and
                    Killadoon, that of Lord Leitrim, in the same neighbourhood; Lyons, on the banks
                    of the canal, the splendid mansion and demesne of Lord Cloncurry; Straffan, on
                    the Liffey, between Celbridge and Clane, belonging to the Henry family; Belan,
                    near Timolin, that of the Earl of Aidborough; and Palmerston, the Earl of
                    Mayo’s. At Jigginstown, near Naas, are still to be seen the walls of a large
                    mansion commenced by <pb break="no" facs="nls:192947084?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-7084-0714"/> the unfortunate Lord Strafford, whilst
                    lord-lieutenantunder Charles II., but never finished.</p>
                <p>There is no large town in the county. The population of neither of the
                    assize-towns amounts to 5000 souls. That of Athy, the larger, was, in 1831,
                    4494; and of Naas, 3808 souls. The former of these towns is situated on the
                    banks of the Barrow, which is here crossed by a bridge, and owes much of its
                    small population to its being the point of connection between the still-water
                    navigation of the Grand Canal, which terminates here, and the river navigation
                    of the Barrow. It was incorporated by James I. under the care of a sovereign,
                    two bailiffs, and twelve burgesses. The assizes are held here once a year; and
                    its old castle has been converted into a prison for the temporary detention of
                    culprits. A free school, capable of receiving 270 children, is the only modern
                    public building of any importance. Naas, situated on the Liffey, and
                    communicating with the main trunk of the Grand Canal by a connecting branch,
                    though less populous than Athy, has a better right to the name of the county
                    town, as being the site of the principal prison; besides which, it can boast of
                    a large Catholic chapel, a sessions-bouse, and a market-house. In other respects
                    it presents nothing worthy of notice. Maynooth is remarkable for several
                    castellated ruins, built at various times by members of the Fitzgerald family;
                    and for being the site of the Roman Catholic College, founded for the education
                    of the priesthood, and supported by an annual parliamentary grant. Its
                    population is only 2052 souls. The other towns whose population exceeds one
                    thousand souls are, Kildare, 1753; Kilcock, 1730; Celbridge, 1645; Monastcrevan,
                    1441; Castledermot, 1375; Clane, 1216; Rathangan, 1165; Leixlip, 1156;
                    Prosperous, 1038.</p>
