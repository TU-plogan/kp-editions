                    extent, and fertility, perhaps the first in the island. It is in a peninsular
                    form, being bounded by the British Channel on the south; by the German Ocean on
                    the east; by the river Thames, which divides it from Essex, on the north; and by
                    the counties of Surrey and Sussex on the west. Its length is sixty-six, and its
                    breadth thirty-six miles. The area is calculated at about 1300 square miles.</p>
                <p>The divisions of Kent are into five laths, which are subdivided into sixty-three
                    hundreds and fifteen liberties, and contain two cities, thirty-six towns, and
                    414 parishes.</p>
                <p>The population, at the four decennial enumerations, amounted in 1801 to 307,624,
                    in 1811 to 373,095, in 1821 to 426,016, and in 1831 to 479,155. At the last
                    census the males were 234,572, and the females 244,583. These are comprehended
                    in 97,142 families, of whom 31,667 are chiefly employedin agriculture, 29,419
                    are occupied in trade, manufactures, and handicraft, and 36,056 are not included
                    in either of the other classes. The number of males above twenty years of age
                    employed in retail trade or in handicraft, or masters or workmen, was
                    34,257.</p>
                <p>The baptisms, burials, and marriages, show the following proportion at different
                    periods, in the parish register :—</p>

                <p>1826 to 1830 34 49 143</p>
                <p>Thus it is seen that the increase of population has been going on rather by a
                    greater degree of longevity than by the increase of births. The only scale of
                    morals which our present statistical knowledge supplies is that regarding
                    chastity, by showing the proportion which the number of illegitimate children
                    bears to the whole of the births. The illegitimates in Kent have only been one
                    in twenty-four, whereas in the whole of England they were one in twenty; in the
                    whole of Wales, one in thirteen; and in England and Wales taken together, one in
                    nineteen.</p>

                <p>By the law of 1832, entitled an act to amend the representation of the people of
                    England, the county of Kent has been divided into the eastern and western parts.
                    The election for the first of these is held at Canterbury, and the other polling
                    places are Sittingbourne, Ashford, New Romney, and Ramsgate. The election for
                    the second or western division is held at Maidstone, and the other polling
                    places are Bromley, Gravesend, Tonbridge, and Cranbrooke. By the same act, the
                    boroughs of New Romney and of Queenborough have been disfranchised; and the
                    borough of Hythe, which before returned two members, can in future elect but
                    one, and, to make up the competent constituency, the town of Folkstone has been
                    added to it. Green wich has by the same law been erected into a borough, and
                    returns two members; and Chatham is also a borough returning one. The other
                    places, viz. Canterbury, Rochester, Dover, Maidstone, and Sandwich, return, as
                    before, two members each. Thus the^ representation consists of four members for
                    the county, and fourteen for the cities and towns.</p>
                <p>The extent of land in the county appears to be 996,480 acres when the whole area
                    is included; but, from some not ascertainable cause, the returns from the
                    several parishes show only 972,240 acres. The annual value of the land,
                    including that of the houses, was taken'in 1815, for the purpose of the property
                    tax, at L.l,644,179. The whole of the poor-rates levied in 1833 amounted to
                    L.450,851; and it had not much varied in the few preceding years.</p>
                <p>The appearance of Kent is generally acknowledged to be equal, if not superior, in
                    beauty, to that of any other British county. Its surface is gently undulating;
                    none of its hills, except on the coast, rise abruptly, nor reach a great
                    elevation. In all the valleys there are streams of water; the woods and trees
                    enrich the scenery, and the mixture of pasture and corn land, interspersed with
                    orchards, fruit-trees, and hop plantations, give to its beauties a character of
                    softness and grace.</p>
                <p>The Thames maybe considered as a Kentish river, as it washes its whole northern
                    boundary, and empties itself into the sea on its shores. The river next in
                    importance is the Medway, formed by the junction of four small streams, one only
                    of which rises within the county. It becomes navigable for large barges at
                    Tunbridge, and continues its course by Maidstone to Chatham, where ships of the
                    largest size can approach the shore; and there terminates its course, by joining
                    the Thames at the Nore, beyond the arsenal of Shcerness. The Greater Stoure, the
                    Lesser Stoure, the Rother, the Cray, the Darent, and the Ravensbourne, are small
                    rivers, none of them navigable, but all of great benefit, by the fertility they
                    communicate to the meadow’s on their banks, and by the power they afford to the
                    many mills erected upon their banks. .</p>
                <p>Kent is almost exclusively an agricultural county; and though the soil is
                    generally fertile,; and though there are few extensive tracts of barren or
                    uncultivated land, yet no part of the kingdom exhibits within so small a compass
                    so great a variety of soils, of productions, and of modes of cultivation. It has
                    been judiciously divided into eight districts for the purposes of agricultural
                    description. The first of these, the Isle of Thanet, is in the north-west angle
                    of the county. The soil is a light mould on a chalky bottom, and has been highly
                    enriched by the marine substances that have been administered as manure. The <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192946837" xml:id="kp-eb0712-6837-0695"/> whole island
                    contains 23,000 acres of arable and 3500 acres of rich marsh land. The most
                    common rotation of crops is fallow, sometimes with, sometimes without, a crop of
                    peas: this is followed by barley, clover, and wheat; and on some soils rather
                    heavier, the course pursued is beans, wheat, and barley. The barley of this
                    district is very much esteemed, and sought for as seed in other countries.
                    Besides the common grains, seeds of various kinds are raised for sale to the
                    London seedsmen, particularly canary, radish, spinach, mustard, and onion seed.
                    The soil in the marshy parts of the island is a mixture of clay, sea sand, and
                    small shells, and yields most abundant pasture.</p>
                <p>The upland farms of East Kent, which surround Canterbury, and extend to Dover on
                    one side and Ashford and Rochester .on the other, are an open and dry tract of
                    corn land, intermixed with woods. The soils are very various, all resting on a
                    subsoil of chalk. Some of them are very heavy loamy clays, with a great quantity
                    of flint stones on the surface: these are usually cultivated on a four-course
                    rotation of fallow, barley, beans, and wheat; when the soil is somewhat stiffer,
                    a variation occurs of fallow, wheat, beans, and oats. In this district the
                    harvest usually commences from twelve to fourteen days later than in the Isle of
                    Thanet. The woods in this district usually supply poles to the hop-planters in
                    the vicinity; they arc cut down after from ten to fourteen years’ growth. There
                    are in this division some few hop grounds, but they are confined to three or
                    foür parishes. In the vicinity of Sandwich, Faversham, and Deal, a portion of
                    land, of a rich sandy loam, receives an almost uniform cultivation; it is nearly
                    all under the plough, and a four-course rotation is practised, of wheat, beans,
                    barley, and oats, after a fallow, or sometimes canary occupies the place of
                    wheat. Some portions of this land are alternately cropped with beans and wheat,
                    or beans and canary. In the vicinity of Sandwich are many orchards, the apples
                    of which are partly sent to London, and partly furnish return cargoes to the
                    vessels that come laden with coals from Newcastle and Sunderland.</p>
                <p>The district extending from Maidstone to Canterbury, and thence to Sandwich, is
                    the great garden-tract for the growth of hops. The soils on which hops are
                    produced are very various: the most productive are those which have a deep loam
                    surface, with a subsoil of deep loamy brick earth; some of these have a
                    considerable quantity of tìint- ∙stones mingled with the soil, and, when it
                    becomes compact, almost covering it. Another soil, provincially called stone
                    shaken, is very good for the growth of hops; it is mixed with many small
                    portions of stone and sand, and rests upon the basis of the stone called Kentish
                    rag, which is burned into excellent lime. The cultivation of hops is a very
                    fluctuating pursuit, as the produce varies in different years from two to
                    fifteen hundredweight per acre, and the prices have varied from three to fifteen
                    pounds. The expense of cultivation is very great, from the quantity of manure
                    that is required, from the great expense of the poles round which the plants
                    twine, and the labour of keeping the ground clear and of picking the hops.
                    Besides hops, the district is very productive of apples, cherries, and filberts,
                    to the growth of which many fields, from one to ten acres in extent, are
                    devoted: part of the apples are made into cider; the remainder, with the
                    cherries and filberts, are principally conveyed to the different markets in
                    London.</p>
                <p>The Isle of Sheppey is separated from the rest of Kent by an arm of the sea
                    called the Swale, which is navigable for ships of 200 tons burden. Its length is
                    eleven, and its breadth eight miles. About four fifths of this island is either
                    marsh or dry pasture-land; upon the former many oxen are fattened, and the
                    latter is appropriated to the breeding and feeding of sheep. About 10,000 acres
                    of this island is arable land, of great fertility, usually cultivated with beans
                    and wheat in alternate years, with occasionally a fallow before the beans. This
                    land is highly fertile, the wheat raised on it being considered as the best that
                    is brought to London, a bushel frequently weighing sixty-four pounds. This great
                    productiveness may be in some measure owing to the practice of applying to the
                    natural heavy clayey soil a frequent dressing of the cockle shells which are
                    washed on the beach by the sea. It is not unusual to apply thirty cart-loads of
                    these shells to an acre of land. The uplands of West Kent are extensive and
                    various in their soils. This part is more woody and enclosed than East Kent. The
                    ridge of the chalk hills, about six or seven miles in breadth, consists of a
                    stiff clay, with many surface flints, and requires six horses frequently to
                    plough it. On these soils the most common rotation is a year’s clean fallow,
                    then wheat, clover, wheat, and oats. Many large flocks of South Down sheep are
                    kept on this hilly range. The valleys and the sides of the hills are lighter
                    soil and easier to work, but do not produce better corn; some of this, but not
                    to a great extent, is cultivated for hops.</p>
                <p>The district known as the Weald of Kent was, in former times, an immense forest,
                    desolate of inhabitants, and only occupied by wild swine and deer; and though it
                    is now filled with towns and villages, and well peopled, the woods that remain
                    are extensive; exhibiting some pleasing landscapes, where seats, farms, and
                    villages, are mixed with cultivated fields, and woods of spreading oaks. The
                    roads in this district are very bad, many of them impassable for carriages in
                    the best seasons; and, in winter, horses can only travel by keeping on the
                    narrow paved tracts that are formed by the sides of the highways. The soil is
                    principally clay, with a substratum of marl, in some places very heavy, but in
                    others sufficiently light to be ploughed with oxen. This district produces
                    wheat, oats, barley, rye-grass, clover, and beans; but so various are the
                    rotations, that it is scarcely possible to generalise them. The pastures are
                    very rich and fertile, and fatten annually great numbers of cattle. In the
                    western part of this district, and in the adjoining Weald of Sussex, there were
                    formerly many ironworks: the ore is found, and the abundance of wood made the
                    manufacturing of it profitable; but the substitution of coke for charcoal in
                    making iron has put a final stop to all the iron-works of Kent and Sussex.</p>
                <p>The last agricultural division is a rich, level, extensive tract of land, on the
                    southern coast, containing about forty-five thousand acres of the richest
                    pasture in the united kingdom. This level is protected from the violence of the
                    sea, and from inundations, by a dyke of earth of very great thickness, called
                    Dimchurch-wall. The whole is alluvial land, consisting of a fine, soft, rich
                    loam, with portions of sea-sand and broken shells intermixed. The subsoil
                    consists of alternate layers of sand and clay mixed with shells, amongst which
                    are sometimes found large oak trees in various positions, the wood of which is
                    as black and as hard as ebony. On this plain there are two towns, Romney and
                    Lydd, but scarcely any villages, and few other houses than those of the
                    shepherds and herdsmen who attend upon the numerous cattle that graze on the
                    marshes.</p>
                <p>As there are no other fences but dykes, or posts and rails, from the surrounding
                    heights it has the appearance of one large verdant field covered with sheep and
                    oxen. The breeding and fattening of sheep is the principal purpose to which this
                    level is appropriated, and the number bred is greater than on any other tract of
                    the same extent in the kingdom. The sheep take their denomination from the
                    district; they are larger than the South Downs, but not of a size equal to the
                    Lincolnshire sheep. Their flesh is highly esteemed in the London markets, and
                    their wool is both fine and of a long fibre; the average weight of the fleeces
                    being about five pounds.</p>
                <p>The landed property of Kent is much divided; there are some noblemen that have
                    large, but none such vast estates <pb break="no" facs="nls:192946850"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-6850-0696"/>as to give a preponderating political influence.
                    The number of freeholders exceeds ten thousand, enjoying estates from the
                    smallest value that can give a vote, and gradually rising to L.7000 or L.8000
                    per annum. The copy-hold tenures are very few, and the peculiar tenure of Kent,
                    known as <hi rend="italic">gavel-kind,</hi> is very much diminished by various
                    legal operations.</p>
                <p>The chief manufactures carried on in this county are those connected with the
                    building and equipping of ships and boats. The males above twenty years of age
                    employed in the several branches of ship-building, block, rope, and sail making,
                    amount to 2120; to which are to be added, nearly as many plumbers, glaziers,
                    painters, joiners, ironmongers, copper-smiths, and other trades who are occupied
                    more in shipping than in other kinds of business. The larger operations of the
                    kind are carried on in the king’s yards at Deptford and Woolwich; but there are
                    many private yards for building and repairing ships on the south bank of the
                    Thames. At Woolwich, the great manufactory of warlike stores, for the use of the
                    artillery chiefly, gives occupation to many labourers exclusively of the
                    soldiers. There mortars and brass cannon are cast, bored, and mounted, the
                    different kinds of shot prepared, and all the various combustibles used in war
                    compounded; and in the dockyard at that place, some of the largest ships of war
                    are always building or repairing.* In Chatham, and at Rochester, the chief
                    manufactories are those of the government, either for the navy or for the
                    ordnance department. The private manufacturing establishments are not either
                    numerous or extensive. The largest in value is paper, which is made at Maidstone
                    and near Dover, of the best quality; but in other parts, where the water is
                    adapted for the purpose, that trade is carried on; some especially near
                    Westerham. The whole number of males above twenty years of age employed in
                    making paper are 531, of whom 147 reside in the town of Maidstone. The grinding
                    of wheat is a considerable trade, from the goodness of the wheat grown here, and
                    the slight expense of conveying the flour by water to the great market of the
                    metropolis. Some printing of calicoes is carried on, upon the banks of the river
                    Cray. The principal of these works are at Crayford, where 124, and at Bexley,
                    where forty males, above twenty years of age, are employed; but this trade, like
                    that of making paper, gives occupation to many more females than males. At
                    Dartford there are some large manufactories of gunpowder; at Deptford, of
                    several chemical preparations; at Greenwich, of machinery and of combs; and at
                    Maidstone, of bagging for hops.</p>
                <p>One of the proudest ornaments of the nation, Greenwich Hospital, for the relief
                    of disabled or aged seamen, is in this county; and, in the park contiguous to
                    it, the Royal Observatory, to which the eyes of all the navigators of Europe are
                    directed, as the place from which issues the nautical ephemeris, which all
                    nations depend on when traversing distant seas.</p>
                <p>Though Kent is bounded on three sides by the ocean and the river Thames, it has
                    scarcely any foreign commerce. The harbours are none of them good; those of
                    Dover and Ramsgate are formed by artificial piers, and the former is dry at low
                    water when the sluices are open. The only trade from Dover is to Calais,
                    Dunkirk, and Ostend, for such light goods as can bear the expense of
                    land-carriage. There is a herring fishery conducted from Folkstone; besides
                    which, the principal foreign trade consists in smuggling those various articles
                    whose high duties offer a temptation to encounter such perilous adventures.</p>
                <p>„ The sea-shores in this county invite numerous visitors, who frequent and fill
                    various towns during the warm months of summer. The principal of these are
                    Margate, Ramsgate, and Broadstairs; but, besides these, many of the smaller
                    places on the coast are resorted to for purposes of health or amusement. On the
                    western side of the county, the waters of Tunbridge have long been celebrated;
                    and though the influence of fashion has erected into rivals several other Spas,
                    yet the company that still resort to it is both numerous and respectable.</p>
