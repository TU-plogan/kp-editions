                <p><label type="entry">KLAPROTH, <hi rend="smallcaps">Martin Henry</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated Prussian chemist, professor of chemistry, member of the Academy of
                    Sciences at Berlin, foreign associate <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the Institute of
                    France, and of several other academies and learned societies, was born at
                    Berlin, on the 1st of December 1743. He had received from nature an observing,
                    serious, reflecting mind, and a capacity of patient application which nothing
                    could tire out or exhaust. After having terminated his classical studies, he
                    applied himself wholly to that of mineralogy, for which he had a decided
                    predilection; but he felt that he could not make rapid progress therein without
                    calling in the aid of chemistry, wherefore he devoted himself to these two
                    branches of physical science. The analysis of minerals appeared to him of
                    extreme importance with re<pb break="no" facs="nls:192947461"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-7461-0743"/>ference to the proper classification of these
                    unorganic substances; and multiplied experiments soon afforded him the means of
                    varying the chemical processes, and of recognizing new elements in the minerals
                    which had already been subjected to analysis. It was thus that he discovered
                    zircon in the jargon of Ceylon; that he demonstrated the presence of potash in
                    volcanic productions; that he made known the sulphate of strontian; that he
                    found potash in the leucite or white garnet; that he discovered in red schorl a
                    new metal, which he named <hi rend="italic">titanium,</hi> another in pechblende
                    which he called <hi rend="italic">uranium,</hi> and a third in the ore of white
                    gold, to which he gave the name of <hi rend="italic">telhirium.</hi> He also
                    made known the molybdate of lead, and proved that the ore of red silver was a
                    sulphuret of silver and antimony. Such are the most important of Μ. Klaproth’s
                    labours, those, in fact, which entitle him to rank amongst the most
                    distinguished chemists of his age; but he published, besides, a considerable
                    number of analyses of fossil substances, which may be found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal de Physique,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Annales de
                    Chimie,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Mines,</hi> and other collections
                    of this sort. He also prepared a mineralogical system, which is mainly founded
                    upon the constituent principles of minerals. His memoirs of chemistry have been
                    collected and translated into French by Tassaert, Paris, 1807, in two vols. 8vo.
                    Lastly, he composed, in conjunction with Wolf, a Dictionary of Chemistry, in
                    four vols. 8vo; a work which was translated into French by Bouillon-Lagrange and
                    Vagel. Klaproth greatly contributed to advance the science of mineralogy, and
                    his researches have thrown much light on the system of Werner, as well as on the
                    classification of Haüy. His discoveries, and, above all, his particular means of
                    analysis, have served to guide several French chemists, who are indebted to him
                    for part, at least, of the fortunate results which have rewarded their
                    researches. This distinguished mineralogist died at Berlin, on the 1st of
                    January 1817. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
