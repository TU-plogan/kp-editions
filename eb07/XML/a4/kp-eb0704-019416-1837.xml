                    the ancients deified the light which foreruns the rising of the sun above our

                    meteor, appearing in the form of beams or rays, and sometimes in that of arches
                    or crowns. The rays are seldom stationary, generally flitting with greater or
                    less velocity throughout the heavens; the arches are sometimes single; sometimes
                    several concentric ones are seen. These lights, or meteoric coruscations, are
                    most brilliant in the arctic regions, appearing mostly in the winter season and
                    in frosty weather. In the Shetland Islands, the <hi rend="italic">merry
                    dancers,</hi> as they are there and elsewhere called, are the constant
                    attendants of clear evenings, and serve to diminish materially the gloom of the
                    long winter nights. They commonly appear at twilight near the horizon, and
                    sometimes continue in that state for several hours without any sensible motion;
                    after which they send forth streams of stronger light, which rise from the
                    horizon in a pyramidal undulating form, shooting with great velocity up to the
                    zenith, assuming columnar and other shapes, and varying in colour from a reddish
                    yellow to the darkest russet. At other times they cover the whole hemisphere
                    with their flickering and fantastical coruscations. On these occasions their
                    motions are amazingly quick, and they astonish the spectator with rapid changes
                    of form. They break out in places where none were seen before, skimming briskly
                    along the heavens; then they are suddenly extinguished, leaving behind a uniform
                    dusky track, which, again, is brilliantly illuminated in the same manner, and as
                    suddenly left a dull blank. Some nights they assume the appearance of vast
                    columns; exhibiting on one side tints of the deepest yellow, and on the other
                    melting away till they become undistinguishable from the surrounding sky. They
                    have generally a strong tremulous motion from end to end, which continues till
                    the whole vanishes. According to the state of the atmosphere, their colours
                    vary. They sometimes assume the hue of blood, on which occasion their appearance
                    is considered portentous. I hen the rustic sages become prophetic, and terrify
                    the gazing spectators with the dread of war, pestilence, and famine. This
                    superstition is not peculiar to the northern islands; nor are these appearances
                    of recent date. The <pb break="no" facs="nls:193191850"

                    events, and lively imaginations shaped them into aerial conflicts:</p>

                <p>Dr Halley tells us, that when he observed a great aurora borealis in 1716, he had
                    begun to despair of ever seeing one at all; none having appeared, at least of
                    any considerable extent, from the time he was born until then. But
                    notwithstanding this long interval, it seems that, in some periods, the aurora
                    borealis had been seen much more frequently; and perhaps this, as well as many
                    other natural phenomena, may be subject to periodical changes and
                    variations.</p>
                <p>The only thing resembling a distinct history of this phenomenon is that which has
                    been given by the learned Dr Halley, in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions,</hi> No. 347. The first account he gives is of the appearance of
                    what is called by him <hi rend="italic">burning spears,</hi> which were seen at
                    London on the 30th January 1560. This account is taken from a book entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">A Description of Meteors,</hi> by <hi rend="italic">W.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">E.</hi> D. D., reprinted at London in 1654. The next appearance,
                    according to the testimony of Stow, was on the 7th October 1564. In 1574 also,
                    according to Camden, and Stow above-mentioned, an aurora borealis was observed
                    two nights successively, viz. on the 14th and 15th of November, having much the
                    same appearances as that described by Dr Halley in 1716, and which we now so
                    frequently observe. Again, an aurora was twice seen in Brabant, in the year
                    1575, viz. on the 13th of February and 28th of September. Its appearances at
                    both these times were described by Cornelius Gemm, professor of medicine in the
                    university of Louvain, who compares them to spears, fortified cities, and armies
                    fighting in the air. After this, Michael Maestlin, tutor to the great Kepler,
                    assures us, that atBaknang in the county of Wurtemberg in Germany, these
                    phenomena, which he styles <hi rend="italic">chasrnata,</hi> were seen by
                    himself no less than seven times in 1580. In 1581 they again appeared, in an
                    extraordinary manner in April and September, and in a less degree at some other
                    periods of the same year. In September 1621, a similar phenomenon was observed
                    all over France, and described by Gassendus, who gave it the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">aurora borealis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> yet neither this, nor
                    any similar appearance posterior to 1574, is described by English writers till
                    the year 1707, which, as Dr Halley observes, shows the prodigious neglect of
                    curious matters that then prevailed. From 1621 to 1707, indeed, there is no
                    mention made of an aurora borealis having been seen by any body; and,
                    considering the number of astronomers who during that period were in a manner
                    continually poring over the heavens, we may very reasonably conclude that
                    nothing of the kind really made its appearance until after an interval of
                    eighty-six years. A small one was seen in November 1707; and during that and the
                    following year, the same appearances were repeated five times. The next on
                    record is that mentioned by Dr Halley in March 1716, which from its brilliancy
                    attracted universal attention, and was considered by the vulgar as marking the
                    introduction of a foreign race of princes. Since that time these meteors have
                    been much more frequent. Many of those observed in this island have been
                    described. The following account of a splendid aurora borealis, as seen from the
                    Gosport Observatory on the 7th January 1831, will give an idea of the brilliancy
                    of this meteor, and of its colours, lustres, arches, and beams.</p>
                <p>“In the afternoon of this day there was a peculiar brightness in the atmosphere
                    near the horizon, for several degrees on each side of the true north point,
                    which indicated the approach of an aurora; indeed we have reason to: suspect
                    that it was a faint appearance of one; while the, sun shone in all his
                    splendour, without the interposition of cloud or vapour. Shortly after sunset an
                    aurora borealis gradually rose above the northern horizon, and at a quarter past
                    five o’clock it had assumed the form of an arch of refulgent light, ten degrees
                    in height, and seventy degrees in width. From this time till half-past five it
                    continued to increase in the intensity of its light, expanding to the western
                    point of the horizon, and fifty-five degrees to the eastward of north, which
                    made the chord of the aurora a hundred and fifty-five degrees. Now, a bright <hi
                    rend="italic">flame-coloured</hi> rainbow-like arch, between three and four
                    degrees broad, and pretty well defined at its upper edge, emanated from the
                    curved edge of the aurora to an altitude of thirty-five degrees; and while it
                    remained apparently stationary, a beautiful rainbow-like arch, still more
                    brilliant, formed about ten degrees south of the zenith, by streamers suddenly
                    springing up from the N. E. by E. and W. by S. points of the horizon, and
                    meeting in the zenith, so that these two bows presented themselves at the same
                    time. At thirty-five minutes past five, the latter bow, in some parts four and
                    in others six degrees in width, divided a little to the eastward of its vertex;
                    and the long streamers which formed it passed off gently to the southward in
                    very bright patches, two in the south-east and one in the south-west quarters,
                    like luminous clouds, and continued in sight nearly a quarter of an hour. One of
                    these bright patches nearly covered Orion several minutes. At forty minutes past
                    five another rainbow-like arch, equally wide and bright, was formed by long
                    streamers from about the same points of the horizon, whose point of convergence
                    was the same, and its course through the feet of Gemini, near the Pleiades,
                    through Aries, the square of Pegasus, the head of Equuleus, and the bow of
                    Antinous. It passed off gradually towards the south; and at a quarter before six
                    the planet Mars, then near the meridian, and about forty-five degrees in
                    altitude, rested, as it were, conspicuously on it. At six it had gone far
                    towards the southern horizon, and could scarcely be perceived, leaving the sky
                    unusually clear and bright. By this time the bow over the aurora had much
                    increased in altitude, and was nearly effaced.</p>
                <p>“At a few minutes past six, after a great many coloured columns of light had
                    risen from the north-east and northwest quarters, and passed the zenith, the
                    aurora sunk considerably towards the horizon; but its upper edge remained bright
                    and very well defined. Some of the streamers or columns were long, others short,
                    and the widest generally remained long enough to pass through a gradation of
                    prismatic colours. At half-past six the aurora again increased in altitude, and
                    vivid coruscations radiated from every part of its arch, and, on intermixing
                    with each other, formed wide columns, which were so grand with crimson tints as
                    to astonish every spectator. Between seven and eight the aurora had spread at
                    least two thirds over the heavens, and as far as the shoulders of Orion on the
                    eastern side of the meridian, when large perpendicular columns, and short
                    pointed luminous coruscations, rising from the aurora, glittering like spears
                    and conical points in nearly parallel rows, now mixing and then dividing, all
                    passed through red, orange, lake, crimson, green, and purple tints; so that the
                    appearance altogether over so great an extent of the heavens was exceedingly
                    grand, particularly when contrasted with the cerulean sky, and its spangled
                    constellations, in the southern portion of the hemisphere.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193191863" xml:id="kp-eb0704-1863-0196"/>
                <p>“At ten minutes before eight the aurora was in its greatest splendour. At five
                    minutes before eight another luminous rainbow-like arch· stretched across the
                    heavens from the eastern point of the horizon, and displayed several prismatic
                    colours while passing southward. Soon after eight a large dark space, in and
                    near the horizon, presented itself several degrees on each side of the magnetic
                    north, and the aurora, still far over the heavens, gradually diminished. At nine
                    it again ascended, and wide columns rose* from every part of its arch, and
                    passed through the same colours as before-mentioned. Between nine and ten the
                    magnetic needle, which in the early part of the evening stood at twenty-four
                    degrees west of the true north, was disturbed, and receded upwards of half a
                    degree northward, either by the influence of the aurora, or by a change of wind
                    from north-east to southwest, and of course a change in its electrical state. At
                    a quarter before eleven there was a grand display of about twelve or fourteen
                    glowing columns from the aurora, several of which passed beyond the zenith, when
                    a perfect red rainbow-like arch, ten degrees above the aurora, was visible. At
                    eleven another bow three degrees and a half wide rose from the aurora, and
                    passed through Aries, Cassiopeia, Ursa Minor, and the square of Ursa Major,
                    until, reaching the zenith, it gradually disappeared. At half-past eleven the
                    aurora again began to sink slowly, and did not rise afterwards. At five minutes
                    before twelve, a large brilliant meteor, the only one observed through the
                    night, passed under Ursa Major. At one o’clock <hi rend="smallcaps">a. m.</hi>
                    the highest part of the aurora, about the magnetic north, had sunk to within six
                    or seven degrees of the horizon; yet bright coruscations occasionally emanated
                    from it till two, when the observations were discontinued, as no more
                    interesting meteoric appearances were likely to occur.”</p>
                <p>The auroras observed, one at Cumberland House and another at Fort Enterprize, in
                    North America, arc described by Lieutenant Hood, in Captain Franklin’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Narrative.</hi> The account of the former is as follows :—</p>
                <p>“For the sake of perspicuity,” says Mr Hood, “I shall describe the several parts
                    of the aurora observed at Cumberland House, which I term <hi rend="italic"
                    >beams, flashes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">arches.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >beams</hi> are little conical pencils of light, ranged in parallel lines, with
                    their pointed extremities towards the earth, generally in the direction of the
                    dipping needle. The <hi rend="italic">flashes</hi> seem to be scattered beams,
                    approaching nearer to the earth, because they are similarly shaped, and
                    infinitely larger. I have called them flashes, because their appearance is
                    sudden, and seldom continues long. When the aurora first becomes visible, it is
                    formed like a rainbow, the light of which is faint, and the motion of the beams
                    undistinguishable. It is then in the horizon. As it approaches the zenith, it
                    resolves itself at intervals into beams, which, by a quick undulating motion,
                    project themselves into wreaths, afterwards fading away, and again brightening,
                    without any visible expansion or concentration of matter. Numerous flashes are
                    seen in different parts of the sky. That this mass, from its short distance
                    above the earth, would appear like an <hi rend="italic">arch</hi> to a person
                    situated at the horizon, may be demonstrated by the rules of perspective,
                    supposing its parts to be nearly equidistant from the earth. An undeniable proof
                    of it, however, is afforded by the observations of the 6th and 7th of April,
                    when the aurora, which filled the sky at Cumberland House, from the northern
                    horizon to the zenith, with wreaths and flashes, assumed the shape of arches at
                    some distance to the southward.</p>
                <p>“But the aurora does not always make its first appearance as an arch. It
                    sometimes rises from a confused mass of light in the east or west, and crosses
                    the sky towards the opposite point, exhibiting wreaths of beams, or coronae
                    boreales, in its way. An arch, also, which is pale and uniform at the horizon,
                    passes the zenith without displaying any irregularity or additional brilliancy;
                    and we have seen three arches together very near the northern horizon, one of
                    which exhibited beams, and even colours; but the other two were faint and
                    uniform. On the 7th of April an <hi rend="italic">arch</hi> was visible to the
                    southward, exactly similar to that in the north, and it disappeared in fifteen
                    minutes. It had probably passed the zenith before sunset. The motion of the
                    whole body of aurora is from the northward to the southward, at angles not more
                    than twenty degrees from the magnetic meridian. The centres of the arches were
                    as often in the magnetic as in the true meridian.</p>
                <p>“The <hi rend="italic">colours</hi> do not seem to depend on the presence of any
                    luminary, but to be generated by the motion of the beams, and then only when
                    that motion is rapid, and the light brilliant. The lower extremities quiver with
                    a <hi rend="italic">flery red colour,</hi> and the upper with <hi rend="italic"
                    >orange.</hi> We once saw <hi rend="italic">violet</hi> in the former. The
                    number of aurorae visible in September was two, in October three, in November
                    three, in December five, in January five, in February seven, in March sixteen,
                    in April fifteen, and in May eleven. Calm and clear weather was the most
                    favourable for observation; but it is discernible in cloudy weather, and through
                    mists. We could not perceive that it affected the weather. The magnetic needle,
                    in the open air, was disturbed by the aurora, whenever it approached the zenith.
                    Its motion was not vibratory, as observed by Mr Dalton; and this was, perhaps,
                    owing to the weight of the card attached to it. It moved slowly to the east or
                    west of the magnetic meridian, and seldom recovered its original direction in
                    less than eight or nine hours. The greatest extent of its aberration was 45". A
                    delicate electrometer, suspended at the height of fifty feet from the ground,
                    was never perceptibly affected by the aurora; nor could we distinguish its
                    rustling noise, of which, however, such strong testimony has been given to us,
                    that no doubt can remain of the fact.”</p>
                <p>The account of the aurora observed at Fort Enterprize is also interesting and
                    instructive with reference to the theory of the phenomenon.</p>
                <p>“The shapes of the aurora observed at Fort Enterprize, at its entry into the
                    horizon, and progress through the sky, may be reduced under two general
                    descriptions. In the first I shall class those which are formed like rainbows or
                    arches in the earliest stage of their appearance. They rise with their centres
                    sometimes in the magnetic meridian, and sometimes several degrees to the
                    eastward or westward of it. The number visible at the same time seldom exceeds
                    five, and is seldom limited to one. The altitude of the lowest, when first seen,
                    is never less than four degrees. As they advance towards the zenith, their
                    centres (or the parts most elevated) preserve a course nearly in the magnetic
                    meridian, or parallel to it. But the eastern and western extremities vary their
                    respective distances, and the arches become irregularly broad streams in the
                    zenith, each dividing the sky into two unequal parts, but never crossing one
                    another till they separate into parts. Those arches which were bright at the
                    horizon increase their brilliancy in the zenith, and discover the beams of which
                    they are composed when the interior motion is rapid. This interior motion is a
                    sudden glow, not proceeding from any visible concentration of matter, but
                    bursting out in several parts of the arch, as if an ignition of combustible
                    matter had taken place, and spreading itself rapidly towards each extremity. In
                    this motion the beams are formed, such as are described in the preceding
                    observations upon the subject. They have two motions; one at right angles to
                    their length or sideways; and the other a tremulous <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193191876" xml:id="kp-eb0704-1876-0197"/>ßnd short vibration, in which
                    they do not exactly preserve their parallelism to each other. By the first they
                    project themselves into wreaths, serpentine forms, or irregular broken curves.
                    The wreaths, when in the zenith, present the appearance of coronae boreales. The
                    second motion is always accompanied with colours; for it must be observed, that
                    beams are often formed without any exhibition of colours; and I have not, in
                    that case, perceived the vibratory motion. The beams, in different aurorae, and
                    sometimes in the same, are of different magnitudes, arising, probably, from
                    their various distances. These evolutions, often repeated, destroy the shape and
                    coherence of the several arches, though they doubtless retain the arched
                    appearance to the eye of a spectator at the southern horizon; for it would be
                    absurd to suppose that these changes occur only in the zenith of one particular
                    place. The observations at different places in 1820 afford satisfactory proof to
                    the contrary; and the number of arches often increased or diminished in their
                    advance to the zenith, by a dismemberment of which, from their distance, we
                    could not distinguish the particulars. However, their several parts passed
                    gradually to the southward, where they assumed the form of an arch. They are
                    also sometimes distributed into flashes, and other detached portions, which pass
                    to the south-eastward. The revolution of an arch from north to south occupies a
                    space of time varying from twenty minutes to two hours. At Cumberland House, the
                    arches were in many instances almost stationary for several hours, a proof that
                    if their motion was not slower, their distance from the earth was greater, than
                    at Fort Enterprize. The arches, which are faint at the horizon, very frequently
                    pass the zenith without any increase of brilliancy or apparent internal
                    motion.</p>
                <p>“The second general class of aurorae are those which propagate themselves from
                    different points of the compass, between north and west towards the opposite
                    points; sometimes also originating in the south-east quarter, and extending
                    themselves towards the north-west. They may be subdivided, like the former, into
                    the distant arches which pass to the southward without much visible change in
                    their appearance, and those which discover beams, and separate at intervals into
                    wreaths, flashes, and irregular segments, exhibiting all the phenomena described
                    above. In explaining the mode by which the two general classes of aurorae are
                    conducted into the horizon, I shall call the motion of the arches, which is in a
                    plane seldom deviating more than two points from the magnetic meridian, the
                    direct motion; and that by which the aurorae propagate themselves nearly at
                    right angles to the magnetic meridian, the lateral motion. Let us suppose a mass
                    of aurorae to be modelled at its birth in a longitudinal form, crossing the
                    meridians at various angles, the whole to be impelled with a direct motion
                    towards the magnetic south, but the parts having different velocities, and each
                    extremity continually removing itself by a lateral motion from the centre, so as
                    to increase the length of the mass. If the centre enter the northern horizon, it
                    will appear like an arch, the real extremities being invisible; and its direct
                    motion will carry it to the southward in that form. But if one extremity first
                    enter the horizon, it will extend itself by its lateral motion to the opposite
                    point, passing, at the same time, by its direct motion to the southward. Of the
                    unequal velocities of the parts, we had many instances, in the direct motion of
                    the arches, by which the centres were often carried from the zenith sixty or
                    seventy degrees to the southward, while the extremities did not materially alter
                    their positions. Nor can this be accounted for by any application of the rules
                    of perspective, because arches exactly similar sometimes changed the bearings of
                    their extremities in proportion to the advance of their centres; and at
                    Cumberland House, on two occasions, the extremities of arches arrived at the
                    east and west points of the compass, while their centres remained only ten
                    degrees above the northern horizon.”</p>
                <p>It was for a long time matter of doubt whether this meteor made its appearance
                    only in the northern hemisphere, or whether it was also to be observed near the
                    south pole. But the occurrence of the aurora in the antarctic regions was
                    clearly ascertained by Mr Forster, who, in his voyage round the world with
                    Captain Cook, observed it in the high southern latitudes, though with phenomena
                    somewhat different from those which are seen here. On the 17th February 1773,
                    when the navigators were in latitude 58° south, “a beautiful phenomenon was
                    observed,” says Mr Forster, “during the preceding night, which appeared again
                    this and several following nights. It consisted of long columns of a clear white
                    light, shooting up from the horizon to the eastward, almost to the zenith, and
                    gradually spreading on the whole southern part of the sky. These columns were
                    sometimes bent sidewise at their upper extremities; and though in most respects
                    similar to the northern lights <hi rend="italic">(aurora borealis)</hi> of our
                    hemisphere, yet differed from them in being always of a whitish colour, whereas
                    ours assume various tints, especially those of a fiery and purple huc. The sky
                    was generally clear when they appeared, and the air sharp and cold, the
                    thermometer standing at the freezing point.” The accounts of subsequent
                    navigators, particularly <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> Weddell, though given
                    more in detail, differ in no material respect from that just quoted, and
                    therefore need not be cited at length. They prove that this splendid meteor is
                    not confined to the northern, but occurs also in the southern regions of the
                    globe, though with considerable diversity in the accompanying phenomena.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Colour.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The colours of the polar

                    red, greenish red, orange red, and lake red. Some of the beams appear as if
                    tinged with black, and resemble dense columns of smoke. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >arches</hi> are sometimes nearly black, passing into violet blue, gray, gold
                    yellow, or white bounded by an edge of yellow. The colours are also sometimes
                    vivid and prismatic. Maupertuis describes a very remarkable red-coloured polar
                    light which he saw at Oswer Zornea on the 18th December 1786. An extensive
                    region of the heavens towards the south appeared tinged of so lively a red, that
                    the whole constellation Orion seemed as if dyed in blood. The light was for some
                    time fixed, but soon became movable; and after having successively assumed all
                    the tints of violet and blue, it formed a dome, of which the summit approached
                    the zenith in the south-west. Its splendour was so great as to be in no degree
                    affected by the bright light of the moon. Maupertuis adds, that he observed only
                    two of these northern lights in Lapland, which are of very rare occurrence in
                    that country, although the aurora there assumes a great variety of tints; hence
                    they are considered by the natives as of portentous omen, and as the forerunner
                    of some great calamity. These red-coloured polar lights have of late years been
                    observed in the Shetland Islands; in many parts of Scotland, as in the
                    neighbourhood of Edinburgh; and in England, from its northern to its southern
                    extremity.</p>

                    James Farquharson states that “the aurora borealis follows a determinate order
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193191889" xml:id="kp-eb0704-1889-0198"/> in its
                    appearance and progress; that the streamers or beams generally appear first in
                    the north, forming an arch from east to west, having its vertex at the line of
                    the magnetic meridian; that when this arch is yet only of low elevation, it is
                    of considerable breadth from north to south, having the streamers of which it is
                    composed placed crossways in relation to its own line, and all directed towards
                    a point a little south of the zenith; that the arch <hi rend="italic">moves
                    forward towards the south,</hi> contracting its lateral dimensions as it
                    approaches the zenith, and increasing in intensity of light by the shortening of
                    the streamers near the magnetic meridian and the gradual shifting of the angles
                    which the streamers near the east and west extremities of the arch make with its
                    own line, till at length these streamers become parallel to that line, and then
                    the arch is seen as a narrow belt, 3° or 4° only in breadth, extending across
                    the zenith at right angles to the magnetic meridian; that it still makes
                    progress southwards; and, after it has reached several degrees south of the
                    zenith, again enlarges in breadth, by exhibiting an order of appearances the
                    reverse of that which had attended its progress towards the zenith from the
                    north; and that the only conditions which can explain these appearances are,
                    that the streamers of the aurora are vertical, or nearly so, and form a deep
                    fringe or arch, which stretches a great way from east to west at right angles to
                    the magnetic meridian, but which is of no great thickness from north to south;
                    and that the arch moves southward, preserving its direction at right angles to
                    the magnetic meridian.” The same gentleman elsewhere remarks, that “the whole
                    lights in the north part of the sky made a rapid progress southward; and the
                    manner of this progress was repeatedly finely exhibited in the fringes and
                    fragments that had reached or passed the zenith, by the extinction of streamers
                    at their northern faces, and the formation of new ones at their southern faces.
                    The advanced southern fringe expired when it had reached about 25° south of the
                    zenith; and all did so, either when they attained a similar angle south, or
                    before they had gone so far. The confused mass of streamers in the north, as
                    they came forward in succession to the zenith, and passed that point, unfolded
                    themselves into narrow zones of light at right angles to the magnetic meridian,
                    or very nearly so; for there was occasionally a small deviation from parallelism
                    among themselves. The zones were more numerous than usual, and were separated
                    from each other by less intervals, sometimes not exceeding 3° or 4°, sometimes,
                    however, 15° or 20°.” <hi rend="italic">(Edinb. Phil. Mag.)</hi><hi

                    differ as to the elevation of the aurora borealis above the surface of the
                    earth, which is a point that can be determined only by a series of accurate
                    observations. Dr Halley observed that the aurora described by him rose to a
                    prodigious height, it being seen from the west of Ireland to the confines of
                    Russia and Poland on the east, nor did he know how much farther it might have
                    been visible; so that it extended at least 30 degrees in longitude, and from
                    latitude 50 degrees N. it was seen over all the northern part of Europe; and,
                    what was very surprising, in all those places where it was visible, the same
                    general appearances were exhibited which Dr Halley noticed at London. But he
                    observes, .with seeming regret, that he could by no means determine its height
                    for want of observations made at different places; otherwise he might easily
                    have calculated the height of the aurora, as he did that of the luminous ball of
                    1719. Father Boscovich, says he, determined the height of an aurora borealis,
                    observed on the 16th of December 1737 by the Marquis of Poleni, to have been 825
                    miles; Bergmann, from a mean of thirty computations, makes the average height of
                    the aurora borealis to be 70 Swedish or upwards of 460 English miles; Euler
                    supposes it to be several thousands of miles in height; and Mairanalso assigns
                    it a very elevated region. In the 74th volume of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical</hi><hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> Dr Blagden, speaking of
                    the height of some fiery meteors, remarks that the “aurora borealis appears to
                    occupy as high if not a higher region above the surface of the earth, as may be
                    judged from the very distant countries to which it has been visible at the same
                    time.” On the 22d October 1804 it is said that the same polar light was seen at
                    the same time in Saxony and in Liefland. Mr Dalton of Manchester, in a paper
                    read to the Royal Society of London on the 17th April 1828, describes a polar
                    light which he observed on the 29th March 1826, assuming the form of a regular
                    arch at right angles to the magnetic meridian, and continuing for above an hour
                    in the same position; thus affording a favourable opportunity for obtaining the
                    data requisite for determining its height. He took great pains to collect as
                    many authentic accounts as possible of the apparent position of this luminous
                    arch with reference to the stars, when seen from various places where it had
                    been observed in England and in Scotland. And according to Mr Dalton’s view of
                    the distribution of the meteor, it appears to have been seen in places 170 miles
                    distant from one another in a north and south direction, and 45 miles distant
                    from east to west, thus comprising an area of 7000 or 8000 square miles; but it
                    musfhave been visible over a much greater extent. Accounts were received of its
                    having been seen as far north as Edinburgh, and as far south as Manchester and
                    Doncaster, and at most of the intermediate towns. From the exact correspondence
                    of the descriptions at all these places, it was inferred that they referred to
                    the same individual luminous appearance. In proceeding from north to south, the
                    apparent altitude of the arch continually increased, still keeping the south of
                    the zenith to the distance of Kendal, at which place it very nearly crossed the
                    zenith. At Warrington, which is farther south, the culminating point of the arch
                    was north of the zenith; and, wherever seen, the arch always seemed to terminate
                    nearly in the magnetic east and west, at two opposite points of the horizon. The
                    observations in which the author placed the greatest confidence for determining
                    the height of the aurora were those made at Whitehaven and at Warrington, places
                    which are distant 83 miles from each other, and situated nearly on the same
                    magnetic meridian. Calculating from the data they afford, he found the height of
                    the arch very nearly 100 miles above the surface of the. earth, and immediately
                    over the towns of Kendal and Kirkby-Stephen. This conclusion is countenanced by
                    observations made at Jedburgh; yet if the former be compared with those at
                    Edinburgh, the height will come out to be 150 or 160 miles, and the position
                    vertical above Carlisle; but he thinks the former result more entitled to
                    confidence. Assuming the height to be 100 miles, it follows that the breadth of
                    the arch would be eight or nine miles; and its visible length, in an easterly
                    and westerly direction from any one place, would be about 550 miles.</p>
                <p>But we are disposed to reject these calculations of Dalton, because from the
                    particular details in his memoirs, and the known distribution of the aurorae, it
                    is highly probable that the aurorae said by him to have been seen at the same
                    time at great distances were different aurorae, and then not much elevated above
                    the clouds. Indeed Mr Farquharson, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical</hi><hi rend="italic">Transactions,</hi> part i. 1829, when
                    discussing the value of Mr Dalton’s observations, thinks that the observations
                    made from Edinburgh to Warrington might be explained on the supposition that
                    there were several nearly vertical arches of the aurora, almost
                    contemporaneously hanging over many lines from Edin<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193191902" xml:id="kp-eb0704-1902-0199-01"/>burgh to Warrington, at a
                    few thousand feet above the surface. The observations of Dr Richardson, Captain
                    Franklin, Lieutenant Hood, and others, render it highly probable that many polar
                    lights occur at heights not higher than the region of clouds. Dr Richardson’s
                    observations seem to show that the aurora is occasionally seated in a region of
                    the atmosphere, below a kind of cloud which is known to possess no great
                    altitude, namely, that modification of cirro-stratus which, descending low in
                    the atmosphere, produces a hazy sheet of cloud over-head, or a fog-bank in the
                    horizon. Indeed Dr Richardson is inclined to infer that the aurora borealis is
                    constantly accompanied by, or immediately precedes, the formation of one or
                    other of the forms of cirro-stratus. On the 13th of November and 18th December
                    1826, at Fort Enterprize, its connection with a cloud intermediate between
                    cirrus and cirro-stratus is mentioned; but the most vivid coruscations of the
                    aurora were observed when there were only a few thin attenuated shoots of
                    cirro-stratus floating in the air, or when that cloud was so rare that its
                    existence was only known by the production of a halo round the moon. The natives
                    of the arctic regions of North America pretend to foretell wind by the rapidity
                    of the motions of the aurora; and they say, that when it spreads over the sky in
                    a uniform sheet of light, it is followed by fine weather, and that the changes
                    thus indicated are more or less speedy, according as the appearance of the
                    meteor is early or late in the evening; an opinion not improbable, when it is
                    recollected that certain kinds of cirro-stratus are also regarded by
                    meteorologists as sure indications of rain and wind. Dr Richardson frequently
                    observed the lower surface of nebulous masses illuminated by polar lights; a
                    fact illustrative of the comparatively low situation of these aurorae. Biot,
                    also, in the island of Unst, observed many aurorae that could not be higher than
                    the region of clouds. Captain Franklin in like manner observed low aurorae. “The
                    important fact,” says he, “of the existence of the aurora at a less elevation
                    than that of dense clouds was evinced on two or three occasions this night (13th
                    February 1821, at Fort Enterprize), and particularly at 11 hours 50 min., when a
                    brilliant mass of light, variegated with the prismatic colours, passed between
                    an uniform steady dense cloud and the earth, and in its progress completely
                    concealed that portion of the cloud which the stream of light covered, until the
                    coruscation had passed over it, when the cloud appeared as before.” Captain
                    Parry, as stated in his third voyage, observed aurorae near to the earth’s
                    surface. It is said that while Lieutenants Scherer and Ross and Captain Parry
                    were admiring the extreme beauty of a polar light, they all simultaneously
                    uttered an exclamation of surprise at seeing a bright ray of the aurora shoot
                    suddenly downward from the general mass of light, and between them and the land,
                    which was only three thousand yards distant. The ray or beam of the polar light
                    thus passed within a distance of three thousand yards, or less than two miles,
                    of them. Further, Mr Farquharson observed in Aberdeenshire an aurora borealis
                    not more than four thousand feet above the level of the sea; and he agrees with
                    Richardson, Franklin, &amp;c., in believing that the aurorae occur in a region
                    immediately above that of the clouds, and of course vary in height with the
                    different states of the atmosphere. But although this region was very low on the
                    20th December 1829, in the polar light seen from Alford, we know that at times
                    it is several miles high, agreeing with the observations of these intelligent
                    travellers. We have frequently seen the aurora when the height of the clouds
                    could not be estimated at less than two or three miles, and at other unes not
                    higher than a thousand or fifteen hundred feet.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Position of the Polar Lights.—</hi> The arches of the polar
                    gits generally cross the magnetic meridian at right angles; when two or more
                    appear at once they are concentric, and tend to the magnetic east and west. The
                    beams or streamers in the direction of their length coincide with the plane of
                    the dip of the needle, or nearly so; and each individual streamer is, in fact,
                    parallel to the dippingneedle. Dr Richardson thinks he has observed a polarity
                    in the masses of cloud belonging to a certain kind of cirro-stratus approaching
                    to cirrus, by which their long diameters, having all the same direction, were
                    made to cross the magnetic meridian nearly at right angles. But the apparent
                    convergence of such masses of cloud towards the opposite points of the horizon,
                    which have been so frequently noticed by meteorologists, is an optical
                    deception, produced when they are situated in a plane parallel to that on which
                    the observer stands. These circumstances, says Dr Richardson, are here noticed,
                    because, if it shall hereafter be proved that the aurora depends upon the
                    existence of certain clouds, its apparent polarity may perhaps, with more
                    propriety, be ascribed to the clouds themselves which emit the light; or, in
                    other words, the clouds may assume their peculiar arrangement through the
                    operation of one cause (magnetism, for example), while the emission of light may
                    be produced by another, namely, a change in their internal constitution, perhaps
                    connected with a motion of the electrical fluid.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Magnetic Property of the Polar Lights.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> Many years ago philosophers remarked that the magnetic needle was
                    agitated during polar lights; and hence it was inferred that these lights were
                    somehow connected with magnetism Other observers, again, maintained that these
                    observations must be erroneous, as they could not in any instance perceive the
                    compass affected by the presence of this meteor. But the late observations, of
                    Biot, Hansteen, Gay-Lussac, Kupfer, and particularly of Richardson, Franklin,
                    and Farquharson, have demonstrated that the magnetic needle is affected by the
                    polar lights. As the fact is one of the most curious in meteorology, we shall
                    now state some particulars illustrative of its nature. In Captain Franklin’s
                    observations, the horizontal compass was placed in a firm sheltered stand, fixed
                    to the back wall of the house at Fort Enterprize, three feet above the ground,
                    on a northern exposure; and the dipping needle was similarly fixed to the end of
                    the storehouse, at the distance of forty feet. There was no iron near either of
                    them. The house stood on a sand-hill, and there were no large stones in its
                    immediate neighbourhood. The horizontal compass belonged to a small variation
                    transit made by Dollond; and its graduated scale, of one and a half inch radius,
                    was divided into degrees, the degrees counting from north towards west to 360.
                    Each degree was subdivided into 20, and, by the assistance of a magnifying
                    glass, he could read it off accurately to within three minutes. The horizontal
                    position was preserved by means of a spirit-level attached to the
                    instrument.</p>
                <p>The manner in which the needle is affected by the au-, rora will require some
                    description. “The motion com-ļ municated to it,” says Captain Franklin, “was
                    neither sud-ļ den nor vibratory. Sometimes it was simultaneous with the
                    formation of arches, prolongation of beams, or certain other changes of form or
                    action of the aurora. But generally the effect of these phenomena upon the
                    needle was not visible immediately, but in about half an hour or an hour the
                    needle had attained its maximum of deviation. From this its return to its former
                    position was very gradual, seldom regaining it before the following morning, and
                    frequently not until the afternoon, unless it was expedited by another arch of
                    the aurora operating in a direction different from the former one.</p>
                <p>“The <hi rend="italic">arches</hi> of the aurora,” he adds, “most commonly
                    traverse the sky nearly at right angles to the magnetic <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193191915" xml:id="kp-eb0704-1915-0200"/>meridian, but the deviations
                    from this direction, as has been already stated, were not rare; and I am
                    inclined to consider that these different positions of the aurora have
                    considerable influence upon the direction of the needle. When an arch was nearly
                    at right angles to the magnetic meridian, the motion of the needle was towards
                    the west; this westward motion was still greater when one extremity of an arch
                    bore 301°, or about 59° to the west of the magnetic north, that is, when the
                    extremity of the arch approached from the west towards the magnetic north. A
                    westerly motion also took place when the extremity of an arch was in the true
                    north, or about 36° to the west of the magnetic north, but not in so great a
                    degree as when its bearing was about 301°. A contrary effect was produced when
                    the same end of an arch originated to the southward of the magnetic west, viz.
                    when it bore from about 245° to 234°, and, of course, when its opposite
                    extremity approached nearer to the magnetic north. In these cases the motion of
                    the needle was towards the east. In one instance only a complete arch was formed
                    in the magnetic meridian; in another, the beam shot up from the magnetic north
                    to the zenith; and in both these cases the needle moved towards the west.</p>
                <p>"The needle was most disturbed on February 13, p. Μ., at a time when the aurora
                    was most distinctly seen passing between a stratum of clouds and the earth, or
                    at least illuminating the face of the clouds opposed to the observer. This and
                    several other appearances induced me to infer that the distance of the aurora
                    from the earth varied on different nights, and produced a proportionate effect
                    on the needle. When the light shone through a dense hazy atmosphere, when there
                    was a halo round the moon, or when a small snow was falling, the disturbance was
                    generally considerable; and on certain hazy cloudy nights the needle frequently
                    deviated in a considerable degree, although the aurora was not visible at the
                    time. Our observations do not enable us to decide whether this ought to be
                    attributed to an aurora concealed by a cloud or haze, or entirely to the state
                    of the atmosphere. Similar deviations have been observed in the day-time, both
                    in a clear and cloudy state of the sky, but more frequently in the latter case.
                    Upon one occasion the aurora was seen immediately after sunset, whilst bright
                    day-light was remaining. A circumstance to which I attach some importance must
                    not be omitted. Clouds have been sometimes observed during the day to assume the
                    forms of the aurora, and I am inclined to connect with the appearance of these
                    clouds the deviation of the needle, which was occasionally remarked at such
                    times. An aurora sometimes approached the zenith without producing any change in
                    the position of the needle, as was more generally the case; whilst at other
                    times a considerable alteration took place although the beams or arches did not
                    come near the zenith. The aurora was frequently seen without producing any
                    perceptible effect on the needle. At such times its appearance was that of an
                    arch, or an horizontal stream of dense yellowish light, with little or no
                    internal motion. The disturbance in the needle was not always proportionate to
                    the agitation of the aurora, but it was always greater when the quick motion and
                    vivid light were observed to take place in a hazy atmosphere. In a few
                    instances, the motion of the needle was observed to commence at the instant a
                    beam darted upwards from the horizon; and its former position was more quickly
                    or slowly regained according to circumstances. If an arch was formed immediately
                    afterwards, having its extremities placed on opposite sides of the magnetic
                    north and south to the former one, the return of the needle was more speedy, and
                    it generally went beyond the point from whence it first started.”</p>
                <p>A series of interesting observations on this subject were also made in December
                    1829, by the reverend James Farquharson, F. R. S., of Aberdeenshire, with an
                    apparatus transmitted to him by the Royal Society of London. This apparatus
                    consisted of a horizontal brass circle, about one foot in diameter, graduated to
                    divisions of ten minutes, and capable of adjustment to a perfect level by means
                    of spirit levels and screwed feet. Concentrically within this divided circle
                    moved a circular horizontal brass plate, its edge touching the divisions, and
                    having at opposite points two verniers, which, by means of attached microscopes,
                    indicated the movements which it made to 60th parts of ten minutes, or 10". The
                    movement of the plate within the circle was effected by means of a screw. A
                    circular brass needle-box was attached to the surface of the inner plate, and a
                    vertical pointed steel wire for supporting the needle formed the centre. At
                    opposite points in the needle-box were fixed two micrometers, with cross wires
                    in the foci, for adjusting the needle to a level, and observing any change in
                    its direction. The top of the needlebox was a circular plate of ground glass in
                    a brass ring, made to slip easily off and on, and having screwed into its centre
                    a vertical brass tube about eight inches long, for the purpose of suspending the
                    needle with fibres of silk, for measuring the time of its oscillations. A
                    horizontal brass pin, with a minute perforation for the silk near its middle,
                    passed through the vertical tube near its top, and being contrived with several
                    motions, served to adjust the suspended needle, and bring it correctly over the
                    steel point, where its levelling could be completely ascertained. The magnetic
                    needle itself was a rectangular plate about five inches long, half an inch
                    broad, and ⅟₄₀th of an inch thick. An agate cup set in brass admitted of being
                    screwed in either at the narrow or flat side of the needle; and a little
                    fixed-ring of brass, with a minute perforation in its top, rising over the cup,
                    admitted of the ready attachment of the silk; so that the needle could be placed
                    on the steel point, or suspended with the silk, with its flat face either
                    vertical or horizontal. This apparatus measured, with great accuracy, very
                    minute changes in the declination of the needle, one so small as 10" being quite
                    sensible by it.</p>
                <p>The observations made with this apparatus, and published in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions of the Royal Society of London</hi> for 1830, also show, in a most
                    satisfactory manner, that the magnetic needle is actually affected by the
                    presence of the polar lights. They equally prove that the needle is not in every
                    instance agitated by the polar lights, even when they are very brilliant; the
                    oscillations taking place only when the beams or fringes of the meteor are in
                    the same plane with the dip of the needle. But as the needle is affected in
                    those planes only where the fringes or arches are in the plane just mentioned,
                    it is evident that observers in different latitudes may obtain very discordant
                    results in the same evening. The observations collected by Dalton, of the
                    appearance of the aurora of the 29th March 1826, prove that many fringes or
                    arches may be parallel to each other at remote distances; and the observations
                    of the President of the Royal Society, on a luminous arch in Cornwall, 29th
                    September 1828, which appeared simultaneously with a remarkable aurora of many
                    arches extending over the whole of Aberdeenshire, show that the meteor is
                    sometimes active over a space nearly coincident with the extent of the kingdom;
                    and there is reason for believing that it often extends much farther. There
                    might, therefore, be an extensive succession of observations of disturbance and
                    non-disturbance of the needle at the same instant from north to south over many
                    degrees of latitude.</p>

                    Having, many years ago, both in this country and in the Shetland Islands, heard

                    although they do not deny that they may have been heard. Thus Richardson says,
                    “I have never heard any sound that could be unequivocally considered as
                    originating in the aurora; but the uniform testimony of the natives, both Crees
                    and Copper Indians, and Esquimaux, and of all the older residents in the
                    country, induces me to believe that its motions are sometimes audible.” Captain
                    Franklin says, “I have not heard the noise ascribed to the aurora, but the
                    uniform testimony of the natives and of the residents in this country induces me
                    to believe that it is occasionally audible.” Parry frequently listened for
                    sounds, from the polar lights, but never heard any. Lieutenant Hood says
                    (Franklin’s <hi rend="italic">Narrative,</hi> p. 535), “We repeatedly heard a
                    hissing noise, like that of a musket bullet passing through the air, which
                    seemed to proceed from the aurora; but Mr Wentzel assured us that this noise was
                    occasioned by severe cold succeeding mild weather, and acting upon the surface
                    of the snow previously melted in the sun’s rays. The temperature of the air was
                    then — 35°, and on the two preceding days it had been above zero. The next
                    morning it was — 42°, and we frequently heard a similar noise. Mr Hearn’s
                    description of. the noise of the aurora agrees exactly with Mr Wentzel’s, and
                    with that of every other person who heard it. It would be an absurd scepticism
                    to doubt the fact any longer, for our observations have rather increased than
                    diminished the probability of it.” Muschenbroeck says that the Greenland fishers
                    in his time assured him that they had frequently heard noises proceeding from
                    the aurora borealis. Mr Nairnc is confident that he has heard a hissing and
                    whizzing noise when the polar lights were very bright; and Mr Cavallo affirms
                    that he more than once heard a crackling noise from polar lights. Giesecké, who
                    resided so long in West or Old Greenland, says, “the polar lights sometimes
                    appear very low, and then they are much agitated, and a crashing and crackling
                    sound is heard, like that of an electric spark, or the falling of hail.”
                    Professor Parrot of Dorpat describes a magnificent polar light he witnessed on
                    the 22d October 1804, from which a crackling and rustling noise proceeded, “We
                    learn from the inhabitants,” says Captain Brooke, in histnteresting travels
                    through Norway, “with respect to the polar or northern lights, that they had
                    frequently heard the noise that sometimes attends them, which they describe like
                    that of a rushing wind. At Hammerfest they said they were violent, and descended
                    so low that it would appear almost possible to touch them.” In a letter from Mr
                    Ramm of Tonset in Norway, addressed to Professor Hansteen, and published m the
                    <hi rend="italic">Magazin</hi><hi rend="italic">fur Naturwidenshaberne,</hi>
                    Christiana, 1825, we are told that he several times heard a quick whispering
                    noise simultaneously with the motion of the beams of the polar lights. In the
                    same journal, Professor Hansteen says, “The polar regions being in reality the
                    native country of the polar light, we ought to be particularly interested in
                    obtaining any additional information on the natural history of this remarkable
                    phenomenon; and we have so many certain accounts of the noise attending it, that
                    the negative experience of southern nations cannot be brought in opposition to
                    our positive knowledge. Unfortunately, we we, since the beginning of this
                    century, in one of the great pauses of this phenomenon; so that the present
                    generation 'nows but little of it from personal observation. It would therefore
                    be very agreeable to receive, from older people, observations of this kind, made
                    in their youth, when the aurora borealis showed itself in full splendour. It can
                    be proved mathematically that the rays of the northern lights ascend from the
                    surface of the earth, in a direction inclining towards the south (an inclination
                    which, with us, forms an angle of about 73°). If, then, this light occupies the
                    whole northern sky, rising more than 17° above the zenith, the rays must proceed
                    from under the feet of the observer, although they do not receive their
                    reflecting power till they have reached a considerable elevation, perhaps beyond
                    our atmosphere. It is therefore conceivable why we should frequently hear a
                    noise attending the northern lights, when.the inhabitants of southern countries,
                    who see the phenomenon at a distance of many hundred miles, hear no report
                    whatever. Wargentin, in the fifteenth volume of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactio7is of the Swedish Academy,</hi> says, that Dr Gisler and Mr Hellant,
                    who had resided for some time in the north of Sweden, made, at the request of
                    the academy, a report of their observations on the aurora borealis.” To these
                    observations Professor Hansteen adds, that Captain Abrahamson, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions of the Scandinavian Literary Society,</hi> has given
                    an account of several observations of noises that were heard proceeding from the
                    northern lights. The professor concludes with stating that he himself knows
                    several persons who have distinctly heard the same sounds; he expresses his
                    surprise that a fact so well established should be called in question; and he
                    relates, with some sharpness, a conversation he once had on this subject with an
                    Englishman, who remarked that the Norwegian tales of noises proceeding from
                    polar lights were akin to the ghost stories of this country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Theory of the Aurora Borealis.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    theory of this phenomenon is involved in the copious details which have been
                    given under the different foregoing heads; and, indeed, from all that is known,
                    it appears reasonable to infer that it is intimately connected with electricity
                    and magnetism. “The aurora borealis,” says Dr Young,“is certainly in some
                    measure a magnetical phenomenon; and if iron were the only substance capable of
                    exhibiting magnetic effects, it would follow that some ferruginous particles
                    must exist in the upper regions of the atmosphere. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >ligld,</hi> usually attending this magnetical meteor may possibly be derived
                    from electricity, which maybe the immediate cause of a change in the
                    distribution of the magnetic fluid contained in the ferruginous vapours which
                    are imagined to float in the air.” <hi rend="italic">(Lectures,</hi> vol. i. p.
                    687.) This assumption of ferruginous particles or vapours, however, seems purely
                    gratuitous and imaginary; and as iron is not the only substance or matter
                    capable of exhibiting magnetic effects, light itself being susceptible of
                    polarization, the above hypothesis is therefore untenable even on the ground on
                    which it has been rested by its author. But it is nevertheless certain that the
                    cause of this luminous meteor is intimately connected with magnetism and
                    electricity; or rather, as the magnetic is variously modified and affected by
                    the electric power, with the phenomena of electro-magnetism. “It is doubtful,”
                    says Dr Young in another place, “whether the light of the aurora borealis may
                    not be of an electric nature; the phenomenon is certainly connected with the
                    general cause of magnetism and he refers in support of this opinion to the
                    ascertained fact that the primitive beams or rays of light are constantly
                    observed in a direction parallel to that of the dipping needle; adding, that
                    “although the substance be magnetical, the illumination which renders it visible
                    may still be derived from the passage of electricity, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193191941" xml:id="kp-eb0704-1941-0202"/>at too great a distance to be
                    discovered by any other test.” <hi rend="italic">{Lectures,</hi> vol. i. p.
                    716.) The fact is, that in magnetism, the agency of electricity is now clearly
                    made out, and they are shown to stand to each other in the relation of effect
                    and cause, at least in as far as that all the phenomena of magnetism are
                    producible by electricity; but no electric phenomena have ever been hitherto
                    produced by magnetism. (Herschel’s <hi rend="italic">Preliminary Discourse,</hi>
                    p. 93.)* Hence the aurora “is certainly connected with the general cause of
                    magnetism,” in as far as it is a joint result or effect of the cause by which it
                    is now known that all the phenomena of magnetism are producible; but this
                    connection is one of relation or coincidence merely; and hence it is to the
                    agency of electricity that the phenomena of the aurora are primarily to be
                    ascribed. “This wonderful agent,” says Mr Herschel, “which we see in intense
                    activity in lightning, and in a feebler and more diffused form traversing the
                    upper regions of the atmosphere in the northern lights, is present, probably in
                    immense abundance, in every form of matter which surrounds us, but becomes
                    sensible only when disturbed by excitements of peculiar kinds.” <hi
                    rend="italic">{Prelim. Discourse,</hi> p. 329, 330.) Mr Canton, likewise,
                    conceives that the aurora is occasioned by the rapid transition or passage of
                    electrical matter from positive towards negative clouds, throughout the upper
                    region of the atmosphere, where the resistance is the least; but he supposes
                    that the aurora which appears at the time when the magnetic needle is disturbed
                    is not the cause of this disturbance, which he attributes to the heat of the
                    earth, and that it is merely the electricity of the heated air above, disengaged
                    chiefly in the northern regions, where the alteration in the temperature of the
                    air is greatest. Be this as it may, however, the experiment contrived by Mr
                    Canton shows clearly that the phenomena of the aurora are intimately connected
                    with, or rather consequent on, a particular constitution of the atmosphere in
                    regard to density and electricity. If, for example, a glass tube about three
                    feet in length be partially exhausted of air, hermetically sealed, and then
                    applied longitudinally to the prime conductor of an electrical machine, the
                    whole tube will be illuminated from end to end, and this illumination will
                    continue for a considerable time after it has been removed from the conductor.
                    If, again, the tube be drawn through the hand either way, the light will become
                    remarkably intense throughout its whole length; and although a great part of the
                    electricity will be discharged by this operation, the tube will nevertheless
                    emit flashes at intervals, if held by one extremity and kept quite steady;
                    while, if grasped by the other hand at a different place, vivid flashes of light
                    will dart from one end to the other, and continue to be emitted for a
                    considerable time without any fresh excitation. It is to be observed, however,
                    that if the density of the air included in the tube be either increased or
                    diminished beyond a certain limit, none of these luminous appearances will be
                    exhibited; and it is this circumstance which shows that the phenomena of the
                    aurora depend on a certain constitution of the atmosphere in point of density
                    and electricity, and that the meteoric appearances or coruscations can never
                    attain the elevation ascribed to them by some philosophers, but must in every
                    case be confined within the limits of our atmosphere, conformably to the
                    observations of Biot and others already detailed. Beccaria, indeed, conjectures
                    that there is a constant and regular circulation of the electric fluid from
                    north to south; and he gives it as his opinion that the aurora borealis is this
                    electric matter performing its transit southwards, in a state of the atmosphere
                    which renders it visible, or approaching nearer than usual to the earth. But
                    such a transition or circulation as that here suggested could only be produced
                    by the diurnal revolution of the earth around its axis; and as the meteor is
                    observed in the southern with nearly the same appearances as in the northern
                    hemisphere, there must consequently be a circulation from south to north as well
                    as from north to south; in other words, if there be any such tendency as that
                    which Beccaria supposes, it must proceed equally or nearly so from both poles
                    towards the equator. The following is a list of the most important papers,
