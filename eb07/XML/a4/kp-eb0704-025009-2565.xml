                    or the goods on board it, belong, or by whom it or they are insured, in order
                    that no particular individual or individuals amongst them, who may have been
                    forced to make a sacrifice, or submit to a loss for the preservation of the ship
                    or cargo, or both, should lose more than others.</p>
                <p>Average is either <hi rend="italic">general or particular.</hi> General average
                    is when a sacrifice is made for the common benefit of the ship and cargo, or a
                    loss is incurred in providing for their mutual safety. “Thus,” says Mr Sergeant
                    Marshall, “when the goods of a particular merchant are thrown overboard in a
                    storm, to save the ship from sinking; or when the masts, cables, anchors, or
                    other furniture of the ship are cut away or destroyed for the preservation of
                    the whole; or money or goods are given as a composition to pirates to save the
                    rest, or an expense is incurred in reclaiming the ship, or defending a suit in a
                    foreign court of admiralty, and obtaining her discharge from an unjust capture
                    or detention; in these and the like cases, when any sacrifice is deliberately
                    and voluntarily made, or any expense fairly and <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi>
                    incurred to prevent a total loss, such sacrifice or expense is the proper
                    subject of a general contribution, and ought to be mutually borne by the owners
                    of the ship, freight, and cargo, so that the loss may fall equally on all,
                    according to the equitable maxι∏ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><pb break="no"

                    7.)</p>
                <p>Particular average is when a sacrifice is made for the sake of the ship only, or
                    of the cargo only, or when a loss is incurred on account of one or other of
                    them. General average affects <hi rend="italic">all</hi> who have any interest
                    in the ship or cargo, proportionally to that interest; particular average
                    affects only the owners of the ship, or the owners of the cargo, or part of the
                    cargo.</p>
                <p>There are also some small charges, called <hi rend="italic">petty</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">accustomed</hi> averages. They consist of disbursements on account
                    of pilotage, light-houses, beaconage, quarantine, &amp;c. When these charges are
                    incurred in the ordinary course of the voyage, they are not considered as a
                    general average, but are set down, one third to the ship, and two thirds to the
                    cargo. If, however, they are incurred for any extraordinary purpose, or to
                    relieve the ship and cargo from some impending danger, they are to be reputed
                    general average.</p>
                <p>The word <hi rend="italic">average</hi> is also met with in bills of lading, when
                    it is said that so much freight shall be paid for the goods “with primage and
                    <hi rend="italic">average</hi> accustomed.” In this sense it merely signifies a
                    small duty or premium, which those who send goods in ships belonging to others
                    are in the habit of paying to the master, over and above the freight, for his
                    care and attention to the goods intrusted to him.</p>
                <p>The doctrine of average contributions seems to have grown out of the necessity
                    which must have been early experienced, of occasionally throwing overboard part
                    of a cargo, in order to provide for the safety of the remainder. The justice of
                    making those whose property was saved contribute to place those who had been
                    called upon to submit to such a sacrifice in the same situation as themselves,
                    is so very obvious, that it could not long escape the notice of commercial
                    legislators. The principle is clearly laid down in the Rhodian law, “Omnium
                    contributione sarciatur (it is there said), quod pro omnibus datum est.
                    Aequissimum enim est, commune detrimentum fieri eorum qui, propter amissas res
                    aliorum, consecuti sunt, ut merces suas salvas haberent.” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Dig.</hi> lib. xiv. tit. 2.) This sound principle, with some of the cases
                    illustrating its application, was early embodied in the Roman law; and having
                    been applied and modified according to the greater experience afforded by the
                    extraordinary extension of navigation, the subject of average forms a most
                    important and interesting chapter in all modern systems of maritime
                    jurisprudence.</p>
                <p>No general average ever takes place unless it can be shown that the danger was
                    imminent, and that the sacrifice made <hi rend="italic">was indispensable, or
                    believed to be indispensable, b]; the captain and officers, for the safety of
                    the ship and cargo.</hi> It has been stated <hi rend="italic">(Lex Mercat.</hi>
                    148), that in order to legalize the act of throwing goods overboard, three
                    things must concur:</p>
                <p>1rf, That what is so condemned to destruction be in consequence of a deliberate
                    and voluntary consultation held between the master and men;</p>
                <p>2&lt;Z(y, That the ship be in distress, and that sacrificing a part be necessary,
                    in order to preserve the rest;</p>
                <p>3√(y, That the saving of the ship and cargo be actually owing to the means used
                    with that sole view.</p>
                <p>But, however desirable, deliberate consultation is not to be expected when danger
                    is imminent; and, in point of fact, the only thing necessary to legalize <hi
                    rend="italic smallcaps"> Oλq</hi><hi rend="italic">jettison,</hi> as it is
                    termed, is that it be deemed essential by the master and seamen for the common
                    safety. Provided it be the effect of danger and the cause of security, all
                    authorities agree that contribution ought to be made, though the onus may not
                    have been complied with. “Previous demeration, if there be time to deliberate,
                    and a due choice of the heaviest and most cumbersome articles, may be proofs of
                    the necessity and propriety of the act; but they are not the <hi rend="italic"
                    >only</hi> nor the <hi rend="italic">essential</hi> proofs. Indeed, in this
                    case, as in many others, too close a compliance with forms, at a period of
                    supposed danger, has very justly excited a suspicion of fraud. In all cases,
                    however, and in all countries, it is justly required of the master, that he draw
                    up an account of the jettison, and verify the same by the oath of himself and
                    some of his crew, as soon as possible after his arrival at any port, that there
                    may be no opportunity to purloin goods from the ship, and then pretend they were
                    cast over in the hour of danger.” (Abbott, Lord Tenterden, <hi rend="italic">On
                    the Law of Shipping,</hi> part. iii. cap. 8.)</p>
                <p>The third condition above stated as requisite to warrant a general contribution,
                    viz. “that the saving of the ship and cargo be actually owing to the means used
                    with that sole view,” is not only incapable of proof, but is in itself
                    unreasonable and absurd. There is, however, no contribution, unless the ship and
                    the rest of the cargo be saved. Hence, if goods be thrown overboard in a storm,
                    and the ship afterwards perish in the same storm, there is no contribution of
                    the goods saved, if any, because the object for which the goods were thrown
                    overboard was not attained. But if a ship, preserved by a jettison, and
                    continuing her course, be afterwards lost, the goods saved from this last
                    misfortune, if any, must contribute to the loss sustained by the jettison,
                    because to it their preservation at a previous period was owing. (Marshall, b.
                    i. c. xii. § 7.)</p>
                <p>No general average takes place in consequence of a jettison that has been
                    rendered necessary by the ship being overloaded, or by goods being placed in
                    some improper place, as on the deck. The loss in such cases falls wholly on the
                    owners and master; for it must have originated either in the negligence or
                    misconduct of one or both of those parties. (Loccenius <hi rend="italic">De
                    Jure</hi><hi rend="italic">Maritimo,</hi> lib. ii. c. viii. § 14.)</p>
                <p>Formerly it was a customary practice in this, as it still is in some foreign
                    countries, to ransom ships when captured by an enemy, the ransom being made good
                    by general average. But this practice having been deemed disadvantageous, was
                    abolished by statute 22 Geo. III. c. 25, which declares, “That all contracts and
                    agreements which shall be entered into, and all bills, notes, and other
                    securities which shall be given, by any person or persons, for ransom of any
                    ship or vessel, merchandise or goods, captured by the subjects of any state at
                    war with his majesty, or by any person committing hostilities against his
                    majesty’s subjects, shall be absolutely void in law, and of no effect whatever.”
                    Any person entering into such a contract is subjected to a penalty of L.500.</p>
                <p>The principles already laid down apply equally to all injuries done to the ship,
                    or to extraordinary expenses incurred on her account, for the common safety.
                    Thus, if damage be voluntarily done to a ship, by cutting her sides or deck to
                    facilitate a necessary jettison, or by running her on shore to avoid an enemy or
                    the danger of a storm; or if the captain, compelled by necessity, cut away and
                    abandon his masts, or any other part of the rigging or furniture, to lighten the
                    ship in the moment of distress; the loss and expenses occasioned by these
                    sacrifices must be made good by a general average.</p>
                <p>But injuries to the ship, not voluntarily incurred for her safety and that of the
                    cargo, are not compensated by general average. Whatever happens in the ordinary
                    course of wear and tear, or by a peril of the sea, as the loss of masts, sails,
                    &amp;c. in a storm, is <hi rend="italic">particular</hi> average, and falls on
                    the owners only. The ship, to borrow the admirable illustration given in the
                    civil law, is like the tool or instrument<pb break="no" facs="nls:193192591"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-2591-0252"/> of a workman in his trade. If in doing his work
                    he break his hammer, his anvil, or any other instrument, he can claim no
                    satisfaction for this from his employer. “Si conservatis mercibus deterior facta
                    sit navis, aut si quid exarmaverit, nulla facienda est collatio: quia dissimilis
                    earum rerum causa sit, quae navis gratia parentur, et earum pro quibus mercedem
                    aliquis acceperit. Nam etsi faber incudem aut malleum fregerit, non imputaretur
                    ei qui locaverit opus: sed si voluntate vectorum vel propter aliquem metum id
                    detrimentum factum sit, hoc ipsum sarciri oportet.” <hi rend="italic">(Dig.</hi>
                    lib. xiv. tit. 2.)</p>
                <p>Much doubt has been entertained whether the expenses incurred by a ship in an <hi
                    rend="italic">intermediate,</hi> port, in which she has taken refuge, should be
                    general average or fall only on the ship. But on principle, at least, it seems
                    pretty obvious, that if the retreat of the ship to the intermediate port be made
                    in order to obviate the danger of foundering, or some other great and imminent
                    calamity, the expenses incurred in entering it, and during the time she is
                    obliged by <hi rend="italic">stress of weather</hi> or adverse winds to continue
                    in it, should belong to general average. But if the retreat of the ship to port
                    be made in order to repair any injury occasioned by the unskilfulness of the
                    master, or in consequence of any defect in her outfit, such, for example, as
                    deficiencies of water, provisions, sails, &amp;c., with which she ought to have
                    been sufficiently supplied before setting out, the expenses should fall wholly
                    on the owners.</p>
                <p>When a ship, supposed to be <hi rend="italic">sea-tvorthy,</hi> is forced to take
                    refuge in an intermediate port because of a loss occasioned by a peril of the
                    sea, as the springing of a mast, &amp;c., then, as the accident is not
                    ascribable to any fault of the master or owners, and the retreat to port is
                    indispensable for the safety of the ship and cargo, it would seem that <hi
                    rend="italic">any extraordinary expense incurred in navigating the ship into
                    port</hi> ought to be made good by general average.</p>
                <p>Supposing, however, that it could be shown that the ship was not at the outset
                    sea-worthy, or in a condition to withstand the ordinary perils of the sea; that
                    the mast, for example, which has sprung, had been previously damaged; or
                    supposing that the mischief had been occasioned by the incapacity of the master;
                    the whole blame would, in such a case, be ascribable to the owners, who, besides
                    defraying every expense, should be made liable in damages to the freighters for
                    the delay that would necessarily take place in completing the voyage, and for
                    whatever injury might be done to the cargo.</p>
                <p>These, however, are merely the conclusions to which, as it appears to us, those
                    should come who look only to principle. The law with respect to most of the
                    points now stated differs in different countries, and has differed in the same
                    country at different periods. “A doubt,” says Lord Tenterden, “was formerly
                    entertained as to the expenses of a ship in a port in which she had taken refuge
                    to repair the damage occasioned by a tempest; but this has been removed by late
                    decisions,—and it has been held that the wages and provisions of the crew during
                    such a period must fall upon the ship alone. But if a ship should necessarily go
                    into an intermediate port for the purpose of repairing such a damage as is in
                    itself a proper object of general contribution, possibly the wages, &amp;c.
                    during the period of such detention, may also be held to be general average, on
                    the ground that the accessory should follow the nature of its principal.” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Law of Shipping,</hi> part iii. chap. 8.)</p>
                <p>I erhaps the reader who reflects on the vagueness of this passage will be
                    disposed to concur with Lord Tenterden’s remark in another part of the same
                    chapter, “That the determinations of the English courts of justice furnish less
                    of authority on this subject (average) than on any other branch of maritime
                    law.”</p>
                <p>Within these few years it was decided, in the case of a British ship that had
                    been obliged to put into port in con- ' sequence of an injury resulting from her
                    accidentally coming into collision with another ship, that so much of the repair
                    she then underwent as was <hi rend="italic">absolutely necessary to enable her
                    to perform her voyage,</hi> should be general average. (Plummer <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Wildman, 3 Μ. and S. 482.) The judges, however, spoke
                    rather doubtfully on the subject; and it is not very easy to discover any good
                    grounds for the judgment. According to the usual terms of the charter-party, the
                    owners bind themselves,“that the ship shall be tight, staunch, and strong, and
                    furnished with all necessaries for the intended voyage ;” and also, “that <hi
                    rend="italic">during the course of the voyage</hi> the ship shall be <hi
                    rend="italic">hept</hi> tight and staunch, and furnished with sufficient men and
                    other necessaries, to the best of the owners’ endeavours.” And these conditions
                    are no more than what the law requires of every owner who takes goods on board
                    without a charter-party. Seeing, therefore, that the owners are bound to carry
                    the cargo to its destination, they must consequently be bound, in the event of
                    the ship sustaining any accidental or natural damage during the course of the
                    voyage, either to repair that damage at their own expense, or to provide another
                    ship to forward the goods. In point of fact, too, such subsidiary ships have
                    frequently been provided; but we have yet to learn that it was ever pretended
                    that their hire was to be defrayed by a general average, though, according to
                    the principle of the decision in the case alluded to, this should be the
                    case.</p>
                <p>Practically, it is now the custom in this country, when a vessel puts into port
                    on account of damage belonging to particular average, which requires to be
                    repaired before she can safely proceed on her voyage, to allow as general
                    average the expense of entering the port and unloading; to charge the owners of
                    the goods or their underwriters with the warehouse rent and expenses attending
                    the cargo; and to throw the expense of reloading and departure on the
                    freight.</p>
                <p>According to the law of England, when a ship is injured by coming into collision
                    with or <hi rend="italic">running foul</hi> of another, if the misfortune has
                    been accidental, and no blame can be ascribed to either party, the owners of the
                    damaged ship have to bear the loss; but when blame can be fairly imputed to one
                    of the parties, it of course falls upon him to make good the loss done to the
                    other. The regulations in the <hi rend="italic">Code de Commerce</hi> (art. 407)
                    harmonize in this respect with the law of England. According to the laws of
                    Oleron and Wisby, however, and the famous French ordinance of 1681, the damage
                    occasioned by an accidental collision is to be defrayed equally by both
                    parties.</p>
                <p>The laws of different states, and the opinions of the ablest jurists, vary as to
                    whether the loss incurred in defending a ship against an enemy or pirate, and in
                    the treatment of the wounded officers and men, should be made good by general
                    average. The ordinance of the Hanse Towns (art. 35), the ordinance of 1681 (liv.
                    iii∙ tit. 7, art. 6), and the <hi rend="italic">Code de Commerce</hi> (art. 400,
                    § 6), explicitly declare that the charges on account of medicine and attendance
                    upon the officers and seamen wounded in defending the ship shall be general
                    average. A regulation of this sort seems to be founded on reason. But other
                    codes are silent on the subject; and though the contrary opinion had been
                    advanced by Mr Serjeant Marshall, and by Mr Justice Park in the earlier editions
                    of his work, the Court of Common Pleas has unanimously decided, that in England
                    neither the expense of repairing a ship injured by successfully <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> resisting and beating off an enemy, nor the cost of
                    curing the wounds incurred by the sailors in the action, nor the ammunition
                    expended <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192604" xml:id="kp-eb0704-2604-0253"/>in
                    it, was the subject of general average. (Taylor <hi rend="italic">v.</hi>
                    Curtis, 2 Marsh. 309.)</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most that can be said in favour of this decision is, that it is
                    conformable to the opinion of Emerigon (TVßité <hi rend="italic">des
                    Assurances,</hi> tome i. p. 627), who contends that an attack of pirates or
                    enemies is to be considered in the same point of view as any ordinary <hi
                    rend="italic">peril of the sea.</hi> But though Emerigon supports his opinion
                    with great learning, the principle on which it is founded appears to be
                    altogether unsound. Losses voluntarily incurred, in cutting down masts, rigging,
                    &amp;c. in order to avert a peril of the sea, are, as every one allows,
                    peculiarly proper subjects for general average; but an attack by an enemy or
                    pirate is a danger that is, in most cases, of the most imminent kind, and cannot
                    be resisted without voluntary sacrifices, involving the risk of death on the
                    part of the crew; and if such sacrifices be made, and the danger be in
                    consequence averted, it seems quite clear, even on Emerigon’s own ground, that
                    they cannot, either consistently or justly, be made particular average.</p>
                <p>The ordinance of the Hanse Towns (art. 35) declares that such seamen as are
                    maimed or disabled in defending a ship against an enemy or pirate, shall be
                    maintained at the public expense during the remainder of their lives.</p>
                <p>The ship, freight, and every thing remaining on board that can be deemed a part
                    of the cargo, must contribute to general average. Money, plate, and jewels,
                    though their <hi rend="italic">weight</hi> could not have increased the danger
                    of the ship, are not exempted; for the advantage derived from the sacrifice was
                    not in proportion to the <hi rend="italic">weight,</hi> but to the <hi
                    rend="italic">value</hi> of the things saved. But the persons on board, their
                    wearing apparel, and the jewels or ornaments belonging to these persons, do not
                    contribute. Neither are the seamen’s wages subjected to this charge; if they
                    were, they might sometimes, perhaps, be tempted to resist a sacrifice necessary
                    for the general safety.</p>
                <p>Different states have adopted different modes of valuing the articles which are
                    to contribute to an average. In this respect the law of England has varied
                    considerably at different periods. At present, however, the ship is valued at
                    the price she was worth at the port of delivery; and most foreign states follow
                    the same rule. The value or the freight is the clear sum which the ship has
                    earned, after seamen’s wages, pilotage, and all such small charges as come under
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">petty</hi> averages, are deducted. It was formerly
                    the custom in England to value the goods Jost or thrown overboard at <hi
                    rend="italic">prime cost,</hi> if the loss happened before half the voyage was
                    performed; but if after, then at the price they would have borne at the port of
                    delivery. But this distinction has been exploded, and it is now the settled
                    practice with us to estimate the goods lost, as well as those saved, at the
                    price they would have fetched at the port of delivery on the ship’s arrival
                    there, freight, duties, and other charges, being deducted. Each person s share
                    of the loss bears, of course, the same proportion to the value of his property
                    that the whole loss bears to the aggregate value of the ship, freight, and
                    cargo. The necessity of taking the goods lost into this account is obvious, for
                    otherwise their owners would be the only persons who would not be losers.</p>
                <p>when the loss of masts, cables, and other furniture of the ship is the subject of
                    general average, it is usual, as the new articles will in all ordinary cases be
                    of greater value than those that have been lost, to deduct <hi rend="italic">one
                    third</hi> &gt;om the value of the former, leaving two thirds only to be
                    contributed.</p>
                <p>But the mode of adjusting an average loss will be better understood by the
                    following example, extracted from</p>

                    a ship destined for Hull; that the ship afterwards struck upon the Goodwin,
                    which compelled the master to cut away his mast, and cast overboard part of the
                    cargo, in which operation another part was injured; and that the ship, having
                    cleared from the sands, was forced to take refuge in Ramsgate harbour, to avoid
                    the further effects of the storm.</p>

                <p>The subject of average does not necessarily make a part of the law of insurance;
                    but as insurers, from the terms of most policies, are liable to indemnify the
                    insured against those contributions which are denominated general average, its
                    consideration very frequently occurs in questions as to partial losses. But in
                    order to confine assurances to that which ought to be their only object, namely,
                    an indemnity against real and important losses arising from the perils of the
                    sea, as well as to obviate disputes respecting losses arising from the
                    perishable quality of the goods insured, and all trivial subjects of difference
                    and litigation, it seems to be the general law of all maritime states, and is
                    expressly, indeed, provided by the famous ordinance of 1681 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> (see liv. iii. tit. 6, § 47, and the elaborate
                    commentary of Μ. Valin), that the insurer shall not be liable to any claim on
                    account of average unless it exceed <hi rend="italic">one</hi> per cent. An
                    article (No. 408) to the same effect is inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Code
                    de Commerce</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, by stipulation, this limitation is
                    frequently extended in French policies to three or four per cent. A similar
                    practice, and for a similar object, was adopted in this country in 1749. It is
                    now constantly stipulated in all policies, that upon certain enumerated articles
                    of a quality peculiarly perishable, the insurer shall not be liable for any
                    partial loss whatever; that upon certain others, liable to partial injuries, but
                    less difficult to be preserved at sea, he shall only be liable for partial
                    losses above <hi rend="italic">five</hi> per cent.; and that as to all other
                    goods, and also the ship and freight, he shall only be liable for partial losses
                    above <hi rend="italic">three</hi> per cent. This stipulation is made by a
                    memorandum inserted at the bottom of all policies done at Lloyd’s, of the
                    following tenor: “N. B. Corn, fish, salt, fruit, flour, and seeds, are warranted
                    free from average, unless general, or the ship be stranded; sugar, tobacco,
                    hemp, flax, hides, and skins, are warranted free from average under five pounds
                    per cent.; and all other goods free from average under three pounds per cent.,
                    unless general, or the ship be stranded.”</p>
                <p>The form of this memorandum was universally used, as well by the Royal Exchange
                    and London Assurance Companies as by private underwriters, till 1754, when it
                    was decided that a ship having run aground was a stranded ship within the
                    meaning of the memorandum, and that although she got off again the underwriters
                    were liable to an average or partial loss upon damaged corn. This decision
                    induced the two companies to strike the words, “<hi rend="italic">or the ship be
                    stranded!</hi> out of the memorandum, so that now they consider themselves
                    liable to no losses which can happen to such commodities, except general
                    averages and total losses. The old form is still retained by the private
                    underwriters.</p>
