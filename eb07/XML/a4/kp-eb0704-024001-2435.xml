                <p><label type="entry">AVA</label>. This extensive country is situated in the
                    southeast of Asia, in the region beyond the Ganges. It Is possessed by the
                    Burmese, the limits of whose dominions, having been greatly enlarged by
                    conquest, cannot be very correctly defined. On the west, where they border with
                    the British territories in India, they are bounded by the province of Arracan,
                    surrendered to the British by the treaty concluded with the Burmese in 1826, and
                    by the petty states of Cassay or Kathé, and Assam, from which countries they are
                    separated by lofty ridges of mountains; on the south by the Indian Ocean and the
                    Siamese territories; on the north and north-east by the Chinese province of
                    Yunan; and on the east by the independent and Siamese portion of Lao. The real
                    extent of this country has not been ascertained by Europeans; and Mr Craufurd,
                    who resided as ambassador at the court of Ava, and to whom we are indebted for
                    the most recent information concerning it, states that he has nothing better to
                    offer than conjecture on this important subject. The extreme western limits he
                    describes as extending to the 93d degree of east longitude, and the eastern
                    limits to 98° 40 ’. The southern limits are in lat. 15° 45' N., and to the north
                    they probably extend to between the 26th and 27th degree. The Burmese
                    territories may therefore be estimated at an extent in breadth of about 350
                    miles, and in length of pearly 700. The area of the country is conjectured by Mr
                    Craufurd to contain 184,000 square miles. That portion of the kingdom which is
                    farthest removed from the capital is divided into provinces or viceroyalties;
                    but we have no information respecting their number or extent, or the power of
                    their several rulers. Another and a more common division is into Myos or
                    townships, of which, according to the statements of the natives, 4600 are
                    contained within the limits of the Burmese empire; but they are so much addicted
                    to exaggeration, that little reliance can be placed on this estimate. The number
                    of townships has accordingly been reduced to 163, and the villages are reckoned
                    to amount to 1300. But even this statement is founded chiefly on conjecture.</p>
                <p>That portion of Asia in which Ava is situated slopes from the central mountains
                    towards the south; and as it approaches the Indian Ocean, it subsides into an
                    extensive champaign country, which is overflowed in the rainy season by the
                    swelling of the rivers. The Burmese territory is watered by four great streams,
                    namely, the Irrawaddy; the Setang, sometimes called the Lokiang; the Saluem,
                    called also the Pegu; and the Kyen-dwen, a tributary of the Irrawaddy. The first
                    three of these rivers have their sources in the northern chain of mountains in
                    the interior, some of which are covered with perpetual snow; and they run with a
                    northerly course to the Indian Ocean. The Irrawaddy and the Saluem are the
                    largest, and they intersect the Burmese country, which they overflow during the
                    season of the rains. The delta of the Irrawaddy extends about 150 miles from the
                    sea, to 17⅜ degrees of N. lat.; and this tract of country is low and champaign,
                    intersected everywhere, during the overflow of the rivers, by canals and
                    branches from the main stream. Eastward, where the Saluem enters the ocean, in
                    the Gulf of Martaban, the country is of the same character; but it is not so
                    extensively overflowed, owing to the inferior size of the latter stream. I he
                    tract along the sea-coast is the only low-lying portion of the Burmese
                    territories. From this point the country begins to rise, and thence for about
                    300 miles farther it may be considered hilly and elevated; and beyond this it is
                    wild and mountainous. To the west and north-west it is divided from Arracan,
                    Cassay, and Assam, by mountainous ridges often of great elevation. The country
                    of Ava may therefore be distinguished into four divisions, namely, Isí, the
                    great alluvial plain at the mouth of the Irrawaddy, the Setang, and the Saluem
                    rivers; 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> the upland country, which commences about
                    150 miles from the shores; <hi rend="italic">⅛dly</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi> the external mountainous regions towards the north, where are
                    the sources of the great rivers; and, <hi rend="italic">Athly</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> the hilly regions, which form the western
                    boundaries of the valleys of the Irrawaddy and the Kyen-dwen. The tract of
                    sea-coast extends along the Indian Ocean about 240 miles, from Cape Negrais to
                    the new British settlement of Amherst, near Martaban, and at the mouth of the
                    river Saluem. All this coast is low, marshy, and broken by at least twenty
                    channels of rivers or arms of the sea; but these being exposed without
                    protection to the surf from the ocean, are choked by sandbanks, and cannot be
                    entered by any vessel of burden. Hence there are only on the coast the three
                    harbours of Martaban, Rangoon, and Bassein.</p>
                <p>The alluvial division of Ava has a rich and fruitful soil;] and the upland
                    country is also productive, though inferior] in fertility to the low-lying
                    tracts. Its productions consist <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> of rice, maize,
                    millet, wheat, various pulses, palms, the sugar-cane, tobacco, cotton, and
                    indigo. Rice is the great staple of agriculture throughout the kingdom, both in
                    the upper and the lower provinces; and in the latter maize is cultivated to a
                    considerable extent. Wheat, which would not thrive in the hot climate of the
                    lower plains, is grown in the neighbourhood of the capital, and, considering its
                    excellent quality, might be an important article of exportation. But it has long
                    been the policy of the government, in which there is little prospect of any
                    change, rigidly to prohibit the exportation of every species of grain. Bread is
                    besides not the favourite food of the people, and the cultivation of wheat is
                    consequently not encouraged. The sugar-cane appears to have been long known to
                    the Burmese; but though the climate and soil are extremely favourable, it is not
                    generally cultivated, and the art of manufacturing sugar is scarcely known. This
                    is partly owing to a tyrannical edict of the government, prohibiting the
                    exportation of this article, which might otherwise have been abundantly
                    produced, and have become a valuable article of trade. A cheap and coarse sugar
                    is obtained from the wine of the palmyra, which abounds in the upper provinces,
                    especially in the arid country, for about 200 miles south of the capital, where
                    numerous groves of this tree are to be seen. The cocoa and areca palms are not
                    common. The tea plant is cultivated in the hills by some of the mountain tribes
                    at the distance of about five days journey, and by others in still greater
                    perfection at the distance of about ten days’ journey, from Ava. The leaves are
                    elliptic, oblong, and serrated, and there is little doubt of its being the
                    genuine tea plant of China. It is singular, however, that they never infuse it
                    as they do the Chinese tea, but eat the leaf prepared with oil and garlic.
                    Cotton is grown in every part of the country and its dependencies, but chiefly
                    in the dry lands and climate of the upper provinces. Indigo is an indigenous
                    product, and is universally cultivated, but in a very rude manner; and it is
                    still more rudely manufactured, so that it is wholly unfit f° <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> exportation.</p>
                <p>In the cultivation of fruits the Burmese are careless and unskilful. The most
                    common fruits are the mango, th®</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192448" xml:id="kp-eb0704-2448-0241"/>
                <p>orange, the pine, the custard apple, the jack, the papaya fig, and the plantain.
                    Most of these fruits grow spontaneously in the congenial soil and climate of the
                    country. They are generally of indifferent quality, especially those which
                    require care in the cultivation. The durian and the mangostin are found no
                    farther north than Tavoy, in the latitude of 14 degrees. In horticulture and
                    gardening the ignorance of the Burmese is still more remarkable. Though green
                    vegetables and fruits form a great portion of their diet, they are at no pains
                    to cultivate them, but are content with gathering those which grow spontaneously
                    in the forests and marshes, such as the young shoots of the bamboo, wild
                    asparagus, the succulent stems of a variety of aquatic plants, and other shrubs
                    which would not be deemed fit for food in any other country. They are strangers
                    to all the ordinary garden vegetables, such as peas, carrots, cabbages, turnips,
                    mustard, cresses, radishes, &amp;c. Even melons, cucumbers, and the egg-plant,
                    so generally cultivated in India, are here little attended to. In the upper
                    provinces the yam and the sweet potato are cultivated, but not extensively; and
                    the common potato is unknown. Onions are produced in some of the upper
                    provinces; and capsicum, which, after salt, is the most ordinary condiment used
                    by the Burmese, is cultivated everywhere.</p>
                <p>The forests of Ava abound in the finest trees. Of these the teak holds a
                    conspicuous place, and the forests of this tree in Ava are the most extensive in
                    India. The soil in the alluvial lands within the reach of the tides is not
                    favourable to its growth, but it thrives in all the high grounds. The finest
                    teak forest is that of Sarawaddy, which furnishes nearly all that is exported to
                    other countries. Other extensive forests of teak exist in the provinces, and Ava
                    the capital is supplied from a place distant fifteen days’ journey. Almost every
                    other description of timber known in India is produced in the Burmese forests.
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> The soondry, so much esteemed in Hindostan for
                    the toughness and hardness of its wood, grows in abundance and of a large size
                    within the influence of the tides. The bamboo also grows to an extraordinary
                    size; its circumference is occasionally 23 or 24 inches. Varnish is another
                    useful product of Ava, which is used by the Shans and the Burmese in their
                    manufacture of lacquer ware. Sticklack of an excellent quality is obtained in
                    the woods.</p>
                <p>Ava is rich in minerals, producing gold, silver, copper, tin, lead, antimony,
                    amber, coal, petroleum, nitre, natron, salt, limestone, and marble, noble
                    serpentine or green stone, and precious stones. Gold, carried down from the
                    higher grounds by the mountain streams, is found in the sands of different
                    rivers: it is also found near the town of Pegu, and more abundantly in Lao. It
                    is not plentiful, however, in the Burmese territories, and is imported from
                    China. Silver mines are wrought in the country of Lao, towards the Chinese
                    frontier, at a place called Bor-twang, about twelve days’journey from B’hamo,
                    which is 250 miles north by east from A va. Those mines are let at a rent of
                    L.4800 per annum, to the Chinese, who among their semibarbarous neighbours the
                    Tonquinese, Siamese, Malays, and Burmans, generally engross every branch of
                    industry which requires either ingenuity or capital. The mountainous districts
                    of Lao in the east contain all the other <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> netals,
                    but such is the rude state of the people, that they <hi rend="superscript">
                    r</hi> &gt;θglect those natural advantages; and it is doubtful whet er the
                    copper, tin, and lead ores which are seen in the market of Ava are produced in
                    the Burmese territories, °r are imported from China. Iron is found abundantly in
                    t e eastern country of Lao, and it is wrought, though with little advantage.
                    Owing to ignorance and the want of proper machinery, about 30 or 40 per cent, of
                    the metal' is lost in the process of forging. The province of Martaban, and the
                    mountains near the capital, contain lime in great abundance and of remarkable
                    whiteness; and statuary marble, equal to the best Italian specimens, is found
                    about 40 miles from Ava, on the eastern bank of the Irrawaddy. Mines of amber
                    are wrought, and their produce must be abundant, judging from the price of this
                    article, which at Ava does not exceed four shillings per pound. Nitre, natron,
                    and salt, are found in the neighbourhood of the capital, and in the upper
                    provinces; also traces of coal, and there is little doubt that this mineral is
                    extensively diffused. It has not, however, been extracted from the earth by the
                    ignorant and lazy inhabitants, who are content to use in its stead wood, which
                    is scarce and dear. Petroleum, which is used by all ranks among the Burmese for
                    burning in lamps, and also for smearing wood as a preservative against insects,
                    is found near the village of Re-nan-gyaong, on the banks of the Irrawaddy. Here
                    are about eight or ten pits or wells, the general depth of which is from 210 to
                    240 feet; some of them are deeper, and one is sunk to the depth of 300 feet. The
                    shaft is of a square form, about three feet in diameter, and is formed by
                    sinking a wooden frame. The liquid appears to boil up from the bottom like an
                    abundant spring, and is extracted in buckets, and sent to all quarters of the
                    country. In those parts where its price is raised by a long land-carriage until
                    it comes into competition with Sesamum oil, the latter is preferred. This useful
                    article is sold at the wells at from 5d. to 7d. per cwt., not above the 100th
                    part of the price of whale oil, the cheapest article of the kind which can be
                    procured in this country: at a greater distance its price rises to 3s.4d.and
                    4s.4d.per cwt., which is still a remarkably low price for the quantity of light
                    which would be afforded by a hundredweight of this oil. The produce of these
                    springs pays a tax of one twentieth; the annual amount of this tax, according to
                    the collector or farmer, is 25,000 ticals, or L.2500 per annum. He calculates
                    that he loses L.800 annually by smuggling, which would make the total produce of
                    the tax L.3300 per annum, and the annual value of the whole produce of the wells
                    L.66,000. Captain Cox was informed that there were 180 wells at one place, and
                    at 4 or 5 miles distance 340 more. These wells belong to the owners of the soil:
                    they are highly valued, yielding a sure rent, and are handed down from father to
                    son as a valuable property. The expense of sinking a well is estimated by Cox at
                    2500 rupees, and the annual produce at the half of that sum. <hi

                <p>The precious stones which are produced in the Burmese territories are chiefly of
                    the sapphire species and the spinelle ruby. They are found at two places, about
                    five days’ journey in a south-east direction from the capital, in the beds of
                    rivulets or small brooks, from which they are separated by washing. The
                    varieties of these stones are the oriental sapphire, the oriental ruby, the
                    opalescent ruby, the star ruby, the green, the yellow, and the white sapphires,
                    and the oriental amethyst. The common sapphire is by far the most frequently
                    found. The crown, as in all despotic countries, lays claim to the produce of
                    these rivers; and all the stones that exceed the value of L.]0 are accordingly
                    sent to the treasury. No stranger, not even Chinese or Mahommedan, is ever
                    permitted to approach the spots where these precious stones are found. Noble
                    serpentine or green stone is found in these mountains, and is exported in
                    considerable quantities to China, where it is used for rings and amulets.</p>

                <p>The country of the Burmese, abounding in deserts and forests, affords extensive
                    shelter to the wild animals. The elephant, and the rhinoceros with a single
                    horn, are found in all the deep forests of the country, and especially in Pegu.
                    The royal tiger, the spotted leopard, and several species of wild cats, also the
                    civet cat, are numerous in all the southern provinces. The hog is found in the
                    wild parts of the country, and several species of deer, such as the Indian roe
                    and the stag. Oxen and buffaloes are natives of the Burman forests; but no
                    species of antelope is seen, and none of the canine tribe. There are, it is
                    said, neither wolves, jackals, foxes, nor hyenas, in any of the tropical
                    countries east of Bengal. The horse is known in the high lands, but not in the
                    lower country of Pegu.</p>
                <p>Of birds, the wild cock is common, and is seen in coveys in all the forests of
                    the country. Two species of pheasants not known to the naturalists of Europe are
                    numerous in Pegu; they are of a small size, and inferior in beauty of plumage to
                    the pheasants of China and Nepaul. There are peacocks, partridges, and quails,
                    and in marshy places snipes; also geese and ducks in the upper provinces, and
                    ducks in the alluvial plains.</p>
                <p>The domestic animals of the Burmese are the ox, the buffalo, the horse, and the
                    elephant. The oxen are used in the upper country, and the buffaloes in the low
                    lands. They are of a good description, and, ranging in the luxuriant pastures of
                    the plains, they commonly appear in high order. The care of these animals is all
                    that is attended to in the rural economy of the Burmese. The buffalo is confined
                    to agricultural labour, and the ox alone is used as a beast of burden or of
                    draught. The Burman horses are rarely more than thirteen hands high; the
                    full-sized horse being unknown in the tropical countries of Asia east of Bengal.
                    Horses are never used but for riding, and only in the upper country, there being
                    no footing for a horse in the alluvial districts. The elephant is not used by
                    the Burmese, except perhaps in the eastern country of Lao, as a domestic animal.
                    He is not employed as a beast of burden, and seems to be maintained merely for
                    royal luxury and ostentation. About 1000 elephants are kept for the pleasure of
                    the king, some of them of fine quality, and of a white colour. The hog is a
                    domestic animal, but of the most filthy and disgusting habits. The dog, as in
                    most other parts of the East, is neglected, and is seen prowling about the
                    streets a prey to disease and famine. Cats are numerous; and about the capital a
                    few goats and sheep, of a puny race, are kept more for curiosity than for use. A
                    few asses are also seen, which are brought from China. The camel is not known
                    even in the upper country, where he would be found extremely useful.—Of poultry
                    only a few common fowls and ducks are reared, for the purpose of being, it is
                    said, clandestinely sold to the Chinese, and to Christian and Mahommedan
                    settlers.</p>
                <p>The extensive country which has been conquered by the Burmese contains many
                    distinct tribes and nations, who, though they differ in language, and often in
                    manners, customs, and religion, appear, from their resemblance in features and
                    form, to be the same race with the inhabitants of the countries that he between
                    Hindostan and China. The most considerable of these tribes are the proper
                    Burmans, the Peguans or Talains, the Shans or people of Lao, the Cassay or
                    Kathé, the Zubaing, the Karens, the Kyens, the Yo, and the Laira. They may be
                    generally described as of a stout, short, active, but well-proportioned form; of
                    a brown but never of an intensely black complexion, with black, coarse, lank,
                    and abundant hair, and a little more beard than is possessed by the same races
                    to the south, namely, the Siamese and the people of Lao. Nor does the climate
                    appear sensibly to affect their physical appearance; the inhabitants of the low
                    and marshy plains being rather of a larger make, and more athletic, than those
                    who dwell in the upper country. The population of the country has been variously
                    estimated and grossly exaggerated by the ignorance of Europeans, who have raised
                    it to 17,000,000, 19,000,000, and even 33,000,000. There is no enumeration of
                    the inhabitants in any part. Mr Crau∙ furd, on the best data that he could
                    procure, estimates them at 2,414,000, which is probably above rather than under
                    the truth.</p>
                <p>The Burmans appear to be inferior to the Hindoos, and still more to the Chinese,
                    in arts, manufactures, and industry, and in all the institutions of civil life.
                    Their government is a pure despotism, the king dispensing torture, imprisonment,
                    or death, according to his sovereign discretion. One of his customary titles is
                    lord of the life and property of all his subjects; and they frequently find to
                    their cost that this is no vain title. The chief object of government seems to
                    be the personal honour and aggrandizement of the monarch; and the only restraint
                    on the exercise of his prerogative is the fear of an insurrection. He is
                    assisted in his administration by a public and a privy council, through which
                    all orders are issued, and by a majority of whom all public matters are decided.
                    Every royal edict must be sanctioned by this council; and each member is a
                    judge, and, besides, exercises an appellate jurisdiction in the last resort. All
                    questions, before they are submitted to the public advisers of his majesty, are
                    debated in the privy council, which consists of four officers, and to which are
                    attached four deputies, thirty secretaries, and five other officers, who carry
                    messages, and report from time to time the proceedings of the council to the
                    king, and who are in reality privileged spies. The paymaster-general is an
                    officer of high importance; and there are other officers of distinction, such as
                    the daywoon or king’s armour-bearer, and the master of the elephants, though
                    they bear no share in the administration of public affairs.<note anchored="true"

                    officers to be punished at his pleasure; and Mr Craufurd mentions, that, during
                    his residence at Ava, the favourite minister, on a complaint from seme of the
                    women of the court, was, by an order from the king, seized by the public
                    executioner, and laid at the side of the road for two hours under the burning
                    sun, with a weight upon his breast; and, after undergoing this disgraceful
                    punishment, he continued to discharge his high functions as before. The country
                    at large is ruled by provincial governors; and it is divided into provinces,
                    townships, districts, villages, and hamlets. The governor is vested with the
                    civil, military, judicial, and fiscal administration of the province. He is
                    assisted by a deputy, who is a judge, and exercises the power of life and death,
                    though in all civil cases an appeal lies from his sentence to the chief council
                    at the capital; and also by a collector of taxes, and another of customs. In all
                    these courts there is an officer who acts as a kind of sheriff or principal
                    conservator of the peace, another officer who acts as public informer, and a
                    third as assessor to the chief judge. To each court is attached a proper
                    complement of messengers; and the executioner is always present, along (as Mr
                    Craufurd. adds) with his “band of branded ruffians.” There are in all the
                    townships and villages judges with a subordinate jurisdiction. The three towns
                    composing the ca-nital<pb break="no" facs="nls:193192474"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-2474-0243"/> have each a governor, and they are assisted by a
                    sort ' of head constables, who are known to all strangers “as the busy, corrupt,
                    and mischievous agents of the local authorities.” But from a mere dry detail of
                    the provincial administration and judicial. institutions of the Burmese, their
                    extreme inefficiency can scarcely be known. No Burmese officer ever receives a
                    fixed salary. He is paid by an assignment either of land or of the labour and
                    industry of a given portion of the inhabitants, and the inferior magistrates by
                    fees, perquisites, and other emoluments; and hence the most shameful extortion
                    and bribery prevails amongst all the functionaries of the Burmese government,
                    from the highest to the lowest. Justice is openly set to sale; and the exercise
                    of the judicial functions is found to be so lucrative, that the two executive
                    councils have by their encroachments deprived the regular judge of the greater
                    part of his employment. So notoriously corrupt are all the judges among the
                    Burmese, that a lawsuit is considered by all prudent men as a serious
                    calamity.</p>
                <p>The criminal code of the Burmese is barbarous and severe, and the punishments
                    inflicted are shocking to humanity. Gang robbery, desertion from the king’s
                    service, robbing of temples, and sedition or treason, are considered the most
                    heinous crimes, and are most severely punished, die criminal being in some cases
                    embowelled, or thrown to wild beasts. In these cases they generally meet death
                    with Asiatic indifference; and it is related of one woman who was adjudged to
                    the latter punishment, that she deliberately crept into the cage of the tiger,
                    and making an obeisance to the animal, was immediately killed by a single blow
                    of his fore-paw, and dragged into the inner recesses of his den. For lesser
                    offences, fines, whipping, and imprisonment are the punishments adjudged. In
                    important cases torture is applied both to the principals and witnesses; and the
                    jailers often torture their prisoners in order to extort money from them. The
                    English and Americans who, during the late war, were thrown into prison, were
                    frequently tortured, and were compelled to pay fines to the jailer in order to
                    procure milder treatment. The trial by ordeal is sometimes resorted to, as well
                    as other superstitious modes of procedure, which denote the lowest state of
                    barbarism. But the administration of justice among the Burmese, however
                    vexatious and expensive, is far from efficient; and the police is as bad as can
                    possibly be conceived. Hence the country is overrun with pirates and robbers,
                    and a general laxity, negligence, and corruption, pervade every branch of the
                    internal administration.</p>
                <p>Among the Burmese, society is distinguished into seven classes, who have each
                    peculiar privileges. These are the royal family, the public officers, the
                    priesthood, the rich men, the cultivators and labourers, slaves and outcasts.
                    There are no hereditary honours under the Burmese government, as all the public
                    functionaries may be dismissed from their offices, and deprived of their rank,
                    at the caprice of the sovereign. Any subject, with, the exception of a slave or
                    outcast, may, however, aspire to the nrst offices in the state, to which, in
                    reality, persons of <hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> θry mean origin do frequently
                    attain. The Burmese are extremely punctilious and strict in maintaining the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> v</hi> &lt;tfιθus orders and distinctions of society. The
                    great officers of government hold the first rank after the king and the princes
                    of the blood, and they are distinguished + <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> ∏ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> la</hi> i <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> or badge, which is
                    the order of nobility, and or which there are different degrees, distinguished
                    by the number of strings or small chains which compose the ornament. Three of
                    open chain-work mark the lowest rank; t ree of neatly-twisted wire the next;
                    there are then six, nine, twelve, and finally twenty-four, which the king alone
                    is entitled to wear. But every article possessed by a Burman for use or
                    ornament,—his ear-rings, cap of ceremony, horse furniture,—the metal of his
                    spitting cup or drinking cup, if it be of gold or any other metal,—the colour
                    and quality of his umbrella, an article in general use,and one of the principal
                    insignia of rank, whether it be of brown varnished paper, red, green, gilded, or
                    plain white, the royal colour,—all indicate the rank of the person; and if any
                    of the lower orders usurp the insignia of a higher class, he may be slain with
                    impunity by the first person who meets him; and so prevalent is the
                    aristocratical spirit of the higher orders, that such an usurption would be sure
                    to meet punishment.</p>
                <p>When a merchant acquires property, he is registered by a royal edict under the
                    name Thuthé, or “rich man,” which gives him a title to the protection of the
                    court, while it exposes him also to regular extortion. The priesthood form a
                    separate order, who are interdicted from all other employment, and are supported
                    by voluntary contributions. They are distinguished by the yellow colours in
                    their dress, which it would be reckoned sacrilege in any other person to wear;
                    and a formal complaint was made, during the conferences with the British
                    previous to peace, because some of their camp followers were seen dressed in
                    yellow clothes. There is also an order of nuns or priestesses, who make a vow of
                    chastity, but may at any time quit their order. The free labouring population
                    consist of proprietors or common labourers; and they are all considered the
                    slaves of the king, who may at all times call for their services as soldiers,
                    artisans, or common labourers. Hence a Burman, being the property of the king,
                    can never quit the country without his especial permission, which is only
                    granted for a limited time, and never to women on any pretence. The British and
                    others who had children by Burmese women while they resided in the country
                    experienced the greatest difficulty, even with the aid of heavy douceurs, in
                    taking them along with them. There are two classes of slaves; namely, those who
                    have mortgaged their services for a debt, and who are used as slaves until the
                    debt is paid; and prisoners of war, who are always reduced to slavery. The class
                    of outcasts consists of the slaves of the pagodas, the burners of the dead, the
                    jailers and executioners, who are generally condemned criminals, lepers and
                    other incurables, who are held in great abhorrence, and treated with singular
                    caprice and cruelty. They are condemned to dwell alone, and in a state of
                    disgrace; and any man who is infected with this disease, however high his rank,
                    is forced, by continual bribes to the officers of justice, to purchase an
                    exemption from the penalties which attach to him. Prostitutes are also
                    considered as outcasts, but not women of loose character, chastity not being in
                    any repute among the Burmans. The women in Ava are not shut up as in many other
                    parts of the East, and excluded from the sight of men: on the contrary, they are
                    suffered to appear openly in society as in Europe. In many other respects,
                    however, they are exposed to the most degrading treatment. They are sold for a
                    time to strangers; and the practice is not considered shameful, nor the female
                    in any respect dishonoured. They are seldom unfaithful to their new master; and
                    many of them have proved essentially useful to strangers in the Burmese
                    dominions, being generally of industrious and domestic habits, and not addicted
                    to vice.</p>
                <p>The taxes from which the public revenue arises are in general rude and
                    ill-contrived expedients for extortion, and are vexatious to the people at the
                    same time that they are not productive to the state. One of the most common is a
                    house-tax on the cultivation of the soil. Nearly all the cultivated land of the
                    kingdom is assign <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192487"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-2487-0244"/>ed to favourites of the court or to public
                    functionaries in lieu of stipends or salaries, or is appropriated to the
                    expenses of public establishments, such as war-boats, elephants, &amp;c.; and
                    this assignment conveys a right to tax the inhabitants according to the
                    discretion of the assignce. The court favourites who receive these grants
                    generally appoint agents to manage this estate; they pay a certain tax or
                    quit-rent to the crown, and their agents extort from the cultivators as much
                    more as they can by every mode of oppression, often by torture. Besides this
                    stated tax, extraordinary contributions are levied by the council of the state
                    immediately from the lords and nobles to whom the lands are assigned, who in
                    their turn levy it from the cultivators, and generally make it a pretence for
                    plunder and extortion. It is the Burmans and Talains, the most improved class of
                    the population, who pay this tax. They may, besides, be called on to labour in
                    the public works. The Karyens, a ruder class, who cultivate the lands, are
                    subjected to a regular capitation, and are in consequence exempted from the
                    occasional <hi rend="italic">corvées</hi> to which the others are exposed. Taxes
                    arc also laid on fruit trees, on the teak forests, on the petroleum springs, on
                    mines of gold and precious stones, on the fishery of ponds, lakes, rivers, and
                    salt-water creeks, on the manufacture of salt, on the eggs of the green turtle,
                    and on esculent swallows’ nests. The custom duties amount on all imports to 10
                    per cent., and on exports to 5, besides 2 per cent, on the former and 1 per
                    cent, on the latter to the local officers. European and other square-rigged
                    vessels are, besides, subjected to a long list of heavy and vexatious charges;
                    and until within a few years they were obliged to unship their rudders, and to
                    land their guns. These oppressions were done away by the treaty concluded
                    between the British and Burmese in 1826. There are no transit duties, nor any
                    duties at fairs or markets; and as the consumption of wines, spirits, opium, and
                    other intoxicating drugs, is forbidden by law, they cannot of course be subject
                    to any tax.</p>
                <p>In the useful arts the Burmese have not made any great advances. The whole
                    process of the cotton manufacture is performed by women, who use a very rude
                    species of loom, and are much inferior in dexterity to the Indian artisans. No
                    fine linen is ever manufactured at home; and the home manufacturer, even in the
                    interior of the country, cannot withstand the competition of British cotton
                    goods. Silk cloths are manufactured at different places; the finest at Ava or
                    Amarapura, from raw Chinese silk, and the coarsest at She-daong, from the raw
                    material of Pegu. The Burman manufactures of silk are generally coarse,
                    high-priced, and durable. The common coarse unglazed earthenware, which is
                    manufactured in Ava, is of an excellent quality; and a better description of
                    pottery is also made. They are entirely ignorant of the art of making porcelain,
                    which is imported from China. Iron ore, as already mentioned, is smelted; but
                    the Burmans cannot manufacture steel, which is brought from Bengal. Coarse
                    articles of cutlery, including swords, spears, knives, also muskets and
                    matchlocks, scissors, and carpenters’ tools, are manufactured at Ava. Brass wire
                    is manufactured at Sagaing, the copper being procured from China, and the zinc
                    from Lao. Gold and silver ornaments are manufactured in every considerable place
                    in the country, but in a decidedly rude and clumsy manner. About forty miles
                    from Ava, on the eastern bank of the Irrawaddy, is an entire hill of pure white
                    marble. Here are sculptured marble images of Gautama or Buddha. The marble is of
                    the finest quality; but the workmanship is rude, and displays neither taste nor
                    fancy. Considering the fertility of the country, and its natural advantages, the
                    commerce of Ava is not extensive. It has of late years, however, and especially
                    since the relaxation of the East India Company’s monopoly in 1814, considerably
                    increased. The internal trade of the country centres chiefly in Ava, the
                    capital, and the sea-ports of Rangoon, Tongo, and Bassein. The traders in those
                    parts, and in the lower parts of Pegu, generally bring to the capital and upper
                    provinces rice, pickled and dried fish, and foreign commodities imported from
                    Bengal, the Asiatic Archipelago, and Europe. They receive in exchange petroleum,
                    which, as already mentioned, is a great article of internal consumption;
                    saltpetre, lime, paper, lacquer ware, cotton and silk fabrics, iron, cutlery,
                    some brass ware, terra japonica, palm, sugar, onions, tamarinds, &amp;c. &amp;c.
                    The Shans or people of Lao, from the east, import into Ava cotton and silk
                    stuffs, some raw silk, varnish, stick-lack, ivory, bees-wax, lacquer ware,
                    swords, gold, lead, and tin. They receive in return the articles of the lower
                    country, which are chiefly salt, with pickled and dried fish. One of the most
                    important branches of the trade of Ava is that carried on with the Chinese
                    province of Yunan. The principal marts of this trade are Midé, six miles to the
                    , north-east of Ava; and B’hamo, the chief place of a province of the same name,
                    bordering on China. It is carried on at annual fairs. The Chinese caravan,
                    setting out from the western province of Yunan at the close of the periodical
                    rains, generally arrives at Ava in the beginning of December, after a journey of
                    six weeks over difficult and mountainous roads, on which only horses, mules, and
                    asses can travel. No part of the journey is by water; from which it would appear
                    that the upper streams of the Irrawaddy, near to the Chinese frontier, are not
                    navigable. The principal fair is, however, held at B’hamo, comparatively few
                    traders arriving at Ava. The articles imported from China are wrought copper;
                    orpiment or yellow arsenic from the mines in Yunan, of a very fine quality,
                    which finds its way into western Asia, and into Europe through Calcutta;
                    quicksilver, vermilion, iron pans, brass wire, tin, lead, alum, silver, gold and
                    gold-leaf; earthenware, paints, carpets, rhubarb, tea, honey, raw silk, velvets
                    and other wrought silks; spirits, musk, verdigris, dry fruits, paper, fans,
                    umbrellas, shoes, wearing apparel, and a few live animals, such as dogs,
                    pheasants, and ducks. The metals are chiefly produced in the province of Yunan,
                    which, though poor, is rich in minerals. The tea, which is coarse and black, is
                    supposed to be from the same province, and is retailed at the rate of 6Įd. a
                    pound, though the price paid to the Chinese importer is not half that sum. The
                    annual value of the raw silk, which is the chief article of import, is L.80,000
                    sterling. The articles sent to China consist of raw cotton to the amount of
                    twenty millions of pounds yearly, and by far the most considerable article of
                    export; feathers, chiefly of the blue jay, for ornamenting the dresses of
                    ceremony oł the Chinese mandarins, and which are so much valued that the bird is
                    pursued by the Burmese hunters as far as the province of Cuttack in India;
                    esculent swallows’nests, ivory, rhinoceros and deers’ horns; sapphires, used for
                    buttons to the caps of the Chinese officers of rank, and noble serpentine, with
                    a small quantity of British woollens. The annual value of this trade is
                    estimated to be from L.400,000 to L.700,000 sterling.</p>
                <p>The foreign trade of Ava, carried on chiefly through the central part of Rangoon,
                    is with Chittagong, Dacca, and Calcutta, in Bengal; Madras and Masulipatam on
                    the Coromandel coast; the Nicoar islands and Penang; also occasionally with
                    Bombay, and with the Persian and Arabian Gulf. The articles exported are teak
                    wood, chieflξ to Calcutta; terra japonica, stick-lack,bees-wax, elephants teeth;
                    raw cotton of a fine quality, from Ava to Dacca; gold and silver, especially
                    from Bassein, and by the over <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192500"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-2500-0245"/>land route of Arracan, to the annual value of
                    L.65,000. The principal imports are cotton piece goods, formerly furnished to
                    the Burmese, who have no cotton manufactures, from the Coromandel coast. To
                    these were afterwards added the cheaper fabrics of Bengal, and both are now in a
                    great measure superseded by the British manufactures. The other imports are
                    British woollens, iron, steel, quicksilver, copper, cordage, borax, sulphur,
                    gunpowder, saltpetre, fire-arms, coarse porcelain, English glass-ware, opium,
                    tobacco, cocoa and areca nuts, sugar, and spirits. Neither the areca nor the
                    cocoa palms flourish in the Burmese territory; and their produce being in
                    general use, is largely imported. The internal trade in the low country, where
                    there are scarcely any roads, is carried on mostly by the rivers and canals; and
                    the Irrawaddy is navigated by vessels of 100 tons burden. In the upper country
                    goods are mostly conveyed in carts drawn by oxen or small horses; and the
                    merchants, as in other parts of Asia, travel in caravans for security.</p>
                <p>The progress and civilization of a country may be generally very accurately
                    measured by the state of its currency; and that used by the Burmese is of the
                    rudest description. For the smaller payments lead is employed; and for the
                    larger payments gold or silver, but principally the latter. These are not coined
                    into pieces of any known weight and fineness; and in every payment of any
                    consequence the metal must be weighed and generally assayed, for which a premium
                    is paid to the bankers or money-changers, of 2’- per cent., besides one per
                    cent, which they say is lost in the operation. These bankers are said by Symes
                    to be workers in silver, and every merchant has one with whom he lodges his
                    cash, and who receives on this account a commission of one per cent. The want of
                    a more convenient currency must tend greatly to embarrass the operations of
                    trade. The high interest received for money, which is 25 and 60 per cent, when
                    no security is given, is another proof of the low state of commerce among the
                    Burmese.</p>
                <p>The Burmese, as may be supposed, are entirely ignorant of literature and science.
                    Their astronomy and astrology they have borrowed from the Hindoos, and the
                    Brahmins have still the exclusive care of such matters. According to their
                    calendar, a common year consists of 12 months, of 29 and 30 days alternately;
                    the year consequently is of 354 days; and, in order to preserve the solar time,
                    the fourth month of every year is doubled, and the additional days and hours are
                    supplied by the royal edicts as they are required. The natural day is divided
                    into 60 parts, called Nari; and time is measured by means of a copper cup
                    perforated at the bottom, and placed in a vase of water. This cup sinks to a
                    particular mark at the termination of each part, when a great bell is struck,
                    which is suspended from a tall belfry close to the palace. The Burmese are
                    entirely ignorant of navigation, and in their voyages to Calcutta during the
                    fine season, they creep along the coast, never losing sight of it. They are
                    equally Ignorant of geography and of all the kindred sciences, and, m lieu of
                    useful knowledge, they cultivate the vain art of alchemy, labouring with intense
                    anxiety to convert the baser metals into gold. Morality, as in most
                    semi-barbarous states, is at a low ebb among them; and their rulers, according
                    to the depositions of several Europeans, British and others, taken before Mr
                    Craufurd at Rangoon, have no conception of the moral excellence or utility of
                    good aith. “They would,” says the Rev. Mr Judson, the respectable American
                    missionary, “consider it nothing less tian folly t <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>
                    keep a treaty if they could gain any thing by reaking it. The fidelity observed
                    by the British government in fulfilling the stipulations of the late treaty
                    stupi-ed the Burmans. They knew not what to make of it, but some of them have
                    now begun to admire it. I heard many make use of expressions like the following:
                    <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> These Kulas (English), though they drink spirits
                    and slay cattle, and are ambitious and rapacious, have a regard for truth and
                    their word which is quite extraordinary, whereas in us Burmese there is no
                    truth.’ The first circumstance in the conduct of the British which struck them
                    with surprise, was the return of Dr Sandford on his parole; and next, Sir A.
                    Campbell’s returning six lacs of rupees offered him after the money was in his
                    power.”</p>
                <p>The Burmese army is recruited from the whole male population of the country, who
                    are at the absolute dispo-- sal of the king, for war or any other purpose; but
                    there is no fixed plan for calling out this conscription, nor any limited period
                    of service; and the inhabitants are far from being of a warlike character. The
                    conscripts, when brought together, are a mere rabble, without discipline or
                    valour. They are always dragged unwillingly into the service, and when an
                    expedition was sent against Junkseylon and the Siamese, they were seen by
                    Europeans, who stated the fact to Mr Craufurd, embarked by hundreds with their
                    hands and legs tied, as if they had been so many cattle. They were unable to
                    withstand the attack of the European force, even though protected by stoccades;
                    and they were completely dismayed by the resolution with which those new enemies
                    advanced to close quarters, and by the destructive effects of their artillery,
                    rockets, &amp;c. From their success against all the neighbouring tribes with
                    whom they had been engaged, they embarked in a war with the British in the vain
                    confidence of an easy triumph; but the entire destruction of a corps of 1000 men
                    at Rangoon, the subsequent assault of the Burman lines, and the retreat of the
                    army to Donabew, entirely dissipated these hopes, and overwhelmed both the court
                    and the people with astonishment and dismay. From the composition of the Burmese
                    force, it cannot long be maintained in the field, and is sure to be entirely
                    dispersed by a defeat; and accordingly, when the British army had advanced to
                    within 45 miles of the capital, it was scarcely possible to collect 1000 men for
                    its defence. The Burmese are very indifferently armed, with clumsy two-handed
                    swords, spears, matchlocks, as many old European muskets as they can purchase,
                    rude padereros of native manufacture, and a few old iron and brass cannon,
                    purchased from strangers, and in no good condition; but they excel in the
                    construction of field works, which they raise on the best positions, and with
                    surprising celerity. Since the conquest of Cassay or Munnipore the Burmese have
                    maintained a body of cavalry, chiefly composed of the Cassay horsemen, who act
                    as a body-guard to the king. They are provided with a spear about seven or eight
                    feet long, which they manage with great dexterity. The peace establishment of
                    the sovereign of Ava is very limited; and Symes mentions that he could never
                    observe any assemblage of more than 2000 troops in the capital.</p>
                <p>The Burmese are not votaries of Brahma, but sectaries! of Boodh, who is
                    universally considered by the Hindoos as the ninth Avatar, or descent of the
                    Deity in his capacity of preserver; and the rites, doctrines, and priesthood are
                    nearly the same as in the countries to the east of the Ganges, namely, Siam,
                    Camboja, and in Ceylon, and formerly in the Asiatic islands. Neither
                    Christianity nor Mahommedanism has made any progress. Foreigners enjoy the most
                    perfect religious toleration, and there is no hostility either to Europeans or
                    to Christians, as in Mahommedan countries; but the Burmese rulers view any
                    attempt to convert the natives to the Christian or any other foreign faith as an
                    interference with their allegiance, and they discourage all such schemes. An
                    American mission was settled <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192513"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-2513-0246"/>there under the conduct of Mr Judson, who brought
                    to the execution of this perilous service zeal and sound discretion; but it
                    entirely failed of success, not from any bigotry on the part of the natives, but
                    from the opposition of men in power. On the war breaking out with the British
                    the missionaries were imprisoned, and narrowly escaped with their lives. They
                    are now prosecuting their missionary labours in the British province of
                    Martaban.</p>
                <p>The ancient history of Ava is very imperfectly known, and the sketch compiled by
                    Mr Craufurd, from oral tradition, and from written documents which he procured
                    during his residence in the country, consists chiefly of dynastics and kings, of
                    which little more is given than the names. We learn from the Portuguese
                    navigators, that, about the middle of the 16th century, four powerful states
                    ruled over those countries which lie between the south-east province of British
                    India, Yunan in China, and the Eastern Sea, namely, Arracan, Ava, Pegu, and
                    Siam. By the help of the Portuguese the Burmans subdued the Peguers, and
                    maintained their supremacy over them throughout the 17th and during the first 40
                    years of the 18th century, when the Peguers revolted, and a war ensued, in the
                    course of which, by the aid of arms procured from Europeans, they gained several
                    victories over the Burmans, and having taken their capital Ava, and made the
                    king prisoner, they reduced the whole country to submission. Alompra, a man of
                    low extraction, who had been left by the conqueror in charge of Monchaboo, an
                    inconsiderable village, planned the deliverance of his country. He attacked the
                    foreigners at first with small detachments; but when his forces increased, he
                    suddenly advanced, and took possession of the capital in the autumn of 1753. In
                    1754 the Peguers, anxious to recover their lost conquests, sent an armament of
                    war-boats against Ava; but after an obstinate and bloody battle they were
                    totally defeated by Alompra. In the districts of Prome, Donabew, Loonzay,
                    &amp;c. the Burmans revolted, and succeeded either in expelling or putting to
                    the sword all the Pegu garrisons in their towns. In 1754 Prome was besieged by
                    the king of Pegu, when he was again defeated by Alompra in a severe battle, and
                    the war was transferred from the upper provinces to the mouths of the navigable
                    rivers, and the numerous creeks and canals which intersect the lower country. In
                    1755 Alompra defeated in a general battle Apporaza the king of Pegu’s brother,
                    after which the Peguers were driven from Bassein and the adjacent country, and
                    were forced to withdraw to the fortress of Syriam. About the year 1754 Alompra,
                    having subdued the Cassayers, who had revolted, laid siege to this fortress,
                    which was taken by surprise, when the garrison were mostly put to the sword, and
                    the Europeans were made prisoners. In these wars the French sided with the
                    Peguers, the English with the Burmans. Monsieur Dupleix, the governor of
                    Pondicherry, had sent two ships to the aid of the former; but the master of the
                    first was decoyed up the river by Alompra, when his vessel was taken, and he
                    along with his whole crew was massacred. The other escaped by being accidentally
                    delayed, and carried accounts of this disaster to Pondicherry. Alompra was now
                    master of all the navigable rivers; and the Peguers, being entirely shut out
                    from foreign aid, were finally subdued. In 1755 the conqueror laid siege to the
                    city of Pegu, which finally capitulated, on condition that the king should
                    govern the country, but that he should do homage for his kingdom, and should
                    also surrender his aughter to the victorious monarch. Alompra, with Asiatic
                    perfidy, violated these conditions, and at last succeeded by treachery in
                    obtaining possession of the town, which he abandoned to the fury of his
                    soldiers. In 1757 the Peguers endeavoured to throw off the yoke, but they were
                    overthrown in a decisive engagement near Rangoon; and Alompra arriving soon
                    after, quelled the rebellion. He afterwards reduced the town and district of
                    Tavoy, and finally undertook the conquest of the Siamese. His army advanced to
                    Mergui and Tennasscrim, both which towns were taken; and he was besieging the
                    capital of Siam when he was taken ill. He immediately ordered his army to
                    retreat, in hopes of reaching his capital alive; but he expired before this, in
                    1760, in the 50th year of his age, after he had reigned eight years. He was
                    succeeded by his oldest son Namdojee Praw, whose reign was disturbed by the
                    rebellion of his brother Shembuan, and afterwards by one of his father’s
                    generals. By his vigour he succeeded in quelling these revolts; and he
                    afterwards turned his arms against the refractory Peguers, who were reduced to
                    subjection. He died in little more than three years, leaving one son in bis
                    infancy. On his decease the throne was usurped by his brother Shembuan, who
                    never acknowledged the rightful heir. He was intent, like his predecessors, on
                    the conquest of the adjacent states; and he accordingly made war in 1765 on the
                    Munnipore Cassayers, and also on the Siamese, with partial success. In the
                    following year he renewed the war with the latter, defeated the Siamese, and,
                    after a long blockade, obtained possession of their capital. But while the
                    Burmans were extending their conquests in this quarter, they were invaded by a
                    Chinese army of 50,000 men from the province of Yunan. This army was hemmed in
                    by the skill of the Burmans; and being harassed by the want of provisions, it
                    was afterwards attacked and totally destroyed, with the exception of 2500 men,
                    who were sent in fetters to work in the Burmese capital at their several trades.
                    In the mean time the Siamese revolted from the Burmese yoke; and while the
                    Burman army was marching against them, the Peguer soldiers who were embodied in
                    it rose against their companions, and commencing an indiscriminate massacre,
                    pursued the Burman army to the gates of Rangoon, which they besieged, but were
                    unable to capture. In 1774 Shembuan was engaged in reducing the marauding
                    tribes. He took the district and fort of Martaban from the revolted Peguers; and
                    in the following year he sailed down the Irrawaddy with an army of 50,000 men,
                    and, arriving at Rangoon, he put to death the aged monarch of Pegu, along with
                    many of his nobles, who had shared with him in the guilt of rebellion. He died
                    in 1776, after a reign of 12 years, during which he had extended the Burmese
                    dominions on every side, having reduced to a state of vassalage the petty states
                    in the neighbourhood, and the uncivilized tribes in the western hills, as well
                    as those in the mountainous tracts to the east of the Irrawaddy. He was
                    succeeded by his son, a youth of 18, who proved himself a blood-thirsty despot,
                    and was put to death by his uncle Min dragee Praw in 1782, who ascended the
                    vacant throne. In 1783 he sent a fleet of boats against Arracan, which was
                    conquered, and the rajah and his family made prisoners. Cheduba, Ramnce, and the
                    Broken Isles soon afterwards surrendered.</p>
                <p>The Siamese who had revolted in 1771 were never afterwards subdued by the
                    Burmans. They retained their dominion over the sea-coast, as far as Mergui; and
                    in the year 1785 they attacked the island of Junkseylon with a fleet of boats
                    and an army. But they were ultimately driven back with loss; and a second
                    attempt by the Burman monarch, who in 1786 invaded Siam with an army oı 30,000
                    men, was attended with no better success. I <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> 1793
                    peace was concluded between these two powers, the Siamese yielding to the
                    Burmans the entire possession of the coast of Tennasscrim on the Indian Ocean,
                    and th <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> two important sea-ports of Mergui and

                <p>In 1795 the Burmese were involved in a dispute with the British in India, in
                    consequence of their troops to the amount of 5000 men entering the district of
                    Chittagong in pursuit of three robbers who had fled from justice across the
                    frontier. Explanations being made, and terms of accommodation offered by General
                    Erskine, the commanding officer, the Burmese commander retired from the British
                    territories, when the fugitives were restored, and all 1ifferences for the
                    present amicably arranged.</p>
                <p>But it was evident that the gradual extension of the British and Burmese
                    territories would in time bring the two powers into collision, and would in all
                    probability lead to a war between them. And it happened, accordingly, that the
                    Burmese, having conquered the neighbouring states of Pegu, Siam, and Arracan,
                    and the northern countries of Cassay and Assam, came into contact with the
                    British frontier near Sylhet on the north-east, which was occupied by chiefs
                    dependent, though somewhat loosely, on the British government. The Burmese
                    leaders, arrested in this manner in their career of conquest, and flushed with
                    past success, were impatient to measure their strength with their new
                    neighbours. It appears from the evidence of Europeans who resided in Ava, that
                    they were entirely unacquainted with the discipline and great military resources
                    of the Europeans. They imagined that, like the other nations in the East, they
                    would fall before their superior tactics and valour; and their cupidity was
                    inflamed by the prospect of marching to Calcutta and of plundering the country.
                    With such dispositions, it was not to be supposed that causes of quarrel would
                    long be wanting; and accordingly, on the whole frontier line, the Burmese were
                    continually committing petty acts of aggression, which the British troops would
                    have been justified in repelling by force. At length their chiefs, throwing off
                    the mask, ventured on the open violation of the British territories. They
                    attacked a party of Sepoys within the frontier, seized and carried off British
                    subjects, and at all points their troops, moving in large bodies, assumed the
                    most menacing positions. The island of Shaparee, at the mouth of the Naaf river,
                    had been occupied by a small guard of British troops. These were attacked on the
                    23d September 1823, during the night, by the Burmese, and driven from their post
                    with the loss of several lives; and to the repeated demands of the British for
                    redress no answer was returned. On the north-east frontier, in the district of
                    Sylhet, the Burmese troops entered the territories of Cachar, which were under
                    the protection of the British, in pursuit of certain alleged fugitives; and they
                    proceeded, according to their custom, to fortify their posts by strong
                    palisades. Here they were attacked in January 1824, and driven from their
                    positions. Several other actions took place, in some of which the British were
                    forced to fall back from the stoccaded posts of their enemies; and in May the
                    Burmese invaded Chittagong in great force, and surrounded a British detachment
                    under Captain No-ton, which was almost entirely destroyed. The alarm which this
                    disaster occasioned in the British territories was great,, and extended as far
                    as Calcutta.</p>
                <p>. Hostilities having now commenced, the British rulers m India, with their usual
                    boldness and energy, resolved to carry the war into the enemy’s country; and
                    with this view an armament was fitted out under the orders of Commodore Grant
                    and Sir Archibald Campbell, which entered ffie Irrawaddy river, and anchored off
                    Rangoon on the 10th nay 1824. After a feeble resistance this great sea-port of
                    the Burmese surrendered, and the troops were landed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> le</hi> place was entirely deserted by its inhabitants,
                    the provisions were carried off or destroyed, and the invading force took
                    possession of a complete solitude. The devastation of the country, which was
                    part of the defensive system of the Burmese, was carried into execution with
                    unrelenting rigour, and the invaders were soon reduced to great difficulties.
                    Being destitute both of provisions and of the means of transport, they were
                    confined within the limits of Rangoon, where they were soon surrounded on all
                    sides by an overwhelming force, posted behind stoccaded entrenchments, which
                    were constructed with equal celerity and skill. The flat country at the mouth of
                    the Irrawaddy is extremely favourable for defence, being mostly covered with a
                    thick and tenacious jungle, intersected by a few narrow and uncertain
                    foot-paths, only known to the Karyan tribes, who cultivate the lands; or by
                    numerous creeks and rivers, from whose thickly-wooded banks a destructive fire
                    might be poured on the invading force. The unskilful Burmese did not. however,
                    profit by the localities as they might have done for the defence of the country.
                    They continued to erect their stoccade under cover of the jungle, and, gradually
                    encroaching on the British position, to harass the outposts and foraging
                    parties, and to prevent all communication between the invaders and the
                    inhabitants. On the 28th May Sir A. Campbell ordered an attack to be made on
                    some of the nearest posts of the enemy, which were all carried after a feeble
                    defence. Another attack was made on the 10th June on the stoccades at the
                    village of Kemmendine. Some of these, being too strong to be attacked by
                    escalade, were battered by artillery; and the shot and shells struck such terror
                    into the Burmese that they fled from their works in the utmost precipitation.
                    The monarch of Ava, enraged at these defeats, sent large reinforcements to his
                    dispirited and beaten army; and early in July a new attack was commenced on the
                    British line, with no better success than before. On the 8th the British general
                    directed an assault to be made on the enemy’s entrenched positions, in which the
                    armament on the river co-operated with the land force. The enemy were beaten as
                    formerly at all points; and their strongest stoccaded works, battered to pieces
                    by a powerful artillery, were in general abandoned by their defenders. Towards
                    the end of August an attack was made on the British position by the prince of
                    Sarawaddy, which was quickly repelled. But with this exception, the enemy having
                    learned by fatal experience the necessity of caution, allowed the British to
                    remain unmolested in their quarters during the months of July and August. This
                    interval of leisure was employed by Sir A. Campbell in subduing the maritime
                    provinces of the Burmese to the east, namely, Tavoy, Mergui, and the whole coast
                    of Tennasscrim, which quickly submitted to the British arms. This was an
                    important conquest, as the country proved to be salubrious, and afforded
                    convalescent stations to the sick, who were now so numerous in the British army,
                    owing to severe duty, and to the incessant rains and privations of every kind to
                    which they were exposed, that scarcely 3000 soldiers fit for duty could be
                    mustered in the lines. The climate of Mergui proved to be so healthy that the
                    sick who had been languishing for months at Rangoon rapidly recovered.<note

                    vain attempts to penetrate the British frontier. Relinquishing his plans of
                    offensive war, Bandoola, with his army, hastened by forced marches to the
                    defence of his country, and, by the end of November, an army of 60,000 men had
                    surrounded the British position at Rangoon and Kemmendine, for the defence of
                    which Sir Archibald Campbell had only 5000 efficient troops. On the 1st December
                    the enemy in great force made repeated attacks on the post of Kemmendine, noways
                    daunted by the heavy broadsides which were poured from the shipping in the
                    river. These attacks were invariably repulsed by the steadiness of the
                    troops—the last, which was made after dusk, with great loss; and the fire rafts
                    which had been set afloat for the destruction of the shipping, were towed ashore
                    by the sailors, where they occasioned no injury. Several encounters took place
                    with the enemy on the succeeding days; and on the 7th the army of Bandoola <hi
                    rend="subscript"> k</hi> was completely routed in a general attack by Sir A.
                    Campbell. The fugitives retired to a strong position on the river, which they
                    again entrenched; and they were here attacked by the British on the 12th, who,
                    surmounting every obstacle, carried the stoccaded ramparts at the point of the
                    bayonet, and drove the enemy in complete confusion from the field. After this
                    defeat the remnant of the Burmese army retreated to Donabew.</p>
                <p>Sir Archibald Campbell, thus victorious in every encounter, now resolved to
                    advance on Prome, about 100 miles higher up the Irrawaddy river. Having provided
                    the means of .transport, and having succeeded in acquiring the confidence of the
                    inhabitants, many of whom had returned to their homes, and were found extremely
                    useful to the army, he moved with his force in two divisions along different
                    branches of the Irrawaddy. By the 22d he reached Sarrawah, about 50 miles from
                    Rangoon. Here he expected intelligence of the reduction of Donabew by the force
                    under General Cotton, which was left in the rear for that purpose. He had
                    advanced 26 miles farther when he learned that General Cotton’s attack on
                    Donabew had failed. He instantly began a retrograde march; on the 27th he
                    effected a junction with General Cotton’s force, and on the 2d April carried the
                    entrenchments at Donabew with little resistance, the enemy being panic-struck by
                    the death of the general-in-chief, Maha Bandoola, who was killed by the
                    explosion of a bomb. Sir A. Campbell, resuming his march to Prome, entered that
                    place on the 25th, the Burmese flying at his approach, after setting fire to the
                    town. Here he remained during the rainy season to refresh his troops, exhausted
                    by privations and severe service. On the 17th September an armistice was
                    concluded between the contending armies for one month. In the course of the
                    summer General Morrison had conquered the province of Arracan; in the north the
                    Burmese were expelled from Assam; and the British had made some progress in
                    Cachar, though their advance was finally impeded by the thick forests and jungle
                    with which the country was covered.</p>
                <p>The armistice between the Burmese and Sir A. Campbell having expired on the 17th
                    October, the army of Ava, amounting to 60,000 men, advanced in three divisions
                    against the British position at Prome, which was defended by 3000 Europeans and
                    2000 native troops. But the science, courage, superior equipment, and high
                    discipline of the British still triumphed over the undisciplined hordes of the
                    .Burmese army, who being hastily brought together, and inexperienced in war,
                    were unable to withstand the close encounter of their veteran adversaries. After
                    several actions, in which the Burmese were the assailants, and were partially
                    successful, Sir A. Campbell, on the 1st December, attacked the different
                    divisions of their army, which were imprudently separated from each other, and
                    which, notwithstanding the entrenchments by which they were protected, were, in
                    the course of four days, successively driven from all their positions and
                    dispersed in every direction. The Burmese retired on Meaday and afterwards on
                    Mellone, along the course of the Irrawaddy, where they occupied with 10,000 or
                    12,000 men a series of strongly fortified heights and a formidable stoccade. On
                    the 26th they sent a flag of truce to the British camp, and a negociation having
                    commenced, peace was proposed to them on the following conditions: IsĄ The
                    cession of Arracan, together with the provinces of Mergui, Tavoy, and Yea; <hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> t</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, The kingdom of
                    Assam and its contiguous petty states, and also Munnipore, were to be placed
                    under princes and residents named by the British government; 3d, The company to
                    be paid a crore of rupees as an indemnification for the expenses of the war;
                    4√∕z, Residents from each court to be allowed, with an escort of fifty men. It
                    was also stipulated that British ships should no longer be obliged to unship
                    their rudders and land their guns as formerly in the Burmese ports. This treaty
                    was agreed to and signed, but the ratification of the king was still wanting;
                    and it was soon apparent that the Burmese had no intention to send it, but were
                    preparing to renew the contest. On the 17th January, accordingly, Sir A.
                    Campbell attacked the enemy’s position at Mellone and carried it, the Burmese
                    troops abandoning their defences in complete disorder. Another offer of peace
                    was here made, which was found to be insincere, and the fugitive army resolved
                    to make at Pagahm-Mew a final stand in defence of the capital. They were
                    attacked and overthrown on the 9th February 1826; and the invading force being
                    now within four days’ march of Ava, Dr Prince, an American missionary, who, with
                    other Europeans, had been thrown into prison when the war commenced, was sent to
                    the British camp with the treaty ratified, the prisoners of war released, and
                    the stipulated instalment of 25 lacs of rupees. The war was thus brought to a
                    successful termination, and the British army immediately began its retreat. Mr
                    Craufurd has since this period resided on the part of the British in the capital
                    of the Burmese monarch, and from his work we derive much valuable information
                    respecting the trade, resources, manners, and institutions of this people, who
                    until the embassy of Colonel Symes in 1796 were almost entirely unknown to
                    Europeans.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ava,</hi> the capital of the Burman empire. It is situated
                    on the Irrawaddy, which is here 3282 feet broad, and which, making a bend out of
                    its ordinary course, flows past the city on the north. On the east it has the
                    river Myit-nge, a rapid stream 450 feet broad, which flows into the Irrawaddy
                    close under its walls. From this river a canal has been dug, through which its
                    waters flow on the south-east angle of the city, and are again brought into the
                    same river. On the south flows the deep and rapid torrent of the Myit-tha into
                    the Irrawaddy, and thus forms the defences both of the south and west faces of
                    the town. This place is divided into the upper and lower, or the lesser and the
                    larger town, both of which are fortified. The brick wall that surrounds the city
                    is 15∣∙ feet ⅛ height and 10 feet in thickness, on the inside of which is thrown
                    up a bank of earth, forming an angle of 45 degrees. There is a ditch round the
                    outer wall, which is inconsiderable, and in the dry season fordable in every
                    part. The wall round the upper or lesser town, which forms the north-east angle,
                    is better constructed than that of the large town. The ditch over the south and
                    west faces of it is also broader and deeper, and when full in the wet season is
                    not to be forded. There are, however, three causeways across, which communicate
                    with the surrounding country. The lesser town is mostly oc-copied<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193192552" xml:id="kp-eb0704-2552-0249"/> by the palace, the hall of
                    justice, the council chamber, the arsenal, and the habitations of a few
                    courtiers of distinction. A strong, well-built wall, about 20 feet high,
                    surrounds the square in which these are situated; and on the outside of the wall
                    is a teak-wood stoccade of the same height. The circumference around the walls,
                    and excluding the suburbs, is about 5∣ miles; but over this extensive area the
                    houses are but thinly scattered, and some quarters are indeed wholly destitute
                    of habitations, and have the appearance merely of neglected commons. In general
                    the habitations of the inhabitants are of the most miserable sort, being mostly
                    mere huts thatched with grass. Some of the dwellings of the chiefs are
                    constructed of planks, and tiled; and there are not, according to Mr Craufurd,
                    more than half a dozen houses built of brick and mortar. Ava, like all the other
                    Burmese towns, is adorned with numerous temples, of which the gilded spires,
                    rising aloft, present, on a distant view of the place, a splendid and imposing
                    appearance, which is far from being realized on a nearer inspection. The largest
                    of these temples contains two distinct edifices; one in the ancient, the other
                    in the modern form; the former containing an image of Guatama, not of marble, as
                    Symes supposes, but of sandstone. It is in a sitting posture, and is 24 feet in
                    height. The head is eight feet in diameter. There is another very large temple,
                    and a third called the “Beautiful.” The one called Maong-Ratna is of great
                    celebrity; it is the one in which the public officers of the government take,
                    with the most solemn forms, the oath of allegiance. The temple called
                    Maha-mrat-muni had an addition lately made to it, of which Mr Craufurd mentions
                    that the numerous and richly-gilded pillars, and splendid ceiling, exceeded any
                    thing that was to be seen without the palace. Ava contains eleven markets or
                    bazaars, composed of thatched huts and sheds, which are well supplied with all
                    that is necessary for the wants of the people. Besides native commodities, there
                    is exposed in these markets the produce of China and Lao, with British cottons,
                    woollens, glass and earthen-ware. The Burman monasteries are mostly built of
                    wood; and of these, consisting of more solid materials, a few ancient ones are
                    all that are to be seen. The only exception is a monastery lately built by the
                    queen, adjoining the palace, which is an unshapely fabric of immense size, and a
                    very conspicuous object.</p>
                <p>The capital of the Burman dominions, according to the political divisions of the
                    empire, comprehends the town of Sagaing on the opposite shore of the Irrawaddy',
                    and the town of Ummerapoora or Amarapura, four miles to the east, with large
                    districts attached to each. The town of Sagaing extends along the Irrawaddy for
                    more than a mile and a half, but is of inconsiderable breadth. It consists of
                    mean houses, thinly scattered among gardens and orchards, the principal trees in
                    the latter consisting of fine old tamarinds. Over the site of the town and its
                    environs are scattered innumerable temples, some of them old and ruinous, others
                    modern. On the river face it has a brick wall about ten feet in height, with
                    parapet and embrazures like that of Ava, and extending for above half a mile
                    along the river. Ummerapoora, to the east, is a large place, and was formerly
                    the capital of Ava. But Ava, which was twice before the capital, was again made
                    so in 1822, by his present majesty. To each of the towns of Ava, Sagaing, and
                    Ummerapoora, are attached districts, which extend the two former twelve miles
                    along the river, and are of equal breadth. The district of Ummerapoora is of
                    equal size, so that Ava must be considered as not only the name of the capital,
                    but of a large district around, which includes an area of 288 miles, containing,
                    according to the most accurate estimate, 354,200 inhabitants. But the city of
                    Ava is not supposed to contain more than 50,000 inhabitants; and, according to
                    Mr Craufurd, half that number would be nearer the truth. Long. 96. E. Lat. 21.
