                <p><label type="entry">ATTERBURY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Dr Francis</hi></label>, son
                    of Dr Lewis Atterbury, was born at Milton in Buckinghamshire, in 1662; educated
                    at Westminster; and thereafter elected to Christ Church in Oxford, where he soon
                    distinguished himself by his fine genius and taste for polite literature. In
                    1687 he was made Μ. A., when he exerted himself in the controversy with the
                    papists; vindicated Luther in the strongest manner; and showed an uncommon fund
                    of learning, enlivened with great vivacity. In 1690 he married Miss Osborn, a
                    distant relation of the duke of Leeds, and a lady of great beauty, but of small
                    fortune.</p>
                <p>In February 1690 and 1691 we find him resolved to “bestir himself in his office
                    in the house,” that of censor probably; an officer peculiar to Christ Church,
                    who presides over the classical exercises. At the same time he held the
                    catechetical lecture founded by Dr Busby.</p>
                <p>It must have been about this period that he took orders, and entered upon another
                    scene and another sort of conversation; for in 1691 he was elected lecturer of
                    St Bride’s Chyrch in London, and preacher at Bridewell Chapel. An academic life,
                    indeed, must have been irksome and insipid to a person of his active and
                    aspiring temper. It was hardly possible that a clergyman of his fine genius,
                    improved by study, and with a spirit to exert his talents, should remain long
                    unnoticed; and accordingly we find that he was soon appointed chaplain to King
                    William and Queen Mary.</p>
                <p>The share which he took in the controversywith Bentley, about the genuineness of
                    Phalaris’s epistles, is now very clearly ascertained. In one of the letters to
                    his noble pupil, dated Chelsea 1698, he says, the matter had cost him some time
                    and trouble. “In laying the design of the book, in writing above half of it, in
                    reviewing a good part of the rest, in transcribing the whole, and attending the
                    press, he adds, “half a year of my life went away.”</p>
                <p>In 1700 a still larger field of activity opened, in which Atterbury was engaged
                    four years with Dr Wake (afterwards archbishop of Canterbury) and others
                    concerning the rights, powers, and privileges of convocations ;' an
                    investigation in which, however the truth of the question may. be supposed to
                    lie, he displayed so much learning and ingenuity, as well as zeal for the
                    interests of his order, that the lower house of convocation returned him their
                    thanks, and the university of Oxford complimented him with the degree of D.D. On
                    the 29th January 1700’he was installed archdeacon of Totness, being promoted to
                    that dignity by Sir Jonathan Trelawney, then bishop of Exeter. The same year he
                    was engaged, with some other learned divines, in revising an intended edition of
                    the Greek Testament, with Greek scholia, collected chiefly from the fathers by
                    Mr Archdeacon Gregory. At this period he was very popular as preacher at the
                    Rolls Chapel; an office which had been conferred on him by Sir John Trevor, a
                    great discerner of abilities, in 1698, when he resigned Bridewell, which he had
                    obtained in 1693. Upon the accession of Queen Anne in 1702, Dr Atterbury was
                    appointed one of her majesty’s chaplains in ordinary; and in October 1704 he was
                    advanced to the deanery of Carlisle. About two years after this he was engaged
                    in a dispute with Mr Hoadly concerning the advantages of virtue with regard to
                    the present life, occasioned by his sermon preached 30th August 1706, at the
                    funeral of Mr Thomas Bennet, a bookseller. In 1707 Sir Jonathan Trelawney, then
                    bishop of Exeter, appointed him one of the canons residentiaries of that church.
                    In 1709 he was engaged in a fresh dispute with Mr Hoadly concerning the doctrine
                    of passive obedience, occasioned by his Latin sermon, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Concio</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Clerum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Londinensem,</hi><hi rend="italic">habita</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">Elphegi.</hi> In 1710 came on the famous trial of Dr Sacheverell,
                    whose remarkable speech on that occasion was generally supposed to have been
                    drawn up by our author, in conjunction with Dr Smalridge and Dr Freind. The same
                    year Dr Atterbury was unanimously chosen prolocutor of the lower house of
                    convocation, and had the chief management of affairs in that house. On the 11th
                    May 1711 he was appointed by the convocation one of the committee for comparing
                    Mr Whiston’s doctrines with those of the church of England; and in June
                    following he had the chief hand in drawing up <hi rend="italic">A Representation
                    of the Present State of</hi><hi rend="italic">Religion.</hi> In 1712 Dr
                    Atterbury was made dean of Christ Church, notwithstanding the strong interest
                    and warm applications of several great men in behalf of his competitor Dr
                    Smalridge. The next year saw him at the summit of his preferment, as well as of
                    his reputation; for, in the beginning of June 1713, the queen, on the
                    recommendation of Lord Chancellor Harcourt, advanced him to the bishopric of
                    Rochester, with the deanery of Westminster in commendam. He was confirmed on the
                    4th July, and consecrated at Lambeth the next day. . .</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the succeeding reign his tide of prosperity began to turn;
                    and he received a sensible mortification presently after the coronation of King
                    George I., when, upon his offering to present to his majesty, with a view, no
                    doubt, of standing better in his favour, the chair of state or royal canopy, his
                    own perquisite as dean of Westminster, the tender was rejected, not without some
                    evident marks of dislike to his person.</p>
                <p>During the rebellion in Scotland, and after the Pretender s declaration had been
                    widely distributed, the archbishop of Canterbury, and the bishops in or near
                    London, drew up and published a <hi rend="italic">Declaration of their
                    abhorrence of the present Rebellion, and an Exhortation to the Clergy and People
                    to be zealous in the discharge of their Duties to His Majesty King George;</hi>
                    but the bishop of Rochester refused to sign it, and engaged Bishop Smalridge to
                    join in the refusal, on account of some reflections it contained against the
                    high church party. In fact he appeared generally among the protestors against
                    the measures of the king’s ministers, and for the most part drew up the reasons
                    of the protests with his own hand.</p>
                <p>In 1716 we find him advising Dean Swift in the management of a refractory
                    chapter. On the 26th April 1/22 he sustained a severe trial in the loss of his
                    lady, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193191148" xml:id="kp-eb0704-1148-0141"/>.by whom
                    he had four children. In this memorable year, also, on a suspicion of his being
                    concerned in a plot in favour of the Pretender, he was apprehended (24th
                    August), and committed prisoner to the Tower. This commitment of a bishop upon
                    suspicion of high treason, as it was a thing rarely practised since the
                    Reformation, so it occasioned various speculations, which amused the nation at
                    that time; and men, as usual, judged of things by tlae standard of their own
                    affections and prejudices.</p>
                <p>On the 23d March 1723 a bill was brought into the house of commons for inflicting
                    certain pains and penalties on Francis, Lord Bishop of Rochester, a copy of
                    which was sent to him, with notice that he had liberty of counsel and solicitors
                    for making his defence. Under these circumstances the bishop applied by petition
                    to the house of lords for their direction and advice as to his conduct in this
                    conjuncture; and on the 4th April he acquainted the speaker of the house of
                    commons, by letter, that he was determined to give that house no trouble in
                    relation to the bill depending therein, but should be ready to make his defence
                    against it when it should be argued in another house, of which he had the honour
                    to be a member. On the 9th the bill passed the house of commons, and was the
                    same day sent up to the house of lords for their concurrence.</p>
                <p>May the 6th being the day appointed by the lords for the first reading of the
                    bill, Bishop Atterbury was brought to Westminster to make his defence. The
                    proceedings continued above a week; and, on May the llth, he was permitted to
                    plead for himself. This he did in a very eloquent speech, which he feelingly
                    opens by complaining of the uncommon severity he had experienced in the tower,
                    and which had been carried to so great a length that not even his son-in-law Mr
                    Morice was permitted to speak to him in any other way than by standing in an
                    open area, whilst the bishop looked out of a two-pair-oſ-stairs window. On the
                    13th he was carried for the last time from the tower in order to hear the reply
                    of the king’s counsel to his defence. On the 15th the bill was read a third
                    time, and, after a very long and warm debate, passed on the 16th by a majority
                    of 83 to 43. On the 27th the king came to the house and confirmed it by his
                    royal assent. On the 18th June 1723 this eminent prelate, having the day before
                    taken leave of his friends, who, from the time of the passing of the bill
                    against him till the day of his departure, had free access to him in the tower,
                    embarked on board the Aldborough man-of-war, and landed the Friday following at
                    Calais. When he went on shore, being informed that Lord Bolingbroke (who, after
                    the rising of the parliament, had received the king’s pardon), was arrived at
                    the same place on his return to England, he said, with an air of pleasantry,
                    “Then <hi rend="italic">I am</hi> exchanged.” And it was, in the opinion of Mr
                    Pope expressed on the same occasion, a sign that the nation was afraid of being
                    overrun with too much politeness, when it could not regain one great man but at
                    the expense of another. The severity of the bishop’s treatment did not cease
                    with his banishment; the same vindictive spirit pursued him even in foreign
                    climes; and no British subject was permitted to visit him without the king’s
                    sign manual, which Mr Morice was always obliged to solicit, not only for
                    himself, but for every one of his family whom he carried abroad with him, for
                    which the fees of office were very high.</p>
                <p>When Bishop Atterbury first entered upon his banishment, Brussels was the place
                    destined for his residence; but, by the arts and instigation of the British
                    ministers, he was compelled to leave that city, and retire to Paris. There,
                    being solicited by the friends of the Pretender to enter into their
                    negociations, he changed his abode for Montpelier in 1728; and after residing in
                    the latter place about two years, returned to Paris, where he died on the 15th
                    February 1732. The affliction which he had sustained by the death of his
                    daughter in 1729 was thought to have hastened his own dissolution.</p>
                <p>How far the bishop may have been attached by inclination to the cause of the
                    Stuart family, to which he might have been led by early prejudices of education
                    and the divided opinion of the times, it is not necessary here to inquire; but
                    that he should have been weak enough to engage in a plot so inconsistent with
                    his station, and so clumsily devised, to say nothing of his solemn asseveration
                    of innocence, is utterly inconsistent with that cunning which his enemies
                    ascribed to him. The duke of Wharton, it is well known, was violent against him,
                    till convinced by his unanswerable reasoning.</p>
                <p>His body was brought over to England, and interred in Westminster Abbey, in a
                    vault which, in the year 1722, had been prepared by his directions. Some time
                    before his death he published a vindication of himself, Bishop Smalridge, and Dr
                    Aldrich, from a charge brought against them by Mr Oldmixon, of having altered
                    and interpolated the copy of Lord Clarendon’s <hi rend="italic">History of the
                    Rebellion.</hi> Atterbury’s <hi rend="italic">Sermons</hi> are extant in four
                    volumes in octavo. Those contained in the first two were published by himself,
                    and dedicated to his great patron Sir Jonathan Trelawney, bishop of Winchester;
                    those contained in the last two were published after his death by Dr Thomas
                    Moore, his lordship’s chaplain. Four admirable <hi rend="italic">Visitation
                    Charges</hi> accompany his <hi rend="italic">Epistolary Correspondence,</hi>
                    published by Mr Nichols in 5 vols. 8vo.</p>
                <p>As to Bishop Atterbury’s character, however differently the moral and political
                    part of it may have been represented by the opposite parties, it is universally
                    agreed that he was a man of great learning and uncommon abilities, a fine
                    writer, and a most excellent preacher. His learned friend Smalridge, in the
                    speech he made when he presented him to the upper house of convocation, as
                    prolocutor, styled him <hi rend="italic">Vir in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mullo</hi><hi rend="italic">literarum</hi><hi rend="italic">genere
                    hospes,</hi><hi rend="italic">in plerisque</hi><hi rend="italic">artibus et
                    studiis diu</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">feliciter

                    rend="italic">disciplinis perfectissimus.</hi> In his controversial writings he
                    was sometimes severe to excess upon his adversary, and dealt rather too much in
                    satire and invective; but this his panegyrist imputes more to the natural
                    fervour of his wit than to any bitterness of temper or inherent malice of
                    disposition. In his sermons, however, he is not only every way unexceptionable,
                    but highly to be commended. The truth is, his talent as a preacher was so
                    excellent and remarkable, that it may not improperly be said that he owed his
                    preferment to the pulpit, “He has,” says an author in the Tatler, “so particular
                    a regard to his congregation, that he commits to his memory what he has to say
                    to them; and has so soft and graceful a behaviour, that it must attract your
                    attention. His person, it is to be confessed, is no small recommendation; but he
                    is to be highly commended for not losing that advantage, and adding to propriety
                    of speech (which might pass the criticism of Longinus) an action which would
                    have been approved by Demosthenes. He never attempts your passions till he has
                    convinced your reason. All the objections which you can form are laid open and
                    dispersed before he uses the least vehemence in his sermon; but when he thinks
                    he has your head, he very soon wins your heart, and never pretends to show the
                    beauty of holiness till he has convinced you of the truth of it.” <pb break="no"
