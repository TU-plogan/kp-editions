                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">ASTURIAS</label>, one of the provinces of the Spanish
                    monarchy, distinguished by the title of a principality, and under that name
                    conferred on the heir apparent to the throne of Spain. It is bounded on the east
                    by Biscay, on the south by Leon, on the west by Galicia, and on the north by the
                    ocean. It was known to the Romans during their empire in Spain by the name of
                    the Ultramontane provinces, being surrounded on every side but the north, where
                    the sea bounds it, by high mountains, which are passable with difficulty by
                    horses, and nearly impassable by wheel carriages. Its surface extends to 308
                    square leagues, and its population, according to the census of 1803, amounted to
                    364,238 souls. Although it is the most populous of any of the larger divisions
                    of Spain, it contains few cities or large towns. The inhabitants are mostly
                    employed in the cultivation of the land, and in such manufactures as cultivators
                    require. The face of the country is excessively irregular and mountainous; the
                    higher elevations are not cultivated; and even in the valleys, which are
                    irrigated by numberless streams, though there is abundant pasture for cattle,
                    there is a great deficiency of corn. The flour of maize constitutes the
                    principal food of all but the higher classes of inhabitants. Wheat is not much
                    grown. The humidity weakens the plant; and though at first it appears to
                    flourish, and looks well till it is in blossom, it scarcely ever forms grain.
                    Rye grows better, and constitutes part of the food, especially when mixed with
                    maize. Chesnuts, as in the other phrts of Spain, form an important portion of
                    the sustenance of the inhabitants. They are very abundant on the hills, and the
                    nuts as well as the wood are very valuable products. Other kinds of timber are
                    found in the mountains, well calculated for ship-building; and several medicinal
                    plants, such as hellebore, valerian, angelica, and others, which form trifling
                    branches of commerce. Cows and horses are reared in this province, and
                    considerable numbers of them sent to Galicia, Leon, and the two Castiles. Vines,
                    for want of due attention, do not flourish. Very little wine is made, and that
                    little of bad quality; but to compensate for this deficiency, they have
                    abundance of apples, and cider forms the common drink of the people. In some
                    parts of the province there are very valuable mines of coal, which provide fuel
                    to the inhabitants and to such trades as require considerable fires; and some of
                    the coal has been transported to Cadiz, Carthagena, and other ports in the
                    Mediterranean Sea-In the lower parts of the country, especially on the sea
                    coast, at a distance from coal mines and forests, the inhabitants use turf or
                    peat for firing. In the vicinity of the river Avila there are some mines of
                    copper worked; and as fuel is plentiful, manufactories of copper utensils have
                    been established, from whence some parts of Leon and Castile are supplied with
                    furnaces, kettles, pots, and other similar articles. Besides these, there is a
                    royal manufactory near Oviedo, where, in blast-furnaces, they cast cannon-balls,
                    granades, bombs, and cannon of all calibres. These latter are sent to Pola to be
                    bored, and then to Oviedo, where they are mounted. Some coarse cloths are made,
                    but not sufficient to supply the inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The mountains, which cover the whole province, gradually decline in height as
                    they approach the ocean, along the border of which is a narrow stripe of the
                    best and most populous portion of the principality. From the narrowness of this
                    tract, it must be seen that the courses of all the rivers are necessarily short
                    and rapid, and that they are very apt to overflow the country when the rains
                    descend on the mountains. The principal river is the Nalon, which encircles the
                    city of Oviedo, before which it receives the river Caudal, formed by the
                    junction of two other rivers, the Pola de Leon and the Aller. After passing
                    Oviedo, the rivers Trubia and Narcea contribute their streams, when, under the
                    designation of the Pravia, it falls into the ocean. Along the whole extent of
                    the coast of Asturias, a length of 130 miles, there is not one good port. The
                    best is Ribadesella, where a large frigate may anchor; but its entrance is bad.
                    Gijon will admit a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193190771"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-0771-0112"/>vessel drawing 16 or 17 feet water, and when
                    within, she is sufficiently safe; but the entrance is very narrow and very
                    dangerous. It is a remark which has been made with sufficient accuracy to
                    entitle it to credit, that on the whole coast of Asturias the sea has been
                    constantly gaining on the shore; and if it continues to encroach for the next 50
                    years as it has done for the last fifty, the town of Gijon will be deprived of
                    its port. The principal city is Oviedo, containing 6000 inhabitants. It is the
                    see of a bishop, and the seat of a superior tribunal of law. It has a
                    university, a well-endowed hospital, and a lazaretto. 1he cathedral is a large
                    Gothic pile, with a tower of uncommon height. It is surrounded with a beautiful
                    walk. The climate is very healthy, and its markets well furnished with every
                    necessary of life. Among other convents, that of the Benedictines deserves
                    notice, as the residence and burial-place of Father Feijoo, whose writings do
                    honour to Spain. At a league from the city are the warm baths of Caldas. The
                    spring issues from a calcareous rock of secondary formation: it is much resorted
                    to, being found highly beneficial in many diseases. Gijon, though not the
                    capital, is larger than Oviedo, and, on account of its harbour, of more
                    importance. It is honoured by having been the native place of Jovellanos, one of
                    the wisest and best men that Spain has recently produced. He founded here the
                    Asturian Institution, destined for the instruction of youth in mathematics,
                    mineralogy, and navigation, which still continues to flourish. He also projected
                    a road, now in progress, for wheel-carriages to Leon from Gijon. The cabildo of
                    Oviedo has done honour to his fame, by erecting at the gate of their city,
                    through which this road passes, a stone with an inscription to perpetuate the
                    obligations his country owed to him. At 10 leagues to the east-south-east of
                    Oviedo stands the collegial church and sanctuary of Covadonga, whose fame has
                    been extended by the history of the period when the remains of the Goths were
                    collected in the mountains of Asturias, and who first commenced that opposition
                    to and defiance of the Moors which continued during seven centuries, till the
                    wholc of the peninsula was cleared of that enterprising, predatory, and
                    oppressive race. The sea coasts, as well as the small rapid streams, abound with
                    fish of various kinds, the latter especially with salmon and lampreys, which are
                    sent to supply the markets of Madrid. The important events of the early history
                    of this principality will be communicated in the general historical account of
                    Spain.— <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi rend="italic">Natural de
