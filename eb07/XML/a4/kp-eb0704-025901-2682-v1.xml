                <p><label type="entry">AYRSHIRE</label>, a county in the west of Scotland,
                    considerable for its population and industry, is bounded by Wigtonshire and the
                    stewartry of Kirkcudbright on the south, by the counties of Dumfries and Lanark
                    on the north-east and east, by Renfrewshire on the north, and by the Irish Sea
                    and the Frith of Clyde for about 70 miles on the west. It contains about 1060
                    square miles, or 665,600 statute acres, consisting of the following descriptions
                    of soil, viz. clay soil 261,960 acres, sand or light soil 120,110 acres, and of
                    moss and moorlands 283,530 acres. About one half of the whole is now under
                    cultivation. The middle part of the county is broadest, and extends to about 25
                    miles across, both ends diminishing to a few miles in breadth. The high ridgy
                    land which stretches along its eastern boundary shuts it out, in a general
                    sense, from the adjacent counties, and the surface inclines either to the sea or
                    to the rivers which flow towards it. Ayrshire possesses only six rivers of note,
                    Ayr, Stinchar, Girvan, Doon, Irvine, and Garnock; but the streams are very
                    numerous, and fresh-water lakes abound, of which Doon is the most extensive, and
                    the parent of the river bearing that name. None of the mountains are deserving
                    of particular notice. In former times the shire was divided into three
                    districts; Carrick, lying on the southern side of the Doon; Kyle, lying between
                    the rivers Doon and Irvine; and Cunningham, comprehending the whole of the
                    county north of the river Irvine. These divisions, although abolished by the
                    statute, still continue to be recognised in statistical descriptions of the
                    county. Carrick is a hilly, wild region, and only of value in its northern
                    quarter. It contains nine parishes, and comprises 393 square miles. Kyle
                    possesses much valuable land towards the coast, but the interior is rough and
                    mountainous; it contains twenty-one parishes, with a superficies of 403 square
                    miles. But the most fertile part of the county is Cunningham, which is
                    comparatively level, comprising 244 square miles, and sixteen parishes. The
                    valued rent is L.l 91,605 0s. 7d. Scots, and in 1811 the real rent of the lands
                    was L.336,471 lθs., and that of the houses L.22,823 sterling. The division of
                    property is considered as not unfavourable to the prosperity of the different
                    classes of the population, though it appears that more than a third part of the
                    whole county is held under settlements of entail. The advantages possessed by
                    Ayrshire, besides its sea-coast and several excellent harbours, may be traced to
                    the coal and limestone found in great abundance in almost every part of it,—the
                    one so necessary to its manufactures, and the other to its agriculture; and the
                    chief natural disadvantage under which it labours is the humidity of its
                    climate, aggravated by the quality of a considerable part of the soil, which is
                    a tenacious clay.</p>
                <p>Agriculture, according to the more approved courses of nanagement, has
                    nevertheless made considerable progress of late in this county. The old rotation
                    of three consecutive crops of corn, followed by six years hay and pasture, has
                    been very generally abandoned in the new eases; and, on the better soils, an
                    alternation of white and green crops, and an interchange of tillage and
                    pasturage, as in the eastern counties of Scotland, begin to prevail. The dairy
                    is, however, the chief object of attention to the Ayrshire husbandmen, and their
                    valuable breed of cows, and rich yet mild cheese known by the name of Dunlop
                    cheese, are in great repute in most parts of Britain. Their horses, under the
                    general name of Clydesdale or Lanarkshire horses, are equal, if not superior, to
                    those of any other race in the island; almost every small farmer (and the farms
                    are generally too small) either rearing one or more himself, or purchasing them
                    when young, and reselling them to the eastern counties after a year or two of
                    very moderate labour. Nevertheless, it must be admitted that the agriculture of
                    Ayrshire is much inferior to that of the counties on the east coast. No regular
                    system of cleansing and manuring the soil, nor of fallowing and draining the wet
                    lands, is to be seen throughout the greater part of the district. The size of
                    the farms is commonly from 50 to 150 acres, affording little scope for the
                    employment of capital or the division of labour; and yet the rents are
                    surprisingly high, some favoured spots bringing not less than eight pounds or
                    guineas an acre.</p>
                <p>Ayrshire, as a manufacturing district, seems to stand next in importance among
                    the Scotish counties to the contiguous shires of Lanark and Renfrew. Various
                    branches of the woollen manufacture are carried on to a considerable extent in
                    different parts of it. In Kilmarnock, harness and printed worsted shawls are
                    manufactured to the yearly amount of L.200,000, carpets to L.100,000, boots and
                    shoes to L.32,000, and bonnets to L.12,000; and besides the public
                    establishments there, and in other parts of the county, many private families in
                    almost every parish take a share in the manufacture of blankets and coarse
                    cloths; a part of which, after supplying their own wants, is carried to the
                    fairs and markets of the county. Beith has long been noted for its thread
                    manufacture. But the cotton works at Catrine are by far the most extensive of
                    all its manufactories, employing about 1800 hands, who are said to make 35,000
                    yards of cloth per week. At Muirkirk and Glenbuck, pig and bar iron are wrought
                    to a great extent, and founderies have been erected there and in other places.
                    Leather, saddlery, earthenware, kelp, and salt, are the only other kinds of
                    manufacture worthy of notice in this county.</p>
                <p>Ayr, Irvine, and Saltcoats, were, till very lately, the only harbours much
                    frequented; and at these places there has long been a little trade with Ireland,
                    America, and the Baltic, and a considerable trade coastwise. The port of Ayr has
                    60 small vessels of about 6000 tons burden; and Irvine, Saltcoats, Troon,
                    Ardrossan, Largs, and Arran, 100 vessels of about 10,000 tons burden. Coal is
                    the staple article of export, and corn the most considerable of its imports; the
                    ports on the Clyde having hitherto been the grand emporium of the w^est of
                    Scotland.</p>
                <p>This county exhibits examples of public spirit in its great landed proprietors
                    beyond any other in Scotland, or probably in the British empire. The harbour and
                    other works at Ardrossan, begun under the auspices of the late Earl of
                    Eglintoun, the harbour of Troon, and the railway from thence to Kilmarnock,
                    formed almost entirely at the expense of the Duke of Portland, are worthy
                    monuments, no less of the enlightened judgment and energy, than of the wealth,
                    of these two patriotic noblemen; and the distant prospect of remuneration, which
                    it is much to be wished could be amply realized, can detract in no respect from
                    the merit of such grand and princely undertakings.</p>
                <p>The harbour of Ardrossan has been for many years in a state to receive shipping,
                    and is considered as one of the safest, most capacious, and most accessible on
                    the west coast of Scotland; possessing many advantages over the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193192695?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0704-2695-0260"/> harbours in
                    the Frith of Clyde, situate in a narrow channel, which can be navigated only
                    when the wind blows from particular points, and which, for upwards of twenty
                    miles below Glasgow, is both shallow and dangerous. A circular pier of 900 yards
                    was finished in 1811; and the wet dock and other appendages, which, according to
                    Mr Telford’s plan, were to contain from 70 to 100 vessels, in water sixteen feet
                    deep, were begun and nearly completed, when the death of the Earl of Ëglinton in
                    1820 brought them to a stand. They were merely suspended, however, and will be
                    resumed when the present earl attains majority, which will happen in a year or
                    two. It was part of the plan to raise a neat, regular-built town at Ardrossan,
                    in which some progress has been made; and excellent baths have been constructed,
                    which draw to it a number of visitors during the summer season.</p>
                <p>The harbour of Ardrossan was only part of the general plan, and that from which,
                    viewed by itself, the smallest advantages perhaps were to be expected. The
                    leading idea was to open up a direct communication between Glasgow, Paisley, and
                    other large towns in the vicinity, and the west coast, instead of the present
                    circuitous passage by the Frith of Clyde. A canal was therefore to be cut from
                    Glasgow to Ardrossan, about thirty-one and a half miles, at the estimated
                    expense of L.125,000. Of this only a third has been executed, that is, from
                    Glasgow to Johnstone, which cost about L.90,000. The rest of the track will be
                    completed by a railway, of which some miles have been already laid from
                    Ardrossan eastwards.</p>
                <p>The harbour at Troon, connected as it now is with Kil- <hi rend="subscript">
                    r</hi> marriock, by means of a railway, seems to possess all the <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> advantages of that of Ardrossan. The wet and dry docks
                    are also excellent, and very well employed. There are also extensive warehouses,
                    and a yard for building vessels. The railway from Troon to Kilmarnock, a
                    distance of ten! miles, has been in full operation for fifteen years, and
                    answers all the purposes for which it was originally intended. There are upwards
                    of 3000 acres of coal fields in its course, which must in time indemnify the
                    duke of Portland for his outlay both on this and the harbour. Coals have been
                    hitherto the principal article of conveyance towards the Troon, at the rate of
                    100 tons daily; and from thence timber, iron, grain, &amp;c. are transported to
                    Kilmarnock and the country adjacent. Locomotive engines were attempted upon it
                    about 15 years ago, but the experiment did not succeed. However, from the
                    improvements recently made upon these machines, it is probable that they may
                    soon be resumed. This railway has cost the duke upwards of L.50,000, and the
                    harbour is estimated at about the same sum.</p>
