                <p><label type="entry">ATMOMETER</label> (from <hi rend="italic">αrμος, vapour,</hi>
                    and μsrgoι∕, <hi rend="italic">a measure),</hi> an instrument contrived by
                    Professor Leslie, for measuring the quantity of moisture exhaled from any humid
                    surface in a given time. It consists of a very thin ball of porous earthenware,
                    from one to three inches in diameter, having a small neck firmly cemented to a
                    long and rather wide tube of glass, to which is adapted a brass cap, with a
                    narrow collar of leather to fit close. Being filled with distilled or pure
                    water, the waste and descent of this column serves to indicate the quantity of
                    evaporation from the external surface of the ball. The tube is marked downwards,
                    through its whole length, by the point of a diamond, with divisions across it,
                    amounting to from 200 to 500, each of which corresponds to a ring of fluid,
                    that, spread over the whole exhaling surface, would form a film only one
                    thousandth part of an inch in thickness. This graduation is performed by
                    previously sealing one of the ends of the tube with wax, and introducing
                    successive portions of quicksilver, to mark every 20, 50, or 100 of those
                    divisions; being calculated of equal bulk to. disks of water, that have the
                    surface of the ball (exclusive of the neck) for their base, and so many thousand
                    parts of an inch for their altitude.</p>
                <p>The instrument, being thus constructed, has its cavity filled with pure water,
                    and its cap screwed tight, and is then suspended freely out of doors, sheltered
                    indeed from rain, but exposed to the action of the wind. The water transudes
                    through the porous substance of the ball just as fast as it evaporates from the
                    external surface; and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193191031"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-1031-0132"/>this waste is measured by the corresponding
                    descent of the liquid in the stem. At the same time, the column is suspended in
                    consequence of the tightness of the cap, and prevented from oozing so freely as
                    to drop from the ball. As the process of evaporation goes on, minute globules of
                    air, separated by the removal of atmospheric pressure from the body of the
                    water, or partly introduced by external absorption, continue to rise in fine
                    streamlets to the top, where they partially occupy the space left by the
                    subsidence of the fluid column. We need scarcely observe, that, after the water
                    has sunk to the bottom of the stem, it will be requisite again to fill the
                    cavity.</p>
                <p>It is a fact of main importance for the accuracy of the atmometer, that the rate
                    of evaporation is nowise affected by the quality of the porous ball, and
                    continues precisely the same whether the exhaling surface appears almost dry or
                    glistens with excess of moisture. This rate must evidently depend on the effect
                    of the dryness of the air combined with its quickness of circulation. In a close
                    room the instrument might therefore serve the purpose of an hygrometer; and,
                    placed out of doors, first screened, perhaps, for an hour, and then exposed
                    during an equal space of time, it would furnish data for calculating the
                    velocity of the wind.</p>
                <p>This instrument is of extensive application and great practical utility. To
                    ascertain readily and accurately the rate of evaporation from any surface, is an
                    important acquisition, not only in meteorology, but in agriculture, and in the
                    various mechanical arts. The quantity of exhalation from the surface of the
                    ground is not of less consequence than the measure of the fall of rain, and a
                    knowledge of it might often direct the farmer advantageously in his operations.
                    On the rapid dispersion of moisture depends the efficacy of drying-houses, which
                    are generally constructed on most erroneous principles.</p>
                <p>The atmometer, in its most compendious form, is admirably fitted for delicate
                    experiments on the evaporation which takes place in close vessels when absorbent
                    substances are introduced. Let the ball of the instrument, for example, be
                    immersed in air variously rarefied or condensed, under a receiver covering a
                    surface of sulphuric acid which has different degrees of strength; and, things
                    being thus disposed, on extracting the common air, and introducing hydrogen gas,
                    the rate of evaporation will then be nearly tripled.</p>
                <p>We shall close this notice with mentioning a striking fact, which shows the
                    necessity of extreme caution in all physical inquiries. Let the ball of an
                    atmometer be cemented to a narrow glass tube of three or four feet in length,
                    and the whole capacity filled with fresh distilled water. Now invert the
                    instrument upright in a basin of quicksilver, and secure it in that situation;
                    the quicksilver, following the column of water, will rise at first quickly, and
                    then by degrees more slowly, till it reaches, perhaps, an elevation of 28
                    inches, where it will remain stationary and afterwards sink down, when the
                    evaporation is nearly spent. Ice-water is raised in this way about 26 inches
                    only, and common water scarcely 24 inches; the air separated from such liquids
                    forming near the top of the ball a thin medium, which, by its elasticity,
                    counteracts in part the pressure of the external atmosphere supporting the
                    mercurial column. But a similar experiment, where the shoot of a vine was
                    cemented to a tube holding quicksilver, has been thought, by Dr Hales and Μ. Du
                    Hamel, quite conclusive in proving the <hi rend="italic">power</hi> of the
                    living principle of vegetation. It is obvious that the force of evaporation
                    alone was sufficient to explain the facts advanced by those ingenious
                    philosophers. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Meteorology. .</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">.
