                    rend="italic">Magnus),</hi> one of the best poets of the fourth century, was the
                    son of an eminent physician, and born at Bourdeaux. Great care was taken of his
                    education, the whole family interesting themselves in it, either because his
                    genius was very promising, or that the scheme of his nativity, which had been
                    cast by his maternal grandfather, led them to imagine that he would one day rise
                    to great honour. He made uncommon progress in classical learning, and at the age
                    of thirty was chosen to teach grammar at Bourdeaux. He was promoted some time
                    after to be professor of rhetoric; in which office he acquired so great a
                    reputation that he was sent for to court to be preceptor to Gratian, the emperor
                    Valentinian’s son. The rewards and honours conferred on him for the faithful
                    discharge of his office prove the truth of Juvenal’s maxim, that when fortune
                    pleases she can raise a man from the humble rank of rhetorician to the dignity
                    of consul. He was actually appointed consul by the emperor Gratian in the year
                    379, after having filled other considerable posts; for besides the dignity of
                    questor, to which he had been nominated by Valentinian, he was made prefect of
                    the praetorium in Italy and Gaul after that prince’s death. His speech,
                    returning thanks to Gratian on his promotion to the consulship, is highly
                    commended. The time of his death is uncertain; but he was alive in 392, and is
                    said to have attained a great age. The emperor Theodosius had a great esteem for
                    Ausonius, and pressed him to publish his poems. There is great inequality in his
                    works; and in his manner and style there is a harshness which was perhaps rather
                    the defect of the times in which he lived than of his genius. The best editions
                    of his poems arc that of Amsterdam in 1671, in 8vo, and that of Paris in 1728,
                    in 4to.</p>
