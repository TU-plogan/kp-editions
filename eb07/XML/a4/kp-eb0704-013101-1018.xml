                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">ATLAS</label>, king of Mauritania, a great astronomer,
                    contemporary with Moses. From his taking observations of the stars on a
                    mountain, the poets feigned him to have been turned into a mountain, and to
                    sustain the heavens on his shoulders. Being an excellent astronomer, and the
                    first who taught the doctrine of the sphere, they tell us that his daughters
                    were turned into stars; seven of them forming the Pleiades, and other seven the
                    Hyades.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Atlas,</hi> a chain of mountains in Africa, lying between
                    the 20th and 25th degrees of north latitude, and supposed almost to divide the
                    continent from east to west. They are said to have derived their name from
                    Atlas, king of Mauritania. They are greatly celebrated by the ancients on
                    account of their height, insomuch that the above-mentioned king, who is said to
                    have been transformed into a mountain, was feigned to support the heavens on his
                    shoulders. M. Desfontaines, who with the eyes of a learned botanist surveyed a
                    great part of this system of mountains, considers it as divided into two leading
                    chains. The southern one, adjoining the desert, is called the Great Atlas; the
                    other, lying towards the Mediterranean, is called the Little Chain. Both run
                    east and west in a parallel direction, and are connected together by several
                    intermediate mountains running north and south, and containing between them both
                    valleys and table-lands; but it is worthy of remark that the Great and Little
                    Atlas of Ptolemy, the one of which is terminated at Cape Feluch, and the other
                    at Cape Cautin, differ from the chains of the French traveller, being lateral
                    branches which shoot off from the main system, to form promontories on the
                    sea-coast. According to Dr Shaw, if we conceive a <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi>
                    number of hills, usually of the perpendicular height of 400, 500, or 600 yards,
                    with an easy ascent, and several groves of fruit or forest trees, rising up in a
                    succession of ranges above one another,—and if to this prospect we add now and
                    then a rocky precipice, having generally a miserable mud-walled village on the
                    summit,—we shall then have a just idea of the mountains of Atlas. The
                    observations of Shaw, however, were confined to eastern Barbary, through which
                    alone he travelled; but Jackson, and other later observers, who saw these
                    mountains from Morocco, describe them as rising to the height of 12,000 or
                    13,000 feet, and, even in this tropical climate, having their summits covered
                    with perpetual snow.</p>
                <p>According to Μ. Chenier, they are formed by an endless chain of lofty eminences,
                    inhabited by a multitude of tribes, whose ferocity permits no stranger to
                    approach. “Nothing, perhaps,” says he, “would be more interesting to the
                    curiosity of the philosopher, or conduce more to the improvement of our
                    knowledge in natural history, than a journey over Mount Atlas. The climate,
                    though extremely cold in winter, is very healthy and pleasant; the valleys are
                    well cultivated, abound in fruits, and are diversified by forests and plentiful
                    springs, the streams of which uniting at a little distance, form considerable
                    rivers, and lose themselves in the ocean. According to the reports of the Moors,
                    there are many quarries of marble, granite, and other valuable stone, in these
                    mountains.” Lead, silver, and copper, are extracted from different parts of
                    them. It is even reported, and Mr Jackson thinks with some truth, that gold and
                    silver might be obtained in them, but for the jealousy of the sovereigns of
                    Morocco. There is also a copious supply of antimony, an article in extensive
                    demand throughout the surrounding countries as a cosmetic for tinging the
                    eyebrows; and sulphur occurs abundantly in the south-eastern tract. The
                    inhabitants are composed of the ancient race of the Berbers or Berebbers, who
                    have always maintained a sort of savage independence.</p>
