                    •surface. A systematic classification in geography is as necessary to enable us
                    to form clear and comprehensive views of its objects, as it is in botany,
                    mineralogy, geo- !°gy&gt; or any other department of physical science, though
                    incapable of being brought to the same degree of perfection. The rapid progress
                    made, during the last fifty years of the past century, in the discovery of those
                    almost innumerable islands that are scattered over the three great oceans, the
                    Indian, the Southern, and the Pacific, peopled by various races of human beings,
                    differing in their features, manners, dispositions, and language, forcibly
                    demanded some such systematic arrangement, otherwise, as the</p>
                <p>President de Brosses has observed, “the sight would be dazzled and confounded, if
                    care were not exerted to relieve it, and fix its attention by divisions marked
                    from distance to distance.”</p>
                <p>It was this learned and very intelligent writer who first suggested that all the
                    lands and islands in the Austral world should be divided into three portions,
                    corresponding with the three great oceans, the Indian or Ethiopic, the Atlantic,
                    and the Pacific; those in the Indian Ocean and to the south of Asia to be named
                    <hi rend="italic">Australasia;</hi> those in the two Pacifies, from the
                    multitude of islands, <hi rend="italic">Polynesia</hi> (a name first used, we

                    unnecessary, as soon as it was ascertained that the <hi rend="italic">Terra
                    Australis incognita</hi> had no existence. Some idea may be formed of the rapid
                    progress made in maritime geography, even within the last fifty years, and of
                    its imperfection previous to that period, when it is stated, that, in the year
                    1770, an enlightened and industrious ŉydrographer, the late Alexander Dalrymple,
                    asserted that the <hi rend="italic">great southern continent</hi> was not then a
                    matter of <hi rend="italic">discovery·,</hi> for that it had been seen on the
                    west by Tasman in 1642, and on the east by Juan Fernandez above half a century
                    before; adding, without any doubt or hesitation, that “the countries
                    intermediate, equal in extent to all the civilized part of Asia, from Turkey to
                    China inclusive, still remain unexplored.” Nay, more, “that it extended from 30°
                    south to the pole, and that the number of its inhabitants was probably more than
                    fifty millions.” All these facts he discovers in the Spanish and Portuguese
                    voyages in the South Pacific Ocean. <hi rend="italic">(Historical
                    Collections.)</hi></p>
                <p>The two divisions of Australasia and Polynesia will be found to comprehend, with
                    sufficient convenience, all those islands that cannot with propriety be referred
                    to any of the four continents of the globe. Nor is there any difficulty in
                    drawing a line of separation between these two divisions; though it is not quite
                    so easy to mark the distinct boundary between the Australasian and the Asiatic
                    islands, where they melt into each other, about the equator, at the north-west
                    extremity of Papua or New Guinea. In a geographical view, the small islands of
                    Waygiou, Salwatty, Batanta, Mysol, and Timorlaut, ought strictly to belong to
                    Australasia; but, peopled as they are by Asiatics of the Malay tribe, and under
                    the influence of the Dutch settlements, it may perhaps be more proper, in a
                    moral and political point of view, to consider them as belonging to the Asiatic
                    islands; more particularly as we shall then have all the Australasian
                    population, with very few exceptions, marked with more or less of the African or
                    Negro character. But, in fact, all geographical divisions arc and must be to a
                    certain degree arbitrary.</p>
                <p>If, then, we take the equator as the northern boundary from the 132° to the 175°
                    of cast longitude; continue a line on the latter meridian to the 55th parallel
                    (bending a little to take in New Zealand) for the eastern; another line along
                    the same parallel to the 65th degree of east longitude for the southern; and a
                    slanting line to the point on the equator from which we set out, so as to
                    include Kerguelen’s Land, and pass on the eastern sides of Timorlaut, Ceram,
                    Mysol, and Salwatty, for the western boundary; those lines will circumscribe the
                    whole of the Australasian islands. We have included the uninhabited islands of
                    Kerguelen and St Paul and Amsterdam, because they cannot properly be considered
                    as African islands, though arranged, we believe, under that division by
                    Pinkerton: they are of less importance to geography than to geology.</p>
                <p>Australasia, then, may be subdivided into the following groups and islands :—</p>
                <p>1. Notasia, or New Holland.</p>
                <p>2. Van Diemen’s Land.</p>
                <p>3. Papua, or New Guinea.</p>
                <p>4. New Britain, New Ireland, and neighbouring islands.</p>
                <p>5. Solomon’s Islands.</p>
                <p>6. New Hebrides.</p>
                <p>7. New Caledonia.</p>
                <p>8. New Zealand, and Isles to the southward.</p>
                <p>9. Kerguelen’s Islands, or Islands of Desolation.</p>
                <p>10. St Paul and Amsterdam.</p>
                <p>11. Numerous reefs and islets of coral scattered over the Australasian Sea.</p>
                <p>I. The first attempt to explore this island, which, from its size, may be
                    considered as the fifth continent of the earth, is unquestionably due to the
                    Dutch; for although some part of the northern coast may have been seen by the
                    early navigators of Spain and Portugal, there is no direct testimony in favour
                    of such a discovery. There are two charts in the British Museum which belonged
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Hαrleian Collection</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> one
                    French, without date, which was probably the original; and the other English,
                    apparently a copy: the latter is dedicated to the king of England, and bears
                    date 1542. In both of these charts is marked down an extensive tract of country
                    to the southward of the Moluccas, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Great
                    Java,</hi> agreeing more nearly with the position and extent of New Holland than
                    any other, land. The form given to the north-west part of the coast in these
                    charts approaches nearest to the truth; a part, indeed, which may have been seen
                    by those early navigators who visited the Moluccas long before the date of the
                    English chart. It is a singular coincidence in geographical nomenclature, that,
                    on the east coast of the French chart, something like a <hi rend="italic">Botany
                    Bay</hi> should be designated under the name of <hi rend="italic">Coste</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Herbaiges.</hi> The Abbé Prevost, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire Générale</hi><hi rend="italic">des Voyages,</hi> and the President de
                    Brosses, in his <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Navigations</hi><hi rend="italic">aux Terres Australes,</hi> are not very happy
                    in advancing a claim in favour of Paulovier de Gonneville, a French captain, to
                    the discovery of this <hi rend="italic">Terra Australis</hi> in 1504. It was the
                    coast of Madagascar upon which Gonneville was driven, as is evident by their own
                    accounts.</p>
                <p>The best and most authentic abstract of the Dutch discoveries on the coasts of
                    New Holland is contained in the instructions given by the governor-general of
                    Batavia to Commodore Abel Janzen Tasman, and published by Mr Dalrymple in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Collection concerning Papua.</hi> From this document it
                    appears that the Dutch government of Bantam in 1605 dispatched the Duyfhen yacht
                    to explore the islands of New Guinea. Returning to the southward along the
                    islands on the northern side of Torres Strait, she came to that part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Great South Land</hi> which is now called Cape York; but all these
                    lands were then thought to be connected, and to form the southern coast of New
                    Guinea. “Thus,” says Captain Flinders, “without being conscious of it, the
                    commander of the Duyfhen made the first authenticated discovery of any part of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Great South Land,</hi> about the month of March 1606.”
                    About the same place, and in the same year, Torres, a Spanish navigator, being
                    second in command to Fernandez de Quiros, saw the <hi rend="italic">Terra
                    Australis,</hi> but had as little knowledge of the nature of his discovery as
                    the commander of the Duyfhen. He passed the strait, however, which divides this
                    <hi rend="italic">Terra Australis</hi> from New Guinea, whose existence was not
                    generally known till 1770, when it was re-discovered and passed by our great
                    circumnavigator Captain Cook. Of this, and his other discoveries, Torres
                    addressed an account to the king of Spain, and, as it afterwards appeared, had
                    taken the precaution to lodge a copy of it in the archives of Manilla; for, when
                    that city was surrendered to the British forces in 1762, Mr Dalrymple snatched
                    from oblivion this interesting document of early discovery, and, as a just
                    tribute to the enterprising Spanish navigator, he gave to this passage the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">Torres Strait,</hi> by which it is now universally
                    known.</p>
                <p>In 1617 the Dutch sent a second expedition, but “with little success the journals
                    of which were lost. In 1623, the yachts Pera and Arnheim were dispatched from
                    Amboyna, under the command of Jan Carstens, who, with eight of the Arnheim’s
                    crew, was treacherously murdered by the natives of New Guinea; but the vessels
                    prosecuted the voyage, and discovered the great islands Arnheim and the Spult.
                    The Arnheim returned to Amboyna; the Pera persisted, and ran along the west
                    coast of New <pb break="no" facs="nls:193191980" xml:id="kp-eb0704-1980-0205"
                    />Guinea, as they thought, but in reality New Holland, to Cape Keer-veer or
                    Turn-again, and from thence explored the coast farther southward, as far as 17°,
                    to Staten River.</p>
                <p>1 In this discovery were found everywhere shallow water and barren coasts,
                    islands altogether thinly peopled by divers cruel, poor, and brutal nations; and
                    of very little use to the (Dutch East India) Company.”</p>
                <p>The next expedition sent by the Dutch was from Banda in the year 1636, when
                    Gerrit Tomaz Pool proceeded with the yachts Klein Amsterdam and Wesel, and
                    nearly at the same place, on the coast of New Guinea, met the same fate which
                    had befallen Carstens; but the supercargo, Pieterson, continued the voyage, and
                    discovered the coast of Arnheim, or Van Diemen’s Land, in 11° S., and sailed
                    along the shore 120 miles, but without seeing any inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Abel Jansen Tasman sailed on a second voyage of discovery from Batavia in 1644;
                    but no account of this voyage was ever made public, nor is it known to exist. No
                    chart bearing his name is now known, but there is little doubt that the
                    north-west coast of New Holland was first explored by him; and it is singular
                    enough that Dampier should say he had Tasman’s chart of it. Tasman is also
                    supposed to have sailed round the Gulf of Carpentaria; an opinion which Captain
                    Flinders considers to be strengthened, from the names of Tasman, of the
                    governor-general, and of two of the council, who signed his instructions, being
                    applied to places at the head of the gulf, as well as that of Maria, the
                    governor’s daughter, to whom Tasman is said to have been attached. Tasman had
                    sailed, on a former voyage, from Batavia in 1642, for the Mauritius; whence
                    steering south and, eastward upon discovery, he fell in with land, to which he
                    gave the name of <hi rend="italic">Anthony Van Diemens Land,</hi> in honour of
                    the governor-general, “our master,” he adds, “who sent us out to make
                    discoveries.”</p>
                <p>The last voyage undertaken by the Dutch for the discovery of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Terra Australis</hi> was in 1705, when three Dutch vessels were sent from
                    Timor, “with orders to explore the north coast of New Holland better than it had
                    been done before.” The account, however, given by the President de Brosses is so
                    vague and imperfect that very little satisfactory information is to be obtained
                    from it. It is on the west coast that the Dutch appear to have been most
                    successful. In Tasman’s instructions it is stated, that “in the years 1616,
                    1618, 1619, and 1622, the west coast of this great <hi rend="italic"
                    >unknown</hi> southland, from 35° to 22° south latitude, was discovered by
                    outward-bound ships, and among them, by the ship <hi rend="italic">Endragt?</hi>
                    Dirk Hartog commanded this ship, and seems to have made the coast in latitude
                    about 26° 30' S., and to have sailed northward along it to about 23°, giving the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Landt van Endragt</hi> to the coast so discovered; and
                    that of Dirk Hartog’s Road (called afterwards <hi rend="italic">Shark’s Bay</hi>
                    by Dampier) to an inlet on the coast a little to the southward of 25°. A plate
                    of tin was found in 1697, and again seen by Baudin in 1801, on one of the
                    islands which forms the roadstead, bearing an inscription that the ship Endragt
                    of Amsterdam arrived there on the 25th October 1616. After this several
                    outward-bound ships fell in by accident with different parts of this coast.</p>
                <p>The.Dutch made little progress in any other part of the extensive coasts of New
                    Holland. The instructions to 1asman say, “In the year 1627 the south coast of
                    the ŋreat South Land was accidentally discovered by the ship the Guldee Zeepard,
                    outward bound from Fatherland for the space of 1000 miles.” From the
                    circumstance of this s up having on board Pieter Nuyts, who was sent from
                    Batavia as ambassador to Japan, and afterwards appointed governor of Formosa,
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">Nuyts Land</hi> was given to this long range of
                    coast.</p>
                <p>The first English navigator who appears to have seen any part of New Holland is
                    the celebrated William Dampier, who, in his buccaneering voyage round the world,
                    in January 1686, touched at the north-west coast, for the purposes of careening
                    his vessel and procuring refreshments. He made the land in latitude 16° 15', and
                    ran along the shore to the north-east till he came to a bay or opening fit for
                    the purpose. In 1699 Dampier a second time visited the north-western coast of
                    this <hi rend="italic">Terra Australis,</hi> being now legitimately employed in
                    making discovery in his Majesty’s ship the Roebuck. Of this part of the coast
                    little more is yet known than what has been described by Dampier,'and that
                    little is due to the exploration of Captain King.</p>
                <p>It was left for our celebrated navigator Captain Cook to complete the grand
                    outline of the fifth continent of the world. The reign of George III. will ever
                    be distinguished for the liberal principles on which voyages of discovery were
                    undertaken, and their results communicated to the world. The Endeavour was
                    fitted out to observe, at Ta-heité, the transit of Venus over the sun’s disk; on
                    her return, in 1770, Captain, then Lieutenant Cook, explored the whole east
                    coast of the <hi rend="italic">Terra Australis Incognita,</hi> from Cape Howe to
                    Cape York, not minutely entering into the details of every part, which would
                    have been impossible, but laying down a correct general outline. “He reaped,”
                    says Captain Flinders, “the harvest of discovery; but the gleanings of the field
                    remained to be gathered.” In his passage through Endeavour Strait, between Cape
                    York and the Prince of Wales’ Islands, he not only cleared up the doubt which
                    till then existed, of the actual separation of <hi rend="italic">Terra
                    Australis</hi> from <hi rend="italic">New Guinea,</hi> but, by his accurate
                    observations, enabled geographers to assign something like a true place to the
                    former discoveries of the Dutch in these parts. .</p>
                <p>In 1777 Captain Cook, in the Resolution and Discovery, visited Van Diemen’s Land;
                    but as Captain Furneaux, in his Majesty’s ship Adventure, had preceded him four
                    years, and Tasman and Marion had examined the coast, little was here supposed to
                    remain for discovery, except in detail. It was long subsequent to Furneaux’s
                    visit that Van Diemen’s Land was ascertained to be an island; a discovery which
                    may have been retarded by that officer having given an opinion “that there is no
                    strait between New Holland and Van Diemen’s Land, but a very deep bay.” The
                    existence of such a strait was however suspected; but the various attempts to
                    ascertain it, without success, by different navigators from both sides of the
                    coast, seemed to have decided the question in the negative, when Mr Bass,
                    surgeon of the Reliance, having observed, as he ran down the east coast in an
                    open whale boat, that a heavy swell rolled in from the westward, was satisfied
                    in his own mind that such a swell could proceed only from the great Southern
                    Ocean. To ascertain whether this was the fact, was a point of great importance
                    to the new colony on the eastern coast; and for this purpose Mr Flinders,
                    together with Mr Bass, was sent on this service in a small decked boat. At the
                    end of three months they returned to Port Jackson, with an interesting account
                    of the survey of the coasts of Van Diemen’s Land, which they had completely
                    circumnavigated, and thus confirmed the conjecture of Mr Bass, whose name the
                    strait deservedly bears.</p>
                <p>The French are entitled to the honour of some partial discoveries on <hi
                    rend="italic">Terra Australis.</hi> Captain Marion was dispatched in the year
                    1772 from the Isle of France with two ships, the Mascarin and Marquis de
                    Castries, on a voyage of discovery, one of the objects of which was that of the
                    supposed southern continent. He touched at Van Diemen’s Land, quarrelled with
                    the natives, and finding no fresh water, and the weather being stormy, he set
                    sail for <pb break="no" facs="nls:193191993" xml:id="kp-eb0704-1993-0206"/>• New
                    Zealand, having added very little to the prior discoveries of Tasman.</p>
                <p>In the year 1792, Rear-Admiral D’Entrecasteaux, having been sent outwith two
                    ships, La Recherche and L’Esperance, in search of the unfortunate La Perouse,
                    made the south coast of New Holland, which he explored as far as the Termination
                    Island of Vancouver; the deficiencies of whose chart he was able to supply, by
                    the state of the weather permitting him to keep the coast closer on board than
                    the English navigator had been able to do. Termination Island was found to be
                    the first of a large group laid down by Nuyts, whose accuracy is praised by the
                    admiral, he having" found “the latitude of Point Lecuwin and of the coast of
                    Nuyt’s Land laid down with an exactness surprising for the remote period in
                    which they had been discovered.” This liberal acknowledgment did not, however,
                    prevent him from giving to the group of islands, which he only saw, but did not
                    survey, the name of <hi rend="italic">Archipel</hi><hi rend="italic">dc
                    la</hi><hi rend="italic">Recherche.</hi> But the most important discovery of
                    D’Entrecasteaux was an inlet on the south coast of Van Diemen’s Land, which was
                    found to be the entrance into a fine navigable channel, running more than thirty
                    miles to the northward, and there communicating with Storm Bay; containing a
                    series of excellent harbours, or rather one continued harbour the whole way,
                    from beginning to end. “The charts,” says Captain Flinders, “of the bays, ports,
                    and arms of the sea, at the south-east end of Van Diemen’s Land, constructed, in
                    this expedition, by Messieurs Beau-temps, Beaupre, and assistants, appear to
                    combine scientific accuracy and minuteness of detail with an uncommon degree of
                    neatness in the execution. They contain some of the finest specimens of marine
                    surveying, perhaps, ever made in a new country.”</p>
                <p>In 1800 Captain Baudin was sent out with two armed vessels, Le Géographe and Le
                    Naturaliste, on a voyage of discovery nominally <hi rend="italic">round the
                    world,</hi> but actually, as appears from his instructions, to examine every
                    part of the coasts of New Holland and Van Diemen’s Land. The first volume of the
                    account of this voyage was published by Μ. Péron, one of the naturalists, in
                    1807; the second never appeared. All the old names of the capes, bays, inlets,
                    and islands, were unblushingly changed to those of Napoleon, his family, his
                    marshals, and members of the Institute; and to 900 leagues of the southern
                    coast, comprehending all the discoveries of Nuyts, Vancouver, D’Entrecasteaux,
                    Flinders, Bass, and Grant, was given the general name of <hi rend="italic">Terre
                    Napoleon,</hi> while not 50 leagues of real discovery were effected which had
                    not been anticipated by Captain Flinders, who, after losing his ship, and
                    proceeding homewards, was scandalously detained as a prisoner in the Isle of
                    France, “to give time for the previous publication of the voyage of Μ. Baudin,
                    to prepossess the world that it was to the French nation only the complete
                    discovery and examination of the south coast of Australia was due.”</p>
                <p>Captain Flinders, however, ultimately triumphed. After an unjust and cruel
                    captivity of seven years, he arrived in England in 1810, and in 1814 published
                    his discoveries in two volumes, accompanied with an atlas of charts, which may
                    be held forth as models in maritime surveying. At this time not a single chart
                    of coast, bay, or island, of Captain Baudin s discoveries had appeared, though
                    shortly afterwards an atlas was published by Freycinet, the first lieutenant,
                    differing in their form and structure very little from those of Captain
                    blinders, but bearing the names recorded in Μ. Peron s first volume. The
                    frontispiece to this atlas affords an instance of that almost impious adulation
                    which Buonaparte was in the habit of receiving from his creatures. An <hi
                    rend="italic">eye,</hi> having an N within it, darts its rays through a dark
                    cloud overshadowing a globe with the southern pole uppermost, on which is drawn
                    the outline of New Holland, with this inscription, “<hi rend="italic"
                    >Fulget</hi><hi rend="italic">et ipso?</hi></p>
                <p>It is to Captain Flinders that we owe the completion in detail of the survey of
                    the coasts of New Holland, with the exception of the west and north-west coasts,
                    which he was prevented from accomplishing by the loss of his ship. Dampier had
                    said, in anchoring near the south end of De Witt’s Land, behind Rosemary Island,
                    which was one of an extensive cluster, “by the tides I met with a while
                    afterwards, I had a strong suspicion that there might be a kind of archipelago
                    of islands, and a passage possibly to the south of New Holland and New Guinea,
                    into the Great South Sea eastward ;” but whether it might be a channel or
                    strait, or the mouth of a large river, he seems not to have made up his mind.
                    Vlaming saw an opening 12 miles wide near the same place, and could find no
                    anchorage. It has now been ascertained that there is no outlet into the great
                    Ocean eastward, nor into the Gulf of Carpentaria, nor into Bass Strait; but the
                    geographical problem yet remains to be solved, whether the opening in the coast
                    behind Rosemary Island be not the mouth of a large river. Le Géographe and Le
                    Naturaliste, under Baudin, stood along this coast, examined in a very slovenly
                    manner some particular points, but assisted geography less than they perplexed
                    it, by unwarrantably changing every old name for that of some of the upstarts
                    created by the French revolution. Never, indeed, were two naval officers so ill
                    selected for the purpose of discovery as Captains Baudin and Hamelin; but not so
                    those in the scientific department, who, under every unfavourable and
                    discouraging circumstance, effected more for physical science than could be
                    expected. Except those parts therefore that were examined by Captain King, a
                    great portion of the northern part of this coast may still be considered as <hi
                    rend="italic">terra incognita</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and it is somewhat
                    remarkable, that the local government of New South Wales, which, we believe, has
                    under its command several colonial vessels, should not before this have taken
                    occasion to ascertain this point, on which so many curious and unexplained
                    phenomena in the geography and geology of the fifth continent depend. We are
                    now, however, in a fair way of having our knowledge of the western side of New
                    Holland considerably enlarged by the establishment of the new colony of Swan
                    River, under the auspices of Captain Stirling of the navy; which, though not
                    well adapted for an agricultural, there is every reason to believe, will turn
                    out a prosperous pastoral settlement. Towards the end of 1830 the number of
                    settlers amounted to not less than 2000 persons, with 3000 head of sheep, 500
                    head of horned cattle, and above 100 horses. The country is sandy and of light
                    soil; but the herbage is nutritive, and the cattle thrive well upon it. The
                    climate is excellent, and water is abundant and good. A bar across the mouth of
                    the river prevents ships from entering Melville Water, whichis extensive,and of
                    sufficient depth forafirst-rate man of war; but a little to the southward of it
                    there is safe and extensive anchorage in Cockburn Sound. Along the coast whales
                    are most abundant, and a fishery has already commenced. A succession of three
                    ranges of hills, the first at thirty miles distance from the coast, has not
                    prevented discoveries to the eastward of them. In the valleys among these hills
                    is abundance of wood and pasturage, and beyond the third range has been
                    discovered a river of considerable magnitude, running to the northward through a
                    rich valley. This river will probably be found to terminate in Shark’s Bay.</p>
                <p>A discovery has also been made of a bay to the eastward of Cape Lecuwin, into
                    which a river called Blackwood falls; and to the eastward of this is another
                    inlet or estuary, into which several rivers fall; and farther to the eastward
                    still is the station of King George’s Sound, with <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193192006" xml:id="kp-eb0704-2006-0207"/>,its two harbours. All these
                    are comprehended within, and connected with, the Swan River Settlement. Its
                    position is highly favourable for a speedy communication with India and the
                    Indian Islands, the Cape of Good Hope, and the Mauritius, and it bids fair to
                    become a flourishing and important settlement. It is a remarkable fact, that in
                    a period not far short of thirty years since the settlement of Port Jackson was
                    first made, all beyond as many leagues was a complete <hi rend="italic">terra
                    incognita</hi> to the settlers, till not long ago, when Mr Evans, the
                    land-surveyor, penetrated behind the hitherto impassable barrier, the Blue
                    Mountains, to the distance of about 300 miles, in two separate journeys.</p>
                <p>Of these journeys it may be necessary to give a brief abstract. Ón the 19th
                    November 1813 Mr Evans left Emu Island in the Nepean, and returned on the 8th
                    January 1814, having performed a journey of 154 miles nearly west. At the end of
                    48 miles he had cleared the ranges of mountains, which, he says, consist of
                    granite, with loose flints and quartz pebbles strewed on the surface; and here,
                    for the first time, he fell in with a small stream running to the westward. The
                    farther he advanced the more beautiful the country became; both hill and dale
                    were clothed with fine grass, the whole appearing at a little distance as if
                    laid out into fields divided by hedgerows. Through every valley meandered
                    trickling streams of fine water, afl falling down towards the Fish River, so
                    called by him from the vast abundance of fine fish resembling trout, which his
                    party caught with ease whenever they had occasion for them. Many of the hills
                    were capped with forest trees, chiefly of the Eucalyptus; and clumps of these,
                    mixed with Mimosas and the Casuarina, were interspersed along the feet of the
                    hills and in the valleys, so as to wear the appearance of <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> succession of gentlemen’s parks. The river, which at first consisted of
                    a chain of pools connected by small streamlets, had assumed in the neighbourhood
                    of Macquarrie’s Plains the character of a considerable stream, and had become
                    unfordable, which made it necessary to construct a bridge of large trees to
                    transport the people, the horses, and baggage. Evans says, the country was now
                    more beautiful than he had ever seen. A fine river, running in a deep channel
                    over a gravelly bottom, and its banks skirted with trees, excepting at the
                    sloping points of hills round which it winded, and which were covered with a
                    fine green sod down to the margin, intermixed with the white daisy; —all this,
                    added to the temperate climate, put him in mind of England. Farther on, and
                    before they reached Bathurst’s Plains, the river was increased considerably in
                    size, by the junction of another stream, which he called Campbell’s River; and
                    to the united streams he gave the name or Macquarrie’s River, the general
                    direction of which appeared to be to the northward of west. Fish continued to
                    abound of the same kind as those first caught, but of a size from eleven to
                    fifteen pounds each. Governor Macquarrie says, these fish resemble perch, are
                    not unlike that usually called rock-cod, and have been caught from seventeen to
                    twenty-five pounds weight each. Large herds of emus were seen crossing the
                    plains, and kangaroos in great abundance; but not a native human being appeared
                    until on his return, when, near Bathurst’s Plains, two women and four children
                    were come upon by surprise, and became so terrified that they fell down with
                    fright. It was observed that both the, women had lost the right eye. Evans makes
                    Bathurst s Plains near 150 miles from Emu Island; but Governor Macquarric, who
                    subsequently visited this place, states the measured distance from Sydney town
                    to be only 140 miles. It is represented as an eligible situation for
                    establishing a settlement, as the land is excellent; plenty of stone and timber
                    for building, but no limestone; abundance of water, though the river, at the
                    time of the governor’s visit, just at the close of an unusually dry season, was
                    reduced to a chain of pools, the intermediate channels being dried up.</p>
                <p>In May 1815 Mr Evans was dispatched a second time, in order to follow the course
                    of Macquarrie’s River. He proceeded about 115 miles, from whence he could see
                    across an extensive plain, 40 or 50 miles, at the extremity of which was a range
                    of blue mountains, separated by an opening in the north-west, through which, he
                    had no doubt, the river flowed; and he appears to have had as little doubt that
                    it crosses the continent, and falls into the sea somewhere in De Witt’s Land,
                    probably through Dampier’s Opening, behind Rosemary Island. A recent discovery
                    has proved that this opinion is not well founded. In January 1831 an expedition
                    undertaken by Captain Sturt has pretty nearly determined this point. With a view
                    to determine the course of the Murrambidgee River, or the outlet of its waters,
                    this enterprising officer started a second time; and the result has been that,
                    instead of the Macquarrie and the Lachlan, and other streams that run to the
                    westward, falling into a great inland sea or extensive marsh, as was
                    conjectured, their united waters constitute a large river, which, under the name
                    of Murray, was found to turn to the southward, and empty itself into an
                    extensive estuary, 60 miles in length by 30 or 40 in width. The river near the
                    point where it fell into this lake or estuary was about 400 yards wide and 20
                    feet deep. The whole country on both banks was composed of undulating and
                    picturesque hills, at the bases of which extended plains and valleys, within
                    sight of many thousand acres of the richest soils.</p>
                <p>The mouth through which the waters of the estuary communicated with the sea was
                    in Encounter Bay, in long. 139.40. E. and lat. 35. 25. 15. S., a little to the
                    eastward of the Gulf of St Vincent, and round the point named Cape Jervis. The
                    river was well stocked with fish, and its banks more populous than any other
                    part of the country that had been traversed. Some accounts state the total
                    number seen to have amounted to not less than 4000 souls. They could scarcely be
                    brought to believe that the discovering party were of the same genus as
                    themselves; they placed their hands against those of the strangers, in order to
                    ascertain if the number of fingers on each corresponded. Nothing surprised them
                    more than the act of taking off the hat, believing, it would seem, that this
                    superstructure of <hi rend="italic">felt</hi> formed a part of the strange
                    animal that had come into their country.</p>
                <p>That part of the country which was passed over by Evans and Oxley was but thinly
                    peopled. The natives who were seen resembled, in their persons and features,
                    those of Sydney, but spoke a different language; and they were better clothed,
                    being well covered with kangaroo skins, sewed neatly together with the sinews of
                    emus. They wore the fur side next the skin, and the outer or flesh side was very
                    ingeniously marked with regular ornamental devices, among which the <hi
                    rend="italic">cross</hi> appeared to predominate. They were exceedingly
                    terrified at the sight of Mr Evans on his horse, as they took the rider and
                    horse to be one animal, and did not recover from their fright or surprise on
                    seeing him dismount. When a little tranquillized, and more familiar, they were
                    found to be a good-humoured, laughing people, exhibiting none of the savage and
                    furious spirit of the natives of Sydney, excited no doubt by the settlers. They
                    were attended with dogs not unlike the jackal, with which they catch kangaroos.
                    The spears they carried were heavy and clumsily made, and they could only throw
                    them to a short distance, something like the New Zealanders.</p>
                <p>The country beyond Bathurst was even superior to that <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193192019" xml:id="kp-eb0704-2019-0208"/>first explored. The vast
                    herds of emus and kangaroos were truly astonishing. These animals, and the fish
                    of the river, appeared to be the principal articles of subsistence for the
                    natives. In one large plain, covered with kangaroos and emus, Evans discovered
                    an immense quantity of a white substance, resembling comfits or sugarplums,
                    which he took to be manna, but which appears to be a pure saccharine substance,
                    an exudation probably from some particular plant. He passed whole mountains of
                    fine blue limestone, and picked up topazes, crystals, and other pebbles, such as
                    are met with on the coast of Bass’s Strait. He also mentions forests of pines,
                    the trees forty feet in height without a branch. Governor Macquarrie, however,
                    observed, that as the soil and grass-lands improved, the timber trees decreased
                    in size. (See the different works of Dalrymple, Burney, Cook, D'Entrecasteaux,
                    and Flinders.)</p>
                <p>If, however, but little is yet known of the interior of New Holland, and the
                    detail of the western coast still requires to be filled up, the grand outline of
                    this large island, or more properly continent, has been completed, and its
                    limits correctly ascertained. It extends in latitude from Cape York, in 10° 45'
                    south, to Wilson’s promontory, in 39° 9' south; and in longitude from Dirk
                    Hartog’s Island, in Shark’s Bay, in 113° east, to Point Look-out, in Glasshouse
                    Bay, in 153° 35' east; the mean breadth from north to south being about 1200,
                    and length from east to west 2100 geographical miles, making an area equal to
                    about three fourths of the continent of Europe. A remarkable sameness in all the
                    productions of the three kingdoms of nature prevails in every part of its
                    extensive coasts, and as remarkable a difference in two of them (the animal and
                    vegetable) from those of the rest of the world.</p>
                <p>The natives, wherever they have been met with, are of the very lowest description
                    of human beings. In the journal of the Duyfhen, the north coast is described as
                    thinly “inhabited by wild, cruel, black savages, by whom some of the crew were
                    murdered and the ship Vianen, touching on the western coast about 21° south,
                    observed “a foul and barren shore, green fields, and very wild, black, barbarous
                    inhabitants.” In 24° south, Polsert, who commanded the Batavia, saw four
                    natives, whom he describes as “wild, black, and altogether naked, not covering
                    even those parts which almost all savages conceal.” Tasman “found in <hi
                    rend="italic">Hollandia Nova,</hi> in lat. 17° 12' south, a naked black people,
                    with curly hair, malicious and cruel, using for arms bows and arrows, hazagaeys,
                    and kalawaeys.” Dampier describes them as being “a naked black people, with
                    curly hair, having a piece of the rind of a tree tied like a girdle about their
                    waists, and a handful of long grass, or three or four green boughs full of
                    leaves, thrust under their girdle to cover their nakedness that “the two
                    foreteeth of the upper jaw are wanting in all of them, men and women, old and
                    young; neither have they any beards.” And he remarks, “they have no boats,
                    canoes, or barklogs.” The south coast is so barren, and the naked hillocks of
                    sand so continuous, that there appears to be nothing for human inhabitants to
                    subsist upon. “It is not surprising,” says D’Entrecasteaux, “that Nuyts has
                    given no details of this barren coast; for its aspect is so uniform, that the
                    most fruitful imagination could find nothing to say of it.” None of our
                    navigators, however, saw more than the coast line, which is either of rock or
                    hillocks of sand. But where the country begins to improve towards the eastward,
                    in the neighbourhood of Kangaroo Island, Captain Flinders found not the least
                    vestige of inhabitants; and, from the stupidity of the kangaroos on that island,
                    “which,” he observes, “not unfrequently appeared to consider us as seals,” he
                    concludes there either are no natives, or that they are ignorant of every kind
                    of embarkation. Towards the norths ern part of the eastern coast, the same
                    navigator thinks they are somewhat superior to those near Sydney, having belts
                    round the waist, and fillets about the head and upper part of the arm,
                    associating in greater numbers, and dwelling in huts of a superior construction.
                    They also catch fish with nets, which he thinks is alone a feature of
                    distinction from those who only spear the fish, as a net requires more than one
                    person to manage it, consumes much time in making, cannot easily be dragged
                    about, and, in short, must occasion a sense of the advantage to be derived from
                    mutual assistance, and suggest the necessity of a permanent residence. The
                    native of the colony of Sydney we know pretty well to be a gloomy, solitary,
                    unsettled being; seldom appearing, even in the town, without his spear, his
                    throwing-stick, or his club. “His spear,” says Colonel Collins, “is his defence
                    against enemies. It is the weapon he uses to punish aggression and revenge
                    insult. It is even the instrument with which he corrects his wife in the last
                    extreme; for, in their passion, or perhaps offener in a fit of jealousy, they
                    scruple not to inflict death. It is the plaything of children, and in the hands
                    of persons of all ages.” Turnbull says, the natives of this part of New Holland
                    are, beyond comparison, the most barbarous on the surface of the globe, and that
                    the influence of European settlers has had no effect in rendering them more
                    sensible of the benefits of civilization; that every day men and women are to be
                    seen in the streets of Sydney and Paramatta naked as in the moment of their
                    birth; yet he contends that they are far from being stupid; that they are the
                    greatest mimics alive; and that the oddities, dress, walk, gait, and looks of
                    all the Europeans of any rank, from the time of Governor Philip downwards, are
                    so exactly imitated, as to form among them a kind of historic register of their
                    several actions and characters; and they are great proficients in the slang
                    language of the convicts. But this seems to be the sum total of all their
                    acquisitions from European intercourse. In other respects they remain, generally
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> speaking, the same untutored, unprotected,
                    improvident, and comfortless savages we first found them. But why is this?
                    Because no pains have been bestowed on their improvement; no kindness shown them
                    to encourage that improvement. In the district under the command of Sir Edward
                    Parry, the natives have been treated like human beings, are sensible of the
                    advantages of civilization, and several of them have made considerable progress
                    in reading and writing, attend the religious duties which the captain and his
                    lady have regularly performed, and they vie with each other in being neat in
                    their persons and clothing. They are described, however, as hideously ugly, with
                    flat noses, wide nostrils, eyes sunk in the head, overshadowed with thick, black
                    eyebrows; the mouth extravagantly wide, lips thick and prominent, hair black and
                    clotted, but not woolly, the colour of the skin varying from dark bronze to jet
                    black. Their stature is below the middle size. They are remarkably thin and ill
                    made, their limbs small, and almost without any appearance of muscle. They live
                    chiefly on fish, which they sometimes spear and sometimes net, the women on
                    parts of the coast aiding to catch them with the hook and line. If a dead whale
                    happens to be cast on shore, numbers flock to it from every part of the coast,
                    just as the vultures smell out a dead carcass, and they feast sumptuously while
                    any part of it remains. Those in the interior are stated to live on grubs, ants
                    and their <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> gg <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> &gt;
                    kangaroos when they can catch them, fern roots, various kinds of berries, and
                    honey. These sylvan satyrs are described as having long and lean legs and arms,
                    owing, as is supposed, to their climbing of trees, which they ascend by notches
                    cut into them by stone hatchets, in which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192032"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-2032-0209"/>the great toe is placed, and by these means they
                    ascend trees that are seventy or eighty feet in height.</p>
                <p>To add to their natural deformity, they thrust a bone through the cartilage of
                    the nose, and stick with gum to their hair, matted with moss, the teeth of men,
                    sharks, or kangaroos, the tails of dogs, jaw-bones of fish, &amp;c. and daub
                    their faces and bodies with red and white clay, and scarify the skin in every
                    part with sharp shells. The women and female children are generally found to
                    want the first two joints of the little finger of the left hand; and the reason
                    they assign is, that they would otherwise be in the way of winding the
                    fishing-lines over the hand.</p>
                <p>They have no fixed habitations, the climate generally allowing of their sleeping
                    in the open air, in the crevices of rocks, or under the shelter of the bushes.
                    Their temporary hovels consist of the bark of a tree, each hovel being just
                    large enough to receive a single person; but to the northward, on the east
                    coast, some were discovered a little larger, so that a family might, on an
                    emergency, squeeze under one of them; they are, however, without furniture or
                    conveniences of any description. They seem to have no idea of the benefits
                    arising from social life; their largest clans extend not beyond the family
                    circle, of each of which the eldest is called by a name synonymous with that of
                    <hi rend="italic">father.</hi> They are totally without religion, paying neither
                    the least respect nor adoration to any object or being, real or imaginary. Hence
                    they have nothing to prompt them to a good action, nothing to deter them from a
                    bad one; hence murder is not considered as any heinous crime, and women think
                    nothing of destroying, by compression, the infant in the womb, to avoid the
                    trouble, if brought alive into the world, of carrying it about and finding it
                    subsistence. Should a woman die with an infant at the breast, the living child
                    is inhumanly thrown into the same hole with the mother, and covered with stones,
                    of which the brutal father throws the first. They are savage even in love, the
                    very first act of courtship, on the part of the husband, being that of knocking
                    down his intended bride with a club, and dragging her away from her friends,
                    bleeding and senseless, to the woods. The consequence is, that scarcely a female
                    of the age of maturity is to be seen without her head full of scars, the
                    unequivocal marks of her husband’s affection. The nearest relations are also
                    perpetually destroying each other, either by stratagem or open combat; for,
                    savage as they are, they have a singular custom of expiating an offence, even
                    murder, by the criminal exposing himself to as many of the injured family as may
                    choose to stand forth and hurl their spears at him. From the moment that he is
                    so dreadfully mangled that he can stand no longer, or has the good fortune to
                    parry all their shafts, a reconcilement takes place, and friendship is restored.
                    If the criminal refuses to stand this trial, he and all his family are
                    considered as fair game to attack and murder wherever they are met with. The
                    English used to attend these unequal combats, and thus gave countenance to a
                    savage practice, which not unfrequently ended in the death of the person who was
                    thus put on his defence. (See Collins, Flinders, Turnbull, &amp; <hi
                    rend="subscript"> c</hi>.)</p>
                <p>If no very essential difference be perceptible in the moral and physical
                    qualities of the man of New Holland and the rest of the species, except that
                    which arises from the different circumstances under which they are placed,—if
                    the rocks and mountains, and the earths, resemble nearly the inorganic
                    substances that are met with m other parts of the world,—there is at least a
                    very extraordinary and a distinct characteristic difference in both the animal
                    and vegetable part of the creation, which makes a considerable class of subjects
                    in both these kingdoms peculiar to New Holland. The quadrupeds hitherto
                    discovered, with very few exceptions, are of the kangaroo or opossum tribe;
                    having their hinder legs long out of all proportion when compared with the
                    length of the fore legs, and a sack under the belly of the female for the
                    reception of the young; of which family, though divided into different genera,
                    there are at least fifty distinct species. They have rats, and dogs of the
                    jackal kind, all exactly alike; and a little animal of the bear tribe, named <hi
                    rend="italic">womat</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and these pretty nearly
                    complete the catalogue of four-footed animals yet known on this fifth continent.
                    There appears, indeed, such an apparent affinity of the natural objects in New
                    South Wales, that Dr White observes, all the quadrupeds are like opossums, all
                    the fish like sharks; and that every part of the land, all the trees, and all
                    the grasses, resemble one another. There is, however, an animal which resembles
                    nothing in the creation but itself,—which, being rejected by naturalists from
                    the classes mammalia, aves, and pisces, must, we suppose, be considered as
                    belonging to the amphibia,— we mean the ornithorhyncus paradoxus, “a quadruped
                    with the beak of a bird, which is contrary to known facts and received
                    opinions.” When the head of one of these beasts was brought to the late Dr Shaw
                    of the British Museum, he suspected it as an idle attempt to impose on his
                    judgment, and did not hastily believe that nature had set the bill of a duck on
                    the head of a quadruped; but so it has since proved to be the case.</p>
                <p>The birds are no less singular than the beasts, there being black swans and white
                    eagles, the former everywhere in such multitudes as to spoil a proverb that had
                    held good for two thousand years; and their song, if we may credit Mr Bass,
                    “exactly resembles the creaking of a rusty sign on a windy day.” The <hi
                    rend="italic">Maenura</hi><hi rend="italic">superba,</hi> with its scalloped
                    tail feathers, is perhaps the most singular and beautiful of that very elegant
                    race of birds known by the name of <hi rend="italic">birds of paradise</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> cockatoos, parrots, and parroquets, are innumerable, and of
                    great variety. The mountain eagle is a magnificent creature; but the emu is
                    perhaps the tallest and loftiest bird that exists, many of them standing full
                    seven feet high.</p>
                <p>The plants are no less singular than the animals. Of these Mr Brown has given a
                    very curious and instructive account in his Geographical and Systematical
                    Remarks, in the Appendix to Flinders’s <hi rend="italic">Voyage.</hi> He
                    collected nearly 3900 species of Australasian plants, which, with those brought
                    to England by Sir Joseph Banks and others, supplied him with the materials for a
                    <hi rend="italic">Flora Terrce Australis,</hi> consisting of 4200 species,
                    referable to 120 natural orders; but he remarks, that more than half the number
                    of species belong to <hi rend="italic">eleven</hi> only of those orders. Of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Eucalyptus</hi> or gum-tree, the largest yet discovered, there
                    are not fewer than 100 different species. “The <hi rend="italic">Eucalyptus
                    globulus</hi> of Labillardière,” says Mr Brown, “and another species, peculiar
                    to the south of Van Diemen’s Land, not unfrequently attain the height of 150
                    feet, with a girth near the base of from 25 to 40 feet.” Of this magnificent
                    genus there are 50 different species within the limits of the colony of Port
                    Jackson. Of the beautiful and elegant <hi rend="italic">Melaleuca</hi> Mr Brown
                    collected upwards of 30 species, all of which, with the exception of the two
                    species <hi rend="italic">Leucodendron</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cajaputi,</hi>
                    appear to be confined to Terra Australis. The tribe of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stachhouseae</hi> is entirely peculiar to that country. Of the natural order of
                    <hi rend="italic">proteaceae,</hi> consisting of about 400 known species, more
                    than 200 are natives of New Holland, of which they form one of its
                    characteristic botanical features; the <hi rend="italic">Eanksia,</hi> in
                    particular, being one of the most striking peculiarities of the vegetable
                    kingdom. The <hi rend="italic">Casuarina, of</hi> which 13 species have been
                    discovered, is another characteristic feature of the woods and thickets of New
                    Holland. The most ex <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192045"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-2045-0210"/>tensive genus, however, is the leafless <hi
                    rend="italic">Acacia,</hi> of which there arc more than 100 species; and this,
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Eucalyptus,</hi> “if taken together,” says Mr Brown,
                    “and considered with respect to the mass of vegetable matter they contain,
                    calculated from the size as well as from the number of individuals, are perhaps
                    nearly equal to all the other plants of that country.” The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ĉasuarina</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Eucalyptus</hi> are represented as
                    furnishing excellent timber for ship-building, and for all the purposes of
                    domestic furniture and agricultural implements; and the gum of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Eucalyptus</hi> is medicinal,—that of one species might be
                    employed as pitch. Freycinct says they procured a resinous substance from the
                    <hi rend="italic">Nanthorrhea,</hi> which served them to caulk their vessels.
                    The bark of a tree on the Hawkesbury is said to be as efficacious in tanning
                    leather as the oak-bark; and a creeping plant <hi rend="italic">(smilax)</hi> is
                    used as a substitute for tea. Nutmegs were found by Flinders on the northern
                    coast, but they were small, and had so little of an aromatic flavour, that Mr
                    Brown gave the plant the specific name of <hi rend="italic">insipida.</hi> Among
                    the curious productions of the vegetable world is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cephalotus</hi><hi rend="italic">follicularis,</hi> or pitcher plant, of which
                    a very correct and detailed drawing is given in the Atlas to Flinders’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Voyage.</hi></p>
                <p>II. Having marked the progressive discovery of this fair and fertile island,
                    until it was ascertained to be such by Tasman, Marion, Furneaux, Cook,
                    D’Entrecasteaux, Bass, and Flinders, we shall not think it necessary to notice
                    the minor discoveries of Bligh, Hunter, Cox, &amp;c. but proceed to give a
                    general outline of its dimensions, surface, and natural productions. It is
                    situated between the parallels of 4L 0. and 43. 32. S. lat., and 144. 32. and
                    148. 25. E. long.; its medial length from north to south being about 160, and
                    breadth from east to west 145 geographical miles. Its surface possesses every
                    variety of mountain, hill, and dale,—of forests and open meadows,— of inland
                    lakes, rivers, and inlets of the sea, forming safe and commodious harbours,—that
                    can render a country valuable or agreeable; and it enjoys a temperate climate,
                    which is perhaps not very different from that of England, though less subject to
                    violent changes. In May, corresponding to our November, Labillardière observed
                    the mountains in the interior covered with snow. The western and southern coasts
                    are bold, steep, and rocky; the latter terminating so abruptly as to appear as
                    if it had been broken off, and the group of islands named De Witt’s Isles, to
                    the southward, twelve in number, formed out of the fragments. Cook found the
                    cliffs on the eastern side composed of sandstone; but the vast buttresses that
                    look towards the southern seas of ice are stated by Flinders to be composed of
                    basaltic columns, appearing like so many stacks of chimneys. Labillardière
                    found, near this southern extremity, a stratum of coal, 3⅛ feet thick and 200
                    fathoms long, resting on sandstone.</p>
                <p>The soil in general is represented as more productive than that of the cast side
                    of New Holland; and the island has the advantage of being intersected by two
                    fine rivers, rising near the centre; the one named the Tamar, falling into
                    Bass’s Strait on the north, and forming Port Dalrymple; the other, the Derwent,
                    which discharges itself into the sea on the south-east extremity, spreading its
                    waters, in the first instance, over the Great Storm Bay, which communicates with
                    North Bay, Norfolk Bay, and Double Bay, on the east, and with D’Entrecasteaux’s
                    Channel on the west. The Tamar in its course receives three streams,—the North
                    Esk, the South Esk, and the Lake river; and the tide flows about 30 miles up the
                    uver, to the point where it is joined by the two Esks. At the head of the
                    western arm of Port Dalrymple is situated York Town, on the skirt of a
                    beautiful, rich, and well-wooded country. There is also a town named Ho-A bart
                    Town, which is now the capital, on the right bank of <hi rend="superscript">
                    s</hi> the Derwent, about five miles inland. The country between these two towns
                    was traversed in 1807 by Mr Grimes, who describes it to be everywhere rich and
                    beautiful, abounding in grassy plains, marshes, and lakes, bounded on each side
                    by hills, well clothed with wood, rising into high and rocky mountains.</p>
                <p>The description given by D’Entrecasteaux of the channel that bears his name, and
                    the surrounding shores, is grand and imposing, and corresponds generally with
                    the following animated account of it from Μ. Péron, ten years afterwards.
                    “Crowded on the surface of the soil are seen on every side those beautiful <hi
                    rend="italic">Mimosas,</hi> those superb <hi rend="italic">Me-trosideros,</hi>
                    those <hi rend="italic">Correas,</hi> unknown till of late to our country, but
                    now become the pride of our shrubberies. From the shores of the ocean to the
                    summits of the highest mountains may be observed the mighty <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eucalyptus,</hi> those giant trees of Australasian forests, many of which
                    measure from 162 to 180 feet in height, and from 25 to 30 and even 36 feet in
                    circumference. <hi rend="italic">Banhsia</hi> of different species, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Protea,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Embothria,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Leptosperma,</hi> form an enchanting belt round the skirts of the
                    forests. Here the <hi rend="italic">Casuarina</hi> exhibits its beautiful form;
                    there the elegant <hi rend="italic">Exocarpus</hi> throws into a hundred
                    different places its negligent branches. Everywhere spring up the most
                    delightful thickets of <hi rend="italic">Melaleuca,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Thesium,</hi><hi rend="italic">Cŏnehyum,</hi><hi rend="italic">Evodia,</hi> all
                    equally interesting, either from their graceful shape, the lovely verdure of
                    their foliage, the singularity of their corollas, or the form of their
                    seed-vessels.” (<hi rend="italic">V(rJ∙</hi><hi rend="italic">aux Terres
                    Australes.)</hi></p>
                <p>All the navigators who have visited the southern part of Van Diemen’s Land
                    describe the natives as a mild, affable, good-humoured, and inoffensive people;
                    with the exception of Marion, the effect of whose fire-arms, Labillardiĕre
                    thinks, had made them afraid of Europeans. Flinders and Bass conceived that the
                    natives of this island were sunk still lower in the scale of human existence
                    than those in the neighbourhood of Port Jackson, though they saw but one man,
                    and he is described as having “a countenance more expressive of benignity and
                    intelligence than of that ferocity or stupidity which generally characterized
                    the other natives.” They are obviously the same people as those of New Holland,
                    and go entirely naked, both men and women; but their language is altogether
                    different. They have the art, too, of striking fire with two flints, which is
                    not known to the other Australasian islanders; and it is also singular that they
                    set no value on iron. The women refused from Cook’s people all presents, and
                    rejected all their addresses, not so much from a sense of virtue, it was
                    supposed, as from the fear of the men, of whom they stood in great awe. In some
                    places were found miserable huts of twigs, and rude baskets, made of a juncus or
                    rush; but these were all the signs that appeared of civilization. Cook,
                    D’Entrecasteaux, and Baudin, all observed many of the largest trees with trunks
                    hollowed out, apparently by means of fire; and as the hollow side invariably
                    faced the east and south-east, the lee-side to the prevailing winds, it was
                    concluded they were intended as habitations. In D’Entrecasteaux s Channel only
                    were indications of huts made of the bark of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eucalyptus,</hi> consisting of three rolls stitched together. (D’Entrecasteaux,
                    Labillardière, Flinders, &amp;c.)</p>
                <p>HI. This great island is, after New Holland, not only the first in point of
                    magnitude, but claims a priority in discovery over that and every other island
                    in the Australasian Sea. In the year 1526, when the Portuguese and the Spaniards
                    were disputing their respective claims to the Spice Islands, Don Jorge de
                    Meneses, of the former <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192058"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-2058-0211"/>nation, had, in his passage from Malacca to the
                    Moluccas, by extraordinary and accidental circumstances, discovered the north
                    coast of Papua, so called, according to some, because the word signifies <hi
                    rend="italic">black,</hi> which was the colour of the natives, or <hi
                    rend="italic">curled hair,</hi> according to others. Meneses remained at a port
                    called Versija till the change of the monsoon, and then returned to the
                    Moluccas. The next navigator who touched at Papua was Alvarez de Saavedra, on
                    his homeward voyage from the Moluccas in 1528, for New Spain; and from an idea
                    that the country abounded in gold, he gave to it the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Isla del Oro.</hi> From the resemblance of the natives to African negroes,
                    being black, with short curly hair, the name was afterwards changed by the
                    Spaniards to New Guinea, and not, as some have supposed, because it was thought
                    that Guinea and Papua were situated under the same parallel of latitude; which,
                    however, they certainly are, though one happens to be north and the other south
                    latitude. He staid a month, and obtained provisions; but some Portuguese
                    deserted with the only boat the ship had, and were left behind. They found their
                    way, however, to Gilolo, and reported that Saavedra had been wrecked; but on his
                    subsequent arrival they were tried, condemned, and executed. He is supposed to
                    have added about 50 leagues of discovery to that of Meneses. In 1529 Saavedra
                    sailed a second time from New Spain, and, according to Galvaom (or Galvano),
                    followed the coast of Papua eastwards above 500 leagues.</p>
                <p>In 1537 Gonzalvo and Alvarado were dispatched on discovery by the viceroy of
                    Peru; but the former being killed in a mutiny, the crew chose another commander;
                    and the first land they made was Papua. The ship was in so crazy a state that
                    she was abandoned; the crew, only seven in number (the rest having died of
                    hunger and fatigue), were made captives, and carried to an island called <hi
                    rend="italic">Crespos</hi> (curly-haired men), whence they were sent to the
                    Moluccas and ransomed.</p>
                <p>In 1545 Ynigo Ortiz de Retż, in his voyage from Tidore to New Spain, came to an
                    archipelago of islands near the land of Papua; sailed 230 leagues along the
                    north coast; and not knowing it had been before visited by Europeans, he called
                    it <hi rend="italic">Nueva Guinea,</hi> from the resemblance of the natives to
                    those of the coast of Guinea.</p>
                <p>In 1606 Torres made the east coast of New Guinea, in his way to the Moluccas,
                    sailed westward 300 leagues, doubled the south-east point, sailed along the
                    southern coast, saw the northern coast of New Holland, and passed the strait
                    which now bears his name. He describes the coast of New Guinea as inhabited by a
                    dark people, naked, except a covering round the middle, of painted cloth made of
                    the bark of a tree. They had arms of clubs and darts ornamented with feathers.
                    He fell in with many large islands, large ports, and large rivers. Towards the
                    northern extremity he met with Mahommedans, who had swords and fire-arms.</p>
                <p>In 1616 Schouten came in sight of a burning mountain on the coast of New Guinea,
                    which he named Vulcan, and immediately after of the coast itself. The island was
                    well inhabited, and abounded with cocoa nuts; but no anchoring ground could be
                    found. The natives were black, with short hair; but others appeared of a more
                    tawny colour, with canoes of a different shape. Among the islands in sight to
                    the northward, four small ones continually smoked. On approaching the mainland,
                    the natives, whom he calls real Papoos, came off, “a wild, strange, and
                    ridiculous people, active as monkeys, having black curled hair, rings in their
                    cars and noses, and necklaces of hogs’ tusks.” They had all some personal
                    defect; one was blind, another had a great leg, a third a swelled arm; which
                    made Schouten conclude that this part of the country was unhealthy, in which he
                    was more confirmed by observing their houses built upon stakes eight or nine
                    feet from the ground. At the two little islands of Moa and Insou, on the
                    north-east coast, the friendly natives supplied them with abundance of cocoa
                    nuts. At 28 leagues from Moa, Schouten fell in with a group of fourteen small
                    islands covered with wood, but apparently uninhabited; but sailing to the
                    northward, they were followed by six large canoes, the people in which were
                    armed with javelins. Those in some canoes from another island were of a tawny
                    complexion, had long curly hair, and appeared, by their persons and language, to
                    be a different race from the natives of Papua: they had rings of coloured glass,
                    yellow beads, and vessels of porcelain, which were regarded as “evidences of
                    their having communication with the East Indies.” Schouten’s Island is the
                    largest of this group. Tasman visited all these islands and the coast of New
                    Guinea in 1643, and obtained vast numbers of cocoa nuts and bananas from the
                    friendly natives of Moa and Insou. Tasman made no discoveries in this part of
                    his voyage.</p>
                <p>Our countryman Dampier saw the coast in 1699, but did not land: the natives came
                    off to his ship, and he speaks in admiration of their large and picturesque <hi
                    rend="italic">proas.</hi> He discovered, however, a strait unknown before, which
                    divides New Guinea from New Britain, and is now called after his name.
                    Bougainville was less fortunate, when, in 1768, he touched on the coast of what
                    he considered a separate island, and to which he gave die name of Louisiade:
                    there is, however, some reason to believe that it is a continuation of New
                    Guinea. D’Entrecasteaux, in 1792, passed along the northern coast of Louisiade,
                    and through Dampier’s Strait, but left the point of its identity with or
                    separation from New Guinea undecided.</p>
                <p>Sonnerat published <hi rend="italic">A Voyage to New Guinea,</hi> though he
                    evidently never was there, but describes the natives and productions from what
                    he saw and from what he could collect at the island of Gibby, to the eastward of
                    Gillolo.</p>
                <p>Forrest, in 1775, anchored in the Bay of Dory, on the northern extremity of New
                    Guinea, and collected some information respecting the inhabitants from a
                    Mahommedan Hadji, who accompanied him. Captain Cook, also, in his first voyage
                    in 1770, made the coast in about 6° 30 ’ south latitude, a little to the
                    northward of Cape Valscher, but did not bring his ship to anchor, on account of
                    the hostility of the natives. A party landed near a grove of cocoa-nut trees,
                    and not far from it found plantain and the bread-fruit tree. The breeze from the
                    trees and shrubs is said to have been charged with a fragrance not unlike that
                    of gum <hi rend="italic">benjamin.</hi> Three Indians rushed out of the wood
                    with a hideous shout, and ran towards the party; the foremost throwing something
                    out of his hand which burnt like gunpowder, the other two hurling their lances
                    at the same time. Before they reached the pinnace, from 60 to 100 had collected,
                    all stark naked; their appearance as to stature, colour, and crisped hair,
                    resembling that of the New Hollanders. They let off fires by four or five at a
                    time, but for what purpose could not be imagined. These fires appeared to be
                    discharged from a piece of stick, probably a hollow cane; and the fire and smoke
                    exactly resembled those of a musket, but without any report. Those who were on
                    board ship, at a distance, concluded they had fire-arms; and even those in the
                    boat might have supposed them firing volleys, had they not been so near as to
                    ascertain that there was no report. Torres had observed something of the same
                    kind in about 4° south latitude on the same coast, where, he says, the
                    inhabitants were black, but better clothed than those southward; that among the
                    wcapons used by them were hollow bamboo sticks, which they filled with lime, and
                    by throwing it out endeavoured to blind their enemies. This explanation,
                    however, does <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192071" xml:id="kp-eb0704-2071-0212"
                    />not account for the <hi rend="italic">fire.</hi> Forrest says that the Chinese
                    from Tidore trade with Papua under Dutch colours; perhaps, therefore, gunpowder
                    may be one of the articles carried by them in exchange for the slaves,
                    ambergris, sea-slugs <hi rend="italic">(biche-de-mer),</hi> tortoise-shell,
                    loories, birds of paradise, &amp;c. which they carry back to China.</p>
                <p>If we suppose the Louisiade of Bougainville to be connected with New Guinea, this
                    island extends in a southeast by east direction from the Cape absurdly called
                    Good Hope, nearly under the equator, to Cape Deliverance, in 11° 30' south,
                    being in length about 1400, and medial breadth about 150 geographical miles. The
                    accounts of all the navigators who have touched on the different parts of its
                    coast describe it as a rich and magnificent country, containing, in all human
                    probability, from its situation and appearance, the most valuable vegetable
                    products of the Moluccas and the several Asiatic islands. Forrest found the
                    nutmeg-tree on Manaswary Island, in the Bay of Dory; and he learned that a
                    people in the interior, called <hi rend="italic">Haraforas,</hi> cultivate the
                    ground, and bring their produce down to the sea-coast; that they are very poor,
                    and some of them have long hair; and that they live in trees, which they ascend
                    by cutting notches in them. The people of New Guinea, in many parts of the
                    coast, live in huts or cabins placed on stages which are erected on poles,
                    commonly in the water, and probably as a protection against snakes and other
                    venomous creatures, though Forrest seems to think against the Haraforas. On
                    these stages they haul up their proas or canoes. These people are invariably
                    described as being hideously ugly; their large eyes, flat noses,· thick lips,
                    woolly hair, and black shining skin, denoting almost to a certainty their
                    African origin and their affinity with the natives of New Holland: but the
                    difference of language, and the want of all the useful productions on the
                    latter, which abound on New Guinea, induced Captain Cook to conclude that there
                    is no intercourse between the two people. The Papuans increase their natural
                    deformity bypassing bones or pieces of stick through the cartilage of the nose,
                    and frizzing out their curly locks like a mop, sometimes to the enormous
                    circumference of three feet. They appear, however, to be one degree farther
                    removed from savage life than the New Hollanders, having permanent houses, and
                    both men and women wearing wrappers round the waist, which are among the
                    articles brought to them by the Chinese and Malays.</p>
                <p>The only quadrupeds that are known to exist on this large island are dogs, rats,
                    and wild hogs; but the feathered race are of great beauty and infinite variety.
                    New Guinea is the native country of those singular and matchless beauties, the
                    birds of paradise, which were once thought to have no legs, but to be always on
                    the wing, and which are known by the name of <hi rend="italic">paxaros da
                    sol,</hi> birds of the sun. They are said to migrate in large flocks, in the dry
                    monsoon, to the islands of Arroo, and other islands to the west and north-west
                    of New Guinea. The great crown pigeon, parrots, loories, and minas, are natives
                    of Papua.</p>
                <p>The whole of this great country is indented with deep bays on every side, some of
                    which nearly intersect the island; and the coast is surrounded on every side by
                    a multitude of small islands, all peopled with the same description of blacks,
                    excepting those already mentioned on the north-west, near the equator, most of
                    which are under the government of Mahommedan Malays, with whom both the Dutch
                    and Chinese have long kept up a considerable intercourse.</p>
                <p>IV. There can be little doubt that this extensive range of islands was partially
                    seen by Le Maire and Schouten in 1616, who, after discovering the Groene Island
                    and the Marquen Islands, steered along the northern coast of New Ireland, as did
                    Tasman also in 1642. Dampier, however, first ascertained New Britain to be an
                    island distinct from New Guinea, by passing the strait which has since borne his
                    name. He visited Port Montague on this island, and speaks of the black natives
                    resembling the Papuans, their dexterity in managing their canoes, their woody
                    hills, fertile vales, and delightful rivulets. He also anchored in Slinger’s
                    Bay, on New Ireland, which he conceived to be the same land with New Britain;
                    but Carteret, in 1727, discovered and passed through a strait which separates
                    them, and to which he gave the name of St George’s Channel. The Admiralty
                    Islands of Carteret, to the north-westward of New Britain, had previously been
                    discovered by Schouten, and named the Twenty-five Islands. New Britain was seen
                    by Roggewein in 1722, and by Bougainville in 1768.</p>
                <p>D’Entrecasteaux, we believe, was the last navigator who passed along the north
                    coast of New Britain, and through St George’s Channel, which divides it from New
                    Ireland, and from thence to the Admiralty Islands; and from his voyage,
                    published by Rossel, together with Labillardière’s and Carteret’s, we shall
                    extract a few gleanings.</p>
                <p>The extent of New Britain and Ireland is not exactly known, nor have they been
                    sufficiently explored to enable geographers to lay them down with accuracy, or
                    even to state what number of islands the group consists of. One of considerable
                    extent lies off the north-west end of New Ireland, which has been named New
                    Hanover, and is itself surrounded by low woody islands. The whole group occupies
                    a space between 2° 30' and 6° of south latitude, and 149° and 153° of east
                    longitude, and may probably contain an area not less than 10,000 geographical
                    miles.</p>
                <p>Carteret, in passing through the strait, saw but few natives on the south coast
                    of New Ireland, who showed marked signs of hostility, and were armed with lances
                    headed with flint; they had also slings and good fishing-tackle. They were
                    black, and had woolly hair, but their lips, he says, were not thick, nor their
                    noses flat; their cheeks were streaked with white, and their hair and beards
                    were covered with a white powder. Their canoes were long and narrow, and had
                    generally outriggers; one of them measured 90 feet in length, and was formed out
                    of a single tree. The two large islands, and the whole group, in fact, were
                    nearly covered with wood; and thick cocoa-nut groves skirted all the low parts
                    of the coast. Labillar dière says that New Ireland produces nutmegs; and he also
                    mentions a new species of the Areca palm, 108 feet high, the stem consisting of
                    hard solid timber.</p>
                <p>The natives of the Admiralty Islands, lying to the north-west, were found by
                    Carteret to be less black than those of New Britain and Ireland, with agreeable
                    countenances, not unlike Europeans; their hair was curly, smeared with oil and
                    red ochre, and their bodies and faces painted with the same material; the glans
                    penis was covered with the shell called the <hi rend="italic">bulla ovum,</hi>
                    serving the same purpose as the wooden sheath of the Caffres in South Africa,
                    whom, indeed, they seem to resemble as closely as the natives of New Guinea do
                    those of the western coast of Africa. The women wear a bandage round the waist.
                    The central island is tolerably large, and of a beautiful appearance, clothed
                    with the most luxuriant verdure, and cultivated to the very summit· Among the
                    groves of cocoa-nut trees are numerous habitations, and the natives have
                    evidently attained to a higher degree of civilization than their southern
                    neighbours; they use earthen vessels, and chew the betel leaf with chunam or
                    lime. This central island is surrounded by nearly thirty small flat islets of
                    coral, and reefs in the various stages of their progress towards islets.</p>
                <p>Proceeding to the westward and to the north-west, we meet with other little
                    clusters of islands, as the Her <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192084"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-2084-0213"/>mites, the Portland, the Echiquier (chess-board),
                    vulgarly called Exchequer Islands, all of which consist, like the Admiralty
                    Archipelago, of a larger central island surrounded by a chain of islets and
                    reefs, most of them covered with beautiful verdure. The natives of these groups,
                    as they approach the equator, gradually assume a lighter colour and longer hair,
                    till they lose entirely the negro character, and melt into that of Malays and
                    other Asiatic islanders. (See Schouten, Dampier, Carteret, Labillardière,
                    &amp;c.)</p>
                <p>V. This archipelago of islands was one of the first discoveries of the Spaniards
                    in Australasia, though the credit of it is given to Alonzo de Mendana, who was
                    sent on an expedition of discovery in 1Ô67 from Callao by the viceroy of Peru.
                    He anchored in a port on the island of Santa Ysabel, to which he gave the name
                    of Porta de la Estrella; and he also built a brigantine to make further
                    discoveries, in which she was particularly successful, having fallen in with no
                    fewer than thirty-three islands, “of very fine prospect.” Many of them were of
                    considerable size, to which they gave particular names, as Galera, Buona-vista,
                    Florida, San German, Guadalcanar, San Christoval, Santa Catarina, and Santa Ana.
                    Guadalcanar, however, was the most attractive, having a port which they named De
                    la Cruz, and a river which they called Galego. Of this island Mendana took
                    possession for the king of Spain. When the voyage was published, the name of
                    Solomon’s Islands was given to the group, “to the end that the Spaniards,
                    supposing them to be those isles from whence Solomon fetched gold to adorn the
                    temple at Jerusalem, might be the more desirous to go and inhabit the same ;”
                    but it has been said that Mendana’s advice was, that they should not be
                    colonized, “that the English, or others, who pass the Strait of Magelhanes to go
                    to the Moluccas, might have no succour there, but such as they get from the
                    Indians.” The truth, however, is, that Mendana, on a second voyage for the
                    discovery of the Solomon Islands, returned without being able to find them,
                    which gave occasion to the remark, that “what Mendana discovered in his first
                    voyage, he lost in his second.” He discovered, however, in this second voyage,
                    the great island of Santa Cruz, which is situated at the south-east extremity of
                    Solomon’s Islands, and may very fairly be considered as one of the group. This
                    island, which has an excellent harbour, La Graciosa, was first revisited after
                    Mendana’s discovery by Carteret, in 1767, who changed its name to that of
                    Egmont, and made it the principal island of a group which he called Queen
                    Charlotte’s Islands. Here Mendana died, and Quiros succeeded to the command; but
                    the search for Solomon’s Islands was abandoned when they were not more than 40
                    leagues from Christoval. It is a singular fact that Solomon’s Islands, whose
                    name was sufficient to tempt adventurers, were lost to Europeans for two
                    centuries after their discovery, and that we know at present little, if any,
                    more than Mendana gave to the world after his first voyage. They were revisited
                    by Bougainville in 1768; by Μ. Surville in 1769, on a voyage from Pondicherry of
                    mercantile speculation, and who, from a ridiculous mistake, called them the
                    Archipelago of he Arsacides, to mark the natives as assassins; by Lieutenant
                    Shortland of the British navy, in 1788, who chose to call them New Georgia; and
                    frequently, since that time, by various British and French navigators ;—still
                    the little we know of them is from Mendana.</p>
                <p>Santa Ysabel, he says, was inhabited by people who had the complexion of
                    mulattoes, with curly hair, and httle covering to their bodies; who worshipped
                    serpents, toads, and such like creatures; whose food was cocoa-nuts and roots;
                    and who, it was believed, ate human flesh, ‘ for the chief sent to the general a
                    present of a quarter of a boy, with the band and arm.” Buónavista is twelve
                    leagues in extent, very fertile, and well peopled, the natives living in regular
                    villages or towns. On Florida, twenty-five leagues in circuit, the natives dyed
                    their hair red, collected together at the sound of the conch-shells, and ate
                    human flesh. Sesarga was well inhabited, produced plenty of yams and
                    bread-fruit, and here the Spaniards saw hogs. In the midst of the island was a
                    volcano continually emitting smoke. They saw bats which measured five feet
                    between the tips of the wings. At Guadalcanar they received in barter two hens
                    and a cock, the first fowls that had been seen. At San Christoval the natives
                    were very numerous, and drew up to give battle to the Spaniards, their arms
                    being darts, clubs, bows and arrows; but they were dispersed by the fire of the
                    muskets, which killed one Indian, and wounded others. In the neighbouring
                    village was found a quantity of cocoa-nuts and almonds, sufficient to have
                    loaded a ship. Santa Ana was well peopled and fertile. It has a good port on the
                    east side, where the Spaniards were attacked by the natives, who wounded three
                    of the invaders, while a dart pierced through the target and arm of the Spanish
                    commanding officer. The blacks had boughs on their heads, and bands round their
                    waists. The Spaniards observed here hogs and fowls.</p>
                <p>VI. To the south-east of Solomon’s Islands, and between the parallels of 14° 3 O'
                    and 20° south latitude, are found a number of islands, some of very considerable
                    magnitude, called the New Hebrides or Hebudes. They were first discovered in
                    1606 by Pedro Fernandez de Quiros, who, with Luis Vaez de Torres, was sent by
                    the king of Spain from Lima with two ships and a zabra (launch) to establish a
                    settlement at the island of Santa Cruz, and from thence to go in quest of the
                    Tierra Austral or southern continent. This voyage has been considered, and
                    justly so, among the most celebrated undertaken by the Spaniards .since the time
                    of Magelhanes. In April 1606 they discovered an island, to which they gave the
                    name of Santa Maria, from whence they saw another island to the southward,so
                    large,” says Torres, “that we sailed for it.” On the 2d May they anchored in a
                    bay large enough to hold a thousand ships, to which they gave the appropriate
                    name of San Felipe y Santiago. Quiros at once determined that he had now
                    discovered the long-sought-for southern continent, and in this conviction named
                    it the Australia del Espiritu Santo. Two rivers fell into the bay, one the
                    Jordan, the other the Salvador. The surrounding country was beautiful, and is
                    thus described by the historian of the voyage: “The banks of the rivers were
                    covered with odoriferous flowers and plants, particularly orange flowers and
                    sweet basil, the perfumes of which were wafted to the ships by the morning and
                    evening breezes; and at the early dawn was heard, from the neighbouring woods,
                    the mixed melody of many different kinds of birds, some in appearance like
                    nightingales, blackbirds, larks, and goldfinches. All the parts of the country
                    in front of the sea were beautifully varied with fertile valleys, plains,
                    winding rivers, and groves, which extend to the sides of the green mountains.”
                    (Torque-mada, as quoted in Burney’s <hi rend="italic">Account of Discoveries in
                    the South Seaf</hi></p>
                <p>Of this terrestrial paradise, which the Spaniards re-: garded as their own, it
                    was intended to take immediate possession. They landed in great numbers; the
                    islanders were also numerous, became alarmed, made them presents, and signified
                    a wish for them to return to their ships. They, however, landed from their
                    boats, on which the chief drew a line on the ground with the end of his bow, and
                    made signs that the Spaniards must not pass that boundary. It is said that
                    Torres, to show his contempt <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192097"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-2097-0214"/>of the idea of being restrained by barbarians,
                    immediately passed the line. A battle ensued, in which the chief was killed, and
                    all the rest fled into the woods. This rash act, however, was fatal to the views
                    of the Spaniards, who never afterwards could prevail on the islanders to have
                    any friendly communication with them; and they left this country, after some
                    ridiculous formalities of taking possession in the name of Philip III., and
                    founding a city, dignified with the name of the <hi rend="italic">New
                    Jerusalem.</hi><hi rend="italic">"'·</hi></p>
                <p>So anxious was Quiros of “adding the Australia del Espiritu Santo to the other
                    possessions of the Spanish monarchy,” that, after his return to Spam, he is said
                    to have presented no less than fifty memorials to the king. One of these, which
                    was printed at Seville, begins thus: “I, Captain Pedro Fernandez de Quiros, say,
                    that with this I have presented to your majesty eight memorials relative to the
                    settlement which ought to be made in <hi rend="italic">Australia
                    Incognita''</hi> In these memorials he enumerates the many valuable productions
                    of this supposed southern continent,—cocoa-nuts, plantains, sugar-canes, yams,
                    batatas, oranges, limes, papas, pumpkins, almonds, nutmegs, mace, ginger, pepper
                    in great quantities, and woods for “building any number of ships.” The animals
                    are hogs, goats, and dogs; fowls, and a variety of useful birds; various good
                    fish, and pearl oysters. The climate is described as so fine, with such a
                    freshness in the air, that neither by labour, exposure to the sun, or rain, or
                    dews, nor by intemperance, did any of the Spaniards fall sick; and among the
                    natives many aged people were seen. They wear a covering round the middle:
                    Torres says they are all black and naked. They are described by Quiros as
                    corpulent and strong, cleanly, cheerful, sensible, and grateful; their houses
                    stood on the ground, and not on poles, built of wood, and thatched. They weave
                    nets, and make earthen vessels, have plantations inclosed with palisades,
                    construct vessels which navigate to distant countries, and have places
                    appropriated for burying the dead; and, he adds, as the last and decisive test
                    of their progress in civilization, “they cut their hogs and make capons.”</p>
                <p>This archipelago of islands, like that of Solomon, was lost to the world for a
                    century and a half, when Bougainville revisited them in 1768, but, except
                    landing on the Isle of Lepers, did nothing more than discover that the land was
                    not connected, but composed of islands, which he called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Great Cyclades</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> which, on being more accurately and
                    extensively explored by Cook in 1774, underwent another change to that of New
                    Hebrides, which they now bear in all our charts. According to the survey of our
                    great navigator, they consist of Tierra del Espiritu Santo, the largest of the
                    whole, St Bartholomew, Mallicolo, the Isle of Lepers, Aurora, Whitsuntide,
                    Ambrym, Apee, Paoom, Three-hills, Sandwich, Montagu, Hinchin-brook, Shepherd’s
                    Isles, Erromango, Tanna, Immer, Anna-tom, and Erronan. The two which are more
                    particularly described are Mallicolo and Tanna, the natives of which differ
                    remarkably in their persons and language; those of the latter having curly but
                    long hair, dark but not black, and without any thing of the negro character in
                    their features, which are regular and agreeable, their persons slender, active,
                    and nimble. They were found to be hospitable, civil, and good-natured, but they
                    displayed a jealousy of their visitors seeing the interior of the island, which
                    could only be equalled in Japan or China. All the plantations were fenced, and
                    laid out in a line; they consisted of sugar-canes, yams, plantains, bread-fruit,
                    &amp;c. The yams were remarkably fine, one of them weighing fifty-six pounds,
                    every ounce of which was good; and they had pigs and poultry. The juice of the
                    cocoa-nut and water appeared to be their only beverage. Their arms were clubs,
                    darts, lances, and bows and arrows. Their canoes, clumsily sewed together, had
                    outriggers, and were work-, ed by paddles and by sails. The men wore a wrapper
                    round the loins, and the women a sort of petticot reaching to the knee.</p>
                <p>The natives of Mallicolo are called by Captain Cook “an ape-like nation,” the
                    most ugly, ill-proportioned people he ever met with, and different from all
                    others, diminutive in their persons, dark coloured, with black hair, short and
                    curly, but not so woolly as a negro’s; they had long heads, flat faces, and
                    monkey countenances; and a belt round the waist, pulled tight across the belly,
                    made them look not unlike overgrown pismires. The women were equally ugly; and
                    the dress of both sexes was in other respects the same as that of Tanna, as were
                    also the productions of the island. Their houses w ere low, and covered with
                    palm thatch. (See Dalrymple, Burney, Cook, &amp;c.)</p>
                <p>VII. This large island, surrounded with coral islets and reefs, was wholly
                    unknown till Captain Cook in 1774 fell in with the north-western extremity in
                    steering southwest from Mallicolo, from which it is distant not more than about
                    eighty leagues. He anchored within a small island called Balabea, and opposite
                    to the district Balade. The great island extends between latitude 20° 5' and 22°
                    30', in the direction of north-west and south-east, about 250 miles long by 60
                    broad. The land bears a great resemblance to that of New South Wales, and many
                    of its natural productions appeared to be the same, but the natives were
                    different. They are represented as a strong, robust, active, well-made people,
                    courteous and friendly, and not in the least addicted to pilfering, in which
                    respect they differ from every other tribe of Australasia. They are nearly of
                    the same colour as the natives of Tanna, and appeared to be a mixed race between
                    that people and those of the Friendly Isles, or of Tanna and New Zealand, their
                    language being a mixture of them all. Of the same disposition as the natives of
                    the Friendly Islands, they were found to excel them in affability and honesty;
                    and the women, like those of Tanna, were chaster than the females of the more
                    eastern islands, not one of the ship’s company having been able to obtain the
                    least favour from any one of them. They wear a petticot of the filaments of the
                    plantain tree, “at least six or eight inches thick, but not one inch longer than
                    necessary for the use designed.” They paint and puncture their bodies, and wear
                    ear-rings, and necklaces, and bracelets, of tortoise and other shells. Both men
                    and women have good features and agreeable countenances; and some of the men
                    measure in height six feet four inches. Their hair is frizzled out like a mop,
                    and is very black, coarse, and strong, but different from that of a negro. The
                    rough mop-heads make use of “scratchers,” composed of a number of sticks of hard
                    wood, about the thickness of knitting-needles, fastened together at one end like
                    a sort of comb; the women have their hair cropped short. The men wear a wrapper
                    round the loins, made of the bark of a tree. Their houses resemble bee-hives,
                    with peaked roofs, entered by a hole just big enough to admit a man bent double.
                    The sides are of spars and reeds, and both these and the roof well thatched with
                    dry grass. They boil their roots and fish in earthen jars. They have nets made
                    of plantain fibres, and the sails of their canoes are of the same material.
                    These vessels consist of two trees fixed together by a platform. They have
                    plantations of sugar-canes, plantains, bread-fruit, and cocoa-nut, but none of
                    them very productive. The whole appearance of the country, indeed, is described
                    as unable to support many inhabitants. The greater part of the visible surface
                    consists of barren rocky mountains; and though the plains and valleys appeared
                    to be fertile, Captain Cook was of opinion that “nature <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193192110" xml:id="kp-eb0704-2110-0215"/>has been less bountiful to it
                    than to any other tropical island we know in this sea.”</p>
                <p>D’Entrecasteaux passed the opposite extremity of New Caledonia in 1792, when on
                    his search after the unfortunate La Perouse, but was prevented by a barrier reef
                    of coral from approaching the coast; and, in the following year, he visited
                    Balade on the north-west. The account of the inhabitants, as given by Rossel and
                    Labillardiĕre, differs altogether from that of Cook. Instead of finding them
                    friendly, honest, and inoffensive, they are described as the worst of cannibals,
                    not only eating the flesh of their enemies, but feeding on little children,
                    ferocious in their dispositions, the most audacious thieves, and the women the
                    most shameless prostitutes. But their own account of their transactions there,
                    the confidence with which they straggled over the country, and the readiness of
                    the savages to serve them, by no means warrant the bad character they have
                    thought fit to give them; and they had no more proof of their being cannibals
                    than they had for accusing the people of Van Diemen’s Land of the same
                    practices, because the surgeon-major mistook the bone of a kangaroo for that of
                    a young girl. They appear to have endeavoured by signs to extort a confession to
                    this effect from the poor savages, who, on their part, were also persuaded that
                    the French were the real cannibals. The charge brought against the women is
                    grounded solely on two young girls having been prevailed on by some of the crew
                    to expose what decency requires to be concealed, in return for some pieces of
                    cloth or iron. Labillardière thinks the inhabitants, as well as the vegetable
                    productions, resemble those of Van Diemen’s Land. There was no want of different
                    kinds of esculent plants, though a great scarcity prevailed from drought or
                    other cause when they arrived. The young shoots of the <hi rend="italic"

                    plantains, sugar-canes, cocoa-nuts, and the bread-fruit, all afforded them
                    articles of food. Yet Labillardiĕre says they eat steatite, and that he saw one
                    man devour a piece of this stone as large as his two fists. They also eat a
                    species of spider. They had lost the hogs which Cook left them, but some half
                    dozen of cocks and hens were seen by the French. (See Cook, Labillardiĕre,
                    &amp;c.)</p>
                <p>VIII. Though these islands geographically belong to Australasia, the natives are,
                    in their physical character and language, Polynesians. They were first
                    discovered on the 13th December 1642, by Abel Jansen Tasman, on his voyage of
                    discovery from the Mauritius; and, on the !8th, the Heemskirk yacht and the
                    fly-boat Zeehaan came to anchor in a bay to which they afterwards gave the name
                    of Moordenaar’s or Murderer’s Bay, and to the island that of Staaten Land, in
                    honour of the states-general, and in the possibility that it might join the
                    Staaten Land to the east of the Tierra del Fucgo. “It is a fine country,” says
                    Tasman, “and we hope it is part of the unknown south continent.” The expedition
                    of Hendrik Brower to Chili the following year cut off the latter Staaten Land
                    from any continental connection, and the name of the former was then changed to
                    that of New Zealand.</p>
                <p>On the 19th a boat with thirteen natives came within a stone s throw of the
                    Heemskirk. The language in which they hailed was unlike that of the Solomon’s
                    Islands, of which Tasman had a vocabulary. Their vessel consisted of two narrow
                    canoes, joined together by boards, on which the people sat; their paddles, about
                    a fathom long, were pointed at the end; their clothing appeared of mats or
                    cotton, but their breasts were naked. They were invited on board, but in vain.
                    The ships, however, were moved nearer in shore, upon which seven double vessels
                    came off.</p>
                <p>A boat, dispatched from one ship to the other, had previously been attacked.
                    Three men belonging to the Zeehaan were killed, and one mortally wounded; one of
                    the killed was dragged into the canoes. After this, despairing of getting water
                    or provisions, they weighed and set sail, twenty-two of the native boats
                    following them, eleven of which were full of people. The ships fired, and the
                    canoes returned to the shore.</p>
                <p>.The next visitor, at the distant period of a hundred and twenty-seven years, was
                    Captain Surville, who in 1769 put into a bay on the north-eastern extremity, and
                    gave it the name of Lauriston Bay. In the same year Lieutenant (afterwards
                    Captain) Cook of the Endeavour, made the land on the 6th of October, the
                    enormous height of which became the subject of much conversation; and the
                    general opinion was, that they had now discovered the <hi rend="italic">Terra
                    Australis Incognita.</hi> This voyage, however, and the circumnavigation of the
                    islands of New Zealand, entirely subverted the theory of a great southern
                    continent. In 1772 Captains Marion du Fresne and Crozet put into the Bay of
                    Isles, where the former and some of the crew were murdered by the natives. In
                    March 1773 Captain Cook in the Resolution, with Captain Furneaux in the
                    Adventure, revisited New Zealand, where the latter had a whole boat’s crew with
                    a midshipman murdered by the inhabitants. In 1776 and 1777 a thjrd visit was
                    made to these islands by Captain Cook. In these several visits, accompanied as
                    he was with men well versed in every branch of natural knowledge, there will be
                    found in the <hi rend="italic">Voyages</hi> of Cook and Forster every species of
                    information that the ferocious disposition of the inhabitants made it
                    practicable to collect.</p>
                <p>The two great islands of New Zealand extend between latitude 34° and 48° south,
                    longitude 181° and 194° east; that to the northward, called Eaheinomawe, is
                    about 400 geographical miles long by 90 in medial breadth; the name of the
                    southern island is Tavai Poenammoo, and it is about 450 geographical miles long
                    by 95 broad; the former has a rich and fertile soil, well clothed with trees,
                    some of them more than20feetin girth, and 90 feet high, without a branch. Some
                    of them resembled spruce, and were “large enough for the mainmast of a 50 gun
                    ship.” The highest hills were covered with forests, the valleys with grass and
                    shrubbery, and the plains were well irrigated with rills of clear water. The
                    southern island is very mountainous; one peak, resembling that of Teneriffe, was
                    estimated by Forster, but without sufficient data, at 14,000 feet in height; it
                    was covered with snow in the middle of January. Both as to appearance and
                    temperature, they may be considered as the British isles of Australasia.
                    Fahrenheit’s thermometer in February was never higher than 66°, and was not
                    lower in June than 48°.</p>
                <p>A great part of the western side of those islands had, however, a desolate and
                    inhospitable appearance; exhibiting ranges of yellow sandstone, or white sand
                    hills, with scarcely a blade of verdure. It is worthy of remark, that this
                    extraordinary difference prevails between the two coasts of South Africa, the
                    two coasts of New Holland, and the two coasts of Van Diemen’s Land.</p>
                <p>The natives are stout, well limbed, and muscular, vigorous and active, excelling
                    in manual dexterity; their countenances intelligent and expressive, of an olive
                    complexion, but not darker than a Spaniard. In the appearance of the women there
                    is not much feminine delicacy; but on Cook’s first visit they found them more
                    modest and decent in their behaviour than any of the islanders they had met
                    with. They were covered from the shoulders to the ankles with a sort of netted
                    cloth made of the split leaves of the flax plant <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phormium</hi><hi rend="italic">tenax),</hi> the ends hanging down like
                    fringes. A party once came upon some <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192123"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-2123-0216"/>women by surprise as they were fishing, naked, for
                    lobsters, and “the chaste Diana, with her nymphs, could not have discovered more
                    confusion and distress at the sight of Actaeon, than these women expressed upon
                    our approach.” On the third visit, however, they had got rid of all their
                    modesty, and a rusty nail was sufficient to purchase the last favour.</p>
                <p>The black hair of the men is bound in a knot on the top of the head, that of the
                    women is cropped; both sexes anoint their hair with rancid oil, and smear their
                    bodies with grease and red ochre. The faces of the old men are covered with
                    large furrowed black marks, generally spiral lines, and have a horrible
                    appearance. The women wear in their ears pieces of cloth, feathers, sticks,
                    bones, &amp;c. and bracelets and anklets of bone, teeth, shells, &amp;c. Captain
                    Cook did not observe any appearance of disease, or bodily complaint, or eruption
                    on the skin, or marks of any; and the most severe wounds healed most rapidly.
                    Very old men, without hair or teeth, showed no signs of decrepitude, and were
                    full of cheerfulness and vivacity. They are mild, gentle, and affectionate
                    towards each other, but ferocious and implacable towards their enemies; and it
                    unfortunately happens, that the little societies into which they appear to be
                    divided, are in an almost perpetual state of hostility, which makes it necessary
                    for them to dwell in happahs or villages, fortified with embankments, ditches,
                    and pallisadoes. They give no quarter, and feast with apparent relish on the
                    bodies of their enemies, which they cut up and broil in holes dug in the earth;
                    they suck out the brains, and preserve the skulls as trophies. They made no
                    hesitation in devouring human flesh in presence of the English officers, and
                    their provision baskets had generally a head or a limb of a human subject.</p>
                <p>The only quadrupeds on the islands are dogs, small and ugly, and rats, the former
                    of which they eat, and with their skins cut into strips they adorn their
                    clothing; but their principal food consists of fish, and the bruised roots of
                    fern. They cultivate, however, and with great neatness, sweet potatoes, eddas,
                    and gourds, all planted in regular rows; and Cook observed near the villages
                    both privies and dunghills. Their houses have a ridge-pole to the roof, which,
                    with the sides, are built of sticks and grass, and lined with bark; they sleep
                    on the floors covered with straw; and the furniture consists of a chest to hold
                    their tools, clothes, arms, and feathers, provision baskets, and gourds to hold
                    water, which is their only beverage; the New Zealanders being among the very few
                    people, civilized or savage, who are ignorant of the means of intoxication.</p>
                <p>Their double canoes or whale boats are admirably constructed with planks from 60
                    to 70 feet in length, and their prows and sterns are tastefully and curiously
                    carved and ornamented; all of which is performed by adzes and axes of a hard
                    black stone, or green talc or jade, and with chisels of human bone or jasper. Of
                    these materials also their offensive weapons are made: these are lances fourteen
                    feet long, sharp at both ends, of hard wood neatly carved; and a battle-axe of
                    jade or bone about a foot long. Their war canoes carry from 60 to 70 men each;
                    they keep exact time with their paddles, singing, with great vociferation and
                    distorted features, their savage war-song, when bound on any hostile expedition.
                    Their war-dances are conducted in the same furious and extravagant style; the
                    only musical instrument, if it can be called one, which they use, is a triton
                    shell, which sounds like a cow’s horn.</p>
                <p>They have, however, a taste for music, and the women are said to sing in a soft,
                    slow, and mournful cadence, making use of semitones. When their husbands are
                    slain in battle, they cut their legs,' arms, and faces, with bone· or sharp
                    shells; and there are few of them who do not wear scars on their bodies as
                    testimonials of their affection and sorrow for their deceased friends.</p>
                <p>The natives of New Zealand exhibit a strange mixture of civilized and savage
                    life. It was hoped, from the state of their cultivated grounds, of which several
                    hundred acres were seen, that presents of hogs, kids, and poultry, would have
                    been most acceptable, and considerable numbers were left with them on the first
                    and second visits of Captain Cook; but, excepting the cocks and hens, which had
                    bred plentifully, and flew about wild in the woods, the others had been wantonly
                    destroyed. In 1791 Vancouver touched at Dusky Bay, and remained there for some
                    time, examining the bays and creeks in the neighbourhood; but he did not see one
                    human being. And in 1793 D’Entrecasteaux passed between the Three Kings’ Island
                    and Cape Maria van Diemen, but had no other communication with the natives
                    except in their canoes. Unlike in every respect to the Otaheitans, they have
                    evidently a common origin; their language not differing more than the language
                    of the two New Zealand Islands from each other. The few notions they have of
                    superior beings also accord with those of Otaheite. (See Cook’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Voyages?)</hi></p>
                <p>A missionary of the name of Marsden, from merely seeing some New Zealanders in
                    New South Wales, had the hardihood to accuse Captain Cook of having drawn “a
                    false picture of the New Zealanders.” He undoubtedly thought so, and went to the
                    islands with a view of converting the natives to Christianity. He soon, however,
                    abandoned this “noble race of men,” as he calls them, being unable, by his own
                    account, “to lay the first stone consoling himself for his disappointment by the
                    reflection that “the pious Israelites could not build the walls of Jerusalem
                    without holding the sŵord in one hand and the trowel in the other.” Captain
                    Cook’s accuracy is too well established to be shaken by such authority. The
                    following horrible transaction proves how well he described the character of
                    these cannibals. In December 1809, the ship Boyd, from Port Jackson, was at
                    Wangarrooa, in the Bay of Islands, and admitted, without due caution, too large
                    a number of natives on board, when the crew were suddenly attacked, overpowered,
                    and slaughtered. Captain Alexander Berry, of the ship Edinburgh Castle, being on
                    the coast, was soon after apprized of this horrible event; and, proceeding to
                    the bay, found the remains of the Boyd, which had been burned by the savages. On
                    landing, he discovered that the massacre had been directed by Tippahee, the old
                    chief who had been so much caressed at Sydney. The bones of the unfortunate men
                    lay scattered on the ground, where their bodies had been devoured by the
                    savages. Sixteen were murdered and cut up on the deck of the vessel; five
                    others, who had fled for safety upon the yards, were told by the old cannibal,
                    that if they would come down their lives should be spared, which, after some
                    hesitation, they consented to do. They were sent on shore, and in five minutes
                    after their dead bodies lay on the beach. The only survivors which Captain Berry
                    contrived to save were, a woman, two children, and a boy. Well might Captain
                    Berry conclude the narrative of his horrid murder by an admonition, “Let no man
                    trust a New Zealander.”</p>
                <p>Commerce, however, that great civilizer, has done more for the Zealanders than
                    the missionaries could effect. An active and increasing trade is carried on
                    between these islands and New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land; and the
                    southern whale-fishery ships are constantly calling there for refreshments. The
                    result has been not only an improvement in the condition of these islanders, but
                    a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192136" xml:id="kp-eb0704-2136-0217"/>• softening
                    down of their ferocious disposition, and a steady ’march in progressive
                    civilization.</p>
                <p>To the eastward of New Zealand is an island of considerable extent and well
                    peopled, discovered by Mr Broughton in 1791, when on a voyage round the world
                    with Vancouver. He called it Chatham Island. The people and the productions are
                    the same as those of New Zealand. (See Vancouver’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Voyage.)</hi></p>
                <p>It may be proper here to notice a recent discovery of a group of islands directly
                    south of the south cape of Tavai Poenammoo, one of the New Zealands, named Lord
                    Auckland’s Group by the discoverer, Mr Bristow, master of a South Sea Whaler, in
                    gratitude to the nobleman whose name they bear, for having, when a boy, procured
                    him admission into the school of Greenwich Hospital. This group, seven in
                    number, was first seen on the 10th of August 1806; and on the 20th of October
                    1807 Captain Bristow came to anchor with his ship, the Sarah, in a fine harbour
                    on the largest island, which he called Enderby, and to the harbour he gave the
                    quaint name of Sarah’s Bosom. They are situated in lat. 50° 40' south, and long.
                    166° 35' east. Wood and water being plentiful and easily procured, they are
                    represented as holding out, in this desolate and remote region, considerable
                    advantages to the southern whale-fishery. The climate, however, is unusually
                    severe, and the weather tempestuous. In the middle of summer (December) every
                    day was attended with snow, sleet, or rain. Yet this severity of climate
                    appeared to make no unfavourable impression on the vegetable productions, as the
                    woods were covered with verdure as early in the spring as October. He observed
                    four kinds of timber trees, the principal of which was said to be mangrove,
                    growing to the height of 30 or 40 feet; but the trunks were so twisted and
                    turned by the violent winds that it was difficult to find a straight piece of
                    ten feet in length. There was no want of shrubbery and herbaceous plants; there
                    were neither men nor quadrupeds of any kind, but seals, sea-elephants, and
                    sea-fowl, in great plenty. The woods abounded with a variety of singing birds
                    with sweet melodious notes, and among them was a species of lark; wild ducks,
                    teals, and snipes, were plentiful; and he caught a kind of rock-cod with the
                    hook and line.</p>
                <p>To the southward of the group another small island was discovered in 1811, to
                    which was given the name of Campbell’s Island; and to the south-west of them
                    Macquarrie’s Island, in latitude 55° south and longitude 160° east. Several
                    other islands are scattered about those of New Zealand; Chatham Island to the
                    eastward of it, and a group of small ones near it, seen by Cornwallis in 1807;
                    Bounty Island to the south-east; and to the southward of the latter a little
                    island which, from its position with regard to England, has been named Antipodes
                    Island. (Bristow’s <hi rend="italic">MS. Letter.)</hi></p>
                <p>IX. Between the parallels of 48° 30' and 50° south, and •longitude 69° east, lies
                    the barren and uninhabited Land of &lt;erguelen, so named from the French
                    officer who first discovered it in 1772, and who, on a second visit in 1773,
                    discovered some small islands near it, but on neither occasion was able once to
                    bring his ships to an anchor upon any part of the coast. Captain Cook was more
                    fortunate. He had heard of Kerguelen’s discovery at the Cape of Good Hope, and
                    wondered he should not have seen this land when he passed it so closely in 1770.
                    In 1776, however, he fell, in with these islands, and as no account of Kerguelen
                    syoyage had been made public, he gave new names o each island. Speaking of the
                    main island, “I should,” says Cook, “from its sterility, with great propriety
                    call Ma <hi rend="italic">I</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> g</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript">

                    rend="italic">f Desolation,</hi> but that I would not rob *1. de Kerguelen of
                    the honour of its bearing his name.” He changed, however, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Baie</hi><hi rend="italic">de l’Oiseau</hi> of the French, where they had
                    landed in a boat and lodged a piece of parchment in a bottle, into <hi
                    rend="italic">Christmas Harbour</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and called a round
                    high rock Bligh’s Cap, which had been named by Μ. de Kerguelen the Isle of
                    Rendezvous,—although, says Cook, “I know nothing that can rendezvous about it
                    but fowls of the air; for it is certainly inaccessible to any other animal.”
                    Kerguelen thought he had discovered the <hi rend="italic">Terra Australis
                    Incognita,</hi> but Cook soon determined that it was of no great extent.</p>
                <p>The hills were but of a moderate height, and yet in the middle of summer were
                    covered with snow; not a shrub was found on this island, and not more than 17 or
                    18 different plants, one half of which were either mosses or grasses. The chief
                    verdure was occasioned by one plant not unlike a saxifrage, spreading in tufts,
                    and forming a surface of a pretty extensive texture, over a kind of bog or
                    rotten turf: the highest plant resembled a small cabbage when shot into seed,
                    and was about two feet high. No land animals were met with, but great plenty of
                    the ursine seal <hi rend="italic">(Phoca ursina).</hi> Penguins were very
                    abundant, as were also shags, cormorants, albatrosses, gulls, ducks, pet-terels,
                    and sea-swallows. A few fish of the size of a haddock were taken with the line,
                    and the only shell-fish were a few limpets and muscles.</p>
                <p>The steep cliffs towards the sea are rent from the top downwards, but whether by
                    rains, frost, or earthquakes, could not be determined. The productions of the
                    hills were composed chiefly of a dark blue and pretty hard stone, intermixed
                    with small particles of glimmer or quartz. Lumps of coloured sandstone, and of
                    semitransparent quartz, are also common. Nothing appeared like an ore or metal
                    of any kind. (Cook’s <hi rend="italic">Third Voyage,</hi> vol. i.)</p>
                <p>X. These small uninhabited islands are interesting only; in a geological point of
                    view. Situated in the midst of the great Indian Ocean, at the distance of 2000
                    miles í from the nearest land, and removed but 18 or 20 miles from each other,
                    they have no common point of resemblance; the one being the product of a
                    volcanic eruption scarcely yet cooled, with a few mosses and grasses on its
                    surface; the other composed of horizontal and parallel strata of rock, covered
                    with frutescent plants—an appearance which led the scientific gentlemen in
                    D’Entrecasteaux’s expedition to conclude that an organization so regular could
                    not proceed from a volcanic origin. A French seal-catcher from the neighbouring
                    island had set fire to the shrubbery, which continued to burn when the
                    navigators passed the island; and imagining that they saw pits of smoke issuing
                    from the crevices between the strata, some of them were disposed to consider
                    this circumstance as infallible indications of subterranean fire. Perron, the
                    seal-catcher above mentioned, with the gentlemen of Lord Macartney’s embassy,
                    who explored the southernmost island, Amsterdam, says that the shores of St
                    Paul’s abounded with pumice stone; but the presence of this light material is by
                    no means an infallible criterion of a proximate eruption.</p>
                <p>Of the recent creation of Amsterdam there can be little doubt; indeed, it is
                    scarcely yet cooled, and is altered considerably since its first discovery by
                    Vlaming in 1696. From every part of the sloping sides of the crater, which is
                    nearly 1000 yards in diameter, and into which the sea has forced its way, either
                    smoke, or hot water, or hot mud, is seen to issue; and everywhere is felt a
                    tremulous motion, and a noise heard like that of boiling water. In many parts of
                    the crater, in the centre of which the water is 174 feet deep, the sea-water is
                    tepid from the hot springs below; and numbers of these springs are found on the
                    margin, below the high-water mark, of various temperatures, from 100° to the
                    boiling point. One very copious spring, slightly chalybeate, issues, in a
                    copious <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192149" xml:id="kp-eb0704-2149-0218"
                    />stream, into the crater, nearly on a level with the lowest state of the tide.
                    These springs cannot possibly descend from the summit of the island, the highest
                    part of which is the edge of the crater, about 600 feet; and the whole area of
                    the island is not more than eight square miles, a surface totally inadequate to
                    collect and condense the clouds, so ns to produce these permanent springs. Why
                    some modern geologists, and among them Μ. de Humboldt, should doubt of sea-water
                    being converted into steam, and undergoing the process of distillation by
                    subterranean fire, we are at a loss to know; or in what other manner they would
                    account for such large and permanent streams of fresh water so situated as those
                    are of Amsterdam Island.</p>
                <p>Another singularity which this island presents is in its mosses and grasses,
                    which are all European. To these may be added the <hi rend="italic">Sonchus
                    oleracea,</hi> or sow thistle, and the <hi rend="italic">Apium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">petrosilenum,</hi> or parsley; and the <hi rend="italic">common
                    Lycopodium,</hi> or club-moss, which grows luxuriantly on the bleak heaths of
                    North Britain, seems to thrive equally well on the boggy soil of Amsterdam,
                    heated, at the depth of a foot below the surface, to the temperature of 186° of
                    Fahrenheit’s scale.</p>
                <p>The crater abounds with an excellent perch of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> reddish
                    colour, which is easily caught with the hook, and may be dropped at once into
                    one of the hot springs on the margin and boiled alive; and, so caught and
                    dressed, we are told it affords an excellent repast. The bar across the mouth of
                    the crater is represented as one mass of cray-fish; and in the sea, outside the
                    bar, are vast multitudes of whales, grampuses, porpoises, seals, and sea lions,
                    so as to be dangerous for boats to pass. It was the same in Vlaming’s time, who
                    “found the sea so full of seals and sea lions that they were obliged to kill
                    them to get a passage through; when they steered from the shore there was also
                    an astonishing number of fish.”</p>
                <p>XI. From the volcanic island of Amsterdam, we must now take a glance of those
                    innumerable low islands and reefs of rocks which are scattered over the greater
                    part of the Australasian Sea to the eastward and northward of New Holland, and
                    which are produced by an operation of nature different from that which lifted up
                    Amsterdam; less violent, indeed, and with less eclat than the latter, but
                    equally, if not more firmly established on the solid foundations of the deep
                    abyss. A volcanic island not unfrequently breaks down its supporters, and sinks
                    back into the cavity out of which it was hurled, as was recently the case with
                    the Sabrina Island, near St Michael’s; but the island of coral, created by slow
                    and imperceptible degrees, hardens with time, and becomes one solid mass from
                    the summit to the base.</p>
                <p>We know very little as yet of the nature of the marine polypi that construct
                    these wonderful fabrics, but we cannot be blind to the effects of their
                    operations. Throughout the whole range of the Polynesian and Australasian
                    islands, there is scarcely a league of sea unoccupied by a coral reef or a coral
                    island; the former springing up to the surface of the water perpendicularly from
                    the fathomless bottom, “deeper than did ever plummet sound and the latter in
                    various stages, from the low and naked rock, with the water rippling over it, to
                    an uninterrupted forest of tall trees. “I have seen,” says Dalrymple, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Inquiry into the Formation of Islands,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >“</hi> the coral banks in all their stages; some in deep water, others with a
                    few rocks appearing above the surface: some just formed into islands, without
                    the least appearance of vegetation; others with a few weeds on the highest part:
                    and, lastly, such as are covered with large timber, with a bottomless sea at a
                    pistol-shot distance.” In fact, as soon as the edge of the reef is high enough
                    to lay hold of the floating seawreck, or for a bird to perch upon, the island
                    may be said to commence. The dung of birds, feathers, wreck of all kinds,
                    cocoa-nuts floating with the young plant out of the-shell, are the first
                    rudiments of the new island. With islands thus formed, and others in the several
                    stages of their progressive creation, Torres Strait is nearly choked up; and
                    Captain Flinders mentions one island in it covered with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Casuarma,</hi> and a variety of other trees and shrubs, which give food to
                    paroquets, pigeons, and other birds, to whose ancestors it is probable the
                    island was originally indebted for this vegetation. The time will come, —it may
                    be ten thousand or ten millions of years, but come it must,—when New Holland,
                    and New Guinea, and all the little groups of islets and reefs to the north and
                    north-west of them, will either be united into one great continent, or be
                    separated only by deep channels, in which the strength and velocity of the tide
                    may obstruct the silent and unobserved agency of these insignificant but most
                    efficacious labourers.</p>
                <p>A barrier reef of coral runs along the whole of the eastern coast of New Holland,
                    “among which,” says Captain Flinders, “we sought fourteen days, and sailed more
                    than 500 miles, before a passage could be found through them out to sea.”
                    Captain Flinders paid some attention to the structure of these reefs, on one of
                    which he suffered shipwreck. Having landed on one of these creations, he says,
                    “we had wheat sheaves, mushrooms, stags’ horns, cabbage leaves, and a variety of
                    other forms, glowing under water, with vivid tints of every shade betwixt green,
                    purple, brown, and white.” “It seems to me,” he adds, “that when the animalcules
                    which form the coral at the bottom of the ocean cease to live, their structures
                    adhere to each other, by virtue either of the glutinous remains within, or of
                    some property in salt water; and the interstices being gradually filled up with
                    sand and broken pieces of coral washed by the sea, which also adhere, a mass of
                    rock is at length formed. Future races of these animalcules erect their
                    habitation upon the rising bank, and die in their turn, to increase, but
                    principally to elevate, this monument of their wonderful labours.” He says that
                    they not only work perpendicularly, but that this barrier wall is the highest
                    part, and generally exposed to the open sea, and that the infant colonies find
                    shelter within it. A bank is thus gradually formed, which is not long in being
                    visited by sea birds; salt plants take root upon it, and a soil begins to be
                    formed; a cocoa-nut, or the drupe of a pandanus, is thrown on shore; land birds
                    visit it, and deposit the seeds of shrubs and trees; every high tide and gale of
                    wind add something to the bank; the form of an island is gradually assumed; and
                    last of all comes man to take possession.</p>
                <p>If we should imagine one of these immense coral reefs to be lifted up by a
                    submarine volcano, and converted into an insular or continental ridge of hills,
                    such a ridge would exhibit most of the phenomena that are met with in hills of
                    limestone.</p>
                <p>It is worthy of remark, that, in this great division of the globe, fully equal in
                    extent to that of Europe, there is no quadruped larger than the kangaroo; that
                    there is none of a ferocious character, and, in many of the islands, none of any
                    description. Man only in Australasia is an animal of prey; and, more ferocious
                    than the lynx, the leopard, or the hyaena, he devours his own species, in
                    countries too where nature has done every thing for his comfort and subsistence.
                    The consequence is, that population is so much checked and thwarted, that the
                    number of all the natives who have been seen on the coasts of all the islands,
                    from the first discovery to the present time, would not in the aggregate amount
                    to 20,000 souls. The only hope of improvement must depend on the future
                    colonization of these healthful and fertile regions of the globe by some
                    European power.</p>
