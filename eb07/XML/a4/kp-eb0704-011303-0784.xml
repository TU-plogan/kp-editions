                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">ATHANASIAN <hi rend="smallcaps">Creed</hi></label>, a
                    formulary or confession of faith, long supposed to have been drawn up by
                    Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, in the fourth century, to justify himself
                    against the calumnies of his Arian enemies. But it is now generally allowed
                    among the learned not to have been his. Dr Waterland ascribes it to Hilary,
                    bishop of Arles, for the following among other reasons:—!. Because Honoratus of
                    Marseilles, the writer of his life, tells us that he composed an <hi
                    rend="italic">Exposition of the Creed</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a more proper
                    title for the <hi rend="italic">Athanasian</hi> than that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Creed</hi> simply, which it now bears. 2. Hilary was a great admirer and
                    follower of St Austin; and the whole composition of this creed is in a manner
                    upon St Austin’s plan, both with respect to the Trinity and incarnation. 3. It
                    is agreeable to the style of Hilary, as far as we can judge from the little that
                    is left of his works. Upon the whole he concludes, that Hilary, bishop of Arles,
                    about the year 430 composed the <hi rend="italic">Exposition of Faith,</hi>
                    which now bears the name of the <hi rend="italic">Athanasian Creed,</hi> for the
                    use of the Gallican clergy, and particularly those of the diocese of Arles;
                    that, about the year 570, it became famous enough to be commented upon; but that
                    all this while, and for several years longer, it had not yet acquired the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">Athanagian,</hi> but was simply styled <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Catholic Faith;</hi> that before 679 Athanasius’s admired name came in to
                    recommend and adorn it, being in itself an excellent system of the Athanasian
                    principles of the Trinity and incarnation, in opposition chiefly to the Arians,
                    Macedonians, and Apollinarians. Such is the hypothesis of the learned author of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Critical History of the Athanasian Creed.</hi> As to the
                    reception of this creed in the Christian churches, we find that it obtained in
                    France in the time of Hinemar, or about 850; that it was received in Spain about
                    100 years later than in France, and in Germany much about the same time. As to
                    our own country, we have clear and positive proofs of this creed being sung
                    alternately in our churches in the 10th century. It was in common use in some
                    parts of Italy, particularly in the diocese of Verona, about the year 960, and
                    was received at Rome about the year 1014. As to the Greek and oriental churches,
                    it has been questioned whether any of them ever received this creed at all;
                    though some very considerable writers are of a contrary persuasion. It appears,
                    then, that the reception of this creed has been both general and ancient, and it
                    may vie with any, in that respect, except the Nicene or Constantinopolitan, the
                    only general creed common to all the churches. As to its matter, it is given as
                    a summary of the true orthodox 'aith, and a condemnation of all heresies ancient
                    and modern. Unhappily, however, it has proved a fruitful source of unprofitable
                    controversy and unchristian animosity.</p>
