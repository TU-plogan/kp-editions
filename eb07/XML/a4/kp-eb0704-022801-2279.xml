                <p><label type="entry">AUSTRIAN ITALY</label>.</p>
                <p>We now enter on a very different scene; for nothing can exhibit a stronger
                    contrast than the portion of Italy subject to Austria, and the mountainous
                    provinces which separate it from the rest of the empire. In treaties and other
                    public acts, this country is styled the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom, from its two
                    great divisions, situated respectively to the east and west of the river Mincio,
                    which, flowing from north to south, divides the country into two nearly equal
                    parts. Lombardy, or the western province, is called the government of Milan;
                    while the province to the east of the Mincio is the government of Venice. Each
                    government is further divided into delegations, each of the extent of our
                    middle-sized counties, as follows:</p>

                <p>Cômo 8,000</p>
                <p>The amount of town population exhibited in this listis far beyond that of any
                    other portion of the Austrian empire; and the same holds in regard to the
                    agriculture and manufactures of this interesting country. Its extent is 18,000
                    square miles, about two thirds of that of Ireland, and it is level almost
                    throughout; its large and beautiful plains extending with little interruption
                    from the Ticino or Tesin on the western frontier, to Venice on the east, a
                    distance of 200 miles. The soil, naturally rich, is so much improved by
                    centuries of cultivation, that it has been frequently called the garden of
                    Europe. The warmth of the climate makes irrigation the chief <hi rend="italic"
                    >desideratum</hi> with the husbandman, and his labours for that purpose are
                    greatly facilitated by the number of rivers and streams flowing from the Alps
                    across extensive plains to the Po. Wheat, maize, rice, and vines, are the
                    principal products, to which are to be added silk, flax, and hemp. The pastures
                    also are rich and extensive. The chief exports are corn, cattle, silk, wool, and
                    fruits.</p>
                <p>The population of Austrian Italy is nearly four and a half millions. It was under
                    the control of France during eighteen years, from 1796 to 1814. It was then
                    re-occupied by the Austrians, and erected into a kingdom, which, thoùgh declared
                    to be inseparable from the Austrian crown, has a constitution of its own, with a
                    prince of the imperial family at its head having the title of viceroy. Its
                    revenue is larger in proportion to its extent than that of any other part of the
                    empire except Vienna and its district. Venice is the city of the north of Italy
                    which has the least partaken of prosperity in the present age; a natural
                    consequence of its loss of sovereignty in 179∙'∙ But it is now declared a free
                    port by the Austrian government; and the inhabitants have hopes of recovering, ⅛
                    some degree, the commercial activity of former ages.</p>
                <p>After this description of particular portions of the empire, we shall proceed to
                    state what is common to the whole under the following heads :—Physical Aspect,
                    Soil, and Climate; Products, Manufactures, and Trade; National Income; Military
                    Establishment; Religion, Education, and National Character; Government and Laws;
                    Foreign Politics.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physical Aspect, Soil, and Climate.</hi></p>
                <p>Of the rivers in the Austrian territory, by far the most interesting is the
                    Danube. Before entering the imperial <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192292"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-2292-0229"/>dominions, it receives a number of rivers flowing
                    northward from the Alps, of which the principal are the Inn, the Iser, the
                    Iller, and the Leck. It next receives the Ens, and flows eastward with a full
                    stream, varying in breadth from a quarter to half a mile. It is bordered
                    throughout this part of its course by high grounds or ridges of mountains, the
                    distance of which from the water is generally greater on the south than on the
                    north side. It is of sufficient depth to bear barges and large boats throughout
                    the whole Austrian territory, and in Hungary it admits vessels of considerable
                    size. Its navigation, however, is not easy, its banks being in various parts
                    steep and rocky; while in the level countries, in which its waters are more
                    widely spread, its bed is often encumbered with shoals. The use of sails has not
                    yet been introduced on the Danube to the extent practised on the Rhine and the
                    Vistula; and as the application of steam to navigation on this river is still in
                    its infancy, the alternative in the case of boats going up the stream is to tow
                    them along the banks; but both the towing tracks and the boats are as yet in a
                    very rude state. Unluckily for the commerce of Austria, the course of the Danube
                    is towards countries devoid of mercantile activity, and which offer no
                    encouraging markets for the produce or manufactures it might be made to
                    convey·</p>
                <p>The other great rivers in the Austrian dominions are the Save, the Drave, and the
                    Muħr, which convey to the Danube the waters from the eastern face of the Alps.
                    The Marsch or Morawa brings to it the tribute of Moravia, while the still larger
                    streams of the Theiss and Maros collect all that flow from the southern side of
                    the Carpathians. All these rivers abound with fish, and are of sufficient depth
                    to be navigable; but flowing through poor and thinly-peopled countries, they
                    have as yet been of little use in a commercial sense.</p>
                <p>Lakes and marshes are both numerous and extensive in the Austrian dominions. In
                    Styria, Tyrol, and other mountainous tracts, they are formed, as in the
                    highlands of Scotland, by water collected in valleys which, from the structure
                    of the ground, are pent up in all directions. In Hungary, Galicia, and other
                    level countries, their origin is different: they are a consequence of neglect of
                    drainage, and of that backward cultivation which prevails in almost all
                    countries until population and agricultural improvement attain a certain height.
                    It was thus that marshes, heaths, and forests covered the surface of England in
                    former ages, and that large tracts are at present lost to every useful purpose
                    along the banks of the Danube, the Theiss, the Drave, the Save, and other rivers
                    in Hungary, which inundate the country, when swelled by heavy rams or the
                    melting of the snow. To drain these low-lying tracts would require skill,
                    capital, and machinery, all of which are wanting in these poor and backward
                    countries.</p>
                <p>The other striking physical features of the Austrian territory are successive
                    chains of mountains, viz. the Alps m the south-west, and the Carpathians in the
                    north-east of the empire, all of great height and extent. In the bleak climate
                    of Norway the higher parts of mountains present little else than continued
                    sterility; but in the central and southern parts of Europe vegetation is seen to
                    rise to a great height. The base of a mountain is often covered with vines and
                    maize; the ascent with green pastures, or with wheat, barley, and similar kinds
                    of corn. The trees m the lower and middle region are often the oak, the elm, <hi
                    rend="italic">or</hi> the ash; while, in the approach towards the summit, the
                    yew and the fir are chiefly seen to brave the fury of the tempest. Many parts of
                    Tyrol, Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola, abound with picturesque views, and
                    recall to the traveller the scenery of Switzerland. Styria, in particular, has,
                    like that country, its cascades, its glaciers, its perpetual snows, and its
                    tremendous avalanches.</p>
                <p>German writers are in the habit of dividing the climate <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> of the Austrian empire into three regions or zones, viz. the northern,
                    situate between the 49th and 51st degrees of north latitude, and comprising
                    nearly the whole of Bohemia, with the high-lying parts of Hungary, Moravia,
                    Galicia, and the Buckowine; the whole extending over a surface of 70,000 square
                    miles. The weather in these countries, though colder in winter and warmer in
                    summer than in England, bears, in its average temperature, a considerable
                    resemblance both to our climate and to that of the north of France. In products
                    also there is a remarkable correspondence; wheat, barley, oats, and rye, forming
                    the great bulk of the yearly crops. The middle region of the Austrian dominions
                    is considerably more extensive; containing the whole of Lower Austria, with the
                    chief part of Upper Austria, Moravia, Hungary, Transylvania, and Galicia. It
                    extends along the entire length of the empire, and has a surface of fully
                    150,000 square miles. This vast tract lies between latitude 46° and 49°. The
                    summer and autumn heats are here much greater than in England; and, in addition
                    to wheat and other products mentioned above, vines and maize are cultivated in
                    favourable situations, as in the middle part of France. Lastly comes the
                    southern region, extending from latitude 46° to 42°, and comprising Lombardy,
                    the Venetian States, the coasts of Croatia and Dalmatia, with the southern line
                    of Sclavonia, and the Bannat of Temesvar. In these different countries the
                    winter lasts during two or three months only, and the cold seldom exceeds that
                    of our month of March. Here are raised not only maize and vines, but olives,
                    myrtles, and other southern products, as in the south of France. This
                    temperature extends over a surface of from 30,000 to 40,000 square miles.</p>
                <p>We have stated these distinctions of climate according to latitude; but it is
                    proper to add, that in no country does there exist greater difference of
                    temperature in the same latitude, in consequence of the very marked differences
                    in the elevation of the soil; one line presenting a succession of mountains, and
                    another of plains and valleys. Thus, the Alpine Provinces, with the extensive
                    tracts adjoining the Carpathian range, and the lofty barrier between Bohemia and
                    Moravia, partake of all the rigour of the north, though situated to the south of
                    latitude 49°; while Galicia and the interior of Bohemia, though to the north of
                    that line, are considerably warmer, because their surface is in general even,
                    and little elevated above the level of the sea.</p>
                <p>The average fall of rain is considerably greater in the mountains than in the
                    plains. In Vienna, and the low-lying tracts generally, 28 inches are a frequent
                    average for the year; but in the mountains it often amounts to 40 inches and
                    upwards.</p>
                <p>It remains to state how the summer heats in Austria are considerably greater than
                    in the same latitude in England, while the cold of winter is often more intense.
                    In this country, and still more in Ireland, the vicinity of the ocean induces a
                    frequency of rain, with a medium degree of heat and cold in the prevailing
                    winds, which by no means exist in Poland, Austria, or any country in the
                    interior of the continent. But the transitions from heat to cold, and <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> are in many parts of Austria as frequent and as
                    remarkable in degree as in this country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Products, Manufactures, and Trade.</hi></p>
                <p>In a country covered in so many parts by mountains, the extent of mineral produce
                    can hardly fail to be large. Iron ore is abundant in many parts of Bohemia,
                    Upper Austria, Styria, and Carinthia; and if the quantities of tin or copper
                    hitherto wrought in these provinces be corn <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192305"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-2305-0230"/>paratively small, it is owing to most of the
                    mountain districts being as yet imperfectly explored. The mines already wrought
                    in Bohemia afford good tin, and those of Hungary excellent copper. In the latter
                    country, particularly at Schemnitz and Kremnitz, are mines of gold and silver,
                    wrought on the account of government, not from a monopolizing spirit, but
                    because without such aid it would not be practicable to secure continued
                    employment to the natives on the spot, so scanty and uncertain are the
                    returns.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Annual Produce of the Mines of Hungary.</hi></p>
                <p>Gold about L.80,000 sterling.</p>
                <p>Silver 160,000</p>
                <p>Antimony 250 tons.</p>
                <p>Lead 1,200 tons.</p>
                <p>Copper 2,000 tons.</p>
                <p>Iron 15,000 tons.</p>
                <p>Small as is the quantity of gold obtained, the mines, of Schemnitz and Kremnitz
                    are visited by foreigners for instruction in that respect, because gold is so
                    seldom found in the more improved countries of Europe. Saxony is far before
                    Austria in scientific knowledge, but its mines are of silver, not of gold;
                    exactly as those of Cornwall are of tin and copper, to the exclusion of the
                    precious metals. The companies lately formed in England for working the gold
                    mines of Brazil have derived useful information from the mines of Hungary.</p>
                <p>A far more important mineral than silver ore, we mean coal, has been found in
                    many parts of the Austrian dominions, in Bohemia, Moravia, Austria Proper,
                    Hungary, and Styria; but the quantity raised is large only in situations
                    contiguous to a navigable river. One of the main sources of the superiority of
                    England to other countries, has been the ease of conveying coal in former ages
                    by sea, and latterly also by canals and railways, to situations where fuel is of
                    importance for manufactures. But in a country like Austria, which has no coast,
                    where canals are almost unknown, and railways have been heard of only of late,
                    the opportunities of such conveyance are as yet very rare. This, joined to the
                    abundance of wood fuel, has prevented the working of many coal mines; but they
                    bid fair to be a source of general employment to the lower classes, and of
                    advantage to those who manage them when manufactures shall be conducted on a
                    larger scale, and the communications assimilated to those of England or the
                    Netherlands.</p>
                <p>Similar observations apply to the raising and distributing of rock salt, mines of
                    which are found in various parts of the empire. Those of Bochnia and Wieliecka
                    in Galicia are known to be the greatest in Europe. A number of others are found
                    along each side of the great Carpathian range, and may be said to extend with
                    greater or less intervals all the way from Moldavia to Suabia. This very
                    extensive tract comprehends the salt mines of Wallachia, Transylvania, Galicia,
                    Upper Hungary, Upper Austria, Styria, Salzburg, and finally of Tyrol. They are
                    found either at the base or on the ascent of great mountains, the salt extending
                    in horizontal or undulating strata, and alternating with strata of clay.</p>
                <p>To an English traveller agriculture appears in a very backward state, even in the
                    best provinces of Austria. Capital has as yet been applied to it on a very
                    limited scale, .while the ploughs and other implements in use are much inferior
                    to those of England. Add to this, that scientific instruction in agriculture,
                    though the subject of various publications in the Protestant part of Germany, is
                    in a manner unknown in Austria and the Catholic countries in the south. Nowhere,
                    however, is there a fairer field tor improved husbandry, for no part of Europe
                    presents a greater extent of good soil. Lower Austria has, like Lombardy, the
                    advantage of extensive plains watered by streams flowing from a range of
                    mountains which form the background of the prospect contemplated by those who
                    travel along the banks of the Danube. Moravia has a similar climate, and almost
                    equal advantages of soil and position. Galicia is likewise fertile, the most so
                    perhaps of any of the Polish provinces; while in the south and east of the
                    empire many of the plains of Hungary and Transylvania might be rendered
                    productive were the population more dense, and acquainted with the method of
                    draining, irrigating, and properly tilling the ground. The land of second rate
                    fertility is in the Alpine provinces. The slopes of the mountains, up to a
                    certain height, are favourable to pasture, and the raising of oats and other
                    like grain; but in many parts the height is so great as to outweigh the
                    advantage of latitude, and to confine the inhabitants to a scanty return for
                    their labour.</p>

                <p>This table suggests several conclusions of importance. First, the proportion of
                    land altogether uncultivated is nearly equal in the three countries; the
                    mountains of Scotland, the bogs of Ireland, and the commons of England,
                    containing a surface corresponding to that of the high mountains in the Alpine
                    provinces of Austria, and the marshes and sandy levels of Hungary. But the
                    proportion of land covered with forests, and thus lost to useful cultivation, is
                    far greater in France, and still more in the Austrian empire, than in this
                    country. The inducement to convert such land into pasture is far greater in
                    Britain and Ireland, in consequence of our numerous population, and the high
                    price of butcher-meat, wool, and hides. To this is to be added a very different
                    consideration, viz. that the facility with which all our large towns are
                    supplied with coal makes it quite unnecessary to keep up forests, as on the
                    continent, for the purpose of fuel.</p>
                <p>Next, as to the land under tillage, the great proportion of such in France is
                    owing to the lower orders living almost wholly on bread and vegetables, to the
                    exclusion of animal food. In Austria the proportion of land in tillage is equal
                    to that in Great Britain; but ithere is the greatest difference in the nature of
                    the cultivation, the produce in even the best districts of Lower Austria being
                    thirty per cent, less than would be obtained from similar soils in this country.
                    In the nature of the produce there is a considerable resemblance, the bulk of it
                    in either country consisting of wheat, barley, oats, rye, pease, beans,
                    potatoes, along with flax and hemp. Of rye, the proportion raised is larger in
                    Austria; that of potatoes much smaller. Maize is raised in the southern
                    provinces of Austria, as of France, and is said to yield much more nourishment
                    for either <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192318" xml:id="kp-eb0704-2318-0231"/>men
                    or horses than could be obtained from wheat on a similar soil. ' ' <hi

                <p>The northern parts of the empire, viz. Bohemia, Galicia, and part of Moravia, are
                    too cold for vines; but in the central part of the empire they are cultivated
                    extensively, and wine is sold in large quantities for home consumption. The
                    prices of the different qualities vary from sixpence to one shilling a bottle.
                    The port is far inferior to that obtained from France, in consequence chiefly of
                    the want of conveyance. Lower Austria and Hungary, the fittest countries for the
                    vine, have navigable rivers only to the eastward, and these lead to countries
                    which either raise wine for their own use, or are too poor to make purchases
                    from their neighbours. The exports from the Austrian states are thus limited to
                    small quantities of choice wines, such as the well-known Tokay, which is raised
                    on the last chain of the Carpathians, near the district of Zemplin. This wine is
                    cultivated alonğ a tract of about seventy square miles: its qualities are
                    various; the richest kind proceeding from the grape with little or no pressure;
                    while the inferior sort is said to be made from the dried grape, reduced into a
                    sort of pap, and mixed with other Hungarian wines. But it by no means follows
                    that all the wine sold under the fashionable name of Tokay is the product of the
                    district in question; for, even in Vienna, there is not perhaps a tenth of real
                    Tokay among the wines which bear that name.</p>
                <p>Manufactures have in the last and present age received considerable extension in
                    the Austrian dominions. They are still, however, on a footing very different
                    from those of our country. In England they are generally conducted on the plan
                    of particular towns or districts restricting themselves to specific branches; as
                    Manchester to cottons and Birmingham to hardware. Hence our minute division of
                    employment, our nicety in workmanship, and the surprising quantities produced.
                    But in Austria the case is different: woollens, linen, hardware, and of late
                    years cottons, are made in almost every place of considerable population; a sure
                    proof that their establishments are on a small scale, and that they avail
                    themselves very imperfectly of local advantages or of the division of labour. In
                    many parts, indeed, weaving and other sedentary work is performed in cottages,
                    as was the case in England a century ago. Spinning wool and flax has from time
                    immemorial been the habitual employment of the lower class of females in
                    Germany; and still continues to be so, notwithstanding the competition of
                    machinery. Linens are woven in every province of the empire; but the finest
                    qualities are made in Lower Austria, Moravia, and certain parts of Bohemia.
                    These countries supply little for export beyond the limits of the empire, but a
                    great deal to the adjacent provinces. Woollens also are a very general
                    manufacture throughout the empire. As to hardware, the mines in the mountainous
                    districts supply an ample store of materials, the manufacture of which takes
                    place partly on the spot, partly in the larger towns, such as Vienna, Prague,
                    and Karlsbad. Bohemia is remarked for the number of its glass works, a
                    consequence of fuel being cheap in several districts which have the advantage of
                    water conveyance. Hungary, Transylvania, and the Buckowine, having extensive
                    pastures, as well as forests containing vast herds of cattle in a wild state,
                    hides are an article of export from the same cause as in the thinly-peopled
                    provinces of Russia or the wilds of Buenos Ayres. A very different object of
                    trade, paper, is also made to a considerable extent in the Austrian states, in
                    consequence of the cheapness of linen rags.</p>
                <p>All these are manufactures of old date; but cottons are comparatively of recent
                    introduction, and are confined to ιenna and some of the principal towns. The
                    cheapness of labour is in favour of such undertakings in Austria; the obstacles
                    to it are the distance which the raw material, whether landed at Trieste or at
                    Hamburg, must be brought by land, as well as the inferiority of the machinery to
                    that of England.</p>
                <p>Comparing these different manufactures with those of an improved country like
                    England, we find the foreign articles generally higher in price and more homely
                    in appearance, but at the same time more durable than ours. This distinction is
                    found to hold in regard to fabrics the most different in their nature; the
                    muskets made in Germany and France being heavier, exactly as their woollens,
                    cottons, and linens, are thicker than ours. Lightness of workmanship and
                    dispatch in completing an article are the result of long practice: the
                    comparatively limited experience of foreigners, and their imperfect subdivision
                    of work, require both longer time and a larger consumption of raw materials.</p>
                <p>In her intercourse with foreign countries, Austria experiences all the
                    disadvantages of an inland position, and of a very limited access to the sea;
                    the portion of coast belonging to her being in a corner of the empire. Its
                    extent is about 500 miles, comprising the north and east shores of the Adriatic,
                    from the mouths of the Po on the west, to Ragusa and Cattaro on the east. The
                    commercial sea-ports are Venice, Trieste, and Fiume; the first being the inlet
                    to Friuli and Lombardy, the second to Carniola, and the third to Croatia. From
                    Venice the access to the interior is easy, the country being flat, and admitting
                    of intersection by canals; but Fiume, and still more Trieste, have to the east
                    ranges of mountains, over which the transport of bulky commodities is attended
                    with great labour and expense. Roads to the interior have been made at the
                    public charge; and it is said that the canal now making from Vienna to the
                    southward may perhaps be continued until it connect the Danube with the
                    Adriatic; but that must be the work of a future age, and of means far greater
                    than can be applied to it by any mercantile association, the distance being
                    fully 300 miles along a line on which, if the mountains be avoided, it would be
                    indispensable to erect aqueducts over the numerous rivers that flow from them.
                    The expense of so vast a work could be defrayed only by the government; who,
                    aware that improved roads are more useful for military purposes than canals, are
                    likely to prefer that mode of employing the funds of the public.</p>
                <p>Venice was made a free port by the Austrian government in 1830, and the
                    inhabitants have hopes of recovering in some degree their former prosperity.
                    Trieste is a port of considerable activity; the shipping belonging to it exceeds
                    100,000 tons, manned by about 6000 seamen.</p>
                <p>The harbours along the coast of Dalmatia are both numerous and commodious, but
                    their trade must be inconsiderable until the country inland acquire population
                    and wealth. In the northern part of the Austrian empire there are also great
                    obstacles to foreign trade. Bohemia communicates with the sea only by the Elbe,
                    and Galicia with still more difficulty by the Vistula. Here there are vast
                    tracts of level country, alike favourable for canals and for improved roads; but
                    the distance to the sea from even the northern line of the Austrian territory is
                    great,—almost 200 miles to the Baltic, and 300 to the German Ocean.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">National Income and Finances.</hi></p>
                <p>In commercial countries, like England and Holland, the public revenue arises
                    principally from the excise and customs; but in a country chiefly agricultural,
                    such as France, and still more Austria, the case is very different. In these the
                    limited extent of foreign trade renders the customs comparatively small; while
                    the small number of towns, and.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192331" xml:id="kp-eb0704-2331-0232"/>
                <p>their scanty population, lessen greatly the produce of the excise. An extra share
                    of the public burdens must therefore fall on land, the assessment of which ought
                    from time to time to be altered according to the amount of rents.' In England,
                    since the first imposition of the land-tax in 1692, there has been no renewed
                    survey, or attempt to adapt it to the augmented rental; but in France and
                    Austria the absolute insufficiency of other taxes rendered an increase of the
                    land-tax indispensable, and the <hi rend="italic">foncière</hi> in France is now
                    collected on a valuation made so lately as 1815. In Austria, the emperor Joseph,
                    among other changes, proposed a land and poll-tax on a uniform plan, and
                    attempted a general survey of the empire. Several years were devoted to this
                    great work; but it encountered many obstacles, as well from the difference of
                    value between the plain and mountain territory, as from the difficulty of
                    computing rents in almost any province of the empire, the property of the
                    peasantry obliging them to pay their landlords in produce or in labour instead
                    of money. Since 1815 the Austrian government has endeavoured to correct defects
                    in the existing assessment, but it is still in a very imperfect state. In the
                    Hereditary States, as well as in Bohemia and Galicia, the land-tax is levied
                    without distinction of class or rank; but in the aristocratic countries of

                    arising from the rent of land and houses throughout the empire; but as the two
                    together can hardly amount to thirty millions sterling a year, perhaps not to
                    twenty-five millions, it follows that of all income in Austria arisinθ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> from real property, L.20 in L.100 are paid, even in
                    time of peace, to the public treasury. The poll-tax on the Jews is a toleration
                    tax. The next head in the list, viz. the inland customs, arises chiefly from the
                    difference in taxation between Hungary and the Hereditary States. Dues are
                    consequently collected on the transit of certain articles from one to another,
                    as was the case between different provinces in France before the revolution. The
                    duty on salt, though not high, is injurious both to agriculture and
                    manufactures, by limiting the consumption. As to tobacco, there is no duty in
                    Hungary and Transylvania; but in the rest of the empire the government, like
                    that of France, keeps in its own hands the exclusive manufacture and sale.</p>
                <p>The tax on liquors, slight in its rate, is small in its produce, from the limited
                    population of the towns: in country parts, where the population is thin, the
                    excise does not repay the expense of collecting. But nothing in the fiscal list
                    is more interesting to a statistical inquirer than the net receipts from the
                    post-office, which in this country are L. 1,200,000 a year; in France L.600,000;
                    in Austria only L.100,000. What can show more clearly the limited correspondence
                    and the scanty traffic of this great empire, or that the badness of the roads is
                    productive of an expense which more than balances the low wages and general
                    cheapness in the post-office establishment?</p>
                <p>The imperial demesnes or crown lands yield about L.200,000 to the treasury, a sum
                    to be carefully distinguished from the personal property of the reigning family,
                    of which the yearly rental amounts to about L.100,000.</p>
                <p>Among the lesser imposts in Austria, not specified in the above table, are those
                    on carriages, pleasure-horses, hair-powder, starch, as well as legacy-duties,
                    and fees on titles of nobility. The list of taxes, in short, is nearly as long
                    in Austria as in England, and the complaint of their pressure almost as general.
                    What, then, are the causes that, with so fertile a soil and so numerous a
                    population, the public revenue of Austria should be so inferior to that of
                    France? The inquiry is interesting, and the causes are briefly as follow.</p>
                <p>In manufacturing and commercial countries, such as England or the Netherlands,
                    agriculture is conducted with the benefit of capital and machinery; and the
                    labour of 30 or 40 persons in 100 is sufficient to raise subsistence for the
                    community at large. But in the other countries of Europe the case is very
                    different, the labour of half or of more than half the inhabitants being
                    required to raise the needful subsistence. Thus in France, a great part of which
                    is more backward than an untravelled Englishman can readily conceive, between 50
                    and 60 persons in 100 are and must be employed in country work, in consequence
                    of the great inferiority of their agriculture, their farms being small, their
                    ploughs and other implements miserably defective, their capital scanty, and
                    machinery, such as threshing-mills, in a manner unknown. Hungary, Transylvania,
                    and the southern frontier along the Danube, being still more backward than any
                    part of France, more destitute of capital, and more deficient in machinery, the
                    consequence is, that of the average population of the Austrian empire, the
                    labour of not fewer than between 60 and 70 persons in 100 is needed for raising
                    provisions; thus reducing to a comparatively small number the population of the
                    towns, the persons disposable for trade and manufacture. This is at once
                    apparent from a comparison of the town population in these different countries.
                    If we make it between France and England, we shall obtain a result decidedly
                    favourable to England; but a comparison of France and Austria exhibits, in
                    almost every case, <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> greater number in the towns of

                <p>Gratz 35,000</p>
                <p>Of the twelve places cited above for the Austrian dominions, no less than five
                    are in Italy, so deficient is the rest of the empire in town population. Of the
                    total number of its inhabitants (33,000,000), it is computed that three fourths,
                    or 25,000,000, reside in the open country.</p>
                <p>Another very important point in estimating the resources of different countries,
                    is the degree of density in the population generally. In England, by the census
                    of this year (1831) it is nearly 220 persons to a square mile; in France, about
                    165; in the Austrian empire, under 130. Now it almost always happens that in a
                    thickly-peopled district the wages are better and the consumption of taxed
                    articles greater, per head, than in one that is thinly peopled; and hence the
                    contribution to the public treasury is larger. Thus the inhabitants of Lombardy,
                    Bohemia, and the Vienna district, pay considerably more per head than those of
                    Hungary, Carinthia, or Upper Austria. Add to this, in the third place, that
                    while England has all the benefit of an insular situation, and France possesses
                    an extensive line of coast, with considerable trade, the maritime provinces of
                    Austria are both limited in extent, and but recently acquired; in short, the
                    empire may be said to have as yet wanted almost entirely the stimulus to
                    industry arising from communication by water. In the fourth and last place, in
                    the remote provinces of the Austrian empire, particularly on the side of Turkey,
                    the contributions of the subjects to their sovereign are made, not in money, but
                    in military service.</p>
                <p>All these reasons tend to one point: they account for the <hi rend="italic">money
                    payment</hi> i∏ name of taxes and all public burdens m Austria not exceeding
                    twelve shillings a head, whilst in France it is double; and for the net revenue
                    of the Austrian empire not exceeding thirteen millions sterling, while that of
                    1rance is above thirty millions. Accordingly, in forming a <hi rend="italic"
                    >bona fide</hi> estimate of their resources, we have to make an addition on the
                    side of Austria on two grounds: first, for the greater value of money in that
                    country; and next, for the frontier provinces discharging their contribution to
                    the state by military service in lieu of taxes. It follows, that in estimating
                    the financial means of the two countries, we shall not materially err in
                    assuming them to bear the proportion of twenty to thirty; in other words, that
                    were the total contribution of the subjects of the emperor to be discharged in
                    money, and in money of the value borne by the circulating medium of France, it
                    would amount to about twenty millions sterling a year.</p>
                <p>Austria, like England, has a sinking fund, and one of which the operations are
                    equally vaunted; but in either country the only true sinking fund is the
                    extension of the national industry, and a reduction of the interest of the debt
                    consequent on continued peace, and on a general abatement in the interest of
                    money.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Military Establishment.</hi></p>
                <p>Austria has taken so prominent a part in the wars of the last and of the present
                    age, that the nature and extent of her military means are subjects of great
                    interest. The disposition of the inhabitants of Hungary, and of the more remote
                    provinces of the empire, is well adapted to a military life. They are accustomed
                    to pass their time out of doors, to indulge in active exercise, to follow-the
                    chase, and to occupy themselves with the care of horses. To such men marching
                    and encamping are but a slight deviation from their established habits. The fire
                    of the nightly watch is not more uncomfortable than that of their smoky
                    cottages; whilst a loaf of bread, a slice of coarse pork, and a glass of
                    spirits, are all the food and drink they desire. But to accustom these rude
                    combatants to the restraints of discipline was found no easy task: still the
                    Austrian government judged it indispensable to their meeting on equal terms the
                    armies of France and Prussia. It is now somewhat more than a century since the
                    Prussians began to take a lead in military discipline, the father of Frederick
                    II. having carried both the manual and platoon exercise to a nicety unattempted
                    by almost any other tactician. He left a highly disciplined army of nearly
                    80,000 men to his son, who, on the death of the emperor Charles VI. in 1740,
                    conceived that such a force would soon enable him to accomplish the conquest of
                    Silesia. He lost no time in making preparations for war. The court of Vienna,
                    alarmed, sent a special envoy to dissuade him from it; but Frederick was not to
                    be deterred by any remonstrances, however urgent. The envoy adverting, on the
                    one hand, to the careful training of the Prussians, and on the other to the
                    recent practice of the Austrians in the field, declared to the king, “<hi
                    rend="italic">Vos troupes, Sire,</hi><hi rend="italic">sont</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">belles,</hi><hi rend="italic">mais les nôtres ont vu le loup.”
                    “Vous convenez,”</hi> replied the king, “<hi rend="italic">que mes troupes sont
                    belles, je vous ferai convenir qu'elles sont bonnes.”</hi> The words of the king
                    were made good; the events of the war which ensued, as well as of the more
                    arduous contest begun in 1756, having proved, on many trying occasions, the
                    great advantage of a high state of discipline. This led the Austrian generals
                    and war ministers to follow the example of the Prussians, as well by carefully
                    training their infantry, as by new-modelling the “free corps” of horsemen,
                    Croats, Sclavonians, and Hungarians, who had hitherto been left to their
                    national mode of fighting. By dint of perseverance, Marshal Lascy and other
                    military men in Austria succeeded at last in bringing these half-civilized
                    combatants under the discipline of regular cavalry.</p>
                <p>The French, in the wars of the revolution, were remarkable for celerity of
                    movement in collective bodies, but bestowed comparatively little attention on
                    the <hi rend="italic">minutiae</hi> of discipline. The Austrians were charged
                    with following a contrary system; with too much care as to details, and too
                    little as to general movements. Their lines are said to have suffered on various
                    occasions, in particular in the dreadful conflicts at Essling and Wagram, from
                    continued exposure to the field-pieces of the enemy; and their infantry was said
                    to be slow in executing most movements except those from front to rear. Their
                    own officers, however, did not admit this inferiority; and whatever may have
                    been the case in the last age, there is reason to believe that the Austrians
                    have now attained that celerity of movement which has so long distinguished
                    their rivals in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192357" xml:id="kp-eb0704-2357-0234"
                    />France and Prussia, and which became so conspicuous in our own troops after
                    their first campaigns in Spain..</p>
                <p>In former times the Austrian government, conscious of the deficient education of
                    its subjects, gave important commands to Italian officers, amongst whom the most
                    remarkable were Montecuculi and Prince Eugene. At present there are military
                    schools at Vienna and several of the provincial towns; and as these have of late
                    been much improved, another generation will probably witness the removal of the
                    charge of deficient instruction from the Austrian armies.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary here to enter into any particulars regarding either the
                    absolute numerical strength, or the relative apportionment and distribution of
                    the Austrian military establishment, at the present time, seeing that these
                    subjects have been already treated of under the proper head in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Army,</hi> where detailed information, derived from the most
                    authentic sources, is given respecting the constitution, organization,
                    discipline, divisions, and numbers of this establishment, as well as of its
                    different branches or arms separately. In referring to the above article,
                    however, it is proper to add, that recent events, particularly the contest in
                    Poland, coupled with the actual state of affairs in France, Italy, and the
                    Netherlands, have produced a considerable augmentation of the disposable
                    military force of Austria. (June 1831.)</p>
                <p>In most of the provinces of the Austrian empire the levies are at first made for
                    militia service <hi rend="italic">llandweìcr),</hi> and the regular regiments
                    are kept up by successive draughts from that force. But in Hungary, recruits are
                    raised at once for the regular service, the emperor proposing a specific number
                    to the diet, who deliberate on the demand; and on its being assented to, the
                    magnates or great landholders undertake to levy their respective proportions on
                    their estates.</p>
                <p>The horses for the Austrian light cavalry are drawn from Hungary and Galicia;
                    those for the heavy cavalry chiefly from Bohemia and Moravia. Clothing, arms,
                    ammunition, and harness, are all furnished at different stations, in Bohemia,
                    Moravia, and the Hereditary States. The duration of military service in Austria
                    was long unlimited; but in the early part of the present century it was reduced,
                    as in this country, to specific periods. For invalids and veteran soldiers there
                    is a provision similar to what is made for our military; they are either
                    received into hospitals or allowed small out-pensions.</p>
                <p> The limited revenue of Austria, and her equally limited •credit in a financial
                    sense, prevent her from making a great military exertion at short notice. She
                    cannot, unless when aided by English subsidies, equip for offensive operations,
                    or send to a distance, armies of any very considerable force. Hence her power in
                    attack is restricted so as to form a remarkable contrast to the extent of her
                    means for continuing a contest by filling up the blanks in her regiments, year
                    after year, by fresh levies. In her long and arduous struggle with France, the
                    losses of each campaign appeared to be supplied without making a serious
                    impression on her numbers, or distressing her productive industry. The causes of
                    this are obvious. A country like England, possessing monied capital, can at
                    short notice embody an army, and send it to a distance, amply equipped and
                    provided; whilst an agricultural nation like Austria is limited in its extent of
                    exertion at the moment, but, from the amount of its population, almost
                    indefinite in. its resources. The long duration of several of her wars is to be
                    ascribed to two causes; her inability, on. the one hand, to overpower her
                    opponents by a great effort; and her power, on the other, to keep up a certain
                    degree of exertion for a long period. It was thus that Austria carried on the
                    contest in Germany about religion during thirty years, and persisted in the war
                    with France in 1713, after England and Holland had’withdrawn. Maria Theresa
                    would have done the same towards Prussia in 1763, had she not been forsaken by
                    her allies; whilst, in the wars with revolutionary France and Buonaparte, we
                    have seen Austria, worsted in five successive contests, return as often to the
                    charge.</p>
                <p>The Austrian navy is as yet merely in an incipient! state, but is entitled to
                    notice, because the possession of <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Venice,
                    Trieste, and the fine harbours along the coast of Dalmatia, hold out a prospect
                    of its being, in course of time, considerably increased. At present it is
                    confined to a few ships of the line, dismantled or cut down, eight frigates, as
                    many corvettes, and about twenty brigs and sloops. Venice is the naval
                    station.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Peligion, Education, National Character.</hi></p>
                <p>The population of the Austrian empire, classed according to their respective
                    creeds, will stand thus: Catholics 26,000,000, Protestants 3,000,000, Greek
                    church 3,000,000, Jews 500,000, other religions 500,000.</p>
                <p>Although Austria took, two centuries ago, so decided a part against the
                    Protestants in the north of Germany, her internal tranquillity was never
                    disturbed by religious contests except in Bohemia, the country of the
                    unfortunate John Huss and Jerome of Prague. Her sovereigns have been tolerant
                    from character, if not from conviction; and during the last half-century
                    indulgence to Protestants and other dissenters has existed in a liberal form.
                    The north and west of Germany frequently exhibit Catholic and Protestant
                    communities in the same vicinity; and nowhere are the superior industry and
                    intelligence of the latter more strongly marked. The traveller who passes from
                    Saxony into Bohemia cannot fail to regret that the reformation should not have
                    made its way into the Austrian dominions: the result would doubtless have been a
                    very decided advancement in science and productive industry. Literature,
                    manufactures, trade, would then have been cultivated in the south and east of
                    Germany with the same zeal, and probably the same success, as have marked their
                    progress in the south and west. At present we can hardly flatter ourselves with
                    any considerable number of converts to Protestantism. The Catholic clergy are in
                    general assiduous in the discharge of their duties: they possess the attachment
                    of their flocks; and the Austrian people at large are too little enlightened to
                    exchange a worship which dazzles the imagination by its pomp and ceremony for
                    one which appeals chiefly to the understanding.</p>
                <p>In Austria, as in France, the Catholic clergy are generally educated in humbler
                    seminaries than universities. Oratory forms no part of their studies, and would,
                    in fact, be misplaced before a German congregation, which meets for the purpose
                    of fulfilling, soberly and tranquilly, a religious duty. Sermons therefore are,
                    in almost all parts of the Austrian dominions, little more than plain moral
                    lessons deduced from the sacred writings; and the reputation of a clergyman,
                    particularly in country parts, rests chiefly on his attention to the sick, and
                    the performance of private and unostentatious duties. But while the country
                    curates and other inferior clergy are thus assiduous and unassuming, the conduct
                    of the heads of the Romish church has often been very different. Protestants who
                    have not lived in a Catholic country can hardly conceive the extent of the
                    pretensions made by the popes in former ages, or which they are still disposed
                    to make in the less enlightened parts of Europe. These the sovereigns of Austria
                    have in general resisted; reserving to themselves several important rights, such
                    as the imposing of taxes on church property, the nomination of bishops and
                    archbishops, and the option of restricting or even preventing the circulation of
                    papal bulls.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192370" xml:id="kp-eb0704-2370-0235"/>
                <p>The extent of landed property in Austria belonging to the Catholic church is very
                    considerable, as may be inferred from the number of abbeys and convents. Though
                    a good deal reduced within the last half-century, there are still nearly 300
                    abbeys and above 500 convents in the empire. The head of the Austrian church is
                    the archbishop of Vienna; but the bishop of St Polten appoints the regimental
                    chaplains, and is the superior of all clergymen doing duty with the army.</p>
                <p>The followers of the Greek church are chiefly in Galicia, Hungary, Croatia, and
                    Transylvania, forming a total of 3,000,000. They are in a state of gradual
                    increase, as well by the progress of population as by arrivals of their brethren
                    from Turkey. Galicia comprises a body of Armenian Catholics, and there are a few
                    of that sect in Hungary. The well-known association of Hernhuters or Moravians
                    took their origin from that province in the middle of the eighteenth century.
                    The emperor Joseph, in his ardour for toleration, extended it to Jews, and even
                    to Mahometans; but he found that the Jews were hardly in a state to be
                    incorporated with the rest of his subjects, or to take advantage of the
                    privileges held out to them. Their old habits and prejudices remain; so that
                    ages will be required in Austria, as in Poland and other backward parts of
                    Europe, before they can be identified with their Christian neighbours. In
                    tolerating Mahometanism, Joseph had in view the vicinity of Turkey, and the
                    importance of inducing traders from that country to travel and settle in his
                    dominions.</p>
                <p>A deficiency in national education has long been a subject of reproach to the
                    Austrians, and their apathy in regard to literature and politics is often
                    ascribed by foreigners to restraints on the press. But these restraints, slight
                    in their nature, are by no means intended to check useful inquiry. The truth is,
                    that the majority of the Austrians are occupied with the tranquil enjoyment of
                    the good things of life: they are unambitious, uninquisi-tive, and, in general,
                    satisfied with following a beaten track, with going over the same routine as
                    their fathers and forefathers. The desire of acquiring property is, of course,
                    as strong or nearly as strong in this as in other countries; but the inhabitants
                    have still to acquire that intellectual activity which stimulates so largely to
                    exertion in England, in France, and, above all, in the Protestant part of
                    Germany. Saxony is the centre of literature for that country; and the society
                    which is within the reach of a youth at the university of Vienna is not to be
                    compared to that of Dresden or Leipsic. The Austrian dialect of Germany is
                    unpleasant, having a slowness of accent and a hissing tone, particularly in the
                    mouths of the lower orders. Hence French is the language used not only at court
                    and by diplomatists, but by genteel society generally. The universities in the
                    Austrian empire are as follow: Vienna, Prague, Pesth in Hungary, Lemberg in
                    Galicia, Inspruck in Tyrol, Gratz in Styria, and Padua and Pavia in Lombardy; in
                    all eight universities, attended by nearly 7000 students. There are seven
                    academies, and thirty lyceums or high schools. Of military schools there are in
                    all ten in the empire; the two principal in Vienna, the others in provincial
                    towns. The primary or elementary schools throughout the empire correspond in
                    some measure to the parish schools in Scotland. They IVere greatly increased
                    half a century ago in the reign of oseph IL, and in the Austrian provinces they
                    appear to be adequate to the wants of the population; but in Hungary and the
                    remote parts of the empire there are still great deficiencies in the provision
                    even for this, the first stage of education. The university of Vienna dates from
                    <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi>. middle of the thirteenth century, the time when
                    the residence of the court, being fixed in that city, began to give importance
                    to it, and to call for improvements in public education. It was long under the
                    management of the clergy, who in the middle ages were the only men of letters;
                    but, a century ago, Von Swicten, the celebrated physician, induced the
                    government to take it into their own hands, and to give a great extension to the
                    medical department; Vienna, from the number of its inhabitants and the extent of
                    its hospitals, being much fitter for a medical school than any other city in
                    Germany. The consequences of Von Swicten’s representations were the fitting up
                    of a botanical garden, an anatomical theatre, a military hospital, and, at a
                    subsequent date, a veterinary school. The university of Vienna is thus at the
                    head of the medical schools in Germany. It contains also public classes for law,
                    theology, classics, philosophy, and general literature, in most of which the
                    reputation of the professors is respectable, though not greater than in other
                    universities, such as Gottingen, Leipsic, and Halle. The number of students at
                    the Vienna university is from 1200 to 1500. Vienna contains also an academy for
                    the fine arts, a seminary for the eastern languages, and facilities for the
                    study of modern Greek. Among the military institutions are a school for cadets,
                    and of late years a polytechnic school for engineers. This capital has also
                    several seminaries like the <hi rend="italic">Ecole Normale</hi> at Paris, for
                    training teachers for provincial towns and villages. The imperial library at
                    Vienna is very extensive, as is the collection of medals and coins. The
                    university of Prague is of old date, and well attended by Bohemians, but it does
                    not rank high in the scale of German seminaries. Pesth, Lemberg, Gratz, and the
                    other universities, arc of importance only to the population of their respective
                    towns and their vicinity.</p>
                <p>In travelling for instruction, the Austrians, like the French, are far behind our
                    countrymen, in consequence partly of the want of pecuniary means, partly of
                    their unambitious and uninquiring character. Individuals, however, may be cited
                    among the Austrians, who, like Baron Humboldt among the Prussians, have
                    traversed remote regions in quest of information; but their number is small when
                    compared with the extent and population of the empire. Still Austria can boast
                    of several names of eminence in literature. Of this class are the two Schlegels,
                    one of whom, Frederick, has long been known by his publications on the language
                    and philosophy of India; while his brother has acquired reputation by his
                    translation of Shakspeare and his works on dramatic criticism. Hammer, the
                    founder of the Oriental Society at Vienna, has long been known for his
                    acquaintance with Persian literature; but the majority of Austrian writers have
                    given their attention less to works of imagination than to classics, geography,
                    and statistics. These studies, requiring rather continued attention than
                    vivacity or power of imagination, are best suited to the laborious habits of the
                    Germans.</p>
                <p>In painting and sculpture, as in architecture, the Austrians have as yet made no
                    great figure; but the case is very different in regard to music. Haydn and
                    Mozart were both formed at Vienna; and it has been said with truth, that a
                    foreigner can hardly receive a higher gratification than by being present at the
                    oratorio at Vienna in commemoration of Haydn. If in vocal music the Germans are
                    inferior to the Italians, they fully maintain the competition in instrumental
                    performance. In short, the passion for music exists here in the humblest ranks,
                    and under circumstances apparently the least favourable to it. The traveller, in
                    passing through villages, observes wandering musicians performing on the most
                    homely and imperfect instruments. He finds this equally in the populous
                    districts adjoining the Danube, and in the secluded spots of Tyrol and
                    Carniola.</p>

                <p>Statistical writers class the population of the Austrian empire according to
                    national descent, thus,</p>
                <p>Of German origin 6,000,000</p>
                <p>Of Italian 5,000,000</p>
                <p>Of Jewish 500,000</p>

                <p>Of Wallachian 2,000,000</p>
                <p>The Sclavonians (called in Latin <hi rend="italic">Slavi</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Sclavi,</hi> and in their own language <hi rend="italic"
                    >Slowacs)</hi> inhabited, in remote ages, a part of the vast tract of country
                    known to the ancients by the name of Scythia. Their descendants are widely
                    spread; for their language and habits are to be traced in the Illyrian
                    provinces, in Hungary, Poland, the east of Germany, and even in the western
                    frontier of Russia. They form the most backward and uninstructed portion of the
                    population of the empire; being generally employed on common country labour, and
                    many of them being still in a state of servitude. The Wallachians are almost
                    equally backward; but the Magyars, though illiterate, are a spirited race,
                    averse to sedentary work, accustomed to exercise in the open air, and prompt in
                    obeying a summons to military duty.</p>
                <p>In Styria, Carinthia, and other mountainous tracts, the manners of the
                    inhabitants are very primitive. Content with the produce furnished by their
                    lands and cattle, and as cheerful and frank as moderate desires can make them,
                    they seem to have no wish beyond the limits of their native districts. They are,
                    it must be allowed, very ignorant and superstitious; being still blindly
                    attached to traditionary usages, and among others, to that of making pilgrimages
                    to a distance as the best means of obtaining forgiveness for trespasses.</p>
                <p>The character of the Germans in the Austrian dominions is in general entitled to
                    praise. Sincerity, industry, and habits of order, are all conspicuous in them;
                    and the number of criminal offences committed among them is remarkably small. In
                    many extensive districts year after year passes without a necessity for capital
                    punishment. The French soldiers, who, in marching through Austria, were very
                    often lodged in detached cottages, and at the mercy of the inhabitants, bore a
                    favourable testimony to their humanity; and there scarcely occurred, either
                    there or elsewhere in Germany, any example of those secret assassinations which
                    were unfortunately so prevalent in Spain.</p>
                <p>The habits of the females in Austria, in the large as in the small towns, are
                    very domestic. Without taking so active a part as French women in either
                    business or conversation, they claim regard for a steady fulfilment of the
                    duties of wives and mothers. The lower orders have similar habits; and a
                    traveller may visit village after village without hearing of a single instance
                    of domestic disquietude. The care of children, the performance of their daily
                    tasks, and punctual attendance on divine worship, seem to occupy all their
                    thoughts.</p>
                <p>A striking feature in the national character of the Austrians is a continued
                    equanimity, a general good humour and forbearance, as if they had little or no
                    cause for complaint in regard either to individual circumstances or public,
                    affairs. This fortunate disposition seems the result. of various causes; of an
                    habitual acquiescence under their superiors; an unacquaintance with the state of
                    other countries; and in fertile districts, such as the banks of the Danube, of a
                    general abundance of provisions, and an exemption from penury.</p>
                <p>* But as in national character almost every good quality has a corresponding
                    drawback, that habitual content, and aversion to change,.which has kept the
                    Austrians tranquil amidst the convulsions of other countries, is connected with
                    a blind adherence to old usages, and a disinclination to almost every kind of
                    innovation. Hence their stationary condition, their backward agriculture, their
                    slowly improving manufactures, and their extravagant deference to hereditary
                    rank—a deference often dearly paid for in war, when men of inferior talents have
                    been intrusted with important commands. On the whole, it must be admitted, that
                    no country in Europe stands more in need than Austria of the benefits arising
                    from the diffusion of knowledge. This applies to the upper as well as to the
                    lower classes. In former times the government partook of the national
                    prejudices, and exhibited strong indications of it in their conduct both in the
                    cabinet and the field. This is forcibly stated in the memoirs of one who had
                    long and arduous contests with them; we mean Frederick II. of Prussia. The court
                    of Vienna was, he said, altogether untractable in negociation, after obtaining
                    even a partial success in the field, or whenever it had any prospect of success;
                    at the same time that it evinced no discrimination in the choice of its general
                    officers. In the campaign of 1744 Frederick entered Bohemia with a strong army,
                    and soon overran the whole country; but the veteran Marshal Traun being sent
                    against him, found means, with an inferior force, so to straiten the Prussian
                    army as to oblige it to quit one_position after another, until it evacuated the
                    whole kingdom. “Yet this man,” says Frederick, “whom I have ever since regarded
                    as my master in the art of war, the court of Vienna removed next year from the
                    chief scene of operations, and sent to Italy with an inferior command.” In our
                    own days similar disappointments have been but too often caused by the Austrian
                    cabinet; in 1796, when Marshal Clairfayt was led to resign, after a very
                    brilliant campaign; and in 1805, when a great army was intrusted to General
                    Mack, who, far from having acquired a reputation, had failed in almost every
                    thing he had attempted.</p>
                <p>We should, however, err greatly were we to suppose the apparent slowness of the
                    Austrians indicative of deficiency of invention. On the contrary, their tranquil
                    and sedate habits are more favourable to original combinations than the
                    sprightliness of the French. But in Austria, as in other parts of Germany,
                    mechanical ingenuity is often applied rather to make a display of skill, or to
                    gratify a fancy, than to accomplish a useful purpose. In one part of a journey
                    through that country a traveller finds a machine so framed that, with a slight
                    impulse, it performs the functions of a chess-player; in another part he sees a
                    head which may be made to imitate the human voice; and in a third place, an
                    instrument uniting the most varied sounds of music. In machinery, as in
                    politics, the speculations of the Germans often bear evidence of considerable
                    ingenuity, but at the same time of the absence of practice and experience.</p>

                <p>Having described the constitutions of Hungary and the - other countries under
                    their respective heads, it remains! merely to state the part of the political
                    system which is’ referable to the empire at large. The executive administration
                    for the whole of the Austrian dominions is vested in the emperor, and is
                    exercised at Vienna in nearly the same manner as that of France and England in
                    their respective capitals. At Vienna, as in London and Paris, the chief public
                    offices are the treasury, the home department, the foreign affairs, and the
                    army; to which are to be added, the boards for the affairs of Hungary, and for
                    the general superintendence of the mines. The name of Aulic is not confined, as
                    is generally supposed, to the military board; it is given to several councils or
                    boards, among others to that of the treasury.</p>

                <p>The Germanic confederation bore, as is well known, during many centuries, the
                    name and form of an empire, consisting of a number of separate states, of which
                    Austria was by far the greatest. Her dominions in Germany comprised Bohemia,
                    Moravia, and Silesia, in addition to the circle of Austria,'which contained
                    Austria Proper, Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola; hence the successive election,
                    during nearly four centuries, of the head of the house of Austria to the rank of
                    the emperor of Germany. This dignity being renounced by Francis IL, the present
                    sovereign, in 1806, the connection of Austria with the rest of Germany on the
                    previous footing was dissolved: nor was it renewed in the final adjustments of
                    1815, by which the Germanic body was declared a confederation, but not an
                    empire; for it has no longer an acknowledged head, questions affecting the
                    confederation at large being discussed in the diet or assembly of deputies from
                    the different states, and determined by a majority of votes. Each confederate
                    state is pledged to supply, when required by the diet, a military force
                    proportioned to its population. Austria having in Germany a population of ten
                    millions, her quota in time of war is nearly 100,000 men; that of Prussia is
                    80,000.</p>
                <p>Since the abrogation of the imperial form in Germany, the “Circle of Austria” is
                    no longer an official designation; but the name of“Hereditary States,” so often
                    used, has reference to the same provinces, viz. Austria Proper, Styria,
                    Carinthia, and Carniola, which during five centuries and upwards have belonged
                    to the house of Hapsburg by hereditary descent. In these the authority of the
                    emperor, though exercised with mildness, is almost uncontrolled. He is the head
                    not only of the executive power, but of the church, and virtually of the
                    legislature. The Hereditary States have parliaments, composed, as in Hungary and
                    Bohemia, of the Catholic prelates and the nobility, with deputies from the
                    landholders and free towns; but they meet seldom, and never fail to give a ready
                    assent to the propositions of the sovereign.</p>
                <p>There exists considerable diversity in the constitutions of the component parts
                    of the Austrian empire, particularly in regard to their origin and date. The
                    constitution of Lower Austria is founded on a charter granted so long ago as the
                    year 1156. Hungary claims to be governed by laws of still older date, the first
                    going back to the ninth century, others dating from the thirteenth; while in
                    Bohemia, con-irmations of the privileges of the nobility, and restrictions on
                    the executive power, were enacted so lately as the seventeenth and eighteenth
                    centuries. Galicia, differing in several respects from these countries, traces
                    part of its political constitution no farther back than its annexation to
                    Austria in 1773. Notwithstanding all these discrepancies, it is in one quarter
                    only, we mean Italy, that the sovereign of Austria has to apprehend deficient
                    loyalty on the part of his subjects. In the other states of his empire, however
                    remote from each other, however different in language or national manners, the
                    prevailing feeling is attachment to the government and aversion to change.
                    Nothing could show this more clearly than the steady loyalty of the people
                    during the repeated invasions of the french, and their ready assent to the
                    levies which year after year filled up the blanks in the imperial regiments,
                    caused by a contest at all times sanguinary, and often unsuccessful. And even as
                    to Italy, although the mountains which separate it from the north are as lofty
                    and <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ⅝ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> ged on the
                    side of Austria as of France, there are in tie former no intermediate states
                    like Switzerland and ledmont; and hence the ease with which an army may march
                    from Germany to Lombardy, and the promptitude <hi rend="superscript"> wι</hi> Hl
                    which it may put down insurrection.</p>
                <p>1he judicial body in Austria is far more numerous than in this country, the
                    difficulty in travelling requiring that there should be courts of justice in a
                    great number of provincial towns. Their salaries are greatly below our scale,
                    the profits of pleaders being too small to disincline even the most eminent from
                    relinquishing their business. The administration of justice in Austria long took
                    place, as in this country, by reference to ancient usage, and to a multitude of
                    decisions, without much system or consideration of general principles. The
                    perplexity attendant on this vague and undefined course being doubly felt in a
                    country where individuals were in general ignorant, and the press inefficient,
                    the government became aware, so long ago as the middle of last century, of the
                    necessity of publishing the laws in a collective form. Accordingly, in the year
                    1767, a code was published in eight folio volumes. This was a first step towards
                    improvement; but the work, from its bulk and its deficient arrangement, proving
                    of little use, instructions were given by the government to an eminent civilian
                    named Von Horten, to recast it in a condensed and improved form. This was
                    necessarily a work of great time and labour, and it was not till 1794 that the
                    first part of the civil code came forth in an improved shape. The remainder
                    followed in a few years, when printed copies were distributed in all directions,
                    and local commissions appointed to report on its applicability to the usages of
                    the different provinces of the empire. At last, in 1812, the civil code was
                    definitively promulgated, and applied to practice. With the criminal code a
                    similar course had been adopted somewhat earlier; it had been promulgated in
                    1803, and introduced into practice the year after. Fortunately, the number of
                    criminal offences in Austria is small compared with the magnitude of the
                    population.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Foreign Politics of Austria.</hi></p>
                <p>We shall conclude this account of Austria with a few remarks on her situation in
                    regard to the great powers who are her neighbours. To begin with France: It is
                    now about three centuries since Austria, by the definitive acquisition of
                    Bohemia and Hungary, became equal to France in extent of territory, and ventured
                    to contend with her for ascendency both in Italy and the Netherlands. In
                    fertility of soil Austria is fully equal to her rival, but in other respects
                    France has had and still has great advantages. Her people all speak the same
                    language, and the country is to a certain degree maritime; main points in
                    facilitating intercourse, and in promoting civilization, trade, and national
                    wealth. Hence the greater increase of the towns; a more general diffusion of
                    education; and a larger proportion of intelligent public officers, of able
                    statesmen and commanders. Add to this, that while France was relieved from
                    intestine troubles so early as the year 1600, or the reign of Henry IV., Austria
                    did not obtain the complete attachment of her subjects in Hungary and the
                    eastern provinces until 1720, more than a century later. The consequence of all
                    this was, that with a few exceptions, such as the brilliant reign of the emperor
                    Charles V., or the still more brilliant age of Marlborough and Eugene, the
                    balance of success inclined to the side of France; and Austria lost first
                    Alsace, afterwards the Netherlands, and for a time Lombardy.</p>
                <p>The adjustments of territory by the general treaties of 1815 are certainly more
                    favourable than any former arrangement to the maintenance of peace between
                    France and Austria. By these treaties Austria definitively relinquished Belgium,
                    which had so long been a ground of quarrel between the two countries; and
                    Prussia became the power to which England and Holland look for co-operation in
                    the event of war in the Netherlands. It was with this view that Prussia received
                    an extension of ter-ritoty<pb break="no" facs="nls:193192409"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-2409-0238"/> on the Rhine, exactly as Lombardy and Venice were
                    restored to Austria, in the understanding that the political guardianship of
                    Italy should be committed to her care. In pursuance of this system, an Austrian
                    army became the sole agent in reinstating the royal authority in Naples in 1820;
                    and to the same power has been lately intrusted the task of preventing the
                    spread of revolution in the States of the Church. Has Austria to apprehend that
                    questions arising out of the politics of Italy will be of a nature to involve
                    her with France? To this the only answer that can at present be given is, that
                    the intermediate power (the court of Turin) has the strongest motives to prevent
                    such collisions, and that the French people have never gone along with their
                    rulers in desiring Lombardy as they desired Belgium.</p>
                <p>Another and an equally interesting question is, what seem to be the comparative
                    prospects of these rival states in regard to increase of resources? The country
                    which shall most steadily cultivate the arts of peace and productive industry,
                    will assuredly advance most effectually in its wealth and power. Since the
                    overthrow of Buonaparte, and the general settlement of territory by the treaties
                    of 1815, the Austrian government has evinced a decided tendency to peace, and a
                    solicitude to heal the wounds inflicted by twenty years of war. Bosnia and
                    Servia, detached from the central part of Turkey, and immediately adjoining the
                    Austrian frontier, offered strong temptations; but the court of Vienna has
                    declined to be a party to any plan for dismembering the Turkish empire. Let us
                    hope that this abstinence from aggression has proceeded from enlightened views,
                    and from a solicitude to promote improvement at home, by leaving capital and
                    labour disposable for productive purposes. Of a disposition to that effect there
                    have been several symptoms since the peace: export duties have been lowered; the
                    assessment for the land-tax has been amended; several of the high roads from
                    Germany to Italy have been improved; those in Bohemia have been extended; and
                    several marshes, in particular an extensive one near Laybach, have been drained.
                    These different undertakings are on a scale insignificant to the view of an
                    Englishman, but important, as indicative of a disposition on the part of
                    government to contribute to public works in a country where formerly their
                    utility was not appreciated. No state, assuredly, would profit more largely by
                    the extension of such works than Austria. Territory she possesses in abundance;
                    her great requisites are, a more close connection, and a greater approach to
                    uniformity in her different provinces. This can be accomplished only by
                    extending the communications, by opening new roads and improving the old, as
                    well as by excavating canals in situations where they are preferable to
                    railways. The difficulty and expense attendant on such labours, great in almost
                    every country, are particularly so in mountainous regions like Spain,
                    Switzerland, or the Alpine provinces of Austria; but in most parts of the empire
                    the obstacles are lessened by the great extent of level ground.</p>
                <p>The points of possible collision between Austria and· Russia are on the side of
                    Poland and Turkey. Were we; to draw a parallel between these two empires, the
                    results would be directly the reverse of those in the comparison with France;
                    Russia being far more backward than Austria in national education, in
                    manufactures, in the size of her towns, and in the average of individual
                    property. Yet the vast extent of Russia, and the <hi rend="italic">éclat</hi>
                    she acquired by occasioning the overthrow of Buonaparte, has led the public,
                    during the last twenty years, when comparing Russia and Austria, to regard the
                    former as decidedly the greater power. On considering, however, the rigour of
                    the Russian climate, the inconvenience of vast distances, and the general
                    barbarism of the people, we cannot assent to this opinion without considerable
                    qualification. In defensive war Russia is almost invincible, because her
                    uncultivated provinces afford no resources to an invading force; but her
                    financial means are not as yet greater than those of Austria, and the armies she
                    has sent to a distance have been formidable only when subsidized by England.
                    Russia has, however, one great advantage; a consciousness of the deficient
                    education of her natives, and a readiness to accept the services of intelligent
                    foreigners. How important would it be for Austria to call in similar aid, until
                    her system of national education should be so far improved as to approach to
                    that of France, England, and the north of Germany?</p>
                <p>Prussia made common cause with Austria against France in 1792, but withdrew from
                    the coalition as early as 1795; and during the subsequent invasions of the
                    empire by the French, her government was considered a willing spectator of their
                    success, calculated as it was to shake the influence of Austria over the
                    Germanic body. But the grounds of such jealousy appear to have been removed by
                    the arrangements of 1815, by which Prussia has the northern and Austria the
                    southern portion of Germany under her influence. Though Prussia has long had the
                    twofold advantage arising from the reformed religion and an enlightened
                    government, she has no title to be placed on a level with Austria in point of
                    resources. Her soil is in many parts so sandy and unproductive, that the average
                    of her population, reckoned by the square mile, is less than that of the
                    Austrian empire; while her revenue is only half, and her total population less
                    than half, of that of her southern rival. The successes obtained by Prussia in
                    the wars of the last century were owing chiefly to one cause, the talents of
                    Frederick II.; and a recurrence of them ought not to be expected at any time
                    when Austria shall be judiciously governed.</p>
