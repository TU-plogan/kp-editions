                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">AVICENNA, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Avicenes</hi></label>, the
                    prince of Arabian philosophers and physicians, was born at Assena, a village in
                    the neighbourhood of Buckharia. His father was from Balkh in Persia, and had
                    married at Buckharia. The first years of Avicenna were devoted to the study of
                    the koran and the belles lettres. He soon showed what he was likely to become
                    afterwards; and the progress he made was so rapid, that when he was but ten
                    years old he was perfectly intelligent in the most hidden senses of the koran.
                    Abu-Abdallah, a native of Naplous, in Syria, at that time professed philosophy
                    at Buckharia with the greatest reputation. .Avicenna studied under him the
                    principles of logic; but being soon disgusted with the slow manner of the
                    schools, he set about studying alone, and read all the authors who had written
                    on philosophy, without any other help than that of their commentators. Possessed
                    with an extreme desire to become acquainted with all sorts of sciences, he
                    likewise devoted himself to the study of medicine; and, persuaded that the
                    medical art consists as much in practice as in theory, he sought every
                    opportunity of visiting the sick, and afterwards confessed that he had learned
                    more from experience than from all the books he had read. He was now in his
                    sixteenth year, and was already celebrated as being the light of his age. At
                    this period he resolved to resume his studies of philosophy, which medicine had
                    caused him to neglect; and he spent a year and a half in this painful labour,
                    without ever sleeping all the time a whole night together. If he felt himself
                    oppressed by sleep or exhausted by study, a glass of wine refreshed his wasted
                    spirits, and gave him new vigour for study; if, in spite of him, his eyes for a
                    few minutes shut out the light, he then endeavoured to recollect and meditate
                    upon all the things which had occupied his thoughts before sleep. At the age of
                    twenty-one he conceived the bold design of incorporating, in one work, all the
                    objects of human knowledge; and carried it into execution in a kind of
                    Encyclopaedia, to which he gave the title of the <hi rend="italic">Utility of
                    Utilities.</hi> He died at Hamadan, aged 58 years, in the 428th year of the
                    Hegira, and of Christ 1036.</p>
                <p>The knowledge he had of physic did not secure him from the ailments that afflict
                    human nature. He was attacked by several maladies in the course of his life, and
                    in particular was very subject to the colic. His excesses in pleasures, and his
                    infirmities, made a poet who wrote his epitaph say, that the profound study of
                    philosophy had not taught him good morals, nor that of medicine the art of
                    preserving his own health.</p>
                <p>Avicenna, after his death, enjoyed so great a reputation, that till the twelfth
                    century he was preferred for the study of philosophy and medicine to all his
                    predecessors. His works were the only writings in vogue in schools, even in
                    Europe. The following are their titles :—1. Of the Utility and Advantage of
                    Science, twenty books. 2. Of Innocence and Criminality, two books. 3. Of Health
                    and Remedies, eighteen books. 4. Canons of Physic, fourteen books. 5. On
                    Astronomical Observations, one book. 6. On Mathematical Sciences. 7. Of
                    Theorems, or Mathematical and Theological Demonstrations, one book. 8. On the
                    Arabic Language and its Properties, ten books. 9. On the Last Judgment. 10. On
                    the Origin of the Soul, and the Resurrection of Bodies. 11. Of the End we should
                    propose to ourselves in Harangues and Philosophical Argumentations. 12.
                    Demonstration of the Collateral Lines in the Sphere. 13. Abridgement of Euclid.
                    14. On Finity and Infinity. 15. On Physics and Metaphysics. 16. On Animals and
                    Vegetables, &amp;c. 17. Ţhe Encyclopaedia mentioned above.</p>
