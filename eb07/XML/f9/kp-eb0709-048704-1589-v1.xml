                    Shrewsbury, in the year 1714. Dr Charles Owen was for some time his tutor; but
                    previous-y to the period when he was under that master, he had been at a school

                    he was in 1730 sent to prosecute his studies under Dr Doddridge at Northampton.
                    Here, by the rectitude of his conduct and wonderful proficiency, he gained the
                    esteem of that excellent person, who always spoke of him in the most respectful

                    admission. Mr Farmer having one evening been detained a little beyond that hour,
                    found the doors shut against him, and was under the necessity of applying to a
                    Mr William Snell, solicitor, a man of eminence, and possessed of many excellent
                    qualifications. In the family of this gentleman he remained for about thirty
                    years, living in the greatest friendship and intimacy. Here also he gradually
                    prepared those valuable treatises^and dissertations which were afterwards given
                    to the public, and which acquired him so much celebrity as a man of letters. He
                    likewise continued to discharge the duties of his ministerial function to the
                    people of Walthamstow.</p>
                <p>When a day of thanksgiving was appointed for the suppression of the rebellion in
                    1745, Mr Farmer preached a sermon on that occasion, which was published the
                    following year. His next work was of much greater importance, being entitled, An
                    Inquiry into the Nature and Design of our Lord’s Temptation in the Wilderness.
                    In this production it was the design of Mr Farmer to prove that the whole was
                    transacted in vision, the different stages of which were intended to point out
                    to him the difficulties and duties of his subsequent ministry. The originality
                    of thought and profound erudition which this work displayed, soon obtained for
                    it a very extensive circulation, and called forth the exertions of those who
                    were of an opposite opinion. It received one reply under the title of Christ’s
                    Temptations real Facts, which possessed considerable merit, but was much
                    inferior to Mr Farmer’s in energy of expression, depth of thinking, and force of
                    argument. But the most masterly, perhaps, of all Mr Farmer’s literary
                    productions was his Dissertation on Miracles, designed to show that they are
                    arguments of a divine interposition, and absolute proofs of the mission and
                    doctrine of a prophet; a work which was first published in the year 1771. But as
                    great talents are frequently envied, so this work of Mr Farmer was declared by
                    some to have been chiefly borrowed from Lemoine’s treatise on the same subject;
                    slander which he refuted in a very able and satisfactory manner. In the year
                    1775 he published his celebrated Essay on the Demoniacs of the New Testament,
                    which may be considered as the completion of the design he had in view by his
                    dissertation on miracles. The hypothesis which he adopted had formerly been
                    defended with great ability by Mede, Sykes, Lardner, and others; but it was
                    reserved for the critical acuteness of Mr Farmer to free it from those
                    difficulties with which it was surrounded, and to place the subject in a much
                    clearer light. His essay on demoniacs was successively attacked by Dr
                    Worthington and Mr Fell, both of them men of considerable erudition, but much
                    inferior in ability to their antagonist.</p>
                <p>Mr Farmer having continued for several years the sole pastor of the congregation
                    at Walthamstow, an able colleague was appointed him in 1761, in consequence of
                    which he became the afternoon preacher to the congregation of Salter’s Hall, in
                    the city of London, and soon afterwards the Tuesday lecturer at the same place.
                    But he resigned his ministerial employments as he advanced in years, a
                    circumstance which the people committed to his charge very much regretted. In
                    the year 1785 an affection in his eyes nearly deprived him of sight, but by
                    means of a surgical operation he was for some time enabled to resume his
                    studies. Mortality is, however, the inevitable lot of all men, and in 1787 the
                    growing infirmities of Mr Farmer brought him to the grave, in the seventy-third
                    year of his age.</p>

                    and critic of considerable eminence, was the son of a hosier at Leicester, at
                    which place he was born in the year 1735. Here he <pb break="no"

                    rudiments of his education, and afterwards became a student at Cambridge, and
                    pensioner of Emanuel College. He was considered as a young man well acquainted
                    with books, much esteemed among his friends, and looked upon as possessed of
                    lively parts, even before he had acquired any extraordinary reputation as a
                    scholar. He was made bachelor of arts in 1757, and master of arts in 1760.
                    Several years after this period, having been for some time a curate, he took the
                    degree of bachelor in divinity, and became a preacher at Whitehall. Besides the
                    attention he paid to the Greek and Roman authors, he prosecuted the study of
                    books in his own language, printed in black letter, and thus laid the foundation
                    of a work which added more to his literary reputation than any other
                    performance. This was an Essay on the Learning of Shakspeare, which he published
                    in 1766. Men of letters had long turned their attention to the learning of
                    Shakspeare, in order to ascertain its real extent. It could not be questioned
                    that hc was acquainted with the history and mythology of the ancients, but it
                    was still a matter of dispute from what sources that acquaintance had been
                    derived. To obviate this difficulty, Mr Farmer’s knowledge of books enabled him
                    to demonstrate, that translations of the far greater part of the classical
                    authors were to be met with in the time of our distinguished dramatist; and as
                    he showed that Shakspeare had even copied the blunders and errors of these
                    translations, he made it manifest beyond the possibility of a rational doubt,
                    that he was wholly incapable of consulting the originals. This essay passed
                    through three editions in a very short time, and was much admired for the
                    sprightliness of its composition, whilst the readers of it were in general
                    persuaded that he had fully established his point.This performance brought him
                    into notice, and became extremely favourable to his professional advancement. By
                    the influence of Bishop Hurd, he procured the chancellorship and a prebend in
                    the cathedral of Lichfield; and in 1775 he was elected master of Emanuel
                    College, and took the degree of doctor in divinity. He was soon afterwards
                    appointed principal librarian to the university, and served in turn the office
                    of vice-chancellor. He was made prebendary of Canterbury by Lord North, at that
                    time prime minister, and Mr Pitt twice offered him a bishopric; but the
                    constraints and solemnity of the episcopal character were not congenial to his
                    natural temper, on which account he declined the offer, and having resigned his
                    office as prebendary, he accepted of a residentiaryship of St Paul’s. This
                    obliged him to reside three months annually in London, which he spent with equal
                    pleasure and advantage in the society of literary men. From nature z he
                    inherited a fund of good humour, and was of such an obliging turn, that he
                    buried party spirit in the satisfaction which he found in the performance of
                    beneficent actions. Though in general an enemy to reforms of every kind, and
                    anxious to preserve things as they were, both in church and state, he was
                    nevertheless instrumental in amending the police of Cambridge, especially as it
                    related to the paving and lighting of the streets. At his instigation also,
                    monumental sculpture was admitted into the cathedral of St Paul’s, and will
                    continue to exhibit a striking proof of national gratitude, as well as serve to
                    cover the nakedness of the walls.It was at one time the intention of Dr Farmer
                    to publish a history of the town and antiquities of Leicester; but either his
                    independent circumstances, or a degree of native indolence, made him relinquish
                    the design, and the few materials which he had collected were therefore &lt;πven
                    to Mr John Nichols, at that time engaged in an elaborate work on the same
                    subject. After a painful illness of some length, Dr Farmer died at Emanuel
                    College in the month of September 1797, in the sixty-second year of his age. Dr
                    Parr wrote an epitaph for his tombstone, in which we find the following
