                <p><label type="entry">FAROE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Faroer</hi>, or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Feroe</hi></label>, a group of European islands, situated in
                    the Northern Ocean, between Zetland and Iceland, about 200 miles north-west of
                    the former. They appear to form the country described by the early Venetian
                    navigators under the name of Friesland, though that term was afterwards applied
                    by the English to the northern extremity of Greenland. These islands are
                    twenty-two in number, of which the principal are Stromoe, Osteroe, Suderoe,
                    Wangoe, and Sandoe. They consist throughout of rocks and hills, rising to a
                    considerable height, and separated from each other by narrow valleys, or rather
                    ravines. Although, however, these hills rise abruptly, there are often on their
                    summits, or at different stages of their ascent, plains of considerable
                    magnitude. They everywhere present to the sea perpendicular cliffs, broken into
                    a thousand fantastic forms, and which, to those who sail along the coast,
                    present at every turn the most picturesque and varied scenery. The highest peak
                    is that of Skellingfell, in the island of Stromoe, which is supposed to rise
                    about 3000 feet above the sea. The rocks consist generally of trap, and exhibit
                    little variety of composition, though they present some striking geological
                    phenomena. The zeolites and chalcedonies here collected have long supplied the
                    best specimens of these minerals to the cabinets of Europe.</p>
                <p>The population of the Faroe Islands, according to a statistical table drawn up in
                    1812, amounted to 5209. Agriculture is in a very imperfect state, the infield,
                    or cultivated land, being supposed to bear to the outfield, or uncultivated, the
                    proportion of one to sixty. The plough is scarcely ever used, being in fact ill
                    suited to the rugged and uneven surface of which all the islands consist. The
                    ground is therefore turned up with the spade, care being taken not to destroy
                    the roots of the grass. Horses and cows are few in number, and the latter give
                    very little milk, in consequence, probably, of the very coarse hay upon which
                    they are fed. Sheep form the chief riches of the islanders, and the number
                    possessed by them was calculated in 1812 at 35,307. Some individuals have flocks
                    of two or three hundred. These sheep are allowed to run about, both in summer
                    and winter, without ever being housed, and in severe seasons they suffer
                    considerably. The wool is generally coarse, and is torn off the animals in so
                    rough a manner, as often to lacerate the skin. The fishery, which was once
                    considerable, has been neglected, and is now of little consequence. The catching
                    of the numerous birds which build their nests upon the face of the cliffs, forms
                    a great source of subsistence to the inhabitants. Those persons employed in this
                    hazardous trade display great ingenuity and the most adventurous spirit.
                    Sometimes the fowler, is let down from the top of the cliff by a rope fastened
                    to his waist; at other times, where there is any footing at all, he climbs the
                    steepest rocks, or, where that is impossible, has himself thrust up by poles
                    made for the purpose. The puffin <hi rend="italic">(Alca Arctica)</hi> is the
                    most common of these birds, and the eider duck is here often shot for food.</p>
                <p>The Danish government has given the monopoly of the <hi rend="superscript">
                    ra</hi> ~θ of the Faroe Islands to a mercantile house at Co- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i n</hi> hagen, under the condition of supplying the
                    inhabitants with a sufficient quantity of grain at a constant fixed price.
                    Should the market price be such as to render this <hi rend="superscript"> a
                    0sin</hi> g transaction, the merchant is indemnified by government. This care of
                    provisioning the islands is probably superfluous; and the natural bad effects of
                    a monopoly are felt in the high price of other imported articles, a good jacket
                    being often given for a few leaves of tobacco. The exports consist of hose knit
                    on the islands, to the^ annual amount of 100,000 pairs; tallow, fish, train-oil,
                    feathers, skins, and butter. During the war between Britain and Denmark, the
                    Fort of Thorshaun was, in 1808, destroyed by Captain Baugh, lest it should
                    afford harbour to privateers. A German adventurer, who assumed the name of Baron
                    Hompesch, afterwards landed and plundered the place; but his conduct was
                    disavowed by the British government, who even restored the value of the property
                    of which the natives had been robbed. Finding also, that the people having lost
                    their communication with Denmark, were in danger of suffering from famine,
                    Britain permitted a limited intercourse to be carried on, under license, from
                    Leith. But the peace restored all things to their usual channel.</p>
                <p>Thorshaun, the principal place in the country, doesnot contain above 520
                    inhabitants. It is situated on the eastern coast of the island of Stromoe, upon
                    a narrow tongue of land, having creeks on each side, where ships may be safely
                    moored. The houses are built of wood, and roofed with birch bark covered with
                    turf; the greenness of which makes it impossible, at a very short distance, to
                    distinguish the place from the surrounding fields. The character of the people
                    is generally marked by great simplicity of manners, kindness, and hospitality.
