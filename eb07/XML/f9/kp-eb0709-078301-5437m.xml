                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p>Field fortification is the art of constructing all kinds of temporary works in
                    the field. An army intrenched, or <pb break="no" facs="nls:193755450"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-5450-0784"/>fortified, in the field, produces, in many
                    respects, the same effect as a fortress; for it covers a country, supplies the
                    want of numbers, stops the advance of a superior enemy, or, if he chooses to
                    risk a battle, obliges him to engage at a disadvantage. “In a war of march and
                    manoeuvre,” says Napoleon, “if you would avoid a battle with a superior army, it
                    is necessary to intrench every night, and to occupy a good defensive position.
                    Those natural positions which are ordinarily met with are not sufficient to
                    protect an army against superior numbers without recourse to art. Those who
                    proscribe lines of circumval-Jation, and all the assistance which the science of
                    the engineer can afford, deprive themselves gratuitously of an auxiliary which
                    is never injurious, almost always useful, and often indispensable. It must be
                    admitted at tłļe same time that the principles of field fortification require
                    improvement. This important branch of the art of war has made no progress since
                    the times of the ancients. It is even inferior to what it was two thousand years
                    ago. Engineer officers should be encouraged in bringing this art to perfection,
                    and in placing it on a level with the rest.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Napoleon.</p></note></p>
                <p>Whenever Napoleon had time and occasion for strengthening his position by
                    field-works, he acted upon the principles recommended in the above extract, as
                    almost all his predecessors had done. In the wars which followed the revolution
                    of 1688, in those of Queen Anne’s reign, and during the Seien Years’ War, we
                    find the commanders of each period, William III. the Duke of Marlborough,
                    Marshal Villars, Marshal Saxe, Frederick II. and Marshal Daun, practically
                    exemplifying their conviction of the great utility of field-works. A few
                    redoubts saved Peter the Great at Pultowa, and enabled him to gain a decisive
                    victory over his formidable antagonist; and at Borodino, some slight open
                    field-works, thrown up by the Russians, caused the French great loss, and
                    rendered too costly to be of almost any avail the victory which, by incredible
                    efforts of gallantry, they gained. It has been argued by some, against
                    intrenchments and field-works, that they have offener been carried than
                    successfully defended, and that hence incommensurate importance has been
                    attached to them. But it should be remembered, on the other hand, that victory
                    in such circumstances has generally been purchased at an expense which rendered
                    it in effect equivalent to defeat; and that a practice which the greatest
                    commanders of ancient and modem times have approved and followed, cannot be one
                    of doubtful utility. At Austerlitz, where the contending armies were nearly
                    equal, Napoleon was preparing to superintend the construction of intrenchments
                    when he found himself called upon to receive battle; and in Portugal, the Duke
                    of Wellington showed to what importance the art of the engineer might be turned
                    for influencing, not merely the fortune of a campaign, but the fate of a cause.
                    The lines of Torres Vedras, which formed the <hi rend="italic">ne</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">plus ultra</hi> of the powerful French army under Massena, and
                    from which the tide of war was rolled back broken into Spain, were perhaps the
                    most remarkable works of the kind ever constructed.</p>
                <p>“Lisbon," says Sir John Jones, “being situated at the extremity of a peninsula
                    formed by the sea and the Tagus, it is plain that if an arm}' be so posted as to
                    extend across the peninsula, no enemy can penetrate into the city without a
                    direct attack on the army so formed. It was on this principle that the lines
                    covering Lisbon were planned by Lord Wellington. Nature drew the rude outline of
                    a strong defensive position, and art rendered it perfect. A tract of country
                    thirty miles, extending from the mouth of the Zizandra on the océan, to Alhandra
                    on the Tagus, was modelled into a field of battle; mountains were scarped
                    perpendicularly, rivers dammed, and inundations formed; all roads favourable to
                    the enemy were destroyed, and others made to facilitate the communications of
                    the defenders; formidable works were erected to strengthen and support the weak
                    parts, whilst numerous cannon places, on inaccessible points, commanded the
                    different approaches to them, and gave an equality of defence to the whole
                    position."<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">War in Spain,</hi> p. 124. The French army which invaded Portugal
                    under Massena consisted of three corps, under Marshals Ney and Junot and General
                    Regnier, amounting in all to 66,000 infantry and 6000 cavalry, besides a strong
                    body of the imperial guard, which crossed the Pyrenees after the invading force
                    had commenced its march from the neighbourhood of Salamanca. The force collected
                    to oppose this threatened invasion did not exceed 48,000 infantry and 3000
                    cavalry, of which about a half was composed of Portuguese levies, yet untried in
                    any general action, and of which a very unfavourable opinion still continued to
                    be entertained. In point of numbers, and still more in the composition of their
                    army, therefore, the French had a decided superiority; but all their advantages
                    were neutralised by the defensive position of Torres vedras.</p></note> These
                    lines were not continuous and connected works; they consisted of independent
                    forts, redoubts, flèches, redans, batteries, &amp;c. so placed as to command and
                    enfilade every approach, and to support each other by a cross or a flanking
                    fire. The first line occupied a front of twenty-nine miles between the sea and
                    the Tagus; and by means of telegraphs intelligence could be conveyed from one
                    extremity to the other in a few minutes; whilst the troops were disposed in
                    masses in the rear of the works, ready to move upon any point that might be
                    attacked, by interior communications shorter than any by which the enemy could
                    advance. “The aim and scope of these works,” says Colonel Napier, “was to bar
                    the passes, and to strengthen the fighting positions between them, without
                    impeding the movements of the army. These objects were attained; and it is
                    certain that the loss of the first line would not have been injurious, save in
                    reputation, because the retreat was secure upon the second and stronger line,
                    and the guns of the first were all of inferior calibre, mounted on common truck
                    carriages, and consequently immovable and useless to the enemy.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">History of
                    the War</hi> in <hi rend="italic">the Peninsula,</hi> vol. iii.</p></note> Both
                    lines occupied a front of fifty miles, on which there were erected one hundred
                    and fifty forts, mounting in all about six hundred pieces of artillery.</p>
                <p>Before this formidable position, defended by a double line of works, and by an
                    array massed and ready to move upon any point by interior communications, the
                    French remained five months, wasting their numbers and resources; until at
                    length, finding it utterly impracticable to force any part of even the exterior
                    line, they were obliged to retire from Portugal, closely followed and harrassed
                    by the army which they had previously driven out of Spain. Yet though the lines
                    of Torres Vedras were thus perfect in themselves, and though one of the ablest
                    of the French generals and a veteran French army were foiled before them, it is
                    not meant to refer to this system of separate field-works as a model to be
                    followed on all occasions; for whilst the old method of covering a considerable
                    front by a continued line of regular bastions and curtains has been universally
                    condemned by modern engineers, it is nevertheless certain that there are
                    situations where a partial application of continued lines may be most
                    judiciously made. In fact, it is not by any fixed rule, but from the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193755463" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5463-0785"/> nature of the
                    ground and of the position to be defended, that the species of works calculated
                    to be most useful should, in every case, be determined.</p>
                <p>It must be obvious indeed that even a limited knowledge of the art of war opens a
                    wide field for the exercise of the talents and resources of engineers in field
                    fortification; but the possession of a military coup-d’oeil, or of that
                    intuitive judgment which comprehends at a glance the true bearing or character
                    of objects as well as events, is necessary to enable them to convert theoretical
                    stores of information to the best practical uses. In passing through a country,
                    it requires an experienced eye to seize quickly on whatever it presents
                    calculated to prove advantageous or disadvantageous to an army destined to
                    attack or defend it; to appreciate the value of villages, stone-enclosures, and
                    broken ground; to know where to dam up rivers, to scarp heights, to form
                    abattis, trous-de-loup, and other obstacles; to select the best situations for
                    field-forts and redoubts, and the best emplacements for batteries; and to
                    arrange all the defensive means employed, with reference to the number of troops
                    destined to act upon the different parts of the line, so that the movements of
                    the defenders may not be obstructed or retarded, and the communications
                    throughout may be short and easy. The variety of ground, however, upon which
                    military operations are for the most part carried on, precludes the possibility
                    of laying down fixed rules in regard to this subject; the accidents of ground,
                    and the peculiar circumstances of each individual case, must, as already
                    observed, determine the extent and description of the works to be constructed,
                    as well as the obstacles most proper to be formed for retarding, if not
                    obstructing, the advance of an enemy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>At the same time, though the observance of fixed rules be impracticable, general
                    principles are of universal ap∙ plication; and hence some of the received maxims
                    in permanent fortification hold equally good in regard to the construction of
                    field-works. These are, <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> that the works to be
                    flanked must never be beyond the range of the missiles discharged from the works
                    flanking them, or in other words, never out of the effective range of musketry,
                    that is, from 150 to 200 yards; <hi rend="italic">secondly,</hi> that the angles
                    of defence should be about right angles; <hi rend="italic">thirdly,</hi> that
                    the salient angles of all works should be as obtuse as possible; <hi
                    rend="italic">fourthly,</hi> that though ditches cannot always be as fully
                    flanked as in permanent fortification, yet partial flanking must be carried as
                    far as possible; and,jZ∕lΛZy, that in the construction of field-works, reference
                    should not only be had to the direct and immediate obstacles which the work
                    itself is calculated to present to the enemy, and the positive effect of the
                    fire on the approaches to it, but the relative value of the work should likewise
                    be considered, with respect to the support it can receive from or give to other
                    works. These principles or maxims are of invariable application.</p>
                <p>It is usual to divide field-works into three classes: <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">redan,</hi> its faces are sometimes broken into a kind of flank,
                    as in fig. 1, Plate CCXLIX. The <hi rend="italic">double redan,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">queue d’hironde,</hi> fig. 2, is considerably stronger, as the
                    re-entering faces defend each other; the <hi rend="italic">tenanted heads</hi>
                    in situations which require a greater extent of front; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >bastioned heads</hi> are also employed in similar circumstances. See fig. 3 and
                    4.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Redoubts</hi> are works closed on all sides; they are
                    constructed of a square or polygonal figure, but most commonly square, as, when
                    of this form, each front can furnish a strong perpendicular fire. Provision
                    should be made for defending the ground before the angles, which, however, are
                    sometimes rounded or cut <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >crémaillière,</hi> so that a fire may be delivered from them. See fig. 5.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Star-forts</hi> were proposed in order to remedy the defects of
                    redoubts having the ground before them undefended by a flanking fire, so that a
                    cross fire might be delivered from the adjacent sides. But, according to Jomini,
                    “starforts are the very worst description of fortification; they cannot have
                    flanks, and the re-entering angles take so much from the interior space that it
                    is impossible to place troops and artillery in them sufficient for their
                    defence:” an opinion confirmed by the practice of Sir Richard rletcher and Sir
                    John Jones in the construction of the lines of Torres Vedras, where the trace of
                    the redoubts was made subservient to the conformation of the ground, to the
                    object in view, and to the protecting them as much as possible from the fire of
                    the enemy’s position.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">bastioned forts,</hi> fig. 7, the principles of construction
                    correspond with those detailed in permanent fortification; and the flanking
                    defence thus obtained for the ditch is nearly perfect. As bastioned forts are
                    only constructed m cases of great importance, no labour or expense should be
                    spared in the formation of such works.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forts with demi-bastions,</hi> fig. 12, are objectionable, as
                    the ditches are only defended by an oblique fire from the sides. The parapets of
                    these works should be of sufficient thickness to resist the fire of the heaviest
                    guns that can be brought against them. In some cases, however, the parapets need
                    only be strong enough to resist the fire <pb break="no" facs="nls:193755476"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-5476-0786"/>of light field-guns, whilst in others it will be
                    sufficient if they serve as a cover to the men within them against musketry. The
                    latter kind is generally that which is thrown up in an evening after taking up a
                    position, and which, if the army does not move next day, it may be considered as
                    necessary to strengthen in some parts, according to circumstances.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Continued lines,</hi> or connected works, are resorted to in
                    order to enclose the front, or to connect important works or forts. The most
                    simple tracing is that of redans joined together by curtains, fig. 9; but as the
                    ditches of these curtains can only be defended by an oblique fire from the faces
                    of the redans, this defect may be remedied by breaking the curtains so as to
                    form nearly right angles with the faces of the redans, in which case they are
                    called <hi rend="italic">lines of</hi><hi rend="italic">tenailles.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Lines</hi><hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >crémailliere</hi> have long faces, with flanks perpendicular to these, in order
                    to defend their ditches. When these faces can be directed towards ground upon
                    which it is impracticable to establish enfilading batteries, the construction is
                    considered as good.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bastioned lines</hi> are the strongest trace which can be given
                    to continued lines, when the ground will admit of such. A perfectly regular
                    trace is only suited for level ground. The ditches in field-works are often
                    sloped <hi rend="italic">en rampe</hi> towards the adjoining flanks, in order
                    that the <hi rend="italic">déblai,</hi> or quantity of earth excavated, may not
                    exceed the <hi rend="italic">remblai,</hi> or quantity contained in the mass of
                    the rampart or parapet, a circumstance which often occurs in fieldworks, where
                    there is seldom any rampart, and only cover sufficient for the defenders.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lines with intervals,</hi> fig. 14, shows the general trace of
                    lines of this kind. The salient works should never be beyond the range of
                    musketry from the re-entering works, and the angles of defence between the two
                    lines should be as near as possible to right angles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tĉtes-de-pont,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bridge-heads,</hi> are
                    works generally open at the gorge, and whose flanks rest upon a river, in order
                    to cover one or more bridges. The best situation for these works is the
                    re-entering sinuosity of a river. As têtes-de-pont, fig. 13, are usually
                    constructed for the purpose of enabling a retiring army to cross a river in
                    order, and to check an enemy pressing upon it, the tracing and profile should be
                    such as to secure a double advantage to the greatest extent possible. In Sir
                    Howard Douglas’s able work on the Construction of Military Bridges will be found
                    much valuable scientific information upon this important subject.</p>
                <p>To field-works there are usually added a variety of obstacles, in order to render
                    the approaches more difficult to the enemy; such as <hi rend="italic">palisades,
                    barriers,</hi><hi rend="italic">abbatis,</hi><hi rend="italic">trous-de-loup,
                    chevaux-de-ſrise, harrows,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">crows' -feet.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Palisades</hi> are strong stakes fixe*d in the ground, and well
                    sharpened at the upper extremities. They are sometimes placed horizontally in
                    the face of the parapet, in which case they are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >fraises.</hi><hi rend="italic">Barrier-gates,</hi> for closing the entrances of
                    field-works, should be made strong enough to resist a sudden attack; they are
                    always placed on the most inaccessible side. <hi rend="italic">Abattis</hi> are
                    lines of felled trees of considerable size, strongly bound together and picketed
                    down, with the smaller branches cut off, and the remainder sharpened and pointed
                    towards the enemy. They are interlaced as much as possible. Abattis, well
                    disposed, present a formidable obstacle. <hi rend="italic">Trous-de-loup</hi>
                    are rows of pits, made before a work, in the form of inverted cones, having each
                    a strong palisade or stake in the middle. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chevaux-de-ſrise</hi> are formed by inserting iron-pointed stakes, five or six
                    feet in length, into a heavy beam of wood, which will thus, if it be square,
                    present four projecting spears, and if hexagonal, six. Chevaux-de-ſrise are
                    generally chained together in a line, in order to cover the ground required; and
                    sometimes they are so constructed as to revolve on an axis. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Harrows,</hi> such as those ordinarily used in husbandry, are recommended to be
                    spread, with the teeth uppermost, over the ground by which an enemy,
                    particularly cavalry, is likely to advance to the attack. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crows'-feet</hi> are pieces of iron, with four points, each four or five inches
                    long, projecting in different directions, and also intended to impede the
                    advance of cavalry.</p>
                <p>For <hi rend="italic">the defence of open towns and villages,</hi> the following
                    methods, recommended by the French minister of war in 1814, are considered as
                    the best that have yet been suggested: “To admit of a town being advantageously
                    intrenched, it is necessary that it should not be commanded within any short
                    distance, that the houses should not be of a construction easily set on fire,
                    and that its extent should not be out of proportion to the means and time at the
                    disposal of the defenders. The first thing to be done is to clear the approaches
                    to the town, by levelling houses, hedges, shrubberies, and whatever may favour
                    the assailants. Wood ought to be cut two feet from the ground, that it may serve
                    to impede the advance of the enemy without masking the fire of the defenders.
                    The next object is to form or complete the enclosure round the town. For this
                    purpose advantage is taken of buildings, walls, and fences applicable to the
                    defence. The openings which remain must be closed by palisades, stockades, or
                    ditches strengthened by abattis. All streets leading out of town must be
                    barricaded. The barricades must be sufficient to resist field artillery, and
                    high enough not to∙be easily got over; and they ought to be flanked by
                    loopholing the neighbouring houses. When pressed for time, carts filled with
                    dung and the wheels taken off, sand-bags, bales of wool or cotton, and furniture
                    taken from the neighbouring houses, all form good barricades. If there should be
                    any old castle, church, or large substantial building, it should be converted
                    into a keep, by blocking up useless entrances, loopholing walls, and surrounding
                    them by a ditch or abattis. If a town is situated near a stream or river, by
                    which part of it may be covered by inundations, this should never be
                    neglected.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Villages</hi> are intrenched on similar principles, and being
                    generally surrounded by gardens with live hedges, the latter may be made use of
                    in forming the lines of defence. If there should only be sufficient troops to
                    defend part of a village or town, a part only should be intrenched and separated
                    from the rest by means of carts and barricades. If there are very few houses, it
                    may be necessary to confine the defence to the church or churchyard, which may
                    in all cases serve as a sort of keep.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The destruction of bridges.</hi> Nothing is of greater
                    consequence to a retiring army than to be able to destroy the bridges in its
                    rear, in order to retard the advance of the enemy. Its safety, nay even its
                    existence, may depend upon the success with which this operation is performed.
                    In order to destroy a stone-bridge, a trench in the form of a cross is made in
                    the crown of the arch, the branches of which are about ten feet in length, and
                    sunk to the top of the arch-stones. A hundred and sixty pounds of powder are
                    placed in each cut or trench for an arch three feet thick, strong planks are
                    then laid over the powder, and the whole being well covered with rubbish, the
                    fire is communicated by means of saucisson or long powder-hose. Stone bridges
                    are also destroyed by simply cuttinga trench about eighteen inches deep across
                    the crown of the arch, and placing in it 345 pounds of powder covered in the
                    manner just described. This quantity has been found sufficient to destroy
                    semicircular arches of twenty-five feet in span, and three feet in thickness at
                    the key. Wooden bridges may be destroyed in different ways; <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193755489" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5489-0787"/>they may be pulled to pieces,
                    burned, or blown up. When there is time to take them to pieces, they are
                    unspiked, and the timbers so separated that they may be speedily removed. The
                    best method of burning such bridges is to tar them, and to cover and surround
                    them with fascines or tarred brushwood. When it is necessary to blow up wooden
                    bridges, this may be effected by means of 220 pounds of powder suspended under
                    the superstructure, and fired in the manner above described.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">ford</hi> is rendered impassable by throwing in large stones,
                    by sinking boards with spikes standing upright in them, by scattering in it
                    crows’-feet, or by placing harrows taken from the neighbouring farms. A low wall
                    may also be built across, so as not to be perceptible above the water; strong
                    stakes may be driven into the bottom,and trees fastened to them; waggons loaded
                    with stones, and the wheels taken off, may in like manner be employed; not to
                    mention a number of other things which may be easily found, and which will
                    answer the purpose equally well. The rendering a ford impassable by such means
                    is only second in importance to the destruction of a bridge, when the enemy
                    whose progress it is desired to retard has either no pontoon-train at all, or
                    has outstripped it by the rapidity of his advance. In this way much valuable
                    time may be gained on the one hand and lost on the other. <hi rend="smallcaps"
