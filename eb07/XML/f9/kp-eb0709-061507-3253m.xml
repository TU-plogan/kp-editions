                <p><label type="entry">FLAXMAN, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, an eminent
                    English sculptor, was born at York on the 6th of July 1755. He was the second
                    son of John Flaxman, a moulder in plaster, who, besides keeping a shop in London
                    for the sale of his figures, sought employment in the country. He was of a
                    weakly consti- . tution, and slightly deformed, which prevented him from
                    mingling with associates of his own age in the robust pastimes of youth. But he
                    was not idle. Behind his father’s counter he usually seated himself during the
                    day, and, with drawing materials before him, busily employed himself in
                    transferring to paper representations of the numerous figures with which he was
                    surrounded. Indeed, almost from childhood he evinced that partiality for and
                    love of works of art, ' in the creation of which he so much excelled in maturer
                    years. But he did not confine himself to copying alone. Young as he was, he had
                    dipped into the Iliad, and actually attempted to design historical illustrations
                    of that immortal epic. His education seems to have devolved principally upon his
                    parents; and as his thirst for knowledge was great, the superintendence of his
                    studies must have been an easy task. At his books and models he laboured
                    incessantly, and before he entered his tenth year he had made a great number of
                    small models in plaster of Paris, wax, and clay, some of which are still
                    preserved; and, besides being interesting as the first efforts of genius, they
                    possess considerable merit as works of art. At ten years of age, a salutary
                    change took place in his health. He became strong, lively, and active; and the
                    crutches, by means of which he had hitherto walked, were thrown aside, not to be
                    again resumed. With renovated health he came to the determination to follow
                    sculpture as a profession. In his father s shop, where he assiduously pursued
                    his studies, he learned form and proportion from the casts of antique statues
                    which it contained; whilst in the woods and fields, to which he could now
                    repair, he was supplied with new images and ideas of beauty. At the house of a
                    Mrs Mathew, whose husband had been attracted to the youthful sculptor, Flaxman
                    often spent his evenings hearing her read Homer and Virgil, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193753266" xml:id="kp-eb0709-3266-0616"/>discourse upon sculpture and
                    poetry; for the lady was very accomplished, and the companion of Mrs Montague,
                    Mrs Chapone, and Mrs Barbauld. Here he was encouraged to acquire the dead
                    languages, so necessary to one of his profession; and although he never attained
                    to great scholarship, he, by this desultory mode of study, obtained such a
                    knowledge of Greek as enabled him to embody the ideas of the ancient poets in a
                    manner which no modern artist has surpassed. He embodied those passages which
                    caught his fancy whilst lie sat listening to Mrs Mathew; and the taste which he
                    displayed in these juvenile efforts induced a gentleman to order six large
                    drawings in chalk, the subjects being chosen from antiquity. The praise which
                    was bestow ed upon them gave new impulse to the genius of the youth, and
                    refreshed that consciousness of superior power which he early experienced. But
                    he never overrated himself, nor allowed his industry to relax on account of the
                    flatteries of friends. He continued to labour assiduously in his vocation, well
                    knowing that it was only in this manner that he could attain great eminence, and
                    succeed in embodying those idealised conceptions of beauty which, although they
                    scarcely admit of being defined or described, are nevertheless not less real,
                    nor less universally acknowledged.</p>
                <p>In his fifteenth year Flaxman became a student of the Royal Academy, and soon
                    made himself known by assiduous and enthusiastic application. In the same year
                    he carried off the silver medal; and in due time became a candidate for the gold
                    one, the reward of the highest degree of merit, but proved unsuccessful. This
                    defeat, however, only increased his assiduity. But finding himself now compelled
                    to labour for bread, he was employed by the Wedgewoods, the enterprising
                    potters, in making designs for adorning their wares. His sketches consisted
                    chiefly of small groups in very low relief, the subjects being taken from
                    ancient poetry and history. Previously to this period the porcelain of England
                    had little external beauty to recommend it; and the genius of Flaxman may be
                    said to have created this branch of art in his native country. The rude and
                    unseemly shapes which formerly prevailed were no longer tolerated, and figures
                    of classic elegance and beauty were invented to supply their place. In 1782,
                    Flaxman having quitted his paternal roof, took a small house, and entered into a
                    matrimonial alliance with a person of considerable accomplishments, in whose
                    society he enjoyed much domestic happiness. During the ten years which preceded
                    this event, he had exhibited some thirteen works at the Royal Academy, but, from
                    the pecuniary difficulties under which he laboured, none of these were executed
                    in marble. Shortly after his marriage, he formed the resolution of studying at
                    Rome, and at the end of five years of incessant labour, during which he executed
                    several monuments and other works of considerable merit, he was enabled to carry
                    his design into execution. It is unnecessary to observe, that Flaxman, like
                    every other artist, was struck with the noble specimens of art which Italy
                    possesses, and that by a close study of these he greatly improved himself. But
                    he was no servile imitator, for he was as capable of creating as of copying. In
                    Rome Flaxman executed a number of works, ror three individuals of his own
                    country he illustrated Homer, Aeschylus, and Dante. These designs are splendid,
                    being varied with great skill, and drawn with a fine sense of the beautiful and
                    harmonious in composition. Of works in marble he executed a small size groμp of
                    Cephalus and Aurora; a statue of Lord Mansfield; a group representing the fury
                    of Athamas, from Ovid’s <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses,</hi> consisting of four
                    figures of the heroic size; and the restoration of that splendid torso which is
                    generally believed to be a fragment of+ Hercifles This last undertaking was as
                    difficult as it turned out to be thankless. He not only completed the figure of
                    Hercules, but added another of Omphale· But this statue did not give
                    satisfaction to the connoisseurs of Italy, and Flaxman caused it to be destroyed
                    some time previously to his death, without any injury to his fame. The remains
                    of ancient sculpture in Rome, and in other cities of Italy, engaged not a little
                    of his attention. He executed numerous drawings, and made a great many
                    memoranda, the most valuable of which were subsequently embodied in his lectures
                    on sculpture. He had been elected a member of the academies of Florence and
                    Carrara; and after seven years’ residence in a foreign country, he at length
                    returned to his own.</p>
                <p>Flaxman’s statue of Lord Mansfield had raised the expectations of his countrymen
                    to a high pitch. In 1797 he was elected associate of the Royal Academy, during
                    which year he sent to the exhibition three sketches in bas-relief from the New
                    Testament, anu a monument to Sir William Jones. The sketches are distinguished
                    for their elegance of grouping. The monument is a bas-relief, but not one of the
                    artist’s most fortunate efforts in that line. In the forty-fifth year of his age
                    Flaxman was elected a member of the Royal Academy, and, as is usual on such
                    occasions, presented to the institution a work of art. His offering on this
                    occasion was a marble group of Apollo and Marpessa; the conception of which is
                    fine, though the workmanship is not so good. In the mechanical use of the chisel
                    he never excelled. It was now his ambition to be employed upon some great
                    national work, and he proposed to make a statue of Britannia two hundred feet in
                    height, but the project was not carried into execution. His fame, however, was
                    now firmly established, and employment flowed rapidly in. A quick succession of
                    noble works followed from his hand, one of which, a monument in memory of the
                    family of Sir Francis Baring, is considered among the greatest efforts of the
                    national genius of England. One of his biographers remarks with respect to it,
                    “This is one of the finest pieces of motionless poetry in the land.” Of
                    historical monuments Flaxman executed several, but they are not equal to his
                    other works. They have been admired for the fine sentiment which pervades them,
                    but their execution is considered by many as too coarse and heavy. The statue of
                    Sir Joshua Reynolds is one of his best productions. But the works he loved most
                    were those which embodied poetical passages in the Bible, and of these he
                    executed a great number. In 1810 the Royal Academy created a professorship of
                    sculpture, and bestowed it upon Flaxmau. His lectures are ten in number. The
                    style is rather heavy; yet although his compositions are destitute of those
                    flashes of poetry which irradiate the pages of Fuseli, they display a very
                    comprehensive knowledge of the subject, much sound sense, and are more
                    calculated to convey definite information to the student than those of the other
                    artist above named. But if the offspring of his pen was cold and uninformed with
                    ideal beauty, the productions of his pencil and chisel display an exuberance of
                    imagination. His sketches and drawings are very numerous. Amongst the works
                    which he illustrated were the Pilgrim’s Progress, Sotheby’s translation of
                    Oberon, an Hesiod. These designs are in all respects fully equal to his other
                    works, and unsurpassed by any thing which ever was executed in that line. During
                    the last ten years o his life Flaxman produced some of his noblest works·
                    Amongst these were the group of the Archangel Michae vanquishing Satan, the
                    Shield of Achilles, Psyche, the Pastoral Apollo, and the statues of Michel
                    Angelo and Rafaelle. The first is a work of the highest merit, and wort y of the
                    great poem which it illustrates. “In the lsycιe and the Pastoral Apollo,” says
                    Mr Allan Cunningham, “the genius of him who illustrated Homer is suflicient y .
                    apparent; a certain austere composure is breathed over <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193753279" xml:id="kp-eb0709-3279-0617"/>them. The Michael Angelo and
                    the Raphael are poetic yet real; heroic, yet familiar; and their costume, though
                    not antique, is at once historic and picturesque.” Flaxman’s statues of Burns
                    and Kemble, executed about the same time <hi rend="subscript">:</hi> are
                    scarcely so happy. Amongst his other works were monuments to Collins at
                    Chichester, and to Earl Howe in Si Paul’s; and statues of Washington, Nclson,
                    Pitt, and Siι John Moore. They are of various excellence, yet all more or less
                    bear the impress of genius and taste. But the career of this great sculptor was
                    drawing to a close. In the beginning of December 1826 he was seized with an
                    inflammation of the lungs, which terminated fatally on the 7th of the same
                    month.</p>
                <p>In stature Flaxman was small, and his figure was slim. In manners he was mild,
                    gentlc, and placable; and his mind, whilst it was rich in the gifts of genius,
                    was embued with unaffected piety. Of his works there are four kinds; the
                    religious, the poetic, the classic, and the historical. In each of these he has
                    left specimens which entitle him to rank very high as an artist, but in all he
                    has not attained the same degree of excellence. In the historical and the
                    classic he was less successful; but in the religious and poetic he has been
                    surpassed in purity, simplicity, and taste, by no modern sculptor. His religious
                    compositions consist of groups and figures embodying moral and spiritual
                    passages from Scripture. They are generally of small dimensions, but very
                    numerous. His mind was essentially poetical; and his productions are embued with
                    the finest inspiration. It was probably of some of these works that Sir Thomas
                    Lawrence spoke when he said of Flaxman, “His solitude was made enjoyment to him
                    by a fancy teeming with images of tenderness, purity, or grandeur. His genius,
                    in the strictest sense of the words, was original and inventive.” His lectures
                    were published in 1829, in one vol. 8vo, illustrated with fifty-two plates.</p>
