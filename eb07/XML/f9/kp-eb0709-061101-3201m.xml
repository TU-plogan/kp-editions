                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    rend="smallcaps">Valerius,</hi> an ancient Latin poet, of whom personally but
                    little is known. He is supposed to have been born at <hi rend="italic"
                    >Setia,</hi> a town of Campania, now Sezzo, whence he has derived the surname of
                    Setinus. But Martial, his contemporary and friend, seems to intimate that he was
                    a native of Padua, or at least lived there. He died when he was about thirty
                    years of age, in the year 93 or 94 of our era, before he had put the finishing
                    hand to the poem on which his reputation entirely rests. The subject which he
                    selected as deserving of celebration was the history of the Argonautic
                    expedition; but of the ten books into which he intended to divide it, he lived
                    only to compose seven and part of the eighth. This poem, which is addressed to
                    the emperor Vespasian, whom the poet compliments on account of his conquest of
                    Judaea, whilst Domitian is at the same time praised for his poetical talents, is
                    an imitation rather than a translation of the Argonautics of Apollonius; and
                    Flaccus has evidently been most successful in those parts where he had not the
                    Greek poet immediately in his view. The model upon which he formed himself was
                    Virgil; and, notwithstanding Horace’s sneer at the <hi rend="italic">servum
                    pecus,</hi> it is surprising how closely the imitator sometimes approaches to
                    the great original. Quintilian’s opinion of his merit may be easily gathered
                    from the brief but expressive eulogium, <hi rend="italic">Multum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">in Valerio Flacco nuper</hi><hi rend="italic">amisimus.</hi> The
                    best editions of this poet are that of Nicoas Heinsius, published at Amsterdam,
                    1680, in 8vo, reprinted of the same size in 1702; and that <hi rend="italic"
                    >cum</hi><hi rend="italic">notis integris</hi><hi rend="italic">variorum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Petri Burmanni,</hi> which appeared at
                    Leyden, 1724, in 4to. It is proper to add, that Baptista Pius, an Italian poet,
                    completed the eighth book of the <hi rend="italic">Argo-nautics,</hi> which
                    Flaccus had left unfinished, and added two <hi rend="superscript"> more</hi>
                    from Apollonius; a supplement which was first print'd by Aldus in 1523, and
                    which has been subjoined to most, if of all of the subsequent editions. (Vossius
