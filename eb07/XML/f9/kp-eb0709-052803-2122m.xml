                <p><label type="entry">FEZ</label>, an extensive country of Africa, and at one time
                    the most flourishing kingdom in the northern part of that continent. It now,
                    however, forms one of the four provinces or kingdoms into which the empire of
                    Morocco is divided. It is bounded on the north by the Straits of Gibraltar and
                    the Mediterranean Sea, on the east by Algiers, on the south by Morocco, and on
                    the west by the Atlantic Ocean. Besides being bordered in one part by the chain
                    of the Greater Atlas, a smaller one called the Lesser Atlas runs across it,
                    extending from the Great Atlas to the sea near Tetuan, a considerable city
                    situated on the Straits of Gibraltar. It is likewise traversed in various
                    directions by other ranges of mountains, some of which are lofty, rugged, and
                    barren, whilst others are adapted for pasture. The intervening plains and
                    valleys, however, which are frequently many miles in extent, being finely
                    watered, are in the highest degree fertile, and capable of producing all the
                    luxuries of the eastern and western worlds. The soilorthe interior is a rich
                    black loam, which, although but very slightly cultivated, is remarkably
                    prolific. The mountainous parts also might, by suitable cultivation, be made to
                    produce abundantly those fruits which thrive best in the nil y regions of warm
                    climates; but they are for the most part utterly neglected. The Moors know
                    little of agriculture, and, besides, they only cultivate in proportion to their
                    im<pb break="no" facs="nls:193752135" xml:id="kp-eb0709-2135-0529"/>mediate
                    wants; so that a considerable portion of the country is allowed to lie untilled.
                    The principal rivers are the Mulluwia or Mulvia, which separates Fez from
                    Algiers; the Morbeya or Ommirabee, which separates Fez from the province of
                    Tcdla; and the Seboo, which waters the interior of the country. Fez is estimated
                    to contain about 89,000 square miles in superficial extent, and its territorial
                    divisions are as follows:</p>

                <p>The government, statistics, and commerce of this region in every respect resemble
                    those of Morocco, of which it is indeed a part, and they will accordingly be
                    described under that article.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fez,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Fas,</hi> the capital of
                    the above kingdom, was built in 786, by a prince of the name of Edris, and
                    having soon risen to be a city of the first magnitude, became the capital of the
                    western Mahommedan states. In the twelfth century it is said to have contained
                    seven hundred temples and nosques, a number of which were erected upon a
                    magnificent scale, and adorned with a profusion of marble pillars. It was at one
                    time held, in the highest veneration; and when the road to Mecca was shut up, in
                    the fourth century of the Hegira, pilgrimages to Fez were performed by the
                    western Moslemins, who considered it as a place nearly equally sacred with that
                    where the Prophet had been born. It was also distinguished for its learning, at
                    a time when the Saracens may be said ‘to have enjoyed a monopoly of all the
                    knowledge which then existed. Its schools of philosophy, physic, and astronomy,
                    were famous throughout the Mahommedan kingdoms of Spain and Africa, and were not
                    only resorted to by the youth of these countries, but likewise by Christians.
                    When the Moors were driven out of Spain, Fez became the resort of numerous
                    refugees, who, being superior in knowledge and civilization to their original
                    countrymen, introduced several of the arts, the practice of which for a time
                    retrieved the decaying fortunes of the city. But it gradually sunk with the
                    declension of arts and wealth in Northern Africa; and when the lringdom of which
                    it was the capital became incorporated with the empire of Morocco, it ceased to
                    possess almost any political importance.</p>
                <p>Fez is situated upon the slope of several hills, which surround it on every side
                    except the north and north-cast. As the town is built on inclined planes, and
                    the ground is unpaved, the streets are very dirty, especially in rainy weather.
                    They are, besides, ső narrow, that two horsemen cannot ride together abreast in
                    them; and the gloom thus produced is deepened by the houses (which are very
                    high) having a projection on the first floor. The light is also intercepted by a
                    sort of galleries or passages which connect the upper parts of the houses, and
                    by the high walls which are raised at certain distances from one side of the
                    street to the other, as if to support the buildings. These walls have arched
                    passages, which are shut at night, and all communication between one part of the
                    city and another is by this means cut off. The houses have a mean and ruinous
                    appearance; they are either altogether destitute of windows, or possess but a
                    few which are seldom larger than a common sheet of paper, and being placed very
                    high, are generally covered with blinds. Behind the high walls there are some
                    buildings which in the inside present something of comfort; but it is the
                    general taste of the country to ave a mansion composed of a court-yard,
                    surrounded with a colonnade, which forms a kind of gallery both above and below.
                    By these galleries the adjoining rooms are reached, and these commonly receive
                    their light only from the door, which, on this account, is necessarily large.
                    The rooms are long and narrow; the ceiling, composed of planks, is lofty, and
                    sometimes ornamented; and the floors are paved with bricks, Dutch tiles, or
                    marble, according to the wealth of the occupant. The roofs are covered with
                    stamped earth, about one foot thick; and this singular casing, on account of its
                    weight, bulges the walls outwards, and rends them into fissures, whilst it does
                    not protect the houses from rain.</p>
                <p>Fez properly consists of two distinct towns, <hi rend="italic">Fas el Bâlee,</hi>
                    or Old Fez, and <hi rend="italic">Fas el Jedid,</hi> or New Fez. The latter,
                    which was founded in the thirteenth century, stands on an eminence commanding
                    the old city, and is surrounded with gardens, which abound in all sorts of
                    delicious fruits and odoriferous flowers. This portion of Fez is principally
                    inhabited by Jews. At the bottom of the valley, which is formed by the
                    surrounding hills into a sort of funnel, runs the river <hi rend="italic">Wed el
                    Juhor,</hi> the river of pearls, so called on account of its value. Besides
                    refreshing vegetation as it passes along, and plentifully supplying the city
                    with water, it is made to turn several water-mills. Fez possesses a vast number
                    of mosques, the finest of which is called <hi rend="italic">El Cαrou-bin.</hi>
                    It was built during the flourishing period of the city, and is described by Leo
                    Africanus as being a mile and a half in circumference. It is constructed of
                    bricks, stones, and lime, but the architecture is said to be mean. It possesses,
                    however, a great number of gates and arches, and two handsome fountains in the
                    court. There are two other celebrated mosques, one of which (namely, that
                    dedicated to Edris, the founder of the city), is the most frequented in Fez. The
                    palace of the sultan is composed of a great number of court-yards, which serve
                    as entrances to apartments. These consist, besides those for domestic uses, of
                    rooms in which the business of government is transacted. The palace is situated
                    upon an elevation in New Fez. None of the other buildings are in any respect
                    remarkable. There are a great number of shops, to which the inhabitants of the
                    surrounding country daily resort as to a fair, for the purchase of commodities,
                    as they have neither shops nor working-places amongst themselves.
                    Provision-markets are numerous, and the city contains about two hundred
                    caravanserais or inns. The various trades, and the different articles sold, arc
                    divided into classes in separate streets, so that a whole street is occupied by
                    those pursuing one species of traffic or art. Fez contains a vast number of
                    public baths, some of which are good, and consist of several rooms heated to
                    different degrees of temperature. There is an hospital richly endowed, but it is
                    occupied solely by lunatics. There are also a great number of schools, the most
                    distinguished of which are established at the mosques of Carou-bin and of Muley
                    Edris, in a small house or mosque called <hi rend="italic">Emdarsa</hi> or
                    academy. In these philosophy is taught, but of course very imperfectly.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of Fez consist of woollen hhaïks, sashes, and silk
                    handkerchiefs, slippers of good leather, which they tan remarkably well, red
                    felt caps, some coarse linen cloth, fine carpets, a curious kind of earthenware,
                    weapons of several kinds, saddlers’ ware, and copper utensils. There are .a few
                    goldsmiths; but the adorning of the person with gold and silver being considered
                    as a sin, this branch of industry is not much patronized. The arts here find
                    little encouragement, and are indeed far inferior to those of Europe, except in
                    the preparation of leather, and in the fabrication of carpets and of hhaiks,
                    which the manufacturers know how to weave as fine and as transparent as gauze.
                    They are also expert in wax-works, weapons, and harness. The heat during the
                    summer is very great; but in other seasons of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193752148" xml:id="kp-eb0709-2148-0530"/>the year, particularly
                    winter, the climate is agreeable. With regard to the number of inhabitants, much
                    difference of opinion prevails amongst travellers. Mr Jackson estimates the
                    population of the old and new city at 380,000 souls, which is certainly an
                    exaggeration; whilst other authorities reduce the number as low as 60,000 and
                    even 30,000 individuals, which is probably below the mark. The traveller who
                    assumed the fictitious name of Ali Bey was told, whilst he remained there, that
                    Fez contained 100,000 souls, and that before the last plague the inhabitants
                    were double that number. Of this population about 2000 are Jews, who live in the
                    most abject state, on account of the sovereign contempt with which they are
                    treated by the Moors. They are almost all either artisans or merchants, and they
                    have several synagogues, and a market-place, which is well provided. According
                    to Ali Bey, the city is situated in long. 4. 58. 15. W. lat. 34. 6. 3. N. It is
                    160 miles south of Gibraltar, and 200 north-north-east of Morocco.</p>
