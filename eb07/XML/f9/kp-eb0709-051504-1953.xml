                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">FERMANAGH</label>, a county in the south-western part of the
                    province of Ulster, in Ireland, is bounded on the north by the counties of
                    Donegal and Tyrone, on the east by the county of Monaghan, on the south by the
                    counties of Cavan and Leitrim, and on the west by those of Leitrim and Donegal.
                    It extends over a surface of 471,348 acres, of which 320,999 are arable land,
                    101,952 are mountain and bog, and 48,797 are under water.</p>
                <p>In the time of Ptolemy it was inhabited by the tribe of the Darini. Afterwards it
                    came into the possession of the Maguires, the O’Flanagans, and the O’Reillys;
                    the first-named of which families had the greatest share of property and
                    influence, and its head was looked upon as the dynast or chieftain of the
                    territory. On the settlement of Ulster in the commencement of the reign of James
                    I. the English family of the Coles was ranked among the principal residents. The
                    county was made shire-ground, along with the rest of Ulster, by Elizabeth, when
                    it was divided into the eight baronies of which it consists at present, viz.
                    Clonkelly, Coole, Glenawly, Knockninny, Lurg, Maghera-boy, Maghera-Stephana, and
                    Tyrkennedy. These baronies are subdivided into eighteen parishes and six parts
                    of parishes, the remaining parts of which are included within some of the
                    adjoining counties. According to the ecclesiastical arrangements of Ireland, the
                    chief portion of this county is in the diocese of Clogher; three parishes only
                    being in the adjoining diocese of Kilmore.</p>
                <p>The surface is very uneven. The borders tow ards Ty- <pb break="no"

                    east, are mountainous. The northwestern portion towards Leitrim presents one
                    continuous mass of hills, many of them high, rough, and boggy, amongst which
                    Belmore Mountain, swelling out its massive sides towards Lough Erne, stands
                    proudly conspicuous. From the summit of the Tossid Mountain is a most extensive
                    prospect, commanding the view of several counties, and taking in the whole of
                    the lake just mentioned. Quilca Mountain, partly in this county and partly in
                    Cavan, rises to a very considerable height. The hills on the southeastern side
                    of the lough are disposed more in ridges than those near them in the adjoining
                    county of Cavan.</p>
                <p>The great feature of the county is Lough Erne, which divides it nearly throughout
                    its whole extent from northwest to south-east. This fine sheet of water forms
                    two long lakes, connected by a strait, on which the town of Enniskillen is
                    situated. They are distinguished by the names of the Upper and Lower Lakes. The
                    former, or the more inland, which lies between Belturbet and Enniskillen, is
                    eleven miles in length, and from half a mile to six miles in width. The latter,
                    which lies between Enniskillen and Belleek, is thirteen miles long, and from two
                    to ten broad. The borders of both are finely broken by numerous bays and inlets,
                    formed by the projections of the surrounding mountains and hills. Both parts of
                    the lake are studded with numerous islands. Popular report makes the number of
                    these equal to that of the days of the year; and, if all the detached points of
                    rock or land visible above water were taken into the account, this number would
                    not be above the truth. There are not, however, more than a hundred and fifty of
                    them ’ which deserve the name of islands. They are in general well formed for
                    scenic effect, and many of them are planted, chiefly with ash and oak, even to
                    the water’s verge. Part of the Upper Lake is so much crowded with them as to
                    give it the appearance, in some parts, more of a flooded country than of an
                    extensive sheet of water. The islands in the Lower Lake are more numerous and
                    picturesque. The largest is Bo or Cow Island, so called from being employed as
                    pasturage; it is situated near the western extremity of the lake. But Devenish
                    Island, near its eastern end, though smaller, is much more celebrated, from
                    having on it one of the most perfect pillar towers in Ireland. Its height is
                    eighty-two feet, and its circumference forty-nine. It is built of cut stone, and
                    finished at the top with a conical roof. Near the summit of the hill which forms
                    the island is the abbey of St Mary’s, of which the belfry staircase and some of
                    the Gothic pillars still remain. At the foot of the hill is a church dedicated
                    to St Molush; and in its vicinity are the remains of that saint’s house, roofed
                    and finished with cut stone. Within a few paces of the house is a stone trough,
                    about six feet long, said to have been his bed, in which those affected with
                    various complaints perform certain prescribed ceremonies, in the hope of
                    obtaining relief. In the island of Ennism’saint are the ruins of an abbey
                    founded by St Nevnid, whose festival is annually celebrated in it. The saint’s
                    bell, ornamented with gold and silver, is still preserved in the island, and
                    held in such veneration as to be used as a relic to swear upon. In the same
                    island is aj&gt;urying-ground, having a large stone cross at its entrance.
                    Innismore is the largest island in the Upper Lake. Belle-isle, containing about
                    two hundred acres, once the favourite residence of the Earl of Ross, and
                    celebrated as well for its natural beauties as for the taste displayed in its
                    improvements, has been suffered to fall into such decay that scarcely a vestige
                    remains of what it once had been. It is connected with the main land by a
                    bridge. Innishar-key Island, near the village of Crum, has been the residence of
                    the representative of the Erne family since the destruction of Crum Castle. The
                    navigation of the lake is chiefly carried on by small vessels called cotts,
                    about ten feet long below, flat-bottomed, with upright sides, and sloping
                    outwards at the stem and stern, so as to allow them to be brought close to the
                    shallow margin of the lake. They are worked by oars; and a broad paddle at the
                    stern serves instead of a rudder. This lake has been pointed out by a late
                    celebrated engineer as an excellent station for steam navigation, although
                    steamers cannot pass from it to Ballyshannon by the Erne, in consequence of the
                    numerous cascades and rapids in that river. Neither is the harbour of
                    Ballyshannon an advantageous site. The course of the steamers should be from
                    Lough Erne through Lough Melvin, and by Manor Hamilton to Sligo; and thence to
                    communicate with the head of the Shannon. Two other lines of inland navigation
                    have been projected, commencing at Lough Erne, and terminating, the one
                    eastwards at Lough Neagh, the other northwards at Lough Foyle; but nothing has
                    as yet been effected towards the accomplishment of either of them. There are
                    some smaller lakes in the county, the largest of which are Lough Melvin, on the
                    borders of Leitrim, and Lough Macnean or Cane, on the confines of Cavan and
                    Leitrim.</p>
                <p>The only river of any importance is the Erne, which rises in the county of Cavan,
                    and after passing through Belturbet, falls into Lough Erne at its south-eastern
                    extremity; thence, passing by Enniskillen, it enters the Lower Lake, at the
                    north-western extremity of which it again narrows into a river, and, passing
                    through Belleek, forms a fine water-fall, bursting out through a thick wood in a
                    broad sheet; and afterwards breaking over a ledge of shelving rocks, it foams
                    through the arches of the bridge here thrown over it, after which it becomes
                    more tranquil; yet, still maintaining a rapid current, during a course of nine
                    miles, in which it crosses many lesser ridges of rock, it at length precipitates
                    its water down a noble cataract into the Atlantic at Ballyshannon. The other
                    remarkable rivers are, the Arney, the Ballenclarogh, the Ballycassidy, the
                    Clodagh, the Kish Water, the Moorlaugh, and the Sillas; all of which, together
                    with upwards of fifty smaller streams, contribute to the supply of Lough
                    Erne.</p>
                <p>The geological structure of the county consists of sandstone and secondary
                    limestone, alternating with tolerable regularity. Red standstone exists in
                    Tossid Mountain, Yellow sandstone, well adapted for building, lies round the
                    town of Enniskillen. Limestone may be found in several of the islands in Lough
                    Erne. A beautiful species of brown marble is found near Florence-court, a
                    limestone district; but it requires to be worked to a greater depth than at
                    present, in order to procure blocks and slabs free from flaws. Coal is said to
                    have been raised in Glengarron Hills; but as no effort has lately been made to
                    procure this mineral there, notwithstanding the avidity with which mines of
                    every description have been sought out and purchased up, it may be inferred that
                    it is not to be had in sufficient quantities to render it an article of general
                    consumption. The cheapness of turf fuel, which is to be had in all parts, is
                    another reason why coal is not more sought after.</p>
                <p>Mineral springs are numerous. Rutty gives a listornineteen, mostly sulphureous,
                    but none are much frequented by strangers; the superior character of the waters
                    of Swadlingbar, in the adjoining county of Cavan, having prevented any
                    successful rivalry.</p>
                <p>The population of this county has increased prodigiously from the period in which
                    the subject became an object of special inquiry. According to the several
                    authorities by which it has been ascertained, its progress is as follows.</p>

                <p>Of the numbers in the latter return, 5283 were of the established church, 246
                    were Roman Catholics, and 4204 dissenters, whilst the religious persuasion" of
                    sixty was not ascertained. Eighteen schools, containing 1012 pupils, were
                    supported by grants of public money; fifty-nine, containing 3433 pupils, by
                    voluntary subscription; and the remaining 163 schools, containing 5348 pupils,
                    were wholly maintained by the fees of the pupils. As far as the proportions
                    between the religious persuasion of the pupils can be applied as a scale for
                    estimating the adult population, the Catholic portion of it must be extremely
                    small, not constituting more than one-fiftieth of the whole, the remaining
                    forty-nine parts being divided in nearly equal proportions between the
                    Protestants of the established church and the dissenters. But in deducing this
                    inference, due allowance should be made for the circumstance, that the Catholic
                    population chiefly prevails in the mountainous districts, in which the desire
                    for education is more checked by local obstacles than in those parts nearer the

                <p>Of the last-named number of electors, 1015 voted at the first election under the
                    reform act.</p>
                <p>This county is almost exclusively agricultural. Farms vary from nine acres,
                    chiefly under tillage, to large tracts for grazing. Much land is let in the
                    gross to middle-men, who sublet it to smaller tenants. Landowners of this
                    description are distinguished by the name of terny-begs, or little landlords.
                    Tiernagh is the Irish word for a prince. There is much land belonging to the see
                    of Clogher in the county. Rents are paid in the mountainous districts in young
                    cattle, yarn, and butter. Oats and barley are the kinds of grain chiefly raised;
                    wheat is comparatively little grown. The manures are, marl, limestone, limestone
                    gravel, bog-mold, and bog-ashes. The marl is white and light, found under bogs
                    and in banks. That about Florence-court is upon clay and gravel, with springs
                    under it, which cause the marl to run into orms like cinders petrified, and of a
                    reddish cast, as if from vitriolic acid. Marl is but little used in farming,
                    limestone and gravel being found more productive. Land is generally prepared for
                    potatoes by manuring it with dung, or yiffi lime and bog-mud mixed, and with
                    burnt clay, which “found to answer well. Some excellent pasture lands are grazed
                    both by black cattle and sheep. A small breed* of cows is to be met with in all
                    parts. The general stock of sheep is of an inferior kind; neither is there any
                    thing like a flock to be seen. Goats are common, in consequence of the ease with
                    which they are maintained in the mountain pastures. Twenty of these are not
                    counted as a <hi rend="italic">sum,</hi> the term used in this county to signify
                    the keep of a cow, or the quantity of land requisite to feed one. The hilly
                    coun-. try affords coarse pasturage for large herds of young cattle; yet that it
                    could be made still more productive by being brought under tillage, is evinced
                    from the success which has attended every judicious effort of industry when thus
                    directed. Timber is more general in Fermanagh than in some of the neighbouring
                    counties. Beech grows to a large size. Ash is a tree peculiarly abundant, both
                    here and in the adjoining counties of Cavan and Tyrone. In the first-mentioned
                    of these counties, indeed, it is constantly found in the hedgerows; and, more
                    particularly in the northern side of Lough Erne, it runs like a weed through the
                    county.</p>
                <p>The linen manufacture is carried on here to some extent. The principal kind made
                    is what is termed seven-eighths. There are several bleachfields in different
                    parts. A good deal of wool is also spun, which is generally worked up into
                    druggets, the warp being of tow yarn and the weft of wool. It is chiefly
                    consumed within the county. These manufactures, and the rearing of black cattle,
                    may be considered as the main sources of wealth among the small farmers.</p>
                <p>The fish chiefly taken in Lough Erne and its tributary streams are, pike, perch,
                    white and speckled trout, bream, red roach, pullein, salmon, and eels both
                    silver and mud, much esteemed for the excellence of their flavour. There are
                    several large eel-weirs at Enniskillen, where great quantities of these fish are
                    caught. They come from the sea when young, and are intercepted in their return.
                    They never take the bait, nor are they known to take any kind of food. The
                    country people catch them by extending across the stream a band of hay, in which
                    they are so entangled that they are easily taken. Their average weight is about
                    three pounds. Those not sold fresh or sent to Dublin are carried in barrels,
                    each of which contains eight dozen, and are sold in Belturbet. Eighty dozen are
                    sometimes caught in a night. There is also an eel-weir near the falls of
                    Belleek.</p>
                <p>Fermanagh has a few resident proprietors of high rank or large income. They are
                    all members of the established church, and derive their titles to their estates
                    from Elizabeth, James I., or Cromwell. A class of yeomanry is also to be met
                    with, who distinguish themselves by the character of being “as good Protestants
                    as any in Ireland a phrase implying not so much any superiority in religious
                    qualifications, as a rooted aversion to their Roman Catholic neighbours. These
                    are farmers, who hold tracts of land of considerable extent, and were settled in
                    the county when the right to the elective franchise was exclusively in the hands
                    of Protestants. At that period, Catholic tenants were often turned out of their
                    farms, and sent farther up the mountains, to make room for the privileged class.
                    The Protestants are a fine race of men, much superior in appearance to those of
                    any other of the northern counties. This superiority arises, in all probability,
                    from their habits of life, which, being peculiarly agricultural, with very
                    little intermixture of sedentary employment at manufactures, are more favourable
                    to the free expansion of the bodily powers. They are tall, well made, and
                    robust. Their countenances display the bloom of health; and they enjoy that
                    uninterrupted flow of animal spirits which is the constant attendant on regular
                    living and active employment. Yet, whether from custom or natural propensity,
                    the peasants do not rise early, and the cows are not milked till noon. There
                    being but few markets for the produce of the soil, little encouragement is given
                    to extraordinary exertion; they <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751992"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-1992-0518"/>therefore seldoin think of turning their time to
                    the best advantage. The cottars are poor, and their cabins wretched huts, with a
                    wattled door, and a mat on the inside. Yet many of the herdsmen who reside in
                    the mountains are able to give their daughters on their marriage twenty guineas
                    and a feather bed, although the cabins in which they reside are of the wretched
                    description just mentioned, and seem to contain nothing but dirt and
                    wretchedness. In cases of disease the lower classes have no confidence in
                    medicine. When they send for the physician, they consider themselves as having
                    signed their death warrant. An aversion is therefore entertained to the whole
                    medical profession; and those who would not lay out sixpence in an apothecary’s
                    shop will hoard up considerable sums to provide for the expenses of a wake. The
                    custom of assembling round the body of a deceased friend prevails universally
                    amongst the Catholics of all ranks; but it is declining evefy year more and more
                    amongst the Protestants.</p>
                <p>The seats of the gentry are very splendid. The principal are, Castle Caldwell, a
                    fine mansion at the foot of a large mountain, having in front the promontory of
                    Rossagoul projecting into the lake, which is here studded with several fine
                    islands; Florence-court, the seat of the Earl of Enniskillen, the façade of
                    which, of the Ionic order, extends 260 feet; Belle-isle, already noticed; Castle
                    Saunderson, near which are some druidical monuments; Dromeoo, Castlecoole,
                    Castle Archdall, Brookborough, and Crum, where there is an extraordinary yew
                    tree, which throws out branches to the distance of forty-five feet.</p>
                <p>The towns in this county are few and small, none amounting in population to 6000
                    souls, and but two having more than 1000 souls each. Enniskillen, the county
                    town, is situated on an island in the strait or river that connects the two
                    portions of Lough Erne. As it was one of the great passes from Ulster into
                    Connaught, it has always been considered as a place of importance. During the
                    war of 1688 it was particularly celebrated for the stand it made against the
                    forces of James II. At a very early period it was the seat of the chief of the
                    Maguire family, the remains of whose castle still exist, having been converted
                    into an artillery barrack. The town occupies the whole island, and is connected
                    with the main land on both sides by a bridge at each end of the High Street. The
                    parish church is a venerable structure, on an elevated position. There is also a
                    Roman Catholic chapel, and three dissenting meetinghouses· The exterior of the
                    county infirmary presents the appearance of a private gentleman’s seat. The
                    markethouse is a light and graceful building, ornamented with a steeple, and
                    containing a suite of rooms for balls and assemblies. The court-house is a
                    plain, grave edifice. The other public buildings are the infantry barrack and
                    the county jail, in the latter of which the prisoners, who are all clothed in a
                    prison-uniform, and arranged in four classes, are employed in breaking stones. A
                    school is kept in it; and the females are superintended by a matron. There is
                    also a tread-mill. The average number of prisoners for the last few years has
                    been seventy. At a small distance from the town is the public school founded by
                    Charles I. who endowed it with an estate of 3360 acres. The head master receives
                    a salary of L.500 per annum, with other advantages. The town maintains a good
                    corn, butter, and fleshmarket, which last is held in convenient shambles. The
                    environs of the town are very beautiful. It opens on the view in a manner
                    peculiarly fine from Florence-court. The hill above the town was formerly
                    planted. A French engineer, sent over by Lord Pelham, cleared it of wood, and
                    erected a fort on it, which, after it had been built, was discovered to be
                    completely commanded by higher ground in the neighbourhood. Enniskillen is
                    celebrated as a depot for obtaining recruits for the army. A regiment of horse
                    was raised here in the time of King William, which is still distinguished by the
                    name of the Enniskillen dragoons. This circumstance, together with the general
                    habits and character of the peasantry, has tended to keep up a military spirit
                    throughout the county. There are few families which have not one or more sons in
                    the army. Young men who intend to enlist travel from very distant parts to this
                    town, where they are sure to meet with recruiting parties to receive them. The
                    population of Enniskillen in 1821 was 2399; in 1831 it was returned at 5270. The
                    only other town containing more than a thousand inhabitantsis Irvinestown,
                    formerly Lowtherstown, the population of which, according to the census of 1831,
                    amounted to 1047. The other collections of houses are mere villages, nor are
                    there many even of these.</p>
