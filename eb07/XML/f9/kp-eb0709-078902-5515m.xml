                <p><label type="entry">FOSTER, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label>, a
                    nonconformist divine, highly celebrated for his pulpit eloquence and erudition,
                    was born at Exeter in the year 1697. At the age of five he was put to the free
                    school of that city, where his progress in the acquisition of grammar was so
                    rapid that his master boasted of him as the most eminent genius in his school.
                    From this seminary he went to the academy where young men designed for being
                    clergymen in the dissenting interest were educated, and here his progress was
                    equally great. His apprehension was remarkably quick, his judgment solid, his
                    memory retentive, his eloquence commanding, and his talents for argumentation
                    truly admirable; but above all, his piety was genuine, and few men possessed
                    candour, modesty, liberality, integrity, tenderness, and benevolence, in so
                    remarkable a degree. He commenced preacher at the age of twenty-one, and was
                    much admired where he occasionally officiated. But the doctrine of the Trinity,
                    which was then much agitated in the west of England, did not accord with the
                    notions of Mr Foster, and the honesty and openness of his heart would not suffer
                    him to conceal his opinions, which, in fact, brought so much odium upon him from
                    the orthodox party, that he retired to another scene of action. He became pastor
                    of a congregation atMilborne-port, in Somersetshire; but as soon as his hearers
                    became zealously attached to what was deemed the orthodox opinion, he retired to
                    Ashwick, under the Mendip Hills, in the same county. In this asylum he preached
                    to two congregations at a little distance from each other, the united
                    contributions of which did not amount to L.15 per annum. In this state of
                    poverty and obscurity he lived for some years, submitting patiently to the
                    privations which were occasioned by his determined uprightness and sincerity. In
                    1720 he gave the world his <hi rend="italic">Essay on Fundamentals,</hi> the
                    design of which was to check an uncharitable and intolerant spirit, at that time
                    extremely prevalent, by showing that the Trinitarian notion is not a fundamental
                    article of Christianity, or made an express condition of salvation in the sacred
                    Scriptures. A sermon accompanied this essay, entitled <hi rend="italic">The
                    Resurrection of Christ proved and vindicated,</hi> against the most important
                    objections of the ancient Jews or modern Deists. From Ashwick, Foster removed to
                    Trowbridge in Wiltshire, where his congregation did not usually exceed twenty or
                    thirty persons.</p>
                <p>By reading Dr Gale’s treatise on infant baptism, he became a convert to the
                    doctrine, that immersion is the true scriptural rite, and was accordingly soon
                    afterwards baptized in London in conformity to that mode. This unreserved manner
                    of adopting whatever his conscience believed to be truth, excluded him from
                    almost every religious party amongst whom he might otherwise haveexpect-ed
                    preferment. But whilst he deliberated with himself whether he should abandon the
                    ministry, and acquire the knowledge of some mechanical employment, Mr Robert
                    Houlston received him into his house in the capacity of chaplain, and here his
                    circle of acquaintances became wider and more respectable. In 1724 he was
                    appointed to succeed Dr Gale in the Baptist congregation in Barbican, London. In
                    1728 he commenced a Sunday evening lecture in the Old Jewry, which he continued
                    till within a short time of his death, with a degree of popularity which few
                    dissenters at that time enjoyed. In 1732 appeared his work entitled The
                    Usefulness, Truth, and Excellency of the Christian Revelation, defended against
                    the objections contained in a late book, called <hi rend="italic">Christianity
                    as old as the Creation.</hi> In this reply Mr Foster exhibited no ordinary share
                    of talents and ingenuity, and it was admired by the candid and judicious of
                    every description. Dr Tindal, against whom it was written, is said to have
                    always spoken of it with great respect. He published a volume of sermons in the
                    year 1734, followed by three other volumes, the last of which appeared in 1744.
                    At this time he was appointed successor to Dr Jeremiah Hunt, in the protestant
                    congregation at Pinner’s-hall. In 1746 he attended the Earl of Kilmarnock when
                    under sentence of death for high treason, after which he published an octavo
                    pamphlet, containing An Account of the Behaviour of the late Earl of Kilmarnock
                    after his Sentence, and on the day of his Execution.</p>
                <p>Foster received from Marischal College, Aberdeen, the degree of doctor in
                    divinity, accompanied with handsome letters from the Principal and Professor
                    Fordyce. “We beg,” said the latter, “that you will be so good as to accept of
                    the diploma, as a small mark of the sincere veneration we have for you, and of
                    the sense we entertain of the eminent services you have done to the cause of
                    liberty, religion, and virtue, by your writings as well as public instructions.”
                    The first volume in quarto of his <hi rend="italic">Discourses on all the
                    principal Branches of Natural Religion and Social Virtue,</hi> was published in
                    the year 1749, and the second appeared in 1752. They were published by
                    subscription; and to evince the high estimation in which his talents and virtues
                    were held, two thousand names were contained in the list, many of them those of
                    persons distinguished by their rank and literary abilities.</p>
                <p>In the month of April 1750 he was seized with a violent distemper, from the
                    effects of which he never thoroughly recovered; yet whilst at all able to
                    officiate, he continued to preach till the beginning of 1752, when he had
                    another attack, which seems to have been of a paralytic nature. After suffering
                    for some time, he expired on the 5th of November, in the fifty-fifth year of his
                    age. His private and public life were alike irreproachable. Foster, it appears,
                    would have died in indigent circumstances, had it not been for the numerous
                    subscriptions to his discourses on natural religion.</p>
                <p>Besides the works above noticed, Dr Foster published three funeral sermons, one
                    of which was intended for Mr Emyln; together with a number of essays which
                    appeared in the Old Whig.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Foster,</hi><hi rend="italic">Samuel,</hi> an English
                    mathematician and professor of astronomy at Gresham College, was one of that
                    learned association which met for cultivating the new philosophy, and which
                    Charles II. established as the Royal Society. Mr Foster, however, died in 1652,
                    before this incorporation took place; but he wrote a number of mathematical and
                    astronomical treatises, particularly, 1. The Description and Use of a small
                    portable Quadrant, for the more easy finding of the hour of azimuth, 1624, in
                    4to; 2. The Art of Dialling, 1638, in 4to; 3. <hi rend="italic">Posthuma</hi><hi

                    use thereof, 1661, in 4to; 6. Miscellanies, or Mathematical Lucubrations. Of the
                    treatises in this collection some are written in Latin and others in
                    English.</p>
                <p>There were two other persons of this name who published mathematical works;
                    William Foster, a disciple of Mr Oughtred, who taught in London; and Mark
                    Foster, author of a treatise on trigonometry, who lived later than the
                    former.</p>
