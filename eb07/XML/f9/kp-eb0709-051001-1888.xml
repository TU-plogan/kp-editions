                <p><label type="entry">FERGUSON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Adam</hi></label>, LL.D., a
                    distinguished philosopher and historian, was born at Logierait, in the Highlands
                    of Perthshire, on the 20th of June 1723. His father, the Reverend Adam Ferguson,
                    a native of the neighbouring parish or Moulin, had been minister of Crathie and
                    Braemar, in Aberdeenshire, from 1700 to 1714; but, on the eve of the rebellion
                    under the Earl of Mar, had been translated to Logierait, where he passed the
                    remainder of his long life, discharging the duties of his laborious charge with
                    such exemplary piety, fidelity, and firmness, that, though at the period of his
                    induction the parishioners were almost universally hostile to presbyterian
                    principles, he speedily secured the respect and admiration of all ranks; and,
                    till the close of his incumbency in 1754, retained a degree of influence which
                    proved that his knowledge of mankind was not inferior to his zeal for their
                    religious improvement. This excellent man left a numerous family, of whom Adam
                    was his youngest son, by Mary Gordon, daughter of Mr Gordon of Hallhead, in
                    Aberdeenshire.</p>
                <p>It is believed that Adam received the first part of his education at the village
                    school of his native parish, under the superintendence of Mr John Connacher, of
                    whose literary attainments little can now be ascertained. Whatever may have been
                    the merits of this teacher, they do not seem to have been estimated so highly as
                    those of the schoolmasters of Dunkeld and Perth; to one or other of which places
                    it was at this time customary for the parishioners of Logierait to send such of
                    their sons as they wished to prepare for a course of academical study. Two, at
                    least, of Mr Ferguson’s younger sons attended the grammar-school of Perth,
                    between the years 1732 and 1738, whilst Mr James Martin was rector, and Mr
                    Andrew Cornfute one of the assistants. Under the tuition of these able and
                    diligent instructors, Adam is said to have made uncommon progress in classical
                    literature; and in addition to the benefit which he derived from his teachers,
                    he possessed the advantage of living under the protection of a respectable
                    citizen, Mr William Ferguson, his relative, a merchant in the town, and at one
                    time chief magistrate or provost.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of autumn 1738, when he had entered into his sixteenth year, he
                    was removed from school to the University of St Andrews, where his father had
                    commenced his studies fifty years before, under a very meritorious regent, Mr
                    John Row, son of the minister of Ceres; who, being grandson of the well-known
                    David Ferguson, minister of Dunfermline, was induced, by the claims of kindred
                    as well as of duty, to pay particular attention to the improvement of a youth
                    whom he soon discovered to be highly deserving of his favour. It so happened
                    that one of the colleagues of Mr Row was still a master of St Leonard’s College,
                    and that all the other masters were of nearly the same standing with the elder
                    Mr Ferguson, who was thus confirmed in his preference of the college in which he
                    had prosecuted his own philosophical studies. At this very juncture the
                    principal of St Leonard’s College died, and the other professors, at whose
                    almost unanimous recommendation Mr Tullideph was appointed to the vacant chair,
                    anticipated the most prosperous results from his efforts to promote the good of
                    an establishment which they considered as having fallen into disrepute, in
                    consequence of the feeble and undignified administration of his
                    predecessors.</p>
                <p>The Greek class in St Leonard’s College was at this time taught with great
                    reputation by Mr Francis Pringle, who had obtained his office in 1699; but,
                    though no other teacher of that language in Scotland could pretend to rival him,
                    the average number of students who were received annually under his charge, from
                    1738 to 1747, did not exceed eleven; whilst the average of entries to the
                    corresponding class in St Salvator’s College scarcely amounted to six. Adam
                    Ferguson was enrolled in Mr Pringle’s class as a ternar, the same rank of
                    students which, in the days of Buchanan, was characterized by the term <hi
                    rend="italic">pauper</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that is to say, one who pays
                    the lowest rate of fees. It has been alleged that Ferguson, after a comparative
                    trial, was admitted one of the foundation bursars, having stood first in the
                    list of successful competitors. If it were so, the victory was not very
                    splendid, as, of the twelve who entered the class along with him, not more than
                    eight (being of the denomination of ternars) could have been permitted to take a
                    share of the contest.</p>
                <p>Besides Pringle, the other masters in St Leonard’s College were, John Craigie,
                    admitted professor of philosophy in 1691; Ninian Young, professor of humanity,
                    and Henry Rymer, professor of philosophy, both admitted in 1709; and David
                    Young, professor of philosophy, admitted in 1716. Before the end of the session
                    1739, Charles Gregory, professor of mathematics, resigned in favour of his son
                    David, who, though a very ordinary man, was the most popular teacher of geometry
                    ever known in that university, which had many years before numbered amongst its
                    professors the inventor of the reflecting telescope.</p>
                <p>The method of teaching in St Leonard’s College at this period did not materially
                    differ from that which had been pursued in the former century. The professors in
                    general followed the beaten track in which they had been guided by their
                    predecessors; and the tasks which they exacted from the students were little
                    more than exercises of memory. A young man of slender abilities might easily
                    distinguish himself as much as his most ingenious associates, who, on the other
                    hand, might be apt to underrate acquirements which were more accessible to
                    plodding industry than to original talents. We have good reason to believe that
                    Ferguson acquired little more at this seminary than a high admiration of the
                    Grecian and Roman literature, to the beauties of which he was more nearly
                    introduced than he had hitherto been; and that his advances in the knowledge of
                    philosophy were all made at a subsequent period. Even under the vigilant and
                    severe inspection of Principal Tullideph, the discipline of the college was by
                    no means effective; and, in Mr Pringle’s class particularly, some of the young
                    gentlemen conducted themselves so improperly as to have narrowly escaped the
                    disgrace of being refused their degrees, after they had undergone the usual
                    trials. Mr Ferguson obtained the degree of master of arts on the 4th of May
                    1742, when he had nearly completed his nineteenth year. The regent under whom he
                    finished his course of physical study was Mr David Young, who used as a text
                    book Keill’s <hi rend="italic">Introductio</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">veram Physicam.</hi></p>
                <p>The minister of Logierait had attempted to induce some of his other sons to
                    follow his own profession; but as they had all testified a disinclination to
                    this line of life, he determined to breed his youngest son to the church, and
                    accordingly he was sent to the divinity hall at St Andrews, in November 1742,
                    when the theological department o study was superintended by Principal Murison
                    and Professors Shaw and Campbell, the last of whom, a man oftalents an learning,
                    was well known by his writings; but, like seve of his predecessors in the same
                    chair, he scarcely ever ec tured at all. Mr Ferguson studied also a year or two
                    a Edinburgh under Professors Gowdie and Cuming; but ı» attention appears to have
                    been chiefly given to pursuι s not immediately connected with his clerical
                    views·</p>
                <p>In the year 1745, when he had attended divinity on y <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193751901" xml:id="kp-eb0709-1901-0511"/>one half of the usual period,
                    an appointment was offered to him, which he could not hold without ordination.
                    It was, in feet, represented to the General Assembly that Lord John Murray,
                    colonel of the Highland regiment (the 42d), was desirous of having a chaplain of
                    the communion of the Church of Scotland possessed of the Erse language; and that
                    Mr Adam Ferguson, though he had not studied divinity for the full period of six
                    years, was pitched upon for that office, provided the Assembly would allow the
                    presbytery of Dunkeld to take him on trials. The Assembly, in respect of the
                    young man’s capacity and good character, authorized the presbytery to ordain him
                    on passing bis first trials, and accordingly he was ordained at Dunkeld, on the
                    2d of July 1745. A few days afterwards he joined the regiment, in which he
                    continued to serve till 1757; about die beginning of which year he was elected
                    keeper of the Advocates’ Library, on the resignation of the celebrated David
                    Hume. About a year after, Mr Ferguson was succeeded in this office by Mr William
                    Wallace, junior, advocate.</p>
                <p>In the course of the year 1757, Mr Ferguson rendered himself conspicuous by the
                    interest which he took in the success of the tragedy of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Douglas,</hi> written by his friend Mr Home. He published a defence of the <hi
                    rend="italic">morality of stage plays,</hi> which, though its merit is not of
                    the highest order, was admitted by the opposite party to be “the only piece on
                    that side that was written with any tolerable degree of discretion.” After Mr
                    Home resigned his living in June 1757, Mr Ferguson and he retired to country
                    lodgings at Braid, in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, where they spent several
                    months in a course of laborious study, enlivened by the intercourse of
                    friendship. As Mr Ferguson’s campaigning habits had reconciled him to a
                    migratory life, it is not easy to trace him through all his changes of
                    residence. During his father’s lifetime he had great satisfaction in making
                    occasional excursions to the Highlands, and thinking aloud in his solitary
                    walks, amidst the lakes and forests of Rannoch, or on the summit of his native
                    mountains, where one of the most magnificent prospects in nature was displayed
                    before his eyes. It was here that the lofty enthusiasm of his spirit was nursed
                    and matured; and it was not so much in the intercourse with polished society as
                    in the wilds of Athole that he acquired that dignity and ease of manner for
                    which he was distinguished above most of the literary men of his country. To use
                    his own expressive words: “If I had not been in the Highlands of Scotland, I
                    might be of their mind who think the inhabitants of Paris and Versailles the
                    only polite people in the world. It is truly wonderful to see persons of every
                    sex and age, who never travelled beyond the nearest mountain, possess themselves
                    perfectly, perform acts of kindness with an aspect of dignity, and a perfect
                    discernment of what is proper to oblige. This is seldom to be seen in our cities
                    or in our capital; but a person among the mountains, who thinks himself nobly
                    born, considers courtesy as the test of his rank. He never saw a superior, and
                    does not know what it is to be embarrassed. He has an ingenuous deference for
                    those who have seen more of the world than himself; but never saw the neglect of
                    others assumed as a mark of superiority.”</p>
                <p>In the year 1759 he was elected professor of natural philosophy in the University
                    of Edinburgh, in the room of Dr John Stewart. He had not made physical science
                    the principal object of his inquiries; and indeed he had not studied it much
                    more attentively than most young men do m the common routine of academical
                    instruction. But with only fonr months to prepare for the labours of the winter,
                    ŋ qualified himself so well as to give universal satisfaction.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> conducted this branch of education five years, and
                    by <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> apting his lectures to the capacities of the
                    young, contrived to render the study more interesting than it had been commonly
                    considered. At this time he was a member of the well-known <hi rend="italic"
                    >Select Society</hi> of Edinburgh, instituted in 1754, for the purpose of
                    promoting philosophical discussion, and training the members to the practice of
                    public speaking. The ardour of this society did not begin to languish till the
                    year 1762, when another association, equally celebrated, was formed by the
                    literary circle of Edinburgh, the design of which was to rouse the country to
                    demand from the legislature the establishment of a militia in Scotland. Mr
                    Ferguson may almost be considered as the founder of this society; and it was at
                    his suggestion that it received a name (<hi rend="italic">The Poker)</hi> which
                    was sufficiently significant in the ears of the initiated, but utterly
                    unintelligible by strangers. His satirical pamphlet entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >The History of Sister Peg,</hi> was intended to forward the object of this
                    patriotic society; and it is perhaps the only production connected with that
                    cause, which, at this distance of time, is capable of exciting any interest.</p>
                <p>In 1763 Mr Ferguson was applied to by the Earl of Warwick, to take charge of his
                    two younger sons, the Honourable Charles and Robert Greville, whose eldest
                    brother, Lord Greville, had received part of his education under the eye of
                    Principal Robertson. These young gentlemen resided some years in his house, and
                    both they and their tutor Mr Macpherson repaid his attention to their
                    improvement by the warmest affection and gratitude. Lord Warwick, who had been
                    advised by General Clerk to place his sons under Mr Ferguson’s care, was not
                    insensible of the “great benefit they had reaped from his tuition, and
                    advantageous as well as manly and friendly conversation.” Mr, afterwards Sir
                    John, Macpherson, at the same time acknowledged, that “to him he owed all his
                    knowledge, as well as all his success in life.”</p>
                <p>On the appointment of Mr Balfour to the professorship of the law of nature and
                    nations in 1764, Mr Ferguson was elected by the magistrates of Edinburgh to
                    succeed him in the chair of moral philosophy. This had long been a favourite
                    object of his ambition; and about ten years before, when the able and
                    accomplished Mr Cleghorn was on his death-bed, he urged his young friend to
                    apply for the office, which, in his apprehension, no man was more capable of
                    adorning. Mr Cleghorn, after expressing his regret at having no such influence
                    with the patrons as to secure such an arrangement, added, as Mr Ferguson
                    sometimes related with much emotion, “I can only say of you, as Hamlet did of
                    Fortinbras, <hi rend="italic">Hehas my dying voice?</hi></p>
                <p>Mr Ferguson entered on his new duties with a degree of spirit and activity, from
                    which the most splendid results were to be anticipated. In one particular his
                    mode of lecturing was singular, and not easily imitated. After having delineated
                    the general plan of his course, and committed it to writing, he resolved not to
                    write a system of lectures, but to endeavour to make himself master of every
                    part of his subject, and to trust to the moment of delivery for the expression
                    of his sentiments. This method of discoursing was in his hands very happily
                    executed; but its success depended, in a great measure, on the state of his
                    health and spirits, as well as upon the interest excited by the different
                    subjects of discussion. Perhaps no lecturer, with the exception of his immediate
                    successor, was ever more admired. His class was crowded by great numbers of
                    gentlemen of high rank and official station, as well as by younger students. In
                    the mean time, eagerly as he applied to the discharge of his professional
                    duties, his attention was extended to other branches of inquiry; and within
                    little more than a year after he commenced his labours as a lecturer on morals,
                    he sent to the press his <hi rend="italic">Essay on the History of Civil
                    Society,</hi> a work which was received with an expression of public approbation
                    which even exceeded the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751914"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-1914-0512"/>Mr Russell. He was not able to prevail on the
                    patrons to accept of a substitute to complete the labours of that session; but
                    after obtaining leave of absence for the next session, he joined his young
                    charge at Geneva in May 1774, and at first entertained hopes that his labours
                    might prove beneficial. The connection, however, was not so agreeable as he
                    expected, and it terminated about twelve months afterwards. In the mean time, he
                    had very nearly been deprived of his office in the university. The towncouncil
                    had, at his desire, appointed Mr John Bruce, then assistant and afterwards
                    successor to Mr Stevenson, to teach the moral philosophy during the session
                    1774-1775 but before the conclusion of the session they thought fit to rescind
                    this act, and to declare the office vacant. His friends in the university,
                    particularly Drs Robertson, Blair, and Black, were exceedingly indignant at this
                    proceeding; more especially as Sir John Pringle had been permitted to be several
                    years absent; and at that very time the professors of mathematics and of the
                    theory of medicine had both been allowed to discharge their duty by substitutes
                    for two years without challenge or complaint. As the council, however, seemed to
                    have determined to fill up the place by a new election, it became necessary for
                    his friends to apply to the Court of Session to put a stop to their proceedings.
                    “I have been much obliged,” says he, in a letter to a friend, “to the general
                    voice that was raised in my favour, as well as to the ardent zeal of particular
                    friends. Hay Campbell (afterwards Lord President) has given me proofs of
                    friendship which I can never forget. Pulteney has behaved to me in every thing
                    as he would have done at the beginning of the Poker Club. I have always been an
                    advocate for mankind, and am a more determined one than ever; the fools and
                    knaves are no more than necessary to give others something to do.”After his
                    return, he continued, as formerly, to divide his time between his literary and
                    agricultural pursuits, and engaged occasionally in the political controversies
                    which agitated the country during the progress of the American war. Besides his
                    pamphlet in answer to Dr Price’s observations on liberty, he communicated his
                    views from time to time to Sir William Pulteney, and other members of
                    parliament; and when it was resolved by government to send out commissioners to
                    quiet the disorders in the colonies, he was appointed secretary to the
                    commission. It appears from a letter of General Putnam, dated July 1778, that
                    the nomination of Dr Ferguson was very agreeable to the more intelligent part of
                    the Americans, who, not without reason, were dissatisfied to find that the
                    commissioners were fettered by restrictions, which rendered their appointment
                    nugatory. “I am very sorry,” he writes, “that the parliament of Great Britain is
                    still so blind to their own and our interest, as to send Dr Ferguson and the
                    rest of the worthy gentlemen over to America with limited power, and that to
                    last only till July 1779, and then to be revoked by them if they think fit; by
                    which means I am deprived of seeing your friend Dr Ferguson, which gives me
                    great pain, as 1 always have heard of his being a gentleman of the first
                    character for learning, good sense, and humanity.” It is well known that the
                    commissioners returned without accomplishing the object of their mission; but
                    they had an opportunity of acquiring more useful information of the state and
                    temper of the country' than government had received in al the previous course of
                    the contest. Whilst Dr Ferguson was absent duringthe session 1778-1779, hisplace
                    wassuρ-plied by Mr Dugald Stewart, who, about five years afterwards, was
                    destined to succeed him in the chair ofmora philosophy.In the year 1780 he was
                    seized with an attack of apoplexy» which, though not violent, was nevertheless
                    sufficient high expectations of his friends. “Ferguson’s book,” says Mr Hume,
                    writing to Dr Robertson from London, “goes on here with great success.” Gray the
                    poet says, “There are uncommon strains of eloquence in it; and I was surprised
                    to find not one single idiom of his country (I think) in the whole work.” Mr
                    Hume, in a letter to the author, (dated 10th March 1767), congratulates him on
                    the success of the book, adding that he had “met with nobody that had read it
                    who did not praise it. Lord Mansfield is very loud to that purpose in his Sunday
                    societies. I heard Lord Chesterfield and Lord Lyttleton express the same
                    sentiment; and, what is above all, Caddel, I am told, is already projecting a
                    second edition of the same quarto size.” Mr Hume then informs him, that Lord
                    Shelburne and Lord Bute were amongst his most zealous partisans; the last
                    declaring the book one of the best he had ever read. Charles Townshend appears
                    to have been of the same opinion, as he read it five times.</p>
                <p>General Clerk had pressed the author to dedicate his work to Lord Shelburne, who
                    had signified his intention of offering Mr Ferguson the government of West
                    Florida; upon which occasion his lordship laughed very heartily, when the
                    general expressed his conviction that Mr Ferguson was more usefully employed as
                    a teacher of science. The book, however, appeared without any dedication. In the
                    course of the following year, Lord Shelburne intimated a hope of getting Mr
                    Ferguson established with a proper appointment at Oxford; and some other persons
                    of influence meditated a design of employing him in one of the departments of
                    state. This purpose was frustrated in all probability by a temper which did not
                    permit him to accommodate himself to the views of those whose maxims of conduct
                    he did not entirely approve. Another circumstance may be considered as having
                    also operated to obstruct the fulfilment of the schemes which were devised for
                    his advancement. At this time he married Miss Burnet, a young lady nearly
                    connected with his mother’s family, and still more nearly related to his
                    intimate friend Dr Black. Soon afterwards he began to cultivate a farm in the
                    parish of Currie, and, at a considerable sacrifice of private interest,
                    gratified his taste for improvement, by transforming a barren heath into a scene
                    which became distinguished for beauty and fertility.</p>
                <p>It was impossible, however, for any combination of circumstances to abate his
                    literary activity; and he not only continued to conduct the business of his
                    class with unremitted diligence, but seized every interval of leisure which he
                    could command, to collect materials for a history of the Roman commonwealth.
                    Whilst he was proceeding in his researches, he was solicited by Philip, Earl of
                    Stanhope, the editor of Dr Robert Simson’s posthumous works, and the other
                    guardians of Charles, Earl of Chesterfield, to superintend the education of that
                    young nobleman, then in his nineteenth year. The negotiation was conducted
                    through the mediation of Dr Adam Smith, who, judging the offer to be
                    advantageous to his friend, exerted himself with great earnestness to induce him
                    to accept it. Lord Stanhope was extremely anxious to obtain the able services of
                    Dr Ferguson without delay, as he conceived it to be of the utmost consequence to
                    his young kinsman to be placed under the care of “a person so well qualified to
                    complete the remaining part of his education, and to repair the neglects,
                    omissions, and errors, which had unfortunately been committed in the former part
                    of it.” The proposal had originally been made early in the year 1773, and was
                    renewed in December, soon after the commencement of the session of the college,
                    when Dr Ferguson was engaged not only in teaching his own class, but also in
                    lecturing on natural philosophy, the professorship of which had recently become
                    vacant by the death of his relation <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751927"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-1927-0513"/>alarm his friends for his safety. This formidable
                    affection did not in the slightest degree impair the force of his understanding;
                    and so abstemious did he afterwards become, as not only to secure himself
                    against the recurrence of the disease, but to enjoy almost uninterrupted health
                    for more than thirty years. As he could not now venture to lecture as formerly
                    without the use of written notes, he therefore found it necessary to write out a
                    course of instruction to be read during the remainder of his incumbency. In his
                    endeavours to recover the substance of his lectures, he availed himself of the
                    notes taken by intelligent young men, who had studied under him different
                    sessions, and who might thus be expected to have preserved the various modes in
                    which he had stated his doctrines, and the different arguments and illustrations
                    by which he had happened to supply in one session what might have been omitted
                    in another. But, in the prospect of soon relinquishing his office, it was
                    scarcely conceivable that the compilation which he thus executed could possess
                    all the excellencies which he was capable of imparting to it; more especially as
                    he was now busy in carrying his great historical work through the press. This
                    was the <hi rend="italic">History of the Progress and Termination of the Homan
                    Republic,</hi> in three volumes quarto, published in 1783, a book which not only
                    delights by the clearness of its narrative and the boldness of its descriptions,
                    but instructs and animates by profound and masterly delineations of character,
                    as well as by the philosophical precision with which it traces the connection of
                    events. It is written in that tone of high-minded enthusiasm, which, if it can
                    only snatch from oblivion whatever is noble and generous in the record of human
                    actions, regards the graces of style as objects merely of secondary account, and
                    is chiefly studious of impressing the lessons of wisdom which may be gathered
                    from the survey of distant ages.</p>
                <p>The fatigues and anxieties of public teaching now became oppressive to his
                    spirits, and not altogether favourable to his health; and he therefore deemed it
                    expedient to resign his office in 1784, when he had completed his sixty-first
                    year. Mr Dugald Stewart, then professor of mathematics, succeeded to his office;
                    and in order to entitle Dr Ferguson to retain his salary, he was conjoined in
                    the professorship of mathematics with Mr Playfair. He now proceeded to revise
                    the notes of his lectures on ethics and politics, with a view to publication;
                    and in 1792 the work appeared, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Principles
                    of Moral and Political Science.</hi> Though composed under disadvantageous
                    circumstances, and though he has omitted many of the questions which were
                    treated in his elementary course, it contains an admirable view of the systems
                    both of ancient and modern philosophers, particularly respecting the foundations
                    of moral approbation, and the sources of private happiness and public security.
                    The authors to whose suggestions he was most indebted were Xenophon, Plato, and
                    Aristotle, amongst the Greeks, Cicero and Seneca amongst the Latins, Epictetus
                    and Antoninus amongst the later scholars of the Grecian school; and, amongst the
                    moderns, Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, Montesquieu, and Adam Smith. It has been
                    considered as a blameable omission in this work, that too slight notice is taken
                    of the importance of religious principle; and the author, ' <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 1</hi>. <hi rend="superscript"> act, seems</hi> 1° have been aware that he had
                    exposed himself to this objection. No man, however, was ever more anxious to
                    establish the foundations of natural theology, and to strengthen the arguments
                    for a future state; subjects on which the work abounds in passages of uncommon
                    beauty.</p>
                <p>After the publication of this work, Dr Ferguson, now in <hi rend="superscript">
                    ιs</hi> seventieth year, resolved to pay a visit to the ancient Metropolis of
                    the world. He passed a short time at some o the principal cities of Europe,
                    Berlin, Vienna, Florence, <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> ple⅛, and Venice, and
                    resided part of the winter 1793 at Rome, in all of which places his reception
                    was extremely 1 flattering. He was elected a member of the Academy of Berlin, as
                    well as of other learned societies. Upon his return to Britain in 1794, he took
                    up his residence at Nidpath Castle in Tweeddale, from which he soon removed to
                    Hallyards in Manor Water. In this agreeable retreat he spent the next fourteen
                    years of his life, a longer period than he had ever before resided in any one
                    place. At last, however, when his sight and his hearing had in a great measure
                    failed, he deemed it advisable to settle in a town, where he might occasionally
                    enjoy the conversation of intelligent friends; and his early prepossessions
                    induced him to settle at St Andrews. Here his strength gradually declined, but
                    the vigour of his mind continued unimpaired as long as he lived. No man took a
                    more lively interest in the great events which were then passing in the world,
                    or contemplated more anxiously the consequences of the arduous struggle in which
                    his country was engaged. He lived long enough to witness the triumphant issue of
                    the contest; and after a short illness, he died on the 22d of February 1816, in
                    the ninety-third year of his age, leaving three sons and three daughters.</p>
                <p>In the various situations which it was his lot to occupy, he had uniformly
                    conducted himself with a dignity and decision which bespoke the elevation and
                    force of his mind. As a military chaplain, he happily united the strict decorum
                    of the clerical character with the unembarrassed address of a man of the world;
                    so that he at the same time secured the respect of the officers and the devoted
                    attachment of the private soldiers. It was while accompanying the army on
                    different expeditions, one of the first of which was an ill-conducted descent on
                    the coast of Bretagne in 1745, that he applied his mind to study the art of war;
                    and it cannot be denied that he excels particularly in the description of
                    military evolutions. In private life his conversation was easy and elegant, and,
                    among his intimate friends, en-livenea by a fascinating gaiety and refinement of
                    humour. He was not very patient of contradiction, however, and rather apt to
                    testify his contempt of assumed superiority.</p>

                    letters and other valuable documents had been indiscriminately destroyed by his
                    direction some years before his death. (p. p. p.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ferguson,</hi><hi rend="italic">James,</hi> an eminent
                    experimental philosopher, mechanist, and astronomer, was born in Banffshire,
                    Scotland, in 1714. His parents were very poor. At an early age, however, his
                    extraordinary genius began to unfold itself. He first learned to read by
                    overhearing his father teach his elder brother; and he had made this acquisition
                    before any one suspected he had done so. He soon discovered a peculiar taste for
                    mechanics, which first indicated itself on seeing his father use a lever; and
                    having pursued this study a considerable time, even when very young, he at
                    length made a watch in wood work, from having once seen one. As he had no
                    instructor, nor any help from books, every thing he learned had all the merit of
                    an original discovery; and such in fact he very naturally believed it to be. As
                    soon as his age permitted he went out to service; but he met with hardships in
                    this humble capacity, which rendered his constitution feeble through life.
                    Whilst he was servant to a farmer, whose goodness he acknowledges in the modest
                    account of himself which he prefixed to his <hi rend="italic">Mechanical
                    Exercises,</hi> he frequently contemplated the stars; and he began the study of
                    astronomy by laying down, from his own observations alone, a celestial globe.
                    His kind master observing these marks of his ingenuity, procured him the
                    countenance and assistance of some neighbouring gentlemen, by whose help and
                    instructions he went on acquiring further knowledge, and was at length sent to
                    Edinburgh. There, having obtained some notion of drawing, he began to take
                    portraits in miniature, by which means he supported himself and family for
                    several years, both in Scotland and England, whilst engaged in pursuing more
                    serious studies. In London he first published some curious astronomical tables
                    and calculations, and afterwards gave public lectures on experimental
                    philosophy, which he repeated in most of the principal towns in England with
                    general approbation. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society without paying
                    for admission; and he had a pension of L.50 per annum given him, unsolicited, by
                    King George III. on his accession, who had heard his lectures, and who
                    frequently sent for and conversed with him on curious topics. Ηe also received
                    several presents from his majesty, and from other patrons of merit. The degree
                    of consideration which Mr Ferguson attained by the strength of his natural
                    genius alone is in fact known to every one. He was universally considered as at
                    the head of astronomy and mechanics in this nation of philosophers; and he might
                    justly be styled self-taught, or rather heaven-taught; for in his whole life he
                    had not received above half a year’s instruction at school. He was a man of the
                    clearest judgment and the most unwearied application to study; benevolent,
                    gentle, and innocent in his manners as a child; humble, courteous, and
                    communicative; and, instead of pedantry, philosophy seemed to have produced in
                    him only diffidence and urbanity. He died in 1776, at the age of sixty-two.</p>
                <p>The following is a list of Mr Ferguson’s published works: 1. Astronomical Tables,
                    and Precepts for calculating the true times of New and Full Moon, 1763; 2.
                    Tables and Tracts relative to several Arts and Sciences; 3. An easy Introduction

                    A Third Letter to the Reverend Mr John Kennedy, 1775. Mr Ferguson also
                    communicated several papers to the Royal Society <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>,
                    which were printed in their Transactions. In 1805, a valuable edition of his
                    Lectures was published at Edinburgh by Dr, now Sir David, Brewster, in two
                    volumes 8vo, with notes and an appendix, intended to adapt the whole to the
                    actual state of science.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ferguson,</hi><hi rend="italic">Robert,</hi> a Scottish
                    poet, who acquired a considerable share of celebrity at a very early period of
                    life, was born at Edinburgh on the 5th of September 1750 or 1751. His father,
                    whose name was William, paid court to the muscs as well as the son; but he
                    wisely relinquished the study of poetry for the more certain emoluments of trade
                    and commerce, and was employed in different mercantile houses both in Edinburgh
                    and in Aberdeen. He was an accountant in the Linen Hall when he died, but never
                    acquired any thing like an independent fortune.</p>
                <p>The subject of this notice was of a weak and delicate constitution during
                    infancy, so much so, indeed, that small hopes were entertained of his ever
                    reaching the years of manhood. Yet such were the care and attention of his
                    parents, that he was able to attend an English school by the time he was six
                    years of age, when his progress was considered as very extraordinary; and it
                    proved no less rapid at the High School of Edinburgh, which he attended for four
                    years, acquiring a competent knowledge of the Latin tongue with very little
                    labour or exertion. He then went to the grammar school of Dundee, and in two
                    years afterwards to the university of St Andrews, which his father preferred to
                    Edinburgh, because a gentleman of the name of Ferguson had left two bursaries
                    for the education of as many boys of the same name.</p>
                <p>Ferguson’s health was never at anytime impaired by severe study; yet he kept
                    alive at the university the opinion which had been entertained of him whilst at
                    school, an he was decidedly the first mathematician of his own stant ing. He was
                    patronized by Dr Wilkie, professor of natural philosophy, but better known as
                    the author of the <hi rend="italic">Ρ goniad,</hi> who conceived an attachment
                    for him, as ∏&gt; perhaps for his poetical as his mathematical talents, kindness
                    was repaid by Ferguson, on the death o Wilkie, by a beautiful eclogue to his
                    memory; writ n <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751953" xml:id="kp-eb0709-1953-0515"
                    />the Scottish dialect. A little before he left the university, ' Ferguson had
                    conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the death of Sir William Wallace, for
                    which he had collected materials; but as he subsequently met with a work on the
                    same subject, he abandoned the design, after he had completed two acts. His own
                    reason for so doing is thus expressed: “Whatever I publish shall be original,
                    and this tragedy might be considered as a copy.”</p>
                <p>He returned to Edinburgh when he had finished his studies, without having fixed
                    on any particular employment; for although he was destined for the church by his
                    father, on the death of the latter he paid but little attention to the
                    expostulations of his mother. He also declined to enter on the study of physic,
                    assigning as a reason, that when he read the description of diseases, he
                    believed that he felt the symptoms of them all in himself. He was, however,
                    induced to attempt the study of the law, in which, as might have been expected,
                    he made no proficiency. He seems, however, to have turned a wishful eye to some
                    sinecure place, in order to obtain which he paid a visit to an uncle who resided
                    at Aberdeen, a man of literature and opulence, hoping that, through his
                    influence, he might be settled in a manner suited to his merit. But in this
                    expectation he was completely disappointed; for although his uncle at first
                    showed him every mark of attachment, his fondness decreased by degrees, and in
                    six months he desired his nephew in an abrupt manner to leave his house, without
                    attempting to procure for him any kind of living.</p>
                <p>His necessities at this period were so great that he copied papers in the
                    commissary clerk’s office for so much per sheet, an employment which he soon
                    left in disgust. His exuberant wit, equalled only by his good nature,
                    thoughtlessness, and social propensities, made all who knew him receive him with
                    affection; but his powers of song and talents for mimicry often led him into the
                    company of the dissipated, whose example could not fail to do him essential
                    injury, and who had neither the power nor the inclination to provide for him
                    through life. The irregularities in which he was thus led to indulge often
                    awakened in him the reproaches of conscience; and the conversation of a
                    minister, who understood his manner of life, appears to have made a deep
                    impression on his mind. His remorse indeed soon afterwards assumed the
                    appearance of absolute despair. His sprightliness entirely forsook him; but he
                    gradually recovered from this despondency, and his health was at length fully
                    restored. Soon afterwards he cut his head so severely in consequence of a fall,
                    that he became delirious from the loss of blood; and in this condition he
                    remained for some months, till the want of sleep and perpetual talking put a
                    period to his existence on the 16th of October 1774. He was buried in the
                    Canongate churchyard. Over his grave a monument was erected by Robert Burns, who
                    loved his genius, and naturally sympathized with failings akin to his own. Had
                    Ferguson united prudence with his abilities, he would have no doubt risen to
                    distinguished eminence in the literary world. His poems in the Scottish dialect
                    have been universally admired by his countrymen; and when we reflect that they
                    were composed in the intervals of dissipation, they must be considered as
                    unequivocal evidences of his genius.</p>
