                <p><label type="entry">FAIRY</label>, in ancient traditions and romances, signifies
                    a sort of sprite, or imaginary genius, of this lower sphere, and distinguished
                    by a variety of fantastical actions either good or bad.</p>
                <p>Fairies were commonly imagined to be women of an order superior to human nature,
                    yet subject to wants, passions, accidents, and even death; sprightly and
                    benevolent whilst young and handsome; morose, peevish, and malignant, if ugly,
                    or in the decline of their beauty; and fond of appearing in white, from which
                    circumstance they were often called the WTiite Ladies.</p>
                <p>Concerning these imaginary beings, Jervaise of Tille-berry, marshal of the
                    kingdom of Arles, who lived in the beginning of the thirteenth century, writes
                    thus in a work inscribed to the Emperor Otho IV. :—“It has been asserted by
                    persons of unexceptionable credit, that fairies used to choose themselves
                    gallants from among men, and rewarded their attachment with an affluence of
                    worldly goods; but if they married, or boasted of a fairy’s favours, they as
                    severely smarted for such indiscretion.” Similar tales still were current in
                    Languedoc; and throughout the whole province there was not a village without
                    some ancient seat or cavern which had the honour of being a fairy’s residence,
                    or at least some spring in which a fairy used to lave its tiny form. This idea
                    of fairies has anear affinity with that of the Greeks and Romans concerning the
                    nymphs of the woods, mountains, and springs; and an ancient scholiast on
                    Theocritus says, that “the nymphs arc demons which appear on the mountains in
                    the figure of women.” The Arabs and other orientals have also their <hi
                    rend="italic">Peris,</hi> of whom they entertain notions somewhat similar to
                    those held in the west respecting fairies.</p>
                <p>But fairies have likewise been described as of either sex, and generally as of
                    small stature, though capable of assuming various forms and dimensions. The most
                    charming representation of these children of romantic fancy is to be found in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Midsummer Night’s Dream,</hi> in referring to which we no
                    doubt have been already anticipated by the recollection of the reader.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Fairy</hi><hi rend="italic">of the Mine,</hi> an
                    imaginary being, an inhabitant of mines. The Germans believed in two species:
                    one fierce and malevolent; the other a gentle race, appearing as little old men
                    dressed like the miners, and not much above two feet in height. These sprites
                    wander about the drifts and chambers of the works; seem perpetually employed,
                    yet do nothing; and appear to cut the ore, or fling what is cut into vessels, or
                    turn the windlass; but never do any harm to the miners, unless provoked. Such is
                    the relation of Agricoa, in his book <hi rend="italic">.De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Animantibus Subterrancis.</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Fairy</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Circle,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ring,</hi> a phenomenon pretty
                    frequent in the fields, and supposed by the vulgar to have been traced by the
                    fairies in their dances. There are two kinds of fairy ring: one of about seven
                    yards in diameter, containing a round bare path, about a foot broad, with green
                    grass in the middle of it; and another of different dimensions, encompassed with
                    a circumference of grass. Jessop and Walker, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions,</hi> ascribe these rings to lightning; and this is
                    thought to be confirmed by their being most frequently produced after thunder
                    storms, as well as by the colour and brittleness of the grass-roots when first
                    observed. Lightning, like all other fires, moves round, and burns more in the
                    extremity than in the middle; and the second circle arises from the first, as
                    the grass burnt up grows very plentifully afterwards. But others maintain that
                    these circles are formed by ants, which are frequently found in great numbers
                    therein. Mr Cavallo, in his <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Electricity,</hi> does
                    not think that lightning is at all concerned in the formation of them. “They are
                    not,” says he, “always of a circular figure;, and, as I am informed, they seem
                    to be rather beds of mushrooms than the effects of lightning.”</p>
