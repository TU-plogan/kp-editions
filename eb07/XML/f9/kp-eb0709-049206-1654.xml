                <p><label type="entry">FAST</label>, in general, denotes abstinence from food; but
                    is more particularly used for such abstinence on a religious account.</p>
                <p>Religious fasting has been practised by most nations from the remotest antiquity.
                    Some divines even pretend that it had its origin in the earthly paradise, where
                    our first parents were forbidden to eat of the tree of knowledge. But though
                    this seems carrying the matter too far, it ⅛ certain that the Jewish church has
                    observed fasts ever since its first institution. Nor were the neighbouring
                    nations, the Egyptians, Phoenicians, and Assyrians, without their fasts. The
                    Egyptians, according to Herodotus, sacrificed a cow to Isis, after having
                    prepared themselves by fasting and prayer; a custom which he likewise ascribes
                    to the women of Cyrene. Porphyry affirms, that the Egyptians, before their
                    stated sacrifices, always rested a number of days, sometimes even of weeks; and
                    that during this time the priests and devotees not only abstained from flesh,
                    fish, wine, and oil, but even from bread, and some kinds of pulse. These
                    austerities were communicated by them to the Greeks, who observed their fasts
                    much in the same manner. The Athenians had the Eleusinian and Thesmophorian
                    fasts, the observance of which was very rigorous, especially amongst the women,
                    who spent one whole day sitting on the ground in a mournful dress, without
                    taking any nourishment. In the island of Crete, the priests of Jupiter were
                    obliged to abstain during their whole lives from fish, flesh, and baked meats.
                    Apuleius informs us, that whoever had a mind to be initiated in the mysteries of
                    Cybele was obliged to prepare himself by fasting ten days; and, indeed, all the
                    pagan deities, whether male or female, required this duty of those who desired
                    to be initiated into their mysteries, of the priests and priestesses who gave
                    out the oracles, and of those who came to consult them.</p>
                <p>Amongst the heathens fasting was also practised before some of their military
                    enterprises. Aristotle informs us, that the Lacedaemonians having resolved to
                    succour a city of the allies, ordained a fast throughout the whole extent of
                    their dominions, without excepting even the domestic animals; and this they did
                    for two ends, first, to spare provisions in favour of the besieged, and,
                    secondly, to draw down the blessing of heaven upon their enterprise. The
                    inhabitants of Tarentum, when besieged by the Romans, demanded succours from
                    their neighbours of Rhegium, who immediately commanded a fast throughout their
                    whole territories. Their enterprise having proved successful by throwing a
                    supply of provisions into the town, the Romans were obliged to raise the siege;
                    and the Tarentines, in memory of this deliverance, instituted a fast to be
                    annually observed ever afterwards.</p>
                <p>Fasting has always been reckoned a particular duty amongst philosophers and
                    religious people, some of whom have carried their abstinence to an incredible
                    length. At Rome it was practised both by kings and emperors. Numa Pompilius,
                    Julius Caesar, Augustus, Vespasian, and others, we are told, observed stated
                    fasts; and Julian surnamed the Apostate was so exact in this observance as to
                    outdo the priests themselves, and even the most rigid philosophers. The
                    Pythagoreans kept a continual lent; but with this difference, that they believed
                    the use of fish to be equally unlawful with that of flesh. Besides their
                    constant temperance, they also frequently fasted rigidly for a considerable
                    time. In this respect, however, they were all outdone by their master
                    Pythagoras, who continue his fasts for no less than fifty days together. Even
                    Apollonius Tyaneus, one of his most celebrated disciples, cou never equal him in
                    the length of his fasts, though these greatly exceeded those of the ordinary
                    Pythagoreans. The Gymnosophists, or Brahmins of the East, are a s° very
                    remarkable for their severe fastings; and thθ 0 J nese, according to Father
                    Lecomte, have likewise t <hi rend="superscript"> eir</hi> stated fasts, with

                    fasts; and the exactness of their dervises in this respect is extraordinary.</p>
                <p>Fasting was often used by the heathens for superstitious purposes; sometimes to
                    procure the interpretation of dreams; at others, to serve as an antidote against
                    the pernicious consequences of nocturnal visions. The Jews, though expressly
                    forbidden to fast upon Sabbath days, think themselves at liberty to dispense
                    with this duty when they happen the night preceding to have had frightful and
                    unlucky dreams, which they consider as presaging great misfortunes. On these
                    occasions they observe a formal fast during the whole day; and at night the
                    patient, having invited three of his friends, addresses himself to them seven
                    times in a very solemn manner, saying, “May the dream I have had prove a lucky
                    one and his friends answer as many times, “Amen, may it be lucky, and God make
                    it so after which, in order to encourage him, they conclude the ceremony with
                    the words of Ecclesiastes, “Go eat thy bread with joy,” and then set themselves
                    down to table. They have also added several fasts not commanded in the law of
                    Moses, particularly three, in memory of sore distresses which their nation has
                    at different times suffered. The abstinence of the ancient Jews commonly lasted
                    twenty-seven or twenty-eight hours at a time, beginning before sunset, and not
                    ending till some hours after sunset the next day. On these days they were
                    obliged to wear white robes in token of grief and repentance, to cover
                    themselves with sackloth, or their worst clothes, to lie on ashes, to sprinkle
                    these on their heads, and to perform other like ceremonies. Some spent the whole
                    night and day following in the temple or synagogue, in prayers and other
                    devotions, barefooted, with a scourge in their hands, of which they sometimes
                    made a good use, in order to excite their zeal. Lastly, to complete their
                    abstinence, they were accustomed at night to eat nothing but a little bread
                    dipped in water, with some salt for seasoning; except indeed they chose to add
                    to their repast some bitter herbs and pulse.</p>
                <p>The ancients, both Jews and Pagans, had also their fasts or purifying the body,
                    particularly the priests and such as were any way employed at the altars; for
                    when nocturnal disorders happened to them, it was unlawful to approach the
                    altars all the next day, which they were bound to employ in purifying
                    themselves. On this account, at great festivals, where their ministry could not
                    be dispensed with, it was usual for them, on the eve of these solemn occasions,
                    not only to fast, but also, for the greater certainty, to abstain from sleep.
                    For this purpose the high priest had. under officers to awake him, if overtaken
                    with sleep, against which other preventives were also employed.</p>
