                    of Saltoun, a celebrated Scottish patriot and political writer, was descended
                    from an ancient family, who traced their origin to some one of the followers of
                    William the Conqueror. He was the son of Sir Robert Fletcher of Saltoun and
                    Innerpeffcr, and was born in the year 1650. The tuition of young Fletcher was
                    committed by his father, on his deathbed, to Mr, afterwards Bishop, Burnet, then
                    his parish minister, to whose care and attention he was indebted for a pious,
                    learned, and polite education. Being endowed with uncommon genius, and possessed
                    of virtues and abilities peculiarly suited to the times in which he lived, Mr
                    Fletcher quickly shone forth the ornament of his country and the champion of its
                    freedom. Having in the course of his classical studies and historical reading
                    been impressed with an enthusiastic admiration both of ancient and modern
                    republics, he had early contracted an ardent love of liberty, and an aversion to
                    arbitrary rule. Hence his spirit the more readily took alarm at certain measures
                    in the reign of Charles II. Being knight of the shire for Lothian to the
                    parliament where the Duke of York appeared as commissioner, he openly opposed
                    the designs of that prince and the bill of accession; and he had a share with
                    Lord Viscount Stair in framing the test act, by which the Duke of York
                    complained that he had lost Scotland. On these accounts he became peculiarly
                    obnoxious to his royal highness, and was at last obliged to fly to Holland, to
                    avoid the fatal consequences of prosecutions which on various pretences were
                    commenced against him. Being cited before the privy council and justiciary
                    courts, and not appearing, he was declared a traitor, and his estate
                    confiscated.</p>
                <p>In Holland, Fletcher and Baillie of Jerviswood were the only persons whom the
                    Earl of Argyll consulted concerning the designs which were then in agitation. In
                    1681 they came over to England in order to concert matters with their party in
                    that country; and they were the only persons who were entrusted so far as to be
                    admitted to the secrets of Lord Russell’s council of six. Mr Fletcher managed
                    his part of the negotiation with so much address, that the administration could
                    find no pretext for sezing him; nor could they fix upon him those articles on
                    account of which Baillie was condemned; and to the honour of the latter be it
                    remembered, that although offered a pardon on condition of accusing his friend,
                    he persisted in rejecting the proposal with indignation.</p>
                <p>Mr Fletcher having joined the Duke of Monmouth upon his landing, received a
                    principal command under him; but the duke was deprived of his services owing to
                    a circumstance which is related by Sir John Dalrymple. Being sent upon an
                    expedition, and not esteeming “times of danger to be times of ceremony, he had
                    seized for his own uding the horse of a country gentleman (the mayor of Lynne),
                    which stood ready equipped for its master. The master, hearing this, ran in a
                    passion to Fletcher, gave him opprobrious <pb break="no" facs="nls:193753318"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-3318-0620"/>language, shook his cane, and attempted to strike.
                    Fletcher, though rigid .in the duties of morality, having been accustomed to
                    foreign service both by sea and land, in which he had acquired high ideas of the
                    honour of a soldier and a gentleman, and of the affront of a cane, pulled out
                    his pistol and shot him dead on the spot. The action was unpopular in countries
                    where such refinements were not understood. A clamour was raised against it
                    among the people of the country; in a body they waited upon the duke with their
                    complaints; and he was forced to desire the only soldier, and almost the only
                    man of parts, in his army, to abandon him. With Fletcher all Monmouth s chance
                    of success in war left him.” In a manuscript memoir belonging to the family
                    there is the following notice concerning Mr Fletcher’s connection with Monmouth,
                    in which his separation from that prince is very differently accounted for: “To
                    Lord Marischal Mr Fletcher explained the motives which first induced him to
                    join, and afterwards abandon, the Duke of Monmouth. The former he ascribed to
                    the duke’s manifesto in Scotland relating to religion, and in England to
                    liberty. For the latter he accounted by the disgust produced in his own mind,
                    and that of his associates, when the duke declared himself king, and broke faith
                    with all who had embarked with him on his principles. He complained heavily of
                    the account commonly given of the death of the mayor of Lynne; and mentioned to
                    Lord Marischal, in proof of the contrary, that he did not leave the duke till he
                    came to Taunton, where he was proclaimed king, several weeks after the death of
                    the mayor of Lynne.”</p>
                <p>Seeing all the efforts of his friends and of himself in favour of liberty
                    frustrated at Taunton, he endeavoured to secure his own personal freedom by
                    taking his passage in the first ship bound to a foreign country. It was his
                    misfortune, however, to land in Spain, where he was immediately arrested, cast
                    into prison, and guarded by three different bands of soldiers, till a vessel
                    could be prepared to carry him a victim in chains to the court of London. But on
                    the morning upon which the ship was to sail, whilst he looked pensively through
                    the bars of his window, he was hailed by a venerable personage, who made signs
                    to speak with him. The prison doors he found open; and whilst his friendly
                    conductor motioned to him to follow,' he passed through three different guards
                    of soldiers all fast asleep. Without being permitted to offer his thanks to his
                    deliverer, he found himself obliged to prosecute with all speed his journey, in
                    which he was directed by a person concerning whom he could never collect any
                    information, and thus he proceeded in safety through Spain.</p>
                <p>During his exile he maintained a frequent and extensive correspondence with the
                    friends of liberty at home, and.he partly employed himself in making a curious
                    collection of books. But his genius also prompted him to engage in more active
                    employments. He repaired to Hungary, and served several campaigns with much
                    reputation as a volunteer untler the Duke of Lorrain. At length, understanding
                    that the great design then projected in Holland, and upon the issue of which he
                    considered the liberties of Britain to depend, had obtained a considerable
                    degree of maturity, he hastened thither, and his counsels and address were of
                    eminent service to the cause. He came over with King William; and in zeal,
                    activity, penetration, and political skill, proved inferior to none of the
                    leaders m the Revolution.</p>
                <p>Such, however, was his magnanimity, that whilst others laboured to render this
                    grand eventa source of emolument to themsel ves and aggrandisement to their
                    families, Mr Fletcher asked for nothing. His estate had been forfeited, and his
                    house abandoned to military execution; his fortune was greatly shattered, and
                    his family reduced to circumstances of distress; yet nothing was given him in
                    recompense of all his sufferings. On the contrary, he had the honour, along with
                    the Duke of Hamilton, to be distinguished by marks ' of both royal and
                    ministerial dislike. Still, whatever private resentment he might entertain, his
                    ruling principle was the good of his country, and to this grand object of his
                    heart he was willing to sacrifice all personal considerations. Accordingly, in
                    1692, when the abdicated king meditated an invasion, Mr Fletcher addressed a
                    letter, preserved in Sir John Dalrymple’s collection, to the Duke of Hamilton,
                    in which every argument is employed with skill and energy to engage his grace to
                    forget his injuries, and in the actual crisis to employ the extensive influence
                    which he then possessed in the cause of freedom and of his country. This letter
                    produced its full effect, and the duke returned to his duty, from which he had
                    in some degree begun to estrange himself.</p>
                <p>To follow our author throughout all the mazes of his political life subsequently
                    to the Revolution, is beyond our purpose, and would exceed our limits. It will
                    be sufficient to mention one or two additional circumstances illustrative of his
                    character. Being elected a member for the parliament 1693, he showed an uniform
                    zeal for the interest of his country. The thought of England domineering over
                    Scotland was what his generous soul could not endure. The indignities and
                    oppression which Scotland lay under galled him to the heart; and in his learned
                    and elaborate discourses he exposed them with undaunted courage and affecting
                    eloquence. In that great event, the Union, he performed essential service. He
                    got the act of security passed, which declared that the two crowns should not be
                    placed on the same head until Scotland had been secured in her civil and
                    religious liberties. After the queen’s demise, therefore, Lord Godolphin was
                    forced into the Union, in order to avoid a civil war. Although Mr Fletcher
                    disapproved of some of the articles, and indeed of the whole frame of the Union;
                    yet, as the act of security was his own work, he had all the merit of that
                    important transaction.</p>
                <p>We must not omit mentioning, that in the ardour of his political career Mr
                    Fletcher forgot not the interests of the place which gave him birth. He esteemed
                    the education of youth as one of the noblest objects of government. On this
                    subject he wrote a treatise, still extant, which is most characteristic of
                    himself; and he established at Saltoun a foundation for the same purpose, of
                    great utility while it lasted. This remarkable person died at London in 1716, at
                    the age of sixty-six, and his remains were conveyed to Scotland, where they were
                    deposited in the family vault at Saltoun.</p>
                <p>Mr Fletcher was master of the English, Latin, Greel French, and Italian
                    languages, and well versed in history, the civil law, and other kinds of
                    learning. In his travels he had not only acquired considerable knowledge in the
                    ar of war, but had also become conversant with the respective interests of the
                    several princes and states of Europe, hţ private life he was affable to his
                    friends, and free from al manner of vice. He had a penetrating, clear, and
                    lively apprehension; but is said to have been too much wedde to opinions, and
                    impatient of contradiction. He was by tar the finest speaker in the parliament
                    of Scotland, and tie Earl of Stair alone rivalled him. The latter was famed or a
                    splendid, the former for a close and nervous eloquence·</p>
                <p>In 1698 he published a <hi rend="italic">Discourse on Goveru</hi><hi rend="italic

                    other pieces, together with a few of his speeches, were after his death collecte
                    and published in an octavo volume, entitled <hi rend="italic">Political Works of

                    >Phineas,</hi> an English poet who enjoyed con siderable popularity in his own
                    day, but regarding whom few particulars have descended to posterity. He was <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193753331" xml:id="kp-eb0709-3331-0621"/> son of Dr Giles
                    Fletcher, who, on account of his abilities, was entrusted by Queen Elizabeth
                    with several important missions, especially one to Russia, in which he
                    negotiated a treaty highly advantageous to England. He published an account of
                    <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic">Russe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Commonwealth,</hi> which was at first suppressed, but afterwards reprinted in
                    1643. Phineas, his eldest son, was educated at Eton, and in 1600 was elected to
                    King’s College, Cambridge, where he took the degrees of bachelor and master of
                    arts. Having entered into holy orders, he received the living of Hilgay in
                    Norfolk in the year 1621. It appears from Blomefield’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Norfolk,</hi> that he continued to officiate in his clerical capacity for
                    twenty-nine years, and it is probable that he died here. These are all the facts
                    known regarding Phincas Fletcher, a poet who was styled “the Spenser of his
                    age,” but whose fame is scarcely equal to his merit. He -wrote <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sicelides,</hi> a piscatory drama, which was printed anonymously in 1631. In
                    the year following he printed at Cambridge a work entitled <hi rend="italic">De
                    literatis antiqueε</hi><hi rend="italic">Britannice,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >prcesertim</hi><hi rend="italic">qui doctrina claruerunt, quique collegia
                    Cantabrigice fundarunt,</hi> 12mo. In the year following he printed, in one vol.
                    4to, his <hi rend="italic">Purple Island, Piscatory Eclogues,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Miscellanies.</hi> These poems have all been reprinted, but not
                    frequently. They are, however, to be found in Anderson’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >British Poets.</hi></p>
                <p>The character of Phineas Fletcher appears to have been mild and amiable, and his
                    contemporaries passed liberal encomiums upon him for his learning and piety. As
                    a poet he possesses more merit than posterity seems disposed to attribute to
                    him. The <hi rend="italic">Purple Island</hi> is his longest and his best
                    production. It is an allegorical poem, of which man is the subject. The first
                    five cantos may be entitled the anatomy of the human body in rhyme. In the
                    remainder of the poem the poet quits the dissecting-room for the academic grove
                    of intellectual philosophy, and the learning of the schools. Although the design
                    is bad, and the reader sickens over anatomical details and abstract subtilties,
                    it is impossible not to admire the ingenuity with which the writer has invested
                    them with the flowers of fancy and of poetry. There is a profusion of images;
                    and although, as might have been expected, many of his allegorical personations
                    are too elaborately drawn and too highly coloured, some of them are
                    distinguished by a boldness of outline, a majesty of manner, a brilliancy of
                    tint, a propriety of attribute, and an air of life, which are rarely met with in
                    modern productions, and rival the best things of the kind even in Spencer, the
                    author from whom he caught his inspiration. Too often, indeed, his conceptions
                    are incongruous, and his conceits fantastical; but many beautiful thoughts are
                    interspersed throughout, and the whole is enriched with a vein of genuine
                    poetry.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fletcher,</hi><hi rend="italic">Giles,</hi> brother of the
                    preceding, and of whom also few memorials remain, was born in the year 1558. He
                    was bred at Cambridge, and died at his living at Al-denston in Suffolk, in the
                    year 1623. He is principally known as the author of <hi rend="italic">Christ?s
                    Victory and Triumph over οηd after Death,</hi> a poem characterized by a tone of
                    enthusiasm peculiarly solemn. Like his brother, he was an imitator of Spencer,
                    and, with the diction of the latter slightly modernized, he retains much of his
                    melody and luxuriant expression. Giles Fletcher, there can be no doubt, is
                    inferior both to Spencer and Milton, but he frequently reminds us of both; and
                    it seems evident that the latter was indebted to him for hints, particularly

                    appear likewise to have been suggested by passages in <hi rend="italic">Christs

                    quaint, that poem is a fine effusion of genius, and one of the best productions

                <p>rLETEWOOD, <hi rend="smallcaps">William,</hi> an eminent English lawyer and
                    recorder of London in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. He was very zealous in
                    suppressing mass-houses, and in imprisoning Roman Catholic priests; but having
                    once rushed in upon mass at the Portuguese ambassador’s house, he was committed
                    to the Fleet for breach of privilege. Mr Wood says he was a learned man and a
                    good antiquary, but of a marvellous merry and pleasant conceit. He was a good
                    popular speaker, and wrote well upon subjects of government. His principal works
                    are, <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi><hi rend="italic">Annalium
