                <p><label type="entry">FORTESCUE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir John</hi></label>, an
                    eminent English latvyer in the reign of Henry VI. was descended from an ancient
                    family in Devonshire, though both the time and place of his birth are unknown.
                    He is supposed to have been educated at Oxford, and the great learning displayed
                    in his writings does no discredit to such a supposition; but it is nevertheless
                    altogether uncertain at which university he studied, or whether he ever studied
                    at any. When he turned his views to the legal profession he entered himself of
                    Lincoln’s Inn, where he soon distinguished himself by his knowledge of the civil
                    as well as of the common law. In the fourth year of Henry VI. he was appointed
                    one of the governors of Lincoln’s Inn, and three years afterwards the same
                    office was again conferred upon him. In 1441 he was made a king’s seijeant at
                    law, and the following year chief justice of the King’s Bench. As a judge
                    Fortescue is highly commended for his wisdom, gravity, and uprightness; and he
                    seems to have enjoyed great favour with the king, who is said to have given him
                    some substantial proofs of esteem and regard. He held his office during the
                    remainder of the reign of Henry VI. to whom he steadily adhered; and having
                    faithfully served that unfortunate monarch in all his troubles, he was attainted
                    of treason in the first parliament of Edward VI. which assembled at Westminster
                    in November 1461, having been included in the same act by which Henry VI.,
                    Margaret of Anjou his queen, Edward their son, and many persons of the first
                    distinction, were likewise attainted. When Henry subsequently fled into
                    Scotland, he is supposed to have appointed Fortescue, who appears to have
                    accompanied him in his flight, chancellor of England; and although the name of
                    the latter is not found recorded in the patent rolls, because, as Selden
                    remarks, “being with Henry VI. driven into Scotland by the fortune of the wars
                    with the house of York, he was made chancellor of England while he was there,”
                    yet several writers have mentioned him by this style and title; and in his book
                    <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Laudibus Legum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Anglia,</hi> he calls himself <hi rend="italic">Cancellarius</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Anglia,</hi> which seems to settle the question. Early in 1463,
                    Fortescue embarked at Bamburg with Queen Margaret, Prince Edward her son, and
                    many other persons of distinction who followed the fortunes of the house of
                    Lancaster, and landed at Helvoetsluys, from which the party were conducted by
                    Bruges and Lisle to Lorraine. Being thus expatriated, he remained many years on
                    the Continent, moving about from place to place, as the necessities of the royal
                    exiles required, and endeavouring to promote their interest by every means in
                    his power. But his most important labours during this period were of a different
                    and more lasting kind. Having observed that Prince Edward applied himself wholly
                    to military exercises, and seemed to think of nothing but qualifying himself to
                    command in battle, Fortescue, who had observed in him indications of a sound
                    understanding, judged it high time to endeavour to give him other impressions,
                    and particularly to infuse into his mind just notions of the constitution of his
                    country, as well as a due regard for its laws. With this view he drew up his
                    celebrated work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Laudibus
                    Legum</hi><hi rend="italic">Anglia,</hi> which, though it failed of its primary
                    intention, owing to the barbarous murder of the young prince, for whose benefit
                    it was composed, will yet remain a lasting monument of the author’s learning and
                    patriotism. When the prospects of the exiles began to brighten a little, the
                    queen and the prince returned to England, accompanied by Fortescue and others,
                    who no doubt hoped that a more auspicious day was about to dawn upon the
                    descendant of time-honoured Lancaster. But destiny still counter-worked the
                    designs of the heroic Margaret. Her attempt to assert the rights of her son
                    totally failed; and the chancellor, forced to reconcile himself as he best could
                    to the victorious Edward IV. wrote an apology for his conduct, which, though
                    Selden had seen it, has never been published. Little further is known respecting
                    the life of this remarkable man, excepting that, amidst all the changes of
                    masters and varieties of fortune, he stedfastly maintained those constitutional
                    principles which he had with equal ability<pb break="no" facs="nls:193755190"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-5190-0764"/> and conciseness explained in the celebrated
                    treatise ' above referred to. He appears to have died at a very advanced age,
                    though the time of his death, like the date of his birth, has not been
                    ascertained.</p>
                <p>Fortescue’s masterly vindication of the laws of England, though received with
                    great favour by the learned of the profession to whom it was communicated, did
                    not appear in print until the reign of Henry VIΠ. when it was published by
                    Whitechurch in 16mo, but without a date. In 1516 it was translated by Mulcaster,
                    and printed by Tot-tel; and again in 1567,1573, and 1575, and also by White in
                    1598, 1599, and 1609. It was likewise printed, with Hengham’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Summa Magna</hi><hi rend="italic">et Parva,</hi> in 1616 and 1660, 12mo; and
                    again with Selden’s notes in 1672, in 12mo. In 1737 it appeared in folio; and,
                    in 1775, an English translation, with the original Latin, and Selden’s notes,
                    besides a variety of remarks relative to the history, antiquities, and laws of
                    England, was published in 8vo. Waterhouse’s <hi rend="italic">Fortescue</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Illustratus,</hi> which appeared in 1663, though prolix and
                    defective in style, may be consulted with advantage, and will serve to
                    facilitate the labours of more judicious and able inquirers. 2. Another valuable
                    and learned work by the same author, but written in English, was published in
                    the reign of Queen Anne, under the title of The Difference between an absolute
                    and limited Monarchy, as it more particularly regards the English Constitution,
                    and accompanied with some remarks by John Fortescue Aland of the Inner Temple,
                    London, 1714, in 8vo; and a second edition with amendments appeared in 1719,
                    8vo. In the Cotton Library there is a manuscript of this work, in the title of
                    which it is said to have been addressed to Henry VI.; but many passages show
                    plainly that it was written in favour of Edward IV. 3. Or the author’s other
                    writings, which were pretty numerous, but never printed, we know nothing more
                    than can be collected from the titles, and the commendations bestowed on them by
                    persons who had perused the manuscripts. Those still extant are, 1. <hi

                    author was a man of great knowledge and observation, will, we trust, yet be
                    printed. When lord-chancellor, Fortescue is said to have drawn up the statute of
                    the 28th Henry VI. on the resumption of certain grants of the crown, which,
                    though much relied on by writers on that subject, is not extant in any edition
                    of the statutes. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
