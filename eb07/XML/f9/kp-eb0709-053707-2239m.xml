                <p><label type="entry">FIELDING, <hi rend="smallcaps">Henry</hi></label>, the prince
                    of English novellists, was born at Sharpham-Park, Somersetshire, on the 22d of
                    April 1707. His father, General Edmund Fielding, who had served under John duke
                    of Marlborough, was the third son of Dr John Fielding, canon of Salisbury, who
                    was the fifth son of George earl of Desmond, and brother of William the third
                    earl of Denbigh; and his mother, the general’s first wife, was a daughter of
                    Judge Gould. He was also connected with the noble family of Kingston, which, in
                    the celebrated Lady Mary Wortley Montague, boasted a brighter ornament than rank
                    or title could bestow. Henry Fielding was the only son of the first marriage;
                    but he had four sisters of the full blood, one of whom, Sarah, was distinguished
                    as an authoress by the history of <hi rend="italic">David Simple,</hi> and other
                    literary attempts. General Fielding, after the death of his first wife, married
                    a second time, and had a numerous family of sons, one of whom is still
                    remembered as a judge of police by the title of Sir John Fielding. The expense
                    attending so large a family, together with a natural thoughtlessness of
                    disposition on the part of his father, of whose habits economy formed no part,
                    were probably the occasion of Henry being early involved in those embarrassments
                    with which, excepting at brief intervals, he continued to struggle through
                    life.</p>
                <p>After acquiring the rudiments of education under the Rev. Mr Oliver, who is
                    supposed to have furnished him with the outline of Parson Trulliber’s character,
                    young Fielding was removed to Eton, where he made great progress in the study of
                    the Greek and Roman authors, and imbibed that deep love of classical literature
                    which may be traced throughout all his works. As his father destined him for the
                    bar, he was, at the age of eighteen, sent from Eton to Leyden, where he remained
                    about two years, and is said to have given the most earnest attention to the
                    study of the civil law. Had he been permitted to continue the pursuit which he
                    had thus engaged, the courts would probably have gained an accomplished lawyer,
                    and the world would have lost a man of genius; but the circumstances of the
                    father determined the chance in favour of posterity, though against the
                    interests and perhaps the welfare of the son. Remittances, in short, failed, and
                    the young civilian was compelled to return, at the age of twenty, to plunge into
                    the dissipation of London, without a monitor to warn or a friend to support him.
                    His father had indeed promised him an allowance of two hundred pounds a year;
                    but this, as Fielding himself used to observe, any one might pay who would.
                    Possessed of a strong constitution, a lively imagination, and a keen relish of
                    pleasure, with the capacity of enjoying the present and trusting to chance for
                    the future, Fielding thus found himself his own master in a place where the
                    temptations to every expensive indulgence are numerous, and the means of
                    gratification easily attainable; and, with reckless improvidence, he squandered
                    in pursuit of pleasure the scanty means which, with strict economy, might have
                    enabled him to begin the world, at the same time entailing upon himself those
                    distresses and misfortunes in which he was ever afterwards involved.</p>
                <p>But as disagreeable impressions never remained long upon his mind, and as it was
                    his disposition to look at the brighter side of things, or rather to enliven the
                    gloomiest prospect with the colours which his own fancy cast upon it, he
                    flattered himself that he would find resources in his own wit and genius, and
                    that the difficulties in which he was involved would be overcome by the
                    exertions which he conceived himself capable of making to surmount them. To a
                    man of pleasure, in fact, some resources were indispensably necessary, and
                    Fielding found them in his pen, having no alternative, as he himself used to
                    say, but to become a hackney writer or a hackney coachman. He at first employed
                    himself in writing for the stage, then in high reputation, from having recently
                    engaged the talents of Wycherley, Congreve, Vanburgh, and Farquhar; his comedies
                    and farces were brought out in hasty succession; between the years 1727 and
                    1736, play succeeded play, to the number of eighteen, which were struck off as
                    his necessities impelled, and sank oftener than swam in the theatrical sea upon
                    which he cast them. Of these, the only pieces now known or read are the
                    mock-tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Tom Thumb,</hi> the translated play of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Miser,</hi> and the farces of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Mock-Doctor</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Intriguing Chambermaid</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and yet, as Sir Walter Scott justly observes, they are all
                    the production of an author unrivalled for his conception and illustration of
                    character in the kindred department of imaginary narrative. λVhilst Fielding was
                    thus living as a man of wit and pleasure about town, seeking and finding
                    amusement in scenes of gaiety and dissipation, and endeavouring to discharge the
                    expense incidental to such a life by the precarious resources afforded by the
                    stage, which, as may easily be supposed, were inadequate for the purpose, he
                    attempted to improve his circumstances by becoming himself the manager of a
                    company; and having, in 1735, assembled a number of discarded comedians, he
                    proposed that they should perform his own plays, at the little theatre of the
                    Haymarket, under the whimsical title of the Great Mogul’s company of comedians.
                    But the project, as might have been expected, did not succeed; and the company,
                    which seemed to have dropped from the clouds, were under the necessity of
                    disbanding. The whole scheme, in fact, has more the air of a mad frolic than of
                    a serious undertaking. During his theatrical career, which, we have just seen,
                    was by no means brilliant, Fielding, like most authors of the time, found it
                    impossible to interest the public sufficiently <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193752252" xml:id="kp-eb0709-2252-0538"/>in the various attempts which
                    lie made to gain their favour, without condescending to flatter their political
                    animosities. In two of his dramatic pieces, <hi rend="italic">Pasquin</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Historical Register,</hi> he displays great acrimony
                    against Sir Robert Walpole, whom, in the year 1730, he had in vain attempted to
                    propitiate by some courtly verses. The keenness of the satire made it felt, and
                    its freedom is supposed to have operated considerably in producing a measure
                    which was then thought necessary to restrain the licentiousness of the stage,
                    and to check that proneness to personal and political satire which had been
                    fostered by the success of the <hi rend="italic">Peg-gar d Opera.</hi> But this
                    measure, which consisted in vesting a discretionary power in the Lord
                    Chamberlain to refuse a license to any piece which he should disapprove, was
                    very unpopular at the time, and, like all petty legislation, has done mischief
                    which was not intended by it, and failed to accomplish the object for which it
                    was designed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“The
                    regulation,” says Sir Walter Scott, “was the cause of much clamour at the time;
                    but licentious satire has since found so many convenient modes of access to the
                    public, that its exclusion from the stage is no longer a matter of interest or
                    regret; nor is it now deemed a violent aggression on liberty that contending
                    political parties cannot be brought into collision within the walls, of the
                    theatres, intended, as they are, for places of amusement, not for scenes of
                    party struggle.” <hi rend="italic">{Memoir of Fielding·}</hi> This is ∏° doubt
                    true; but has not the theatre suffered in consequence of the regulation by which
                    all political allusions are excluded from t <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi>
                    stage, whilst neither the amount of licentious satire, nor its facilities of
                    gaining access to the public, have been, in the slightest degree,
                    diminished?</p></note></p>
                <p>About the year 1736, Fielding having, it seems, formed the resolution of settling
                    in life, espoused a young lady of Salisbury, named Craddock, possessed of
                    considerable beauty, and of a fortune of L.1500; and, about the same time, he
                    succeeded, in right of his mother, to a small estate of L.200 per annum,
                    situated at Stower in Derbyshire. With this fortune, which, managed with
                    prudence and economy, might have afforded a decent competence, he retired from
                    London to his seat in the country, resolved to bid adieu to the follies and
                    irregularities of a town life, and to cultivate habits of domestic enjoyment.
                    But having unfortunately carried with him the same improvident disposition to
                    enjoy the present at the expense of the future, which marked his whole life, he
                    soon forgot all his resolutions of amendment; established an equipage with showy
                    liveries; threw open his gates to unbounded hospitality; and suffered his whole
                    substance to be devoured by horses, hounds, retinuc, and entertainments. Thus,
                    in less than three years, Fielding found himself landless, homeless, penniless,
                    without any other resource than his abilities, and having brought nothing from
                    the country except that experience of rural life and its pleasures which
                    afterwards enabled him to delineate with such inimitable truth and force the
                    character of Squire Western. Not discouraged, however, he entered himself as a
                    student of law at the Temple, and, after the customary term of manducation, was
                    called to the bar. Fielding had now a profession, and, as he had vigorously
                    applied his powerful mind to the study of the law, it might have been expected
                    that his success would have been in proportion to his assiduity. But various
                    causes conspired to obstruct his rise in the legal profession. In the first
                    place, those persons who have it in their power to advance or retard the
                    practice of a young lawyer, seem to have mistrusted the capacity of a man of wit
                    and pleasure for steady application to business; and Fielding’s own conduct was
                    in all probability such as to justify this want of confidence in his regularity.
                    In the next place, disease, the consequence of a free life, came to the aid of
                    dissipation of mind, and interrupted the course of his practice by severe
                    attacks of the gout, which gradually undermined his naturally robust
                    constitution. But amidst all this difficulty and suffering, he pursued his
                    rescarches with great though irregular vigour; and, as a proof of the eminence
                    to which, i∏ happier circumstances, he might have risen at the bar, he left two
                    manuscript volumes in folio on the Crown Law; a branch to which he had most
                    assiduously applied himself. The exigencies of a family, to which he was
                    tenderly attached, forced him however to have recourse again to the stage, where
                    he attempted to produce a continuation of his own piece, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Virgin Unmashed</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but as one of the characters was
                    supposed to have been written in ridicule of a man of quality, the Lord
                    Chamberlain refused his license. Political pamphlets, fugitive tracts, newspaper
                    essays, and sometimes farccs, were the next means he had recourse to for
                    subsistence; and as his ready pen supplied such productions upon every
                    emergency, he contrived out of the scanty profits to support himself and family.
                    But amidst the anxiety and labour of this precarious mode of life, he had the
                    misfortune to lose his wife; a domestic calamity which so deeply affected him
                    that his reason was for a time endangered by the excess of his grief. All
                    violent emotions, however, are happily transient; Fielding recovered from the
                    blow which had stunned him, though his regret was lasting; and the necessity of
                    procuring subsistence compelled him to resume his literary labours. At length,
                    in the year 1741 or 1742, circumstances led him to engage in a species of
                    composition which he rescued from the degraded state in which he found it, and
                    rendered a classical department in English literature.</p>
                <p>The novel of <hi rend="italic">Pamela,</hi> published in 1740, having raised the
                    fame of Richardson to the highest pitch, Fielding, whether tired of hearing it
                    overpraised,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>his
                    production, many passages of which would now be thought highly indelicate, and
                    condemned as suggestive of licentious ideas, was in those days recommended even
                    from the pulpit. Modern refinement, though it may not have succeeded in
                    banishing immodesty from the heart, has at least had the effect of purifying
                    literary compositions of that grossness which, more or less, deforms almost all
                    those of the last age.</p></note> or whether, as a writer for subsistence,
                    disposed to catch at whatever interested the public for the time, or whether,
                    finally, seduced by that malicious spirit of wit which delights to turn into
                    ridicule the idol of the day, resolved to caricature the style, the principles,
                    and the personages of this favourite performance. As Gay’s desire to satirize
                    Philips produced <hi rend="italic">The Shepherds Weck,</hi> so Fielding’s
                    purpose to ridicule <hi rend="italic">Pamela</hi> suggested <hi rend="italic"
                    >The History of Joseph Andrews</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but, in both cases,
                    more especially the latter, a work was executed of infinitely greater merit than
                    could have been expected to arise out of such a design; and the reader received
                    a higher gratification than the author himself appears to have proposed or
                    contemplated. In Fielding’s novel there is indeed a fine vein of irony, as will
                    appear from comparing it with the pages of <hi rend="italic">Pamela</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but the production against which the ridicule was directed
                    is now almost forgotten; whilst <hi rend="italic">Joseph Andrews</hi> continues
                    to be read for its admirable pictures of manners, and, above all, for the
                    inimitable character of Parson Adams, which alone is sufficient to decide the
                    superiority of Fielding over all novel writers. “His learning, his simplicity,
                    his evangelical purity of mind,” says Sir Walter Scott, “are so admirably
                    mingled with pedantry, absence of mind, and the habit of athletic and gymnastic
                    exercises, then acquired at the universities by students of all descriptions,
                    that he may be safely termed one of the richest productions of the muse of
                    fiction. Like Don Quixote, Parson Adams is beaten a little too much and too
                    often; but the cudgel lights upon his shoulders, as on those of the honoured
                    knight of La Mancha, without <pb break="no" facs="nls:193752265"

                    bastinadoed without being degraded.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    admirers, male and female, took care to echo back his resentment, and to heap
                    Fielding with reproach. The animosity of the idol and his worshippers, in fact,
                    survived the gifted man who had rendered them all ridiculous; and in
                    Richardson’s correspondence we find the most ungenerous, not to say malignant,
                    reproaches cast on his memory.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Kichardson, being well acquainted with Fielding’s sisters,
                    took occasion to complain to them, not of their brother’s usage of himself (this
                    would have been natural and honest), but of his unfortunate predilection for
                    what was mean and low in character and description. The following passage is
                    remarkable, first for the unexampled presumption of the writer, who thus
                    constitutes himself the judge paramount of Fielding’s qualities; and, secondly,
                    for the malignant indelicacy which could obtrude such observations on the sister
                    of a rival: “Poor Fielding! I could not help telling his sister that I was
                    equally surprised at and concerned for his continued lowness. Had y∪ur brother,
                    said I, been born in a stable, or been a runner at a spunging-house, one should
                    have thought him a genius, and wished he had had the advantage of a liberal
                    education, and of being admitted into good company !” The man who could be
                    guilty of such deliberate brutality as is here complacently chronicled, would
                    not have scrupled to employ more criminal means to gratify his animosity, if he
                    had not been restrained either by innate cowardice or a salutary fear of the
                    laws. After this, however, we cannot <hi rend="superscript"> be</hi> surprised
                    to find Richardson alleging that Fielding was destitute of invention and
                    talents; that the run of his best works was nearly over; and that, as an author,
                    he would soon be forgotten! ...</p></note> But Fielding does not appear to have
                    retorted any of the ill-will in which Richardson and his coterie indulged. If he
                    gave the first offence without provocation, he was also the first to retreat
                    from the contest, and to leave his exasperated antagonists in undisputed
                    possession of the field. Nor was Fielding slow in conceding to Richardson that
                    praise to which his genius entitled him from the liberality of his
                    contemporaries. In the fifth number of the <hi rend="italic">Jacobite
                    Journal,</hi> he warmly commends <hi rend="italic">Clarissa Harlowe,</hi> by far
                    the best and most powerful of Richardson’s novels, and which, with those scenes
                    in <hi rend="italic">Sir Charles Grandison</hi> relating to the history of
                    Clementina, contains the passages of deep pathos on which his fame as a writer
                    must finally rest. “Perhaps this is one of the cases,” says Sir Walter Scott,
                    “in which one would rather have sympathized with the thoughtless offender, than
                    with the illiberal and ungenerous mind which so long retained its
                    resentment.”</p>
                <p>After the publication of <hi rend="italic">Joseph Andrews,</hi> Fielding had
                    again recourse to the stage, and brought out <hi rend="italic">The
                    Wedding-Day,</hi> which, though upon the whole unsuccessful, produced him some
                    little profit. This was the last of his theatrical efforts which appeared during
                    his life-time. The comedy of <hi rend="italic">The Fathers,</hi> in manuscript,
                    was lost by Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, and, when recovered, was performed
                    after the author’s death, for the benefit of his family.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The following anecdote, which is given by
                    former biographers, shows the carelessness of Fielding respecting his reputation
                    as a dramatist: “On one of the davs of its rehearsal (that is, the rehearsal of
                    <hi rend="italic">The Wedding-Day),</hi> Garrick, who performed a principal
                    part, and who was then a favourite with the public, told Fielding he was
                    apprehensive that the audience would make free with him in a particular passage,
                    and remarked that, as a repulse might &lt;lisconcert him during the remainder of
                    the night, the passage should be omitted; “No, d—n ’em,” replied he; “if the
                    scene is"not a good one, let them find <hi rend="italic">that</hi> out.”
                    Acccrdingly the play was brought out without alteration, and, as had been
                    foreseen, marks of disapprobation appeared. Garrick, alarmed at the hisses he
                    met with, retired into the green-room, where the author was solacing himself
                    with a bottle of champagne. He had by this tune drank pretty trcely; ≡nd,
                    glancing his eye at the actor, while clouds of tobacco issued from his mouth,
                    cried out, “What’s the matter, Garrick . what are they hissing now ?” “Why, the
                    scene that I begged you to retrench,” replied the actor; “I knew it would not
                    do; and they have ≡frightened me that I shall not be able to collect myself
                    again the whole night.” “Oh, d-n ’em,” rejoined he, with great coolness, they
                    <hi rend="italic">have</hi> found it out, have they ?”</p></note> Besides a
                    variety of fugitive pieces, Fielding published, in 1743, a volume of
                    miscellanies, containing, amongst other things, <hi rend="italic">The Joumey
                    from this World to the next</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a tract of which it is
                    difficult to perceive the scope or aim, although it displays a good deal of
                    Fielding’s characteristic humour. His next production was <hi rend="italic">The
                    History of Jonathan Wild the Great</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a picture of
                    desperate vice, unrelieved by a single indication of human feeling, or even by
                    an accidental deviation into virtue. What object Fielding could have proposed to
                    himself by so revolting a delineation, it is not easy to conjecture. For,
                    besides the disgust produced by the contemplation of wickedness naked and
                    unredeemed, every one must feel, that ascribing a train of fictitious adventures
                    to a real character, has in it something clumsy and inartificial; whilst, on the
                    other hand, it subjects the author to a suspicion of having used as the title of
                    his book the name of an infamous depredator, in the hope of connecting the one
                    with the popular renown of the other. At the same time, there are not many
                    passages in Fielding’s works more strongly marked with his peculiar genius, than
                    the scene between Jonathan Wild and the Ordinary, in Newgate. Besides these more
                    permanent proofs of his application to literature, Fielding employed his ready
                    pen in most of the political and literary controversies of the times. He
                    conducted one paper, called <hi rend="italic">The Jacobite Journal,</hi> the
                    object of which was to eradicate those feelings and sentiments which had already
                    been so effectually crushed on the field of Culloden; and he either entirely
                    composed or had a principal share in <hi rend="italic">The True Patriot</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">The Champion,</hi> periodicals of the same class. Being
                    attached to the principles of the Revolution, and to the settlement of the
                    succession in the family of Brunswick, he steadily advocated what was then
                    called the Whig cause; but whilst far inferior writers were enriched out of the
                    secret-service money with unexampled prodigality, his zeal and ability remained
                    long unnoticed, and never met with any suitable recompense.</p>
                <p>As it was impossible, however, that such a man could be altogether overlooked,
                    Fielding, in 1749, received a small pension, together with an appointment as a
                    justice of peace for Westminster; an office then considered as disreputable, and
                    of which he was at liberty to make the most he could by the worst means he
                    chose. At this period the magistrates of Westminster, being paid by fees for
                    their services to the public, were thence termed trading justices; and in
                    general they appear to have deserved this opprobrious appellation; for the mean
                    and wretched system on which they were remunerated making it their interest to
                    inflame petty disputes, to wring out of thieves and pickpockets a portion of
                    their unhallowed gains, and thus to traffic, as it were, in guilt and misery,
                    seemed equally well calculated to encourage crime, and to degrade those whose
                    ostensible duty it was to repress it. The habits of Fielding, who was never very
                    select in his society, cannot be supposed to have <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193752278" xml:id="kp-eb0709-2278-0540"/>been improved by the position
                    into which he was now thrown; and from a humiliating anecdote told by Horace
                    Walpole,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Rigby gave me
                    a strong picture of nature. He and Peter Bathurst, t’other night, carried a
                    servant of the latter’s, who had attempted to shoot him, before Fielding, who,
                    to all his other vocations, has, by the grace of Mr Lyttleton, added that of
                    Middlesex justice. He sent them word he was at supper; they must come next
                    morning. They did not understand that freedom, and ran up, where they found him
                    banquetting with a blind man, a wh—, and three Irishmen, on some cold mutton,
                    and a bone of ham, both in one dish, and the dirtiest cloth. He never stirred or
                    asked them to sit. Rigby, who had seen him come so often to beg a guinea of Sir
                    C. Williams, and Bathurst, at whose father’s he had lived for victuals,
                    understood that dignity as little, and pulled themselves chairs, on which he
                    civilized.” <hi rend="italic">(Letters from the Hon. Horace Walpole to George
                    Montague, Esq.</hi> p. 58, London, 1818.) It ought to be added, however, that
                    Walpole, though he has here stigmatized the lowness of Fielding’s society and
                    habits, has elsewhere done justice to his talents. In <hi rend="italic">The

                    after allowance is made for the aristocratical exaggeration of the narrator,
                    that his mind had sunk to the level of his situation. Yet, though the
                    circumstances attending his official situation tended to foster the careless and
                    disreputable habits which he was unfortunately but too prone to indulge, it is
                    consoling to observe that Fielding’s principles remained unshaken, and that
                    there is no foundation whatever for the imputation of venality which, from the
                    popular discredit attaching to his office, and his own thoughtless extravagance,
                    the ill-natured world were at one time but too ready to cast upon him. His own
                    account of his conduct respecting the dues of the office on which he depended
                    for subsistence has been confirmed by Mr Murphy, and never doubted or denied. “I
                    will confess,” says he, “that my private affairs at the beginning of winter had
                    but a gloomy aspect; for I had not plundered the public, or the poor, of those
                    sums which men, who are always ready to plunder both as much as they can, have
                    been pleased to suspect me of taking; on the contrary, by composing instead of
                    inflaming the quarrels of porters and beggars (which, I blush when I say, hath
                    not been universally practised), and by refusing to take a shilling from a man
                    who most undoubtedly would not have had another left, I had reduced an income of
                    L.500 a year, of the dirtiest money upon earth, to little more than L.300, a
                    considerable portion of which remained with my clerk.” Nor was this all. Whilst
                    Fielding thus evinced his disinterestedness as a magistrate, he endeavoured, by
                    various suggestions, to check the growth of crime and depravity. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Inquiry into the Increase of Thieves and Robbers</hi> contains
                    several valuable hints which succeeding statesmen have adopted, and some which
                    have not yet received the attention they deserve. He was the first to expose the
                    injurious effects of the frequency of pardons, rendered necessary by the
                    reckless multiplication of capital punishments; and he had the merit of
                    directing public attention to that swelling imposthume of the state, pauperism,
                    with the consequences to be apprehended from the state of the poor laws and the
                    mode in which they were administered. He afterwards published a scheme for the
                    provision of the poor, which showed that he was fully sensible of the evil,
                    without being able to suggest an effectual or practical remedy; but although his
                    project for restricting them to their parishes, and providing for them in
                    workhouses, was not approved of, it has never been disputed that his treatise
                    exhibits both the knowledge of the magistrate and the picturesque expression of
                    the novel writer. He also published a <hi rend="italic">Charge to the Grand Jury
                    of Middlesex,</hi> and some <hi rend="italic">Tracts concerning Law Trials,</hi>
                    which are considered as valuable.</p>
                <p>Before publishing his scheme for the provision of the poor, however, Fielding
                    made himself immortal by the production of <hi rend="italic">Tom Jones, or the
                    History of a Foundling;</hi> a work composed under all the disadvantages
                    incident to an author alternately harassed by his disagreeable magisterial
                    duties, and pressed by the necessity of hurrying out some ephemeral essay or
                    pamphlet to meet the demands of the passing day. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Tom Jones</hi> is inscribed
                    to the Hon. Mr, afterwards Lord Lyttleton, in a dedication where he intimates

                    never have been composed, inasmuch as the author had been indebted to them for
                    the means of subsistence whilst engaged in composing it. Ralph Allen, the friend
                    of Pope, is also alluded to as one of bis benefactors, but, by his own desire,
                    not named. This modest and munificent patron of merit is said to have made
                    Fielding a present of L.200 at one time, and that before he was personally
                    acquainted with the object of his "bounty; an act of rare generosity, and, from
                    the manner in which it was performed, fully confirming the truth of Pope’s

                    </lg></note> In these painful and precarious circumstances was the first of
                    English novels given to the public, who nad not hitherto seen any works founded
                    upon the plan of painting from nature, and who, consequently, were quite
                    unprepared for a work constructed on such a principle. Even Richardson’s novels
                    are but a step removed from the domain of the old romance; and, though
                    approaching more nearly to the ordinary course of events, still resemble it by
                    dealing in improbable incidents, exaggerated delineations, and characters
                    swelled out beyond the ordinary proportions of humanity. <hi rend="italic">Tom
                    Jones,</hi> on the other hand, is truth and human nature itself, and therein
                    consists the incalculable advantage which it possesses over all previous
                    fictions of this particular kind. Fielding is the Hogarth of novelists; and he
                    painted manners with the hand of a master. <hi rend="italic">The History of a
                    Foundling</hi> was received with unanimous acclamation by the public, and proved
                    so productive to Millar, the publisher, that he handsomely added L.100 to the
                    L.600 for which he had purchased the work from the author.</p>
                <p>“The general merits of this popular and delightful work,” says Sir Walter Scott,
                    “have been so often dwelt upon, and its imperfections so frequently censured,
                    that we can do little more than hastily run over ground which has been so
                    repeatedly occupied. The felicitous contrivance and happy extrication of the
                    story, where every incident tells upon and advances the catastrophe, while at
                    the same time it illustrates the characters of those interested in its approach,
                    cannot too often be mentioned with the highest approbation. The attention of the
                    reader is never diverted or puzzled by unnecessary digressions, or recalled to
                    the main story by abrupt and startling recurrences; he glides down the narrative
                    like a boat on the surface of some broad navigable stream, which only winds
                    enough to gratify the voyager with the varied beauty of its banks. One exception
                    to this praise, otherwise so well merited, occurs in the story of the Old Man of
                    the Hill; an episode which, in compliance with a custom introduced by Cervantes,
                    and followed by Le Sage, Fielding has thrust <pb break="no" facs="nls:193752291"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-2291-0541"/> into the midst of his narrative, as he had
                    formerly introduced the History of Leonora, equally unnecessarily and
                    inartificially, into that of <hi rend="italic">Joseph Andrews.</hi> It has also
                    been wondered why Fielding should have chosen to leave the stain of illegitimacy
                    on the birth of his hero; and it has been surmised that he did so in allusion to
                    his own first wife, who was also a natural child. A better reason may be
                    discovered in the story itself; for had Miss Bridget been privately married to
                    the father of Tom Jones, there could have been no adequate motive assigned for
                    keeping his birth secret from a man so reasonable and compassionate as
                    Allworthy.</p>
                <p>“But even the high praise due to the construction and arrangement of the story is
                    inferior to that claimed by the truth, force, and spirit of the characters, from
                    Tom Jones himself down to Black George the game-keeper and his family. Amongst
                    these, Squire Western stands alone; imitated from no prototype, and in himself
                    an inimitable picture of ignorance, prejudice, irascibility, and rusticity,
                    united with natural shrewdness, constitutional good humour, and an instinctive,
                    affection for his daughter,—all which qualities, good and bad, are grounded upon
                    that basis of thorough selfishness, natural to one bred up from infancy where no
                    one dared to contradict his arguments or to control his conduct. In one incident
                    alone we think Fielding has departed from this admirable sketch. As an English
                    squire, Western ought not to have taken a beating so unresistingly from the
                    friend of Lord Fellamar. We half suspect that the passage is an interpolation.
                    It is inconsistent with the squire’s readiness to engage in rustic affrays. We
                    grant a pistol or sword might have appalled him; but Squire Western should have
                    yielded to no one in the use of the English horsewhip; and as, with all his
                    brutalities, we have a sneaking interest in the honest jolly country gentleman,
                    we would willingly hope there is some mistake in this matter.</p>
                <p>“The character of Jones, otherwise a model of generosity, openness, manly spirit,
                    mingled with thoughtless dissipation, is, in like manner, unnecessarily degraded
                    by the nature of his intercourse with Lady Bellaston; and this is one of the
                    circumstances which incline us to believe that Fielding’s ideas of what was
                    gentleman-like and honourable had sustained some depreciation, in consequence of
                    the unhappy circumstances of his life, and of the society to which they
                    condemned him.</p>
                <p>“A more sweeping and general objection was made against the <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of a Foundling</hi> by the admirers of Richardson, and has been often
                    repeated since. It is alleged, that the ultimate moral of <hi rend="italic">Tom

                    a youth who gives way to licentious habits, is detrimental to society, and tends
                    to encourage the youthful reader in the practice of those follies to which his
                    natural passions and the usual course of the world but too much direct him.
                    French delicacy, which on so many occasions has strained at a gnat and swallowed
                    a camel, saw this fatal tendency in the work, and by an <hi rend="italic"
                    >arret</hi> discharged the circulation of a bungled abridgment by De la Place,
                    entitled a translation. To this charge Fielding himself might probably have
                    replied, that the vices into which Jones suffers himself to fall are made the
                    direct cause of placing him in the distressful situation which he occupies
                    during the greater part of the narrative; whilst his generosity, his charity,
                    and his amiable qualities, become the means of saving him from the consequences
                    of his folly. But we suspect with Dr Johnson, that there is something of cant
                    both in the objection and in the answer to it, &lt; Men,’ says that moralist, ‘
                    will not become highwaymen because Macheath is acquitted on the stage;’ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> an</hi> d we add, they will not become swindlers and thieves
                    because they sympathize with the fortunes of the witty picaroon Giī Blas, or
                    licentious debauchees because they read <hi rend="italic">Torn Jones.</hi> The
                    professed moral of a piece is usually what the reader is least interested in; it
                    is like the mendicant, who cripples after some splendid and gay procession, and
                    in vain solicits the attention of those who have been gazing upon it. Excluding
                    from consideration those infamous works, which address themselves directly to
                    awakening the grosser passions of our nature, we are inclined to think, the
                    worst evil to be apprehended from the perusal of novels is, that the habit is
                    apt to generate an indisposition to real history and useful literature; and that
                    the best which can be hoped is, that they may sometimes instruct the youthful
                    mind by real pictures of life, and sometimes awaken their better feelings and
                    sympathies by strains of generous sentiment and tales of fictitious wo. Beyond
                    this point they are a mere elegance, a luxury contrived for the amusement of
                    polished life, and the gratification of that half love of literature, which
                    pervades all ranks in an advanced stage of society, and are read much more for
                    amusement than with the least hope of deriving instruction from them. The vices
                    and follies of Tom Jones are those which the world soon teaches to all who enter
                    on the career of life, and to which society is unhappily but too indulgent; nor
                    do we believe, that in any one instance the perusal of Fielding’s novel has
                    added one libertine to the large list, who would not have been such had it never
                    crossed the press. And it is with concern we add our sincere belief, that the
                    fine picture of frankness and generosity exhibited in that fictitious character
                    has had as few imitators as the career of his follies. Let it not be supposed
                    that we are indifferent to morality, because we treat with scorn that
                    affectation which, while in common life it connives at the open practice of
                    libertinism, pretends to detest the memory of an author who painted life as it
                    was, with all its shades, and more than all the lights which it occasionally
                    exhibits, to relieve them. For particular passages of the work, the author can
                    only be defended under the custom of his age, which permitted, in certain cases,
                    much stronger language than ours. He has himself said, that there is nothing
                    which can offend the chastest eye in the perusal; and he spoke probably
                    according to the’ideas of his time. But in modern estimation, there are several
                    passages at which delicacy may justly take offence; and we can only say, that
                    they may be termed rather jocularly coarse than seductive; and that they are
                    atoned for by the admirable mixture of wit and argument by which, in others, the
                    cause of true religion and virtue is supported and advanced.</p>
                <p>“Fielding considered his works as an experiment in British literature; and
                    therefore he chose to prefix a preliminary chapter to each book, explanatory of
                    his own views, and of the rules attached to this mode of composition. Those
                    critical introductions, which rather interrupt the course of the story, and the
                    flow of the interest at the first perusal, are found, on a second or third, the
                    most entertaining chapters of the whole work.”</p>
                <p>The publication of <hi rend="italic">Torn Jones</hi> placed Fielding at the head
                    of English novellists, but it seems to have been attended with little or no
                    advantage to his fortune beyond the temporary relief afforded by the copy-money.
                    His last work of importance was <hi rend="italic">Amelia,</hi> which may be
                    considered as a continuation of <hi rend="italic">Torn Jones</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but we have not the same sympathy for the ungrateful and
                    dissolute conduct of Booth, as for the youthful, and on that account somewhat
                    excusable, follies of Jones. The character of Amelia is said to have been drawn
                    for Fielding’s second wife; and if, as has been alleged, he put her forbearance
                    to tests of the same kind, it must also be confessed that he has in some degree
                    repaid her by the picture which he has drawn <pb break="no" facs="nls:193752304"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-2304-0542"/>of her purity, delicacy, and tenderness. <hi
                    rend="italic">Amelia</hi> was published in 1751 by Millar, who paid a thousand
                    pounds for the copyright, and contrived to reimburse himself by an ingenious
                    stratagem which he practised on the trade. In 1752, Fielding, unmoved by former
                    failures, commenced a literary newspaper and review, to be published twice a
                    week, which he entitled the <hi rend="italic">Covent-Garden Journal;</hi> but
                    although his ready pen, sharp wit, and classical attainments, highly fitted him
                    for conducting a work of this kind, it was his failing to embroil himself in the
                    party squabbles or literary feuds of the day; and on this occasion it was not
                    long ere he involved himself in a quarrel with Dr Hill and other periodical
                    writers, amongst whom we regret to mention Smollett, a man possessed of kindred
                    genius, and second only to Fielding in that department of literature where both
                    so eminently excelled. The warfare was of short duration, and neither party
                    would derive honour from an inquiry into the cause or the conduct of
                    hostilities.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Fielding’s strength was fast decaying; a complication of disorders
                    having terminated in a dropsical habit, which totally undermined his naturally
                    robust constitution. But as the Duke of Newcastle, then prime minister, was
                    desirous of receiving assistance from him in the formation of a plan for the
                    prevention of secret robberies, and for improving the police of the metropolis,
                    Fielding undertook, for the small consideration of L.600, to be paid by
                    government, to extirpate several gangs of daring ruffians, who then infested
                    London and its vicinity; and, though his health was thus impaired, he continued
                    to superintend the conduct of his agents, to take evidence, and to make out
                    commitments, until this great object was accomplished. The exertions which were
                    thus rendered necessary, however, proved fatal to his exhausted frame, which was
                    now suffering under dropsy, jaundice, and asthma. The Bath waters were tried,
                    but in vain; and various modes of cure or alleviation were resorted to, though
                    with little effect. As a last resource, therefore, his medical advisers
                    recommended him to try the effect of a milder climate; and with this view he
                    undertook a voyage to Lisbon, of which he has left a record, written with a hand
                    trembling almost in its latest hour.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Of his departure for Lisbon he has himself left the
                    following melancholy record, in which his situation is painted a thousand times
                    better than could have been done by any pen but his own: “On this day,
                    Wednesday, June 26, 17ð4, the most melancholy sun I had ever beheld arose, and
                    found me awake at my house at I ’ 'ordhook. By the light of this sun, I was, in
                    my own opinion, last to behold and take leave of some creatures on whom I doated
                    with a mother-like fondness, guided by nature and passion, and uncured and
                    unhardened by all the doctrine of that philosophical school, where I had learned
                    to bear pains, and to despise death. In this situation, as 1 could not conquer
                    nature, I submitted entirely to her, and she made as great a fool of me as she
                    had ever done of any woman whatsoever; under pretence of giving me leave to
                    enjoy, she drew me in to suffer, the company of my little ones during eight
                    hours; and I doubt not whether, in that time, I did not undergo more than in all
                    my distemper. At twelve precisely my coach was at the door, which was no sooner
                    told me, than <hi rend="italic">I</hi> kissed my children, and went into it with
                    some little resolution. γV wife, who behaved more like a heroine and
                    philosopher, though at the same time the tenderest mother in the world, and my
                    eldest daughter, followed me. Some friends went with us, others here took their
                    leave; and I heard my behaviour applauded, with many murmurs and praises to
                    which I well knew I had no title.” (Pby¾'∙e <hi rend="italic">to Lisbon,</hi> p.
                    1.) This affecting passage remains a singular example of I ieldiug s natural
                    strength of mind; and, indeed, the whole of the <hi rend="italic">Journey to
                    Lisbon</hi> shows that, whilst struggling at once with the depression and the
                    irritability of disease, he could still exhibit a few flashes of that bright wit
                    which used to set the wor in a roar. “His perception of character, and power of
                    describing it,” says Sir Walter Scott, “had not forsaken him in those sa
                    moments; for the master of the ship in which he sailed, the scolding landlady of
                    the Isle of Wight, the military coxcomb who Visι s their vessel, are all
                    portraits marked with the master-hand which traced Parson Adams and Squire
                    Western.”</p></note> Fielding, however, reached that city alive, and remained
                    there two months; but he was unable to continue his proposed literary labours.
                    The hand of death was upon him; and in the beginning of October 1754 he
                    terminated his earthly career, in the forty-eighth year of his age, leaving
                    behind him a widow and four children. “Thus lived, and thus died,” says Sir
                    Walter Scott, “at a period of life when the world might have expected continued
                    delight from his matured powers, the celebrated Henry Fielding, father of the
                    English novel, and in his powers of strong and national humour, and forcible yet
