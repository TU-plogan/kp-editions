                <p><label type="entry">FABRICIUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">George</hi></label>, a Latin
                    poet and historian, was born at Kemnitz, in Germany, on the 24th April 1516. He
                    began his studies in his native place, and completed them at Freyberg and at
                    Leipsic, where he was preceptor to Wolfgang, and also to Philip and Antony
                    Werter. He travelled into Italy with the elder of his pupils, and on his return
                    to Germany in 1553, was appointed director of the college of Meissen, where he
                    died on the 13th July 1571. In his poetical compositions, which obtained for
                    their author considerable distinction, he aftected not to employ any word which
                    had the slightest flavour of paganism; and he blamed those poets who had in
                    their works introduced the pagan divinities. All that he wrote on the history of
                    his country is, in the judgment of Niceron, estimable for research and accuracy;
                    and Lenglet Dufresnoy pronounces a similar opinion. The following list includes
                    the principal works which he published, either as author or as editor: 1. <hi

                    having been a native of the episcopal city of that name, in Italy, where he was
                    born in 1537. His parents, though poor, were desirous to give their son an
                    excellent education, and with this view sent him to Padua, where the young
                    Fabricius soon found powerful protectors to assist in the cultivation of his
                    talents. After completing his course of philosophy, he applied himself to
                    medicine, which he studied under the celebrated Fallopius, and soon became the
                    most distinguished pupil of that learned professor, whom he afterwards
                    succeeded. Fallopius having died in 1562, Fabricius, then only twenty-five years
                    of age, was at first employed merely to give anatomical demonstrations; but he
                    discharged this duty with so much zeal and ability that, in 1565, he was
                    formally promoted to the chair of surgery, whilst that of anatomy, which had
                    hitherto been considered as merely a dependence or accessory of the other, was
                    declared primary in favour of Fabricius, to whom were also assigned very
                    considerable appointments. And to these preferments the senators of Venice added
                    the highest distinctions which it was in their power to bestow. They granted him
                    privileges not less extraordinary than flattering, gave him precedence of the
                    professors of philosophy, named him citizen of Padua, honoured him with a statue
                    and a gold chain, decorated him with the order of knight of St Mark, constructed
                    a superb anatomical theatre for his accommodation, and assigned him a liberal
                    retired allowance, with the right of naming his successor. Fabricius practised
                    his profession with much dignity and with rare disinterestedness. Persons of
                    high rank, who were indebted to him for the re-establishment of their health,
                    made up by rich presents for the fees which the generous physician refused; and
                    these Fabricius collected in a cabinet, on the door of which he caused to be
                    inscribed the words <hi rend="italic">Lucri neglecti</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lucrum.</hi> He possessed a beautiful country-house, situated on the delightful
                    banks of the Brenta, and still known by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Montognuola d' Acquapendente,</hi> where, sound in body and mind, loaded with
                    riches, generally esteemed, and enjoying a brilliant reputation, he calculated
                    on spending a happy old age. But his expectations were cruelly disappointed, and
                    his repose was disturbed by envy and ingratitude. It is even said that he was
                    sometimes obliged to employ the knife for other purposes than surgical
                    operations and dissections. Relations on whom he had never ceased to lavish
                    favours, unworthily betrayed his confidence, and are suspected, not without
                    reason, of having abridged his days by means of poison. Having attained the age
                    of cighty-two, he died suddenly in an agony of vomiting, on the 21st May 1619,
                    leaving to his niece a fortune of two hundred thousand ducats, and to the
                    republic of letters the following works, which are much esteemed: 1. <hi

                    hactenus variis locis ac formis edita, nunc vero certo ordine digesta, et.in

                <p>But the Leyden edition, published in 1738, by Bernard-Lifroy Albinus, is
                    preferred to that of Bohn, as containing a life of the author, and the prefaces
                    of the different treatises, which Bohn had unaccountably suppressed. All the
                    writings of Fabricius are truly classical, and fully jug. tify the high
                    reputation of their author. His style is pure, and even elegant; the language of
                    Hippocrates was as familiar to him as that of Celsus; and lucid order pervades
                    all his writings. In regularity of plan and clear luminous method he is
                    unsurpassed, “On a reproché à ce grand chirurgien trop de timidité dans
                    l’exercice de son art, et pourtant nous le voyons,” says his French biographer,
                    “pratiquer et perfectionner le trépan, employer avec autant de hardiesse que de
                    talent le bistouri, l’aiguille, le trois-quarts, la rugine et même le for rouge,
                    quoiqu en dise Severino. Haller, qui, certes, ne le juge pas avec bienveillance,
                    est forcé de lui rendre justice sur ces divers points.” In a word, Fabricius was
                    one of the greatest ornaments of the university of Padua, and one of the most
                    celebrated anatomists and surgeons of the sixteenth century. <hi

                    >John Albert,</hi> one of the most learned, laborious, and useful of
                    bibliographers, was born at Leipsic on the 11th of November 1668. He lost his
                    mother in 1674, and five years afterwards his father, Werner Fabricius, director
                    of music in the church of St Paul at Leipsic, and author of several works,
                    particularly <hi rend="italic">Deliciae</hi><hi rend="italic">Harmoniere,</hi>
                    published in 1657. The subject of this notice commenced his studies under his
                    father, who, on his deathbed, recommended him to the care of Valentine Alberti.
                    He studied during five years under Wencelaz Buhl, then for some time under Ĵ. S.
                    Herrichen; and, in 1684, he was sent to Quedlinburg, there to continue his
                    studies under Samuel Schmidt. From this period the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Adversaria</hi> of Barthius formed his delight; and when, in 1687, he saw the
                    first volume of Morhof’s <hi rend="italic">Polyhistor,</hi> the desire which he
                    had already felt of devoting himself to letters greatly increased. Having
                    returned to Leipsic in 1686, he was the same year admitted bachelor in
                    philosophy, and, in the beginning of 1688, he took the degree of master in the
                    same faculty; soon after which he published his first work, consisting of only
                    one sheet in quarto. He then applied himself to the study of medicine, which,
                    however, he relinquished for that of theology; and having gone to Hamburg in
                    1693, he proposed to travel into several countries, when the unexpected and not
                    very agreeable information which now reached him, that the expense of his
                    education had absorbed his whole patrimony, and even left him in debt to his
                    trustee, forced him to abandon his project. He therefore remained at Hamburg,
                    where J. F. Mayer employed him in the capacity of librarian. In 1696 he
                    accompanied his patron to Sweden, and, on his return to Hamburg, not long
                    afterwards, he competed for the chair oflogic and philosophy. The suffrages
                    being equally divided between Fabricius and Sebastian Edzardi, one of his
                    opponents, recourse was had to chance, which decided in favour ofEdzardi; butin
                    1699 Fabricius succeeded Vincent Flaccius in the chair of eloquence and
                    practical philosophy, after which he took the degree of doctor in theology at
                    Kiel. From 1692 to 1697 he had preached regularly every Friday; but after he
                    received his appointment of professor, he devoted the greater part of his time
                    to the duties of that office. In 1701, J. F. Mayer having established himself at
                    Greifswald, caused the chair of theology in that city to be offered to
                    Fabricius, who, however refused it on account of his health. But in 1708 he ha
                    accepted the situation of professor of theology, logic, an metaphysics, and was
                    preparing to enter on his new oitice, when the senate of Hamburg induced him to
                    remain, by adding to his charge as professor that of rector of t <hi

                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-1407-0473"/>school of St John, then held by his father-in-law,
                    Schultz, whom Fabricius was very willing to assist in the discharge of his
                    duties. Schultz died in 1709, but Fabricius retained the rectorship two years
                    longer. In 1719 the landgrave of Hesse Cassel made him so advantageous an offer,
                    that Fabricius was on the point of accepting it; but this time also the
                    magistrates, by a seasonable increase of salary, prevailed on him to remain
                    amongst them. An attempt was subsequently made to draw him to Wittenberg. But
                    Fabricius refused to listen to the proposals which were made to him, and died at
                    Hamburg on the 30th of April 1736. Besides the time which he had devoted to the
                    duties of his office, Fabricius spent a considerable portion in maintaining an
                    extensive correspondence, and in receiving the visits of foreigners; but he was
                    so laborious that he was nevertheless the author of a great number of works, the
                    list of which, according to Niceron and Reimar, includes as many as a hundred
                    and twenty-eight. It will be sufficient here, however, to indicate the most
                    remarkable of these, which are, 1. <hi rend="italic">Scriptorum recentium

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fabricius,</hi><hi rend="italic">Vincent,</hi> born at
                    Hamburg on the 13th of eptember 1612, studied at Leyden, and there took his <hi
                    rend="superscript"> e</hi> S&gt;ees in medicine in 1634. He had already made
                    himself known by his talent for Latin poetry; and two years befoιe this, had
                    published a collection of verses, at the solicitation of his friend and patron
                    Daniel Heinsius. He t ιen applied himself to the study of law, in which his
                    progress was not less rapid than it had been in the other sciences, and in due
                    time he became a learned civilian. 1he bishop of Lubec conferred on him the
                    title of counsellor, with suitable appointments; but he did not hold this
                    situation for any length of time; and having established himself with his family
                    at Dantzic, he was soon afterwards named syndic, and then burgomaster, of that
                    city. The knowledge which he had acquired of the interests of the republic, and
                    the talent for public speaking which he displayed upon occasions of importance,
                    caused him to be thirteen times returned by the senate as their deputy to the
                    Polish diet. He died at Warsaw, during one of the sessions of that body, on the
                    11th September 1667. The first edition of the poems of Fabricius appeared at
                    Leyden in 1632; and the second, corrected and augmented by the author, in 1638.
                    But his son, Frederic Fabricius, published a third at Leipsic, 1685, in 8vo,
                    containing several pieces which had been omitted in the preceding editions,
                    besides the <hi rend="italic">Harangues</hi> pronounced by him in the Polish
                    diet, a discourse <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Obsidione et
                    Liberatione urbis Leidensis,</hi> delivered at Leyden in 1632, and the medical
                    theses maintained by him in the same city.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fabricius,</hi><hi rend="italic">John-Christian,</hi> the
                    most celebrated entomologist of the eighteenth century, was born at Tundern, in
                    the duchy of Sleswick, in 1742. After having completed his studies, at the age
                    of twenty, he repaired to the university of Upsal, to attend the prelections of
                    Linnaeus. How long he remained there is uncertain. But no pupil was ever more
                    indebted to the lessons of his master than Fabricius. All his works on
                    entomology, which have secured to him a well-merited reputation, indicate the
                    precepts, the method, and even the forms of Linnaeus, applied to the development
                    of a single new idea, not more fortunate in conception than fruitful in its
                    consequences. Far from disguising the obligations which he owed to his master,
                    Fabricius delighted to expatiate on the happy moments which he had passed in the
                    society of Linnaeus; and the grateful scholar has transmitted to us those
                    biographical details, which are not only the most interesting in themselves, but
                    at the same time best fitted to give us an insight into the character of the
                    great naturalist. It was in studying under the latter that Fabricius conceived
                    the idea of his system, and formed the project of his labours on insects. The
                    first insect s mouth which he dissected was that of a cockchafer <hi
                    rend="italic">(scarabaeus</hi><hi rend="italic">stridulus)</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> he showed it to Linnaeus, with the description he had made of it, and
                    proposed to him to employ the organs of the mouth, in order to establish the
                    characters of insects, in the new edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Systema</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturae</hi> which Linnaeus was then preparing.
                    The latter encouraged his pupil to pursue this course, but refused to enter on
                    it himself, because, as he said, he was too old to change his method. Forced to
                    choose a profession, Fabricius studied medicine, and at the age of twenty-five
                    took the degree of doctor in physic; but being soon afterwards appointed
                    professor of natural history in the university of Kiel, he devoted himsclŕ
                    entirely to his favourite pursuits, and, in 1775, published his system of
                    entomology. This work gave anew aspect to the science. Swammerdam and Ray had
                    classed insects according to their metamorphoses; Lister, Linnaeus, and
                    Geoffroy, according to the organs of motion; and some entomologists, as Reaumur,
                    Scopoli, and even Linnaeus himself, had employed the nutritive organs in order
                    to characterize distinctively certain genera. But before the time of Fabricius
                    no one had thought of makiner these <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751420"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-1420-0474"/>the basis of a general classification. This idea
                    was at once new and bold, and the author evolved it with singular ability. In a
                    second work, which he published two years afterwards, he developed the
                    characters of the classes and genera, showing in the preface the advantages of
                    his method, and, at the same time, excusing its inconveniences. Lastly, in 1778,
                    he published <hi rend="italic">Entomological Philosophy,</hi> in imitation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Botanical Philosophy</hi> of Linnaeus; and from this
                    period till his death, that is, during the space of more than thirty years, he
                    was incessantly occupied in extending his system, which he reproduced under
                    different forms in the various works which, from tinfe to time, he gave to the
                    world. But in proportion as the number of species increased, the characters of
                    the <hi rend="italic">genera,</hi> and even of the classes, became more and more
                    uncertain and arbitrary; and, with reference to this fundamental point, his
                    later wa itings are perhaps inferior to those which preceded them. The basis
                    which he had assumed was excellent; but it could only conduct him to a <hi
                    rend="italic">natural method,</hi> not, as he supposed, to a <hi rend="italic"
                    >system</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and this misconception led him to neglect
                    other considerations which would have furnished more exact means of
                    classification. Fabricius had a very extensive knowledge of botany, and of the
                    other branches of natural history. He had been appointed counsellor of state to
                    the king of Denmark, and professor of rural and political economy, in which
                    capacity he published, in German and in Danish, several useful works, though
                    much less celebrated than those which appeared from his pen on the subject of
                    entomology. Fabricius died in 1807, at the age of sixty-five, of a melancholic
                    affection, produced, as is alleged, by the bombardment of Copenhagen. The
                    following is a list of his works: 1. <hi rend="italic">Systema</hi><hi
