                <p><label type="entry">FIXLMILLNER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Placidus</hi></label>, a
                    learned astronomer, was ' born at Achleuthen, near Linz, in Austria, on the 28th
                    of May 1721. He received the rudiments of his education in the monastery of
                    Kremsmunster, of which his uncle Alexander was abbot; afterwards went to
                    Salzburg, where he studied a regular course of philosophy, but turned his
                    attention particularly to the mathematics. In 1737, he was admitted as a novice
                    into the Benedictine monastery, Kremsmunster, and the next year he took the
                    solemn vowin presence of the abbot. After being two years in this monastery,
                    during which time he devoted every leisure hour to the study of mathematics and
                    philosophy, he returned to Salzburg to finish his studies in theology and
                    jurisprudence, and at the same time acquired a competent knowledge of the
                    oriental and modern languages, besides history and antiquities. In 1745, he
                    obtained the degree of doctor in divinity, after which he received priest’s
                    orders in his own monastery, and was created professor of ecclesiastical law,
                    which office he held during forty years, discharging its duties until within a
                    few days of his death. He was also chosen as dean of the higher schools, and
                    regent of the young nobility, offices which he retained during his life.</p>
                <p>Fixlmillner wrote a commentary on the <hi rend="italic">Jus Cαηοnicum,</hi> but
                    this work was never published. By the entreaties of his friends, he was induced
                    to publish his <hi rend="italic">Reipubliece sa∙ crae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Origines</hi><hi rend="italic">dwinoe, seu Ecclesiae Christi exterior junetura,
                    imperium,</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">hierarchia, ex</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">primigenia ejus institutione cruta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">demonstrata.</hi> But it was his knowledge of
                    astronomy which rendered him truly illustrious. His uncle Alexander fitted up an
                    apartment for containing the instruments necessary for the pursuit of
                    mathematical knowledge; and he also erected an observatory, which was begun in
                    1748, and completed in 1758, under the direction of Anselm Dering of Emsdorf, a
                    celebrated architect. Whilst the observatory was building, Fixlmillner led a
                    life of retirement and severe study, his favourite pursuit during this time
                    being astronomy. When the edifice was finished, Dobler, a mathematician of some
                    note, was appointed first astronomer; but the successors of his uncle the abbot
                    having discovered Fixlmillner’s extensive mathematical knowledge, made him an
                    offer of the astronomical department, and the sole direction of the observatory;
                    and this place he accepted in the year 1762, at the same time retaining his
                    chair as professor of ecclesiastical law. He was not yet master of the learning
                    which practical astronomy requires; but to remedy this defect he perused
                    attentively Lalande’s <hi rend="italic">Exposition du</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Calcul Astronomique,</hi> soon after which he obtained the large astronomical
                    work of the same author, and in 1766 published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Meridianus</hi><hi rend="italic">Specidae Astronomicce Cremifanensis∙&gt;</hi>
                    Steyer, 4to, by which he acquired considerable reputation. Ten years after this
                    period he gave the world his <hi rend="italic">Deeenniwn Astronomicum,</hi>
                    Steyer, 4to, containing many curious and important particulars respecting the
                    theory and practice of astronomy. His <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Astronomica</hi><hi rend="italic">Cremĳhnensia,</hi> Steyer, 1791,
                    4to, which did not appear till after his decease, still further increased his
                    astronomical reputation; and he was, besides, a large contributor to many
                    periodical publications in different countries.</p>
                <p>He made and collected a great number of observations on the planet Mercury, the
                    importance of which was publicly acknowledged by Lalande, as they greatly
                    assisted him in constructing his tables of that planet. Fixlmillner was one of
                    the first astronomers who calculated the orbit of the new planet Uranus <hi
                    rend="italic">{Georgium Sidus)</hi>, his tables respecting which will be found
                    in the Berlin Almanac for 1789. He also proved the truth of what had formerly
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193753201" xml:id="kp-eb0709-3201-0611"/>been
                    conjectured, that the thirty-fourth star of Taurus, which Flamsteed observed in
                    1690, was the new planet. It may be said of most philosophers, that they observe
                    a great deal and calculate little; but the conduct of Fixlmillner was exactly
                    the reverse. He turned his attention more than any of his predecessors to the
                    solar spots, which he observed in the years 1767, 1776, 1777, 1778, and 1782,
                    and from which he deduced important inferences respecting the revolution of the
                    sun on his axis.</p>
                <p>Fixlmillner had a genius singularly adapted for the study of mechanics, by which
                    he was enabled to invent a new micrometer, and a machine for grinding concentric
                    circles. As he resided in the country, he was in a great measure deprived of
                    literary assistance; but his indefatigable zeal, diligence, and perseverance
                    more than supplied the want of such aid. He was but little subject to the
                    influence of the stronger passions. Like the laws of nature, which it was his
                    chief delight to study, he was simple, uniform, and constant; and by the
                    mildness and integrity of his character, he acquired the love and esteem of
                    mankind. His high reputation never inspired him with’vanity, and he rather
                    wished to conceal than to propagate what had been written in his praise. His
                    health having been very much impaired by his intense application, he terminated
                    his earthly career on the 27th August 1791, in the seventy-first year of his
                    age.</p>
