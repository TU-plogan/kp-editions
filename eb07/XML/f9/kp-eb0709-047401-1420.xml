                    one of the most celebrated jurisconsults of his time, was born in 1580, at Aix
                    in I ιovence, whither his father, originally of Nismes, had gone to establish
                    himself during the civil wars. His earlv studies were successfully prosecuted,
                    and he made great progress in the ancient languages and in the civil and the
                    canon law. In 1606 he took the degree of doctor, and was soon afterwards
                    admitted as advocate before the parliament of Aix. As this court then reckoned
                    amongst its members men of distinguished merit, such as the celebrated Peiresc
                    and William Duvair, who was its first president, their common taste for letters
                    naturally united them with Fabrot, for whom, in 1609, Duvair procured a
                    professorship in the university of Aix. Having become keeper of the seals, the
                    latter carried his young friend with him to Paris, where Fabrot remained until
                    after the death of his benefactor, when he returned to resume his peaceful
                    functions as professor. But these did not absorb the whole of his time, and he
                    employed his leisure in other labours, which, however, had all a relation to
                    jurisprudence. The great interpreters whom the sixteenth century produced had
                    left almost nothing to be added in regard to the books of this science written
                    in Latin. But Fabrot opened for himself a different path. The successors of
                    Justinian on the throne of Constantinople had caused to be executed in Greek an
                    abridgment of his compilations, to which were added articles taken from the
                    fathers and the councils; and to this abridgment Leo the Philosopher gave the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Basilica,</hi> which, in fact, formed the code of the
                    eastern empire until its destruction. The <hi rend="italic">Basilica,</hi> long
                    unknown, were in some sort discovered by Cujas, who made great use of them in
                    his writings, but did not publish them. Fabrot, however, undertook this task,
                    and, about 1639, extracted from this collection, and published in Greek and
                    Latin, fourteen laws, which are wanting in the Digest. These, with some other
                    productions of Fabrot, were inserted by Everard Otton in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thesaurus Juris</hi><hi rend="italic">Civilis.</hi> Of the sixty books of which
                    the <hi rend="italic">Basilica</hi> were composed, thirteen have been lost.
                    Those which remain Fabrot translated; and he supplied, by means of summaries,
                    the place of those which are lost. This work, consisting of seven volumes in
                    folio, was published in 1647 at Paris, where Fabrot had now established himself,
                    and was dedicated to the Chancellor Seguier, through whose influence, exerted in
                    his favour, he obtained a considerable pension, by means of which he was enabled
                    to continue his useful labours. Matthieu Mole, at first procureur-général, then
                    first president anti keeper of the seals, a man whose heroic firmness is so well
                    known, and Jerome Bignon, a magistrate distinguished for his knowledge and
                    integrity, likewise gave Fabrot proofs of the estimation in which they held his
                    talents. Besides the <hi rend="italic">Basilica,</hi> the latter also translated
                    into Latin the Greek paraphrase which Theophilus had made of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Institutions</hi> of Justinian (Paris, 1638 and 1657, in 4to)∙ The
                    particular nature of his pursuits having rendered him familiar with the
                    Byzantine historians, Fabrot published several of their works, such as those of
                    Cedrenus, Nicetas, Anastasius the Librarian, and others, enriched wit <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> notes and dissertations. And as he was not only
                    acquainted with the civil, but also with the canon law of t e lower empire,
                    which in fact form but one whole; whet Justel and William Voet compiled their
                    Library of Canot Law, which appeared in 1661, they inserted in that compilation
                    the constitutions of Theodorus Balsamon, wuc were found amongst the papers of
                    Fabrot, with notes in '&gt;s peculiar manner. But one of the undertakings ¶ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ιc</hi> have done the greatest honour to this learned
                    juriscon suit, is his edition of the works of Cujas, which he co^ rected
                    according to several manuscripts, and enriche' <hi rend="superscript"> w</hi>
                    notes and several treatises of Cujas, which had not f viously seen the light.
                    Before the appearance o t of Naples and of Venice, this was the best of all t

                    completed it in 1658. It is believed that the continued and intense application
                    which he bestowed on this work caused the malady of which he died on the 16th of
                    January 1659. His reputation was so extensive, that the most celebrated
                    universities of France desired to have the benefit of his services as professor
                    of law; but he refused every offer of the kind which was made to him, however
                    advantageous, that his attention might not be diverted from the great
                    undertakings in which he had embarked. Fabrot wrote, 1. <hi rend="italic"
