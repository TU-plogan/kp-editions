                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">FONTANA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Felix</hi></label>, a
                    distinguished physiologist and experimental philosopher, was born at Pomarolo, a
                    little town in the Tyrol, on the 15th April 1730.</p>
                <p>He began his studies at the neighbouring city of Rove-</p>
                <p>redo, and continued them in the schools of Verona and Parma, and afterwards in
                    the universities of Padua and Bologna. He then visited Rome, and went to
                    Florence, where he obtained from the Emperor Francis I. who was at that time
                    Grand Duke of Tuscany, the appointment of professor of philosophy at Pisa; but
                    the Grand Duke Peter Leopold, who was also afterwards emperor, invited him to
                    settle at Florence, and gave him an establishment connected with his household,
                    as <hi rend="italic">Fisico</hi> or naturalist, and as director of the cabinet
                    of natural history, which was afterwards rendered by his exertions one of the
                    principal ornaments of the city of Florence.</p>
                <p>Fontana became the author of many well-known works on physiology, natural
                    philosophy, and chemistry. In 1757 he was engaged in an investigation tending to
                    confirm the doctrines of Haller respecting the irritability of the muscles,
                    considered as a distinct quality inherent in those organs. Haller has published
                    several of his letters as a part of his own <hi rend="italic">Mémoires sur
                    les</hi><hi rend="italic">parties</hi><hi rend="italic">sensibles et
                    irritables;</hi> and the subject afforded Fontana the materials of several
                    successive essays. 1. <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Irritabilitatis

                    <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Laws of Irritability,</hi> stating, first, the
                    general outline of the doctrine, then entering into the different intensity of
                    the property of irritability, and its loss by exhaustion or by inactivity, and
                    discussing the action of the heart, and the peculiarities of the death
                    occasioned by electricity. 3. Another link of the same chain of investigation is
                    found in the earlier publication <hi rend="italic">De'</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >moti delι</hi><hi rend="italic">iride,</hi> 8. Lucca, 1765; showing that the
                    contraction of the pupil depends on the effect of light falling on the retina,
                    and not on the iris itself, and establishing an analogy between the motions of
                    the uvea, and the semi-voluntary actions of the muscles of respiration. 4. One
                    of the most important of Fontana’s works is his <hi rend="italic">Ricerche

                    calculated to show that the poison of the viper acts by mixing with the blood,
                    and destroying the irritability of the muscles to which it is conveyed; but that
                    the bite of the European viper, though fatal to small animals, is scarcely ever
                    capable of producing any immediately dangerous effects on the human frame. 5.
                    The same matter was republished, with many additions, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Traité sur le Venin de la Vipère, sur les Poisons Américains, sur le
                    Laurier-cérise, et sur quelques autres Poisons,</hi> Berlin, 1787; together with
                    some observations on the primitive structure of the animal body, experiments on
                    the reproduction of the nerves, and remarks on the anatomy of the eye. 6. In
                    1766 our author published an essay entitled <hi rend="italic">Nuove
                    Osservazioni</hi><hi rend="italic">sopra</hi><hi rend="italic">i glo-betti rossi
                    del sangue,</hi> Lucca; confuting the assertions which had lately been advanced
                    by Della Torre, respecting the complicated structure and changes of form of the
                    globules of the blood. 7. In the next year appeared <hi rend="italic"
                    >Osservazioni</hi><hi rend="italic">sopra</hi><hi rend="italic">la ruggine

                    an eel, to which he attributes the rust of coin, but which has not always been
                    found by subsequent observers in similar cases, perhaps for want of accurate
                    distinction. 8. There is also a <hi rend="italic">Lettre sur</hi><hi

                    a multitude of little animals in continual motion.</p>

                    attention throughout Europe in the latter half of the last century. He seems,
                    however, to have had the merit of first applying the discoveries of Priestley
                    respecting the effects of the nitric oxide to the examination of the qualities
                    of the atmosphere by means of the eudiometer, which is the subject of his <hi

                    observed the remarkable property that charcoal possesses of absorbing several
                    times its bulk of different gases. 14. In the <hi rend="italic">Ricerche

                    having fancied that the acidity of the fixed air is not essential to it, but
                    accidentally derived from the stronger acid employed in expelling it from the
                    earth or alkali. 15. The <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions for</hi>
                    1779, p. 187, contain his <hi rend="italic">Experiments and Observations on

                    various Animals,</hi> consisting of a repetition of Scheele’s attempt to breathe
                    hydrogen gas, which did not always create a sensation of immediate uneasiness,
                    though it was sometimes productive of alarming consequences. 16. In the same
                    volume, p. 432, we find an interesting <hi rend="italic">Account of the Airs
                    extracted from difl’erent kinds of Waters, with thoughts on the Salubrity of the
                    Air at different places,</hi> showing that the air afforded by water is very
                    different under different circumstances, but that the quality of the atmosphere
                    itself scarcely ever exhibits any variations which can be rendered sensible by
                    chemical tests.</p>
                <p>17. To the Memoirs of the Italian Society Fontana contributed several short
                    essays; the first, entitled <hi rend="italic">Principi generali</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">della solidità e della fluidità dei corpi,</hi> vol. i. p. 89,
                    Verona, 1782, containing the prevalent theories of the day respecting the change
                    in the forms of aggregation of the same substance, together with experiments on
                    the elasticity of different gases. 18. The second is a collection of
                    definitions, entitled <hi rend="italic">Sopra</hi><hi rend="italic">la luce, la
                    fiamma,</hi><hi rend="italic">il</hi><hi rend="italic">calore</hi><hi

                    p. 104, characterizing these supposed elementary principles according to the
                    ideas of Bergman, Scheele, and others. 19. In a later volume, v. p. 581 (1790),
                    we find a <hi rend="italic">Lettera del</hi><hi rend="italic">Cavaliere</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">F.</hi><hi rend="italic">Faļitana al Sign, de Morveau,</hi> in
                    which it is conjectured that inflammable air may be a compound of phlogiston and
                    water, and it is observed that the white crusts of flints contain as great a
                    proportion of pure silica as their internal parts. Our author remarks, however,
                    that his attention had of late been much distracted from chemical pursuits by
                    the attention required for the completion of his collection of wax models of
                    anatomical subjects, and for the duplicates which he was preparing for the
                    cabinet of Vienna at the request of the emperor. At a subsequent period another
                    series of copies of these models was ordered by Bonaparte to be sent to Paris;
                    but it was there judged inferior to the preparations already existing in the
                    Ecole de Médecine, which had been made under the direction of Laumonier, and
                    Fontana’s collection was sent to the university of Montpellier. He was latterly
                    engaged for some time in the preparation of a colossal model of a man, built up
                    anatomically of all his component parts, which were accurately represented in
                    wood; but this elaborate design was never completed.</p>
                <p>20. He was also the author of a few other chemical and mineralogical papers of
                    less importance; for instance, of an <hi rend="italic">Analyse de la Malachite,
                    Journ. Phys.</hi> xi. p. 509; and, 21. A <hi rend="italic">Lettre sur</hi><hi

                    work is entitled <hi rend="italic">Principes raisonnés de la Génération.</hi> He
                    was also meditating an essay on the revivification of animals, but he did not
                    live to complete it. A collection of his works, translated into French by
                    Gibelin» was published at Paris in 1785, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observatu&gt;ns Physiques</hi><hi rend="italic">et Chimiques.</hi></p>
                <p>Fontana had become acquainted with a great number of contemporary men of science,
                    by having travelled in various parts of Europe for the purpose of enriching the
                    cabinet of which he was superintendent: the same official situation brought him
                    into contact with all foreigners of distinction who passed through Florence in
                    their travels; and he seems to have enjoyed a more extensive reputation than
                    many philosophers of deeper research and more irresistible penetration. He wore
                    the habit of an ecclesiastic, and was not uncommonly called abbé. He was well
                    received in the best societies, though his manners are said to have been
                    sometimes a little at variance with the dress which he adopted. He was treated
                    with great respect by the French generals when they took possession of Tuscany
                    in 1799, and hence he became the object of some suspicion upon the return of the
                    Austrians, especially with the insurgents of Arezzo, who preceded them, and by
                    whom he was for a short time imprisoned. His last illness was occasioned by an
                    accidental fall in the street, on the 11th of January 1805, and he died the 9th
                    of March 1806, at the age of seventy-five. He was buried in the church of the
                    Holy Cross, not far from the tomb of Galileo. His Eloge was pronounced by
                    Professor Mangili, in the university of Pavia, on the 12th November 1812.
                    (Cuvier, in <hi rend="italic">Biographie Universelle,</hi> vol. XV. 8. Par.

                    rend="italic">Gregory,</hi> a profound mathematician and natural philosopher,
                    younger brother of Felix Fontana, was born at Villa de Nogarola, near Roveredo,
                    on the 7th December 1735.</p>
                <p>He received the first rudiments of his education at Roveredo, and continued his
                    studies at Rome, where he entered into the <hi rend="italic">Scuole Pie,</hi>
                    and soon distinguished himselt by his talents and assiduity. He was entrusted
                    with the care of a part of the public instruction in the school called the
                    Collegio Nazareno, and was soon afterwards sent as a professor to Sinigaglia. It
                    was here that he formed an intimacy with the Marquis Fagnani, whose example and
                    assistance contributed very much to the advancement of his mathematical studies,
                    to which he very soon in a great measure confined his attention. He was then
                    removed by his superiors to Bologna; but his co-operation was found more
                    necessary for the pious schools which had lately been established at Milan, and
                    he there obtained the patronage and friendship of the Count de Firmian, the
                    Maecenas of the day, who greatly encouraged the publication of his first works.
                    From these works he acquired so much credit, that he was summoned in 1763 to
                    occupy the chair of logic and metaphysics in the university of Pavia; and he was
                    appointed by Firmian director of the public library which he founded about the
                    same time for the university. Two years afterwards he was advanced to the
                    professorship of the higher mathematics, which had become vacant by the death of
                    the celebrated Boscovich, and he filled this situation with high reputation for
                    thirty years. He was the author of a great variety of memoirs, and did not even
                    disdain the labour of a translator, when he thought that it could be useful to
                    Ins pupils or his countrymen; but he never engaged in any single original work
                    of great extent; for notwithstanding his habitual industry, his disposition was
                    too volatile to allow him to confine himself long enough to any one object to
                    effect any striking innovation in the complexion of the sciences which he
                    cultivated. He was assiduous in the duties of his professorship; and his
                    personal intercourse with society was extremely limited, though his
                    correspondence with men of science was extensive. He was in the habit of writing
                    many notes in the margin of the books that he read; and the volumes which
                    composed his <pb break="no" facs="nls:193754605" xml:id="kp-eb0709-4605-0719"
                    />library acquired a double value from this circumstance. In April 1795 he was
                    elected a foreign member of the Royal Society of London. About this time his
                    health began to decline, and his physicians considered him as having suffered
                    from too great application to his studies. In 1796 he received great marks of
                    respect from Bonaparte, then commanding the French army in Italy; and he was
                    made a member of the legislative body of the newly erected Cisalpine republic.
                    In 1800, having resigned the professorship at Pavia, he came to Milan, and was
                    afterwards nominated one of the Electoral College of the Dotti. He was still
                    occupied in a variety of literary pursuits, when he was attacked by a violent
                    fever, which caused his death at Milan, on the 24th August 1803. He left his
                    manuscripts to his brother Felix, who died soon after him. An unmarried sister
                    survived them both, and inherited the little property of her brothers, which was
                    soon exhausted, and she was reduced to the extremity of distress. At last,
                    finding no protection in a country to which her family had done so much honour,
                    she became desperate, and drowned herself in the canal of Milan.</p>
