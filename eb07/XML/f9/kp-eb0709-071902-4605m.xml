                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    rend="smallcaps">le</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Bovier de,</hi> was born at Rouen
                    on the 11th February 1657, and died at Paris on the 9th January 1757. It was
                    during this interval of time, comprehending an entire century, that the greatest
                    writers France has produced commenced or terminated their career; and amongst
                    these illustrious men, who were all either the friends, the enemies, or the
                    rivals of Fontenelle, none was more remarkable whilst living, or has been more
                    celebrated since his death. For this advantage he has been principally indebted
                    to the variety of his acquirements, the fineness of his genius, and the
                    versatility and grace of a talent peculiarly French, which seems to have
                    acquired its greatest perfection, and displayed itself in the happiest manner,
                    in the country which gave him birth, and in the age when he flourished.
                    Fontenelle received his education in the college of Jesuits at Rouen, where the
                    quickness and aptitude of his powers became conspicuous at a very early period.
                    When only thirteen years of age he commenced the study of rhetoric; and so rapid
                    was his progress, that in a note opposite his name on the register of the
                    college, he is described as <hi rend="italic">adolescens</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >omnibus</hi><hi rend="italic">partibus absolutus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">inter</hi><hi rend="italic">discipulos princeps.</hi>
                    At the desire of his father he studied the law; but as he lost the very first
                    cause in which he was employed as an advocate, he became disgusted with his
                    profession, and devoted himself entirely to literature and philosophy. He
                    composed a considerable part of the operas of <hi rend="italic">Psyche</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Bellerophon,</hi> which were printed under the name of his
                    uncle Thomas Corneille; and he also wrote a tragedy called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aspar,</hi> but as it did not succeed, he consigned the manuscript to the
                    flames, and never afterwards attempted that species of composition. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Dialogues des Morts</hi> were published in the year 1683, and well
                    received as a specimen of elegant composition, combining morality with the
                    charms of literature; in fact, this work laid the foundation of the great
                    reputation of Fontenelle. His <hi rend="italic">Lettres</hi><hi rend="italic">du
                    Chevalier d’Her,</hi> published in 1685, without his name, discovered much wit
                    and ingenuity, but at the same time no small share of affectation, and
                    obtained<pb break="no" facs="nls:193754618" xml:id="kp-eb0709-4618-0720"/> only
                    moderate success. But his <hi rend="italic">Entretiens sur la Pluralité des
                    Mondes</hi> has been regarded as one of his ablest performances, combining
                    science and philosophy with vivacity and humour, a talent which may be said to
                    belong almost exclusively to the French nation. It was universally read, and
                    translated into several foreign languages. In his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">des Oracles</hi> he supported the opinion that
                    oracles were forgeries, in opposition to those who contended that they were
                    supernatural operations of evil spirits, put to silence by the appearance of
                    Christ, and consequently exposed himself to much clerical animadversion. Le
                    Tellier denounced the book, and the Jesuit Baltus attempted to refute it; whilst
                    others, again, wrote as warmly in its defence, contending that the opinion
                    therein maintained was conformable to that of the most renowned theologians.
                    Fontenelle took no part in the dispute, but contented himself with writing to Μ.
                    Leclerc, “It belongs rather to Μ. Van-Daale than to me to answer on this
                    occasion; he is my guarantee, I am only his interpreter; and I have no objection
                    that the Devil should be a prophet since the Father Jesuit wishes it so, and
                    considers it the more orthodox opinion.” His Pastoral Poems, which appeared in
                    the year 1688, with a discourse on the nature of the eclogue, were very much
                    admired for their delicacy of sentiment, as was also his opera of Thetis and
                    Peleus; but his Aeneas and Lavinia was not so successful. In the year 1699
                    Fontenelle was chosen secretary of the Academy of Sciences, which office he held
                    during the long period of forty-two years. Whilst in this office he published
                    annually a volume of the history of that learned body, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">de l’</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Académie</hi><hi rend="italic">des Sciences,</hi> filled with analyses of
                    memoirs, and éloges on deceased members. Besides his labours as secretary, he
                    also made his contribution as an academician, by composing his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Géométrie</hi><hi rend="italic">de ī</hi><hi rend="italic">Infini,</hi> a work
                    of which he jocularly observed that there were only eight men in Europe in a
                    condition to understand it, and that the author was not one of the number. It
                    appears, however, that Fontenelle was by no means profound in the mathematics;
                    and hence, with the exception of a preface to the <hi rend="italic">Analyse
                    des</hi><hi rend="italic">Infiniment*</hi><hi rend="italic">Petits</hi> of
                    L’Hôpital, and a memoir on the extension of the property of the number <hi
                    rend="italic">nine,</hi> he produced no other works on the subject. As a poet,
                    Fontenelle did not rise above elegance and ingenuity; as a man of science, he
                    excelled in throwing light on the inventions of others, rather than in
                    discovering new truths himself; and as a general writer, he united solid sense
                    with the delicacy and refinement of a man of wit. He studied his own comfort as
                    much as most men, but never sacrificed to selfish gratification the duties of a
                    man of honour and of virtue. He had many friends, and towards the close of his
                    life scarcely a single enemy. He was never married, and, for a man of letters,
                    had acquired considerable affluence. Although of a delicate constitution, he
                    reached the age of ninety without any complaint except deafness; and died, as
                    already mentioned, on the 9th of January 1757, being within a few days of a
                    hundred years of age. When asked by a certain person how he could pass so easily
                    through the world, he replied, by virtue of two axioms, namely, that all is
                    possible, and that every one is in the right.</p>
                <p>There are only two complete editions of the works of Fontenelle; one in eleven
                    volumes 12mo, Paris, 1758, 1760; and the other in eight volumes 8vo, Paris,
                    Bastien, ] 790. In these editions are found the Prefaces and Eloges which form
                    part of the History of the Academy of Sciences; but they contain neither the
                    Analyses nor Ae <hi rend="italic">Géométrie</hi><hi rend="italic">de ĩ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Infini,</hi> which first appeared in 1727, 4to. The edition of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres Diverses,</hi> published at the Hague, 1728, 1729, is
                    much sought after on account of the engravings of Bernard Picard. But the work
                    of Fontenelle which has been most frequently reprinted is his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Entretien sur la Pluralité des Mondes.</hi> The first edition appeared in the
                    year 1686; but the sixth conversation, composed long afterwards, was only
                    printed in the edition of 1719. The principal other editions are that of Dijon,
                    Causse, 1793, in 8vo; that of Didot, 1796, in 4to; and that printed in 1800,
                    with the notes of Lalande, which is the best. In 1730 there appeared at Leipsic,
                    in 8vo, a German translation by Gottsched; in 1751, an Italian translation by
                    Vestrini, published at Arezzo; and there are three English translations, the
                    best of which was published in 1760, in 8vo.</p>
