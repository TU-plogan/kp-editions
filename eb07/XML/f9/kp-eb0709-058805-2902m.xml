                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                    rend="smallcaps">Julius,</hi> a Latin writer who flourished under the successors
                    of Constantine. About the year 345 he composed a work entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Erroribus Profanarum Religionum,</hi> which he
                    inscribed to Constantius and Constans, the sons of Constantine, and which is
                    happily still extant, accompanied with the annotations of John Wouver. To
                    Firmicus are also attributed eight books on astronomy, first printed by Aldus
                    Manutius in 1501, and reprinted several times since; but as this work contains
                    nothing relating to the true science of astronomy, and is filled with
                    astrological calculations, after the manner of the Babylonians and Egyptians,
                    Baronius doubts whether a good and pious Christian, as Firmicus is represented
                    to have been, could have indulged in such profane and impious speculations.
                    Cave, however, supposes that he might have written these books anterior to the
                    date of his conversion from Paganism; a supposition not incompatible with the
                    opinion of Baronius. Of the treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Errors of the
                    Profane Religions,</hi> the principal editions subsequent to that of Aldus are,
                    one printed at Strasburg in 1562, another at Heidelberg in 1599, and a third at
                    Paris in 1610, all in 8vo; but afterwards it was conjoined with Minucius Felix,
                    and printed at Amsterdam in 1645, at Leyden in 1652, and again at Leyden by
                    James Gronovius, in 1709, 8vo. It is likewise to be found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibliotheca Ραtrwn,</hi> and at the end of Cyprian, printed at
                    Paris in 1666. (Dupin; Cave; Moreri; Fabricius, <hi rend="italic">Bibl.

                    >Primogeniture.)</hi> In Scripture the term first-born is often used in a
                    figurative sense, to signify that which is first, most excellent, or most
                    distinguished in any thing. Thus it is said of Christ that he is “the first-born
                    of every creature ;” and in Revelation he is called “the first-begotten of the
                    dead,” that is, according to the commentators, begotten of the Father before any
                    creature was produced, and the first who rose from the dead by his o^n power.
                    “The first-born of the poor” signifies the most miserable of all the poor; and
                    in Job, “the first-born of death” means the most terrible of all deaths.</p>

                    rend="italic">(primitiae),</hi> amongst the Hebrews, oblations to God of part of
                    the fruits of the harvest, as an acknowledgment of his sovereign dominion. The
                    first of these fruits was offered in the name of the whole nation, being either
                    two loaves of bread, or a sheaf of barley which was thrashed in the court of the
                    temple. Every private person was obliged to bring to the temple his first
                    fruits, consisting of wheat, barley, grapes, figs, apricos, olives, and
                    dates.</p>
                <p>There was another kind of first fruits offered to God. When bread was kneaded in
                    a family, a portion of it “as set apart and given to the priest or Levite who
                    dwelt in the place; but if there was no priest or Levite there, it was cast into
                    the oven, and consumed by the fire. These offerings constituted a considerable
                    part of the revenues of the Hebrew priesthood.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> First</hi><hi rend="italic">Fruits</hi> are

                    of grapes and corn; which shows that this was die practice of the African
