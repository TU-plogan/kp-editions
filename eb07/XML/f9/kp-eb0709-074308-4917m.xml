                <p><label type="entry">FOREST</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Geography,</hi> a large
                    extent of ground covered with trees. The word is formed from the Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">foresta,</hi> which first occurs in the capitulars of Charlemagne,
                    and which is itself derived from the German <hi rend="italic">frost,</hi>
                    signifying the same thing. Spelman derives it from the Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >foris restat,</hi> by reason forests are out of towns. Others derive <hi
                    rend="italic">foresta</hi> from <hi rend="italic">feris,</hi> that is, <hi

                    as being a safe station or abode for wild beasts.</p>
                <p>The Caledonian and Hercynian forests are famous in history. The former was a
                    celebrated retreat of the ancient <pb break="no" facs="nls:193754930"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-4930-0744"/>Picts and Scots; and the latter, in Caesar’s time,
                    extended from the borders of Alsatia and Switzerland to Transylvania, being
                    computed at sixty days’ journey in length, and nine in breadth. The ancients
                    venerated forests, and imagined that a great part of their gods resided therein.
                    Temples were frequently built in the thickest forests, the gloom and silence of
                    which naturally inspire sentiments of devotion. For a similar reason the Druids
                    made forests the place of their residence, performing sacrifices, instructing
                    youth, and giving laws in their umbrageous recesses.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Forest,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Law,</hi> is defined, by
                    Manwood, a certain territory of woody grounds and fruitful pastures, privileged
                    for wild beasts and fowls of forest, chase, and warren, to rest and abide under
                    the protection of the king, for his princely delight; bounded with unremoveable
                    marks and meres, either known by matter of record or prescription; replenished
                    with wild beasts of venery or chase, with great coverts of vert for the said
                    beasts; and for preservation and continuance whereof, the vert and venison,
                    there are certain particular laws, privileges, and officers. Forests are of such
                    antiquity in England that, excepting the New Forest in Hampshire, erected by
                    William the Conqueror, and Hampton Court, erected by Henry VIII. it is said that
                    there is no record or history which makes any certain mention of their erection,
                    though they are mentioned by several writers and in several of our laws and
                    statutes. Ancient historians tell us that New Forest was raised by
                    thede-struction of twenty-two parish churches, and many villages, chapels, and
                    manors, for the space of thirty miles together, which was attended with divers
                    judgments on the posterity of William I. who erected it: for William Rufus was
                    there shot with an arrow, and before him Richard the brother of Henry I.; and
                    Henry, nephew to Robert, the eldest son of the conqueror, was, like Absalom,
                    suspended by the hair of the head in the boughs of the forest.</p>
                <p>A forest in the hands of a subject is properly the same thing as a cΛαse, being
                    subject to the common law, and not to the forest laws. But a chase differs from
                    a forest in this, that it is not enclosed, and likewise, that a man may have a
                    chase in another man’s ground as well as his own, that is, the liberty of
                    keeping beasts of chase or royal game therein, protected even from the owner of
                    the land, with a power of hunting them thereon.</p>
                <p>The manner of erecting a forest is this: Certain commissioners are appointed
                    under the great seal, who view the ground intended for a forest, and fence it
                    round; and this commission being returned into chancery, the king causes it to
                    be proclaimed throughout the country where the land lies, that it is a forest,
                    prohibiting all persons from hunting therein without his leave. Though the king
                    may erect a forest on his own ground and waste, he may not do it on the ground
                    of other persons without their consent; and agreements with them for that
                    purpose ought to be confirmed by parliament.</p>
                <p>A forest, strictly speaking, cannot be in the hands of any but the king; for no
                    person except the king has power to grant a commission to be justice in eyre of
                    the forest. Yet, if he grants a forest to a subject, and that on request made in
                    the chancery, such subject and his heirs shall have justices of the forest; in
                    which case the subject has a forest in law.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Forest-Lows,</hi> are peculiar laws, different from
                    the common law of England. Before the making of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Charta</hi><hi rend="italic">de Foresta,</hi> offences committed therein were
                    punished at the pleasure of the king in the severest manner. By this charter
                    many forests were disforested and stripped of their oppressive privileges, and
                    regulations were made for the government of those which remained; in particular,
                    killing the king’s deer was declared to be no longer a capital offence, but only
                    punishable by fine, imprisonment, or abjuration of the realm. Yet even in this
                    charter there were some grievous articles, which the clemency of later princes •
                    has since thought fit to alter <hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >assisas</hi><hi rend="italic">foresrae.</hi> And to , this day, in trespasses
                    relating to the forest, <hi rend="italic">voluntas repu∙</hi> 1 <hi
                    rend="italic">tabitur pro facto</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> so that if a man be
                    taken hunting a deer, . he may be arrested as if he had taken a deer.</p>
