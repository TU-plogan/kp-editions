                <p><label type="entry">FENELON, <hi rend="smallcaps">François de Salignac de
                    Lamotte</hi></label>, was descended of an ancient and illustrious family, and
                    born at the castle of Fénélon in Perigord, on the 6th of August 1651. Under the
                    eyes of a virtuous father, he advanced in his literary studies with equal
                    rapidity and success; and being from childhood nurtured in classical antiquity,
                    and in particular familiarised in his solitude with the master pieces of Grecian
                    genius, his taste was formed on the purest models, whilst his benign genius was
                    simultaneously developed. Called to Paris by his uncle, the Marquis of Fénélon,
                    to complete his philosophical studies, and commence the course of theology
                    requisite for the vocation to which he was destined, he, at the age of fifteen,
                    underwent the same trial as Bossuet, and preached before an auditory, less
                    distinguished, perhaps, than that which assembled in the hôtel de Rambouillet,
                    but still highly respectable, who listened to him with a mixture of surprise and
                    admiration. But this premature reputation rather alarmed than gratified the
                    Marquis of Fénélon, who, in order to withdraw the young apostle from the
                    seductions of the world and of glory, placed him in the seminary of St Sulpice∙
                    In this retreat Fénélon imbibed the evangelical spirit, and acquired the
                    friendship of the virtuous Tronson, the superior of the establishment; and here
                    also he received holy orders. About this time his religious fervour inspired him
                    with the design of devoting himself to the missions in Canada. But being
                    thwarted in this scheme by the apprehensions of his family and the weakness of
                    his constitution, he soon turned his regards towards the missions of the Levant,
                    particularly Greece, where the sacred and the profane, St Paul and Socrates, the
                    church of Corinth, the Parthenon, and Parnassus, equally invited his poetical
                    and religious imagination. Fortunately for the Catholic church and for France,
                    however, this project also misgave; and Fénélon, diverted from distant missions,
                    devoted himself to an apostleship, which he thought not less useful, namely, the
                    instruction of the <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles Catholiques,</hi> or
                    newly-converted women in Paris. The duties and cares of this employment, in
                    which he buried his genius during ten years, prepared him for the composition of
                    his first work, entitled <hi rend="italic">Traite</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    lEducation</hi><hi rend="italic">des Filles,</hi> a masterpiece of delicacy and
                    of reason, which has not been equalled by the author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Emile</hi> and painter of Sophie. This work was intended for the Duchess of
                    Beauvilliers, the pious mother of a numerous family. In the modest obscurity of
                    his ministry, Fénélon had already formed with the Dukes of Beauvilliers and of
                    Chevreuse that virtuous friendship which resisted equally the seductions of
                    favour and the frowns of disgrace, the smiles of the court and the decree of
                    exile. But in the case of Bossuet he met with an attachment which was destined
                    to be much less durable. Admitted into familiarity with this great man, Fénélon
                    studied his genius and his life; and the example of Bossuet, whose polemical
                    religion exercised itself in controversies and conversions, probably suggested
                    to him the <hi rend="italic">Traite du Ministère</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Pasteurs,</hi> a work in which he combats the heretics with a moderation which
                    formed no part of the character of his illustrious model. The subject, the merit
                    of this work, and the all-powerful suffrage of Bossuet in its favour, induced
                    Louis XIV. to confide toFénélon thecharge of a new mission to Poitou. The
                    rigorous uniformity which the French monarch was desirous of establishing in
                    matters of religion, and the resistance which sprung from the oppressive
                    measures adopted for this purpose, often obliged the monarch to cause his
                    missionaries be supported by troops. Fénélon, however, not only rejected
                    peremptorily the co-operation of the dragoons, but even reserved to himself the
                    choice of the ecclesiastical colleagues who should share with him in the
                    ministry of persuasion and gentleness. He converted without persecuting, and
                    made the faith of which he was the apostle an object o love instead of hatred.
                    The importance which was then attached to such missions fixed all eyes upon
                    Fenelon, who had so happily acquitted himself of that entrusted to his care. . .
                    ,</p>
                <p>A great object was now presented to his ambition an his talents. The dauphin,
                    grandson of Louis XIV., <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193751823" xml:id="kp-eb0709-1823-0505"/>at length passed the period
                    of childhood, and the king was looking out for a person to whom the education of
                    the young prince might be confided. This was in the year 1689. By the favour of
                    Madame de Maintenon, virtue obtained the preference in this appointment. Μ. de
                    Beauvilliers was named governor, and he recommended to the king Fénélon as
                    preceptor of the young prince. These virtuous friends, seconded by the
                    attentions of men worthy of imitating them, commenced the task of educating the
                    future king; and history attests that there was never seen a more perfect
                    concurrence of principle and exertion. But Fénélon, by the natural superiority
                    of his genius, formed the soul of this reunion; it was he who, transported by
                    the hope of one day realizing the <hi rend="italic">beau ideal</hi> of a prince
                    on the throne, and viewing the happiness of France as in a great measure
                    dependent on the education of its future sovereign, destroyed with admirable art
                    all the dangerous germs which nature and the premature sentiment of power had
                    implanted in his youthful breast, and gradually moulded an almost indomitable
                    character to the habit of the most salutary virtues. This system of education,
                    precious vestiges of which remain in some of the writings of Fénélon, appears to
                    have been a masterpiece of that genius which devotes itself to advance the
                    happiness of mankind. When brought into the midst of the court, Fénélon, without
                    intermingling in its intrigues, secured general admiration by the graces of his
                    brilliant and ready wit, and the charm of his noble and eloquent conversation.
                    In his character the apostle and the great lord seemed to be strangely united.
                    Imagination and genius escaped him on all occasions; and the most refined
                    politeness at once embellished and rendered pardonable in the eyes of courtiers,
                    the ascendency of his talents. This personal superiority indeed excited much
                    more admiration than even the writings which proceeded from his pen, and, at the
                    period of his reception in the Academy, was made the subject of eloquent
                    commendation. “On sent,” says La Bruyère, writing of him soon afterwards, “la
                    force et l’ascendant de ce rare esprit, soit qu’il prêche de génie et sans
                    préparation, soit qu’il prononce un discours étudié et oratoire, soit qu’il
                    explique ses pensées dans la conversation; toujours maitre de l’oreille et du
                    coeur de ceux qui l’écoutent, il ne leur permet pas d’envier ni tant
                    d’élévation, ni tant de faculté de délicatesse de politesse.” This ascendency of
                    virtue, of grace, and of genius, which excited in the hearts of the friends of
                    Fénélon a tenderness mixed with enthusiasm, and which had even won Madame de
                    Maintenon, in spite of her distrust and reserve, proved altogether unavailing
                    against the prepossessions of Louis XIV. This monarch no doubt esteemed the man
                    to whom he had confided the education of his grandson, but he never had any
                    relish for his society. It is supposed indeed that the brilliant and ready
                    elocution of Fénélon was distasteful to Louis, intolerant as he was of any sort
                    of pre-eminence except his own. But if we cast our eyes on the letter in which
                    Fénélon, in an expansion of confidence, informed Madame de Maintenon “that Louis
                    XIV. had no idea of his duties as a king,” we shall probably find, in the
                    expression of this honest but uncourtly opinion, a better explanation of the
                    aversion of a monarch accustomed to adulation, than in any supposed jealousy of
                    the superiority of his conversational powers. Fénélon passed five years in the
                    eminent situation of preceptor to the dauphin, without asking or receiving
                    anything; and, indeed, during his residence at court he had preserved the most
                    irreproachable disinterestedness. Louis XIV. however, who knew how to recompense
                    merit, <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> 'en though its possessor might not be
                    personally agreeable to himself, wished to repair this oversight, and, in 1694,
                    named Fénélon Archbishop of Cambrai.</p>
                <p>But at this moment of favour and prosperity his credit <hi rend="superscript">
                    ¾as</hi> destined to receive a blow, which would have inflicted a mortal wound
                    on a less inviolable reputation. Fénélon, whose natural temperament disposed him
                    to cherish a lively and spiritual devotion, had for some time fancied that he
                    recognised some of his own principles in the mouth of a pious mad woman, who,
                    not doubt, had great talents for peisuasion, since she obtained an extraordinary
                    influence over several superior minds. Madame Guyon, writing and discoursing on
                    grace and on pure love, at first persecuted and arrested, soon afterwards
                    admitted into the intimate society of the Duke of Beauvilliers, received by
                    Madame de Maintenon, and authorized to disseminate her doctrine in St Cyr, then
                    suspected by Bossuet, arrested of new, interrogated, and condemned, served as a
                    pretext for the disgrace of Fénélon. The inexorable Bossuet, who loved not the
                    mystical subtilties and refinements concerning divine love, with which the
                    lively and tender imagination of Fénélon was captivated, wished to bring it
                    about that the new Archbishop of Cambrai should himself condemn the errors of a
                    woman who had been his friend. Fénélon, however, refused, both from conscience
                    and delicacy, to gratify his antagonist in this particular. Fearing to
                    compromise opinions which were dear to him, wishing to manage and restrain an
                    unfortunate woman, whose only offence appeared to consist in some venial
                    exaggeration about the love of God, and perhaps also shocked at the theological
                    haughtiness of Bossuet, who pressed upon him as if for the purpose of
                    proselytism, he stood upon the defensive, and published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Maximes des Saintes,</hi> which may be regarded as an indirect apology for, or
                    even as a subdued exposition of, the principles of Madame Guyon. In an age when
                    a religious opinion was a political event, the first appearance of this work
                    excited murmurs of astonishment; and all those who had been secretly envious of
                    the genius and the promotion of Fénélon, declared loudly against the errors of
                    his theology. Bossuet, a man incapable of indulging mean or unworthy sentiments,
                    but at the same time inflexible, impatient of contradiction, and regardless of
                    all external observances, when he believed the faith to be compromised,
                    denounced to Louis XIV. in the midst of his court, the alleged heresy of the
                    Archbishop of Cambrai; and at the moment when this attack was made upon Fénélon,
                    the burning of his palace at Cambrai, and the consequent loss of his library,
                    manuscripts, and papers, put his patience to a new trial, yet only drew from him
                    the touching remark, “It is better that the fire should have consumed my
                    dwelling than the cottage of a poor labourer.” Nevertheless Bossuet, committed
                    by his declaration to the king, prepared to pursue his rival, and seemed eager
                    to extort from him a recantation; whilst, on the other hand, Madame de
                    Maintenon, hitherto the friend and protectress of Fénélon, treated him with the
                    greatest coldness. In the mean time Fénélon submitted his book to the judgment
                    of the holy see. Bossuet, however, having already composed remarks, in which
                    bitter and vehement censure is surrounded with ostentatious expressions of
                    friendship and regret, proposed a conference; but this Fénélon declined,
                    preferring to defend his book at the tribunal to which he had appealed. It was
                    then that he received orders to quit the court and retire into his diocese; a
                    circumstance which occasioned great grief to the Duke of Burgundy. The cabal
                    wished to profit by the fall of Fénélon to overthrow the Duke of Beauvilliers;
                    but the latter was saved by his own virtuous conduct; for his devotion to the
                    cause his unfortunate friend interested the generosity of Louis XIV. and their
                    design miscarried. Notwithstanding the evident desne of this monarch, however,
                    the court of Rome hesitated to condemn an archbishop so illustrious as Fenelon∙
                    But thy repugnance evinced by Innocent VI1I∙ only served to stimulate the
                    talents of the accuser and accused; and, whilst <pb break="no"

                    consisting of ten cardinals) remained undecided, the writings of the two
                    adversaries succeeded one another with prodigious rapidity. The contest had, in
                    fact, now changed its character. After having exhausted the dogma, Bossuet threw
                    himself upon the facts; and the <hi rend="italic">Relation</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >du Quiétisme,</hi> written with equal spirit and malignity, seemed calculated
                    to involve Fénélon in a portion of the ridicule which inseparably attached to
                    Madame Guyon. The Abbé Bossuet, an unworthy nephew of the Bishop of Meaux,
                    extended still further these personal inculpations, and, having collected some
                    odious rumours, sought to impeach the purity of Fénélon’s character. Never did
                    the indignation of a virtuous and calumniated spirit display itself in greater
                    eloquence. Fénélon, in his defence, demolished these vile accusations; and it
                    required new letters from Louis XIV. prepared by Bossuet, and new intrigues,
                    carried even to the extent of menace, to extort from the court of Rome a
                    reluctant condemnation, which, when obtained, was found to be softened both in
                    the form and in the expressions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    France more irrecoverable than ever. When the brief, so long delayed, and
                    obtained after so much discussion and intrigue, at length arrived in 1699,
                    Fénélon hastened to subscribe it, and to ratify his own condemnation by a
                    mandatory letter, conceived in the most touching and simple language, although
                    Bossuet did not fail to discover in it much parade and ambiguity.<note

                <p>The modest submission of Fénélon, his silence, his episcopal virtues, and the
                    admiration which these had inspired, would not, in all probability, have
                    re-opened to him the doors of the court of Louis XIV.; but an unexpected event,
                    which occurred at this time, served to irritate that monarch more than ever
                    against him. The <hi rend="italic">Télémaque,</hi> composed several years
                    previously during the period of his favour, was published some months after the
                    affair about Quietism, through the infidelity of a domestic who had been
                    employed to transcribe the manuscript, and who, it appears, had contrived to
                    take a copy for himself. The work, though suppressed in France, was reproduced
                    by the presses of Holland, and obtained throughout all Europe a success which
                    malignity rendered injurious to Louis XIV., by seeking in it allusions to the
                    conquests and misfortunes of his reign. This prince, who had always disliked the
                    political notions of Fénélon, and had even described him as “un bel esprit
                    chimérique,” regarded the author of <hi rend="italic">Télémaque</hi> as a
                    detractor of his glory, who to the guilt of ingratitude added the more
                    irritating injustice of satire. There cannot be a greater absurdity, however,
                    than to construe this production as a political satire, or to seek in it for
                    allegorical and premeditated censure of Louis XIV.; all the details being, in
                    fact, combined in the best manner imaginable for disconcerting allusions, and
                    avoiding as much as possible the inevitable fatality of resemblances. We are
                    convinced indeed that this generous precaution ocču-pied the mind of Fénélon
                    whilst composing the work, and that, writing for the happiness of nations, he
                    selected those primitive manners, and antique forms of society, which are the
                    most remote from the picture of life presented by modern Europe, but which
                    served equally well to embody his poetical conception, and to suggest those
                    instructive lessons which it was his grand object to inculcate. .Besides, why
                    should he have thought of representing Louis XIV. under the character of the
                    imprudent Idomeneus, or that of the sacrilegious Adrastus, rather than under the
                    masterly delineation of the great and virtuous Sesostris?</p>
                <p>Fénélon, however, soon learned the indelible impression which <hi rend="italic"
                    >Télémaque</hi> had produced upon the heart of the <hi rend="underline"
                    >king</hi>; and, resigned to his banishment from court, which he had sometimes
                    the weakness to call his disgrace, he sought to console himself for the loss of
                    the royal favour by endeavouring to diffuse happiness around him in his retreat
                    at Cambrai. The sanctity of the ancient bishops, the severity of the primitive
                    church, the attraction of the most indulgent virtue, the charm of the most
                    captivating politeness, the utmost eagerness to fulfil even the humblest duties
                    of the ministry, indefatigable goodness, inexhaustible charity; such are the
                    traits of Fénélon’s character as delineated by an eloquent and virtuous prelate,
                    who knew him well, and who dwells with enthusiasm on the picture which he has
                    drawn of his illustrious friend. The first care of Fénélon was to instruct the
                    clergy of a seminary which he had founded; nor did he even disdain to teach
                    their catechism to the children of his diocese. Like the bishops of ancient
                    days, he often ascended the pulpit of his cathedral, and, trusting at once to
                    his faith and his feelings, spoke without preparation, diffusing all the
                    treasures of his natural eloquence. When the misfortunes of the war, which
                    chastised the ambition of Louis XIV., brought the allied army into the diocese
                    of Cambrai, the occasion called for new efforts and new sacrifices upon the part
                    of the good archbishop, who, by his wisdom, his firmness, and the nobleness of
                    his language, inspired the hostile commanders with a salutary respect for the
                    unfortunate provinces of Flanders. Marlborough and Eugène indeed were worthy of
                    listening to the voice of the great man whose genius and worth they so well
                    appreciated.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is now

                <p>The situation of Cambrai on the frontiers of France attracted to the
                    archiepiscopal residence many strangers, none of whom approached or quitted its
                    lord without being affected with a‘sort of religious admiration. Not tomention
                    Ramsay, who passed several years under his roof, the celebrated Marshal Munich,
                    and the unfortunate Chevalier de St George, called James HL, experienced the
                    delight of his society, and derived instruction from his superior sagacity. By
                    the wise counsels which he gave to James III., Fénélon showed his high esteem
                    for the English constitution, powerful alike against despotism on the one hand,
                    and anarchy on the other. The archbishop was exempt from that narrow patriotism
                    which undervalues whatever exists beyond the frontiers. His virtuous and
                    benevolent spirit <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751849"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-1849-0507"/>concerned itself for the welfare of the whole
                    human family. ' « I love my family,” said he, “better than myself; I love my
                    country better than my family; but I love the human race better than my
                    country.” The humanity of Fénélon was not, however, confined to exaggerated
                    speculations and impracticable generalities, which always suppose great
                    ignorance of the details of human affairs. His politics were not the dream of a
                    virtuous but fanciful mind. He had seen and judged both the court dnd the world;
                    he was acquainted with the history of all ages; and he was endowed with an
                    independence of spirit which raised him above the prejudices of his age and
                    nation. In the different memoirs which he addressed to the Duke of Beauvilliers
                    may be seen proofs of the wisdom of his views respecting the greatest interests,
                    particularly the succession to the throne of Spain, the policy best suited to
                    Philip V., the views of the allies, the conduct of the war, and the necessity of
                    peace. The disastrous war of the succession having brought the theatre of action
                    near to the archiepiscopal residence of Fénélon, afforded him an opportunity,
                    after ten years’ absence, of seeing the young prince whom he had formed, and who
                    had just assumed the command of the French troops. It cannot be disguised,
                    however, that, in the command of armies, the pupil of Fénélon fell far below the
                    promise of his youth and the opinion of France respecting him. The letters of
                    the archbishop to the Duke of Burgundy, at this decisive epoch, evince a severe
                    frankness, and show the ascendency which the master had acquired over the mind
                    of the scholar; so much so, indeed, as to create a suspicion that the young
                    prince, though well informed, docile, and virtuous, was of too timid a genius.
                    In these letters also severe judgments are pronounced on all the generals who
                    then formed the hope of France. Fené-Ion, in fact, though he possessed great
                    sweetness of disposition, had not a little of domination in his character. His
                    ideas were absolute and decisive; the promptitude and force of his mind rendered
                    his judgments energetic and inflexible. But the continual attention which he
                    gave to the political interests of France in no degree diminished his zeal for
                    the affairs of religion and the church; and those who have been accustomed to
                    honour him as a philosopher, will perhaps be surprised to find him entering into
                    all ecclesiastical discussions with an ardour equal to that of Bossuet himself.
                    When the unfortunate disputes about Jansenism were, after a long interruption,
                    revived, Fénélon wrote against men “vho did not imitate him in his respect for
                    the court of Rome, and he soon found himself engaged in a controversy scarcely
                    less animated than that which had taken place concerning Quietism.</p>
                <p>The courtiers supposed that in acting thus Fénélon had views of ambition and
                    flattery. But if he had desired to regain the favour of the sovereign, he
                    employed, about the same period, a much more effectual method for accomplishing
                    his object, by feeding at his own expense the whole French army during the
                    disastrous winter of 1709. His aim m both cases was to serve religion and his
                    country. The same sentiments dictated the view which he presented the following
                    year of the evils of France, and also the project ff associating the nation with
                    the government, by convoking an assembly of the notables, a proposition
                    remarkable m itself, and still more so when considered in connection with
                    subsequent events. In the memoir which contains the exposition of this scheme,
                    Fénélon shows that he had rightly estimated the strength and the weakness of
                    despotism, as well as the salutary power of liberty. Meanwhile, an unexpected
                    event appeared to accelerate the moment when the counsels of Fénélon were to
                    govern France. The grand dauphin died, and the Duke of Burgundy, long oppressed
                    by the mediocrity of his father, saw himself all once brought close to the
                    throne of which he was heir, and to the king, whose stay and support he now
                    became. His virtues, freed from a jealous tutelage, had at length scope for
                    action; and the pupil of Fénélon showed himself worthy of his master. Full of
                    hope and joy, the latter wrote to the young prince, who, according to St Simon,
                    reigned in advance, “Il ne faut pas que tous soient à un seul, mais un.seul doit
                    etre a tous pour faire leur bonheur ;” language which, we believe, has but
                    rarely been addressed to the heirs apparent of thrones. But whilst Fénélon was
                    devising plans for promoting the welfare of France, and advancing the glory of
                    its future sovereign, all his hopes were blasted by the sudden death of the
                    young heir of the old king, who remained unshaken amidst all the humiliations of
                    his glory, and all the disasters of his family. Fénélon survived this event some
                    time, and, notwithstanding his grief, laboured to prevent the evils incident to
                    a long and inevitable minority. In several confidential memoirs which he wrote
                    on this subject, we discover the novelty of his political views, and that spirit
                    of liberty which, in his age, was not the least of its innovations. One of these
                    papers is devoted to a discussion of the probabilities of the guilt of the Duke
                    of Orleans, and whether he was actuated by an ambition which required other
                    crimes besides that which had been laid to his charge; a memoir in which,
                    without dwelling upon all the horrors of the popular reports, he judges severely
                    the scandalous profligacy of the Duke of Orleans, and condemns his vices in the
                    tone and language which it became a Christian bishop to assume. The last public
                    discussion in which Fénélon engaged related to the bull <hi rend="italic"
                    >Unigenitus,</hi> which, as is well known, gave rise to much controversy, and
                    occupied his attention towards the close of his life. Malignity has supposed
                    that the zeal of Fénélon in this matter was sharpened by an old grudge against
                    the Cardinal de Noailles; but when the conduct of this virtuous and excellent
                    man seems to be authorized by his duty, it is not necessary to explain it by
                    reference to his alleged weaknesses. Faithful above all things to his episcopal
                    character, he conceived himself bound to combat errors which he considered as
                    calculated to disturb the consciences of men, and to interrupt the repose of the
                    church. But his wine of life was now upon the lees. His friends, like the
                    travellers on the bridge in the Vision of Mirza, had dropped off one by one,
                    till the Duke of Beauvilliers alone remained to him; and when the latter was
                    also removed by death, Fénélon followed him to the grave at the brief interval
                    of four months. This great and good man expired on the 7th January 1715, at the
                    age of sixty-four; and his death, which a slight fall had accelerated, was, like
                    his life, that of a virtuous and exemplary Christian bishop. In the <hi
