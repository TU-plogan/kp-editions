                <p>SECTION I.</p>
                <p>INTRODUCTION.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> determination of the figure and dimensions of the
                    earth is a problem of very great importance in astronomy, inasmuch as it is in
                    reference to the earth’s diameter that the distances of the planets from the sun
                    and from each other are estimated. It is also a problem of very great interest
                    and curiosity; and has accordingly attracted the attention of mankind since the
                    earliest dawn of civilization.</p>
                <p>There are two points of view under which this great question may be considered.
                    The figure of the earth may be regarded as a fact to be determined by
                    investigation and experience, like any other phenomenon or law of nature; in
                    which case it is necessary to find, by the actual measurement and comparison of
                    different portions of the terrestrial surface, the nature of its curvature, and
                    the magnitude of its diameters. Under the second point of view, the question is
                    one of pure theory. The earth may be regarded as a congeries of material
                    particles, attracting each other with forces reciprocally proportional to their
                    mutual distances, and endowed with a rotatory motion about a fixed axis; and the
                    problem is to determine the form the whole mass would assume in virtue of the
                    attractive and centrifugal forces by which the particles are impelled. Viewed in
                    this light, the actual figure of the earth becomes one of the series of
                    consequences resulting from the universal gravitation of matter, and depending
                    on the same laws which regulate its motion in its orbit about the sun.</p>
                <p>It would be a waste of time to inquire what were the notions of the figure of the
                    earth which were or might have been entertained by its earliest and most
                    ignorant inhabitants. A very slight attention to the most common phenomena
                    renders the fact of its general roundness almost palpable to the senses. The
                    uniform level appearance of the sensible horizon in every situation in which a
                    spectator can be placed,—the depression of the circumpolar stars as he advances
                    toward the south, and their elevation as he proceeds in a contrary
                    direction,—the disappearance of a ship standing out to sea,—the projection of
                    the earth as seen in a lunar eclipse,—and a number of other familiar
                    appearances,—put the globular figure of our planet beyond all manner of doubt.
                    Reasoning from such appearances, the earliest astronomers universally regarded
                    the earth as a sphere; and their attention was solely directed, in their various
                    measurements and computations, to ascertain its dimensions. Modern science has
                    discovered that its figure deviates slightly from that of a sphere, being
                    compressed or flattened at the extremities of its axis of rotation; and the
                    object of the astronomer, at the present time, is to determine not only its
                    dimensions, but also the exact amount of its compression.</p>
                <p>Attempts to estimate the magnitude of the earth were made at a very early date;
                    for Aristotle relates that the mathematicians prior to his time had found the
                    circumference to be 400,000 stadia. But Eratosthenes appears to have been the
                    first who entertained an accurate idea of the principles on which the
                    determination of the figure of the earth really depends, and attempted to reduce
                    these principles to practice. His results, in consequence of the imperfect data
                    from which they were deduced, were very inaccurate; but his method is the same
                    as that which is followed at the present day, depending, in fact, on the
                    comparison of a line actually measured on the surface of the earth with the
                    corresponding celestial arc. He had remarked, or been informed, that at Syene in
                    Upper Egypt, on the day of the summer solstice, at noon, objects cast no
                    shadows; whence he concluded that the sun was exactly in the zenith at mid-day.
                    On the same day at Alexandria he observed the sun’s meridional distance from the
                    zenith to be 7° 12', or a fiftieth part of the circumference. Then, assuming
                    Syene to be exactly under the meridian of Alexandria (the error in this
                    assumption was about 3°), and the distance between the two places, measured in a
                    straight line, to be 5000 stadia, he had 5000 × 50 = 250,000 stadia for the
                    whole circumference of the earth. It is easy to see how very imperfect this
                    operation must have been. Without mentioning smaller errors, the neglect of the
                    solar diameter would alone occasion an uncertainty as to the sun’s declination,
                    and consequently as to the length of the celestial arc, amounting to half a
                    degree on the observation at Syene; and there is no reason to suppose that that
                    at Alexandria was more exact. The terrestrial distance between the two places
                    was assumed on equally, or probably still more loose and inaccurate
                    determinations.</p>
                <p>The next attempt to ascertain the dimensions of the earth was made by Posidonius.
                    This astronomer adopted a method which differed from that of Eratosthenes only
                    in determining the celestial arc by means of the altitude of a star, instead of
                    the sun’s zenith distance. At Rhodes the bright star Canopus, when on the
                    meridian, barely appears above the horizon. At Alexandria the same star was
                    observed to have a meridional altitude of a quarter of a sign, or seven and a
                    half degrees, which, therefore, was the celestial arc intercepted between the
                    zenith of Alexandria and Rhodes. The terrestrial distance between the two places
                    was estimated, like that between Alexandria and Syene, at 5000 stadia, and they
                    were both supposed to be under the same meridian. Hence, since seven and a half
                    degrees is the forty-eighth of the circumference, we have 5000 × 48 = 240,000
                    stadia, for the whole circumference of the globe.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to form any correct opinion of the degree of approximation
                    attained in these ancient measures, as the length of the stadium is not known
                    with any certainty. That it varied in different places, and at diflerent times,
                    is sufficiently obvious from the statement of Ptolemy, who, in his work on
                    geography, assigns the length of the degree at 500 stadia, and consequently the
                    whole circumference at 180,000, differing from the determination of Posidonius
                    in the proportion of three to four, and still more from that of Eratosthenes.
                    Ptolemy remarked that it was not necessary <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> that
                    the line measured should lie exactly in the meridian: it was sufficient to know
                    its inclination to the meridian, or the azimuthal angle, together with the
                    latitudes of its extreme points, in order to compare it with the meridional arc.
                    The determination of the azimuth is, however, an operation of considerable
                    difficulty; and Ptolemy has given no details of the metho by which he proposed
                    to estimate it. He has been equa-ly silent in respect of the means by which the
                    mean length of a degree was ascertained to be 500 stadia, so that t <hi
                    rend="superscript"> e</hi> result which he has recorded is still less
                    satisfactory t an those of the two more ancient astronomers.</p>
                <p>The active curiosity of the Arabians, which was <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> *
                    <hi rend="superscript"> erte</hi> so successfully in promoting practical
                    astronomy, did no <pb break="no" facs="nls:193752369"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-2369-0547"/>overlook the measure of the earth. The Caliph
                    Almamoun, who began his reign in the year 814, ordered a company of astronomers
                    to measure a degree on the level plain of Mesopotamia. Dividing themselves into
                    two parties, the one proceeded northward, and the other southward, in the
                    direction of the meridian, through a degree of latitude, and measured with rods
                    the itinerary distance as they proceeded. The perfect agreement of their
                    conclusion with that of Ptolemy throws it open to great suspicion; and when it
                    is considered that their operation was repeated at a different place, with
                    exactly the same result, there can be no doubt that they blindly adopted the
                    statement of the Greek astronomer, either from inability to execute the task
                    assigned to them, or because they had no confidence in their own determination.
                    ^</p>
                <p>From the time of Almamoun, the problem of determining the dimensions of the earth
                    was neglected, till the revival of astronomy with general learning in Europe.
                    The first attempt to solve it was made by Fernel, who, about the middle of the
                    sixteenth century, measured the distance from Paris to Amiens along the high
                    road, by observing the number of revolutions made by his coach-wheel in the
                    journey between these two cities. Supposing them to be under the same meridian,
                    which is nearly true, and having ascertained the difference of their latitudes,
                    Fernel found by this means the length of the degree to be 57,070 French toises,
                    or about 364,960 English feet. A degree was measured long afterwards at the same
                    place by Lacaille, in a far more adequate and scientific manner, and he found it
                    to be 57,074 toises. This agreement is rendered less extraordinary by the
                    circumstance that the toise of Fernel was not exactly of the same length as that
                    of Lacaille. After all, it must be allowed that Fernel made a fortunate guess.
                    (Delambre, <hi rend="italic">Astronomie,</hi> tom. iii. chap. xXxv.)</p>
                <p>But the first who had the merit of attempting to execute the geodetic operations
                    that are indispensably necessary to effect the accurate measurement of a long
                    line on the surface of the earth, was Willebrord Snell, a native of Holland, and
                    a teacher of mathematics. Having established a chain of triangles between
                    Alkmaer and Bergen-op-Zoom, and observed the angles of each triangle by means of
                    a quadrant of five and a half feet radius, he measured a base on the frozen
                    surface of the meadows between Leyden and the village of Soeterwoud, and
                    determined the distance between the two places by trigonometrical computation.
                    The length of the degree which he found was 28,500 Rynland feet, or about 55,020
                    toises, which is about 2050 toises too small. This result was published by
                    Muschenbroek, who in fact revised or calculated the observations from the
                    original papers a century after the death of Snell.</p>
                <p>Norwood in the year 1635 attempted to measure a degree in England nearly in the
                    same manner as Fernel. He measured the distance between London and York along
                    the public road, taking the bearings and reducing the direction to the meridian
                    in a rough way. The difference of latitudes he found by observations of the
                    solstice to be 2° 28', and thence concluded the length of the degree to be
                    367,176 English feet. Like the measurement of Fernel, this has been found to be
                    a much nearer approximation than the method employed would have led ŋs to
                    expect.</p>
                <p>The application of the telescope to circular instruments gave a far higher degree
                    of precision to geodetic operations. Picard, to whom practical astronomy is
                    indebted for this capital improvement, was the first who measured an arc of the
                    meridian with such precautions and care as the delicate nature of the operation
                    requires. With a standard scale he measured a base of about six English <hi
                    rend="superscript"> πu</hi> * <hi rend="superscript"> es</hi> in length; and
                    observed the angles of his triangles with a quadrant, having a telescope adapted
                    to it with cross wires in its focus. He even calculated the error’ produced by
                    the instrument being placed out of the centre or the station, and determined the
                    zenith distance of a star in the constellation Cassiopeia with a sector, for the
                    purpose of obtaining the differences of latitude. The distance between Amiens
                    and Malvoisine was found to be 78,850 toises, and the difference of latitude 1°
                    22' 55", whence the result gave for the degree at Amiens 57,060 toises; but as
                    the aberration and nutation were unknown at that time, and the refraction was
                    not taken into account, causes of error to which it is indispensably necessary
                    to have regard,—a determination which agrees so nearly with the results of
                    recent measures could only have arisen from a fortunate compensation of errors.
                    In fact, his toise was somewhat shorter than that which has since been adopted
                    as the standard; and the error occasioned by this circumstance nearly
                    compensated that which was committed in determining the celestial arc, so that
                    in recalculating all the observations, the degree is found to be very nearly the
                    same as was found by Picard.</p>
                <p>Hitherto geodetic operations had been confined to the determination of the
                    magnitude of the earth; but a discovery made by Richer turned the attention of
                    mathematicians to its deviation from the spherical form. This astronomer having
                    been sent, by the Academy of Sciences of Paris, to the island of Cayenne in
                    South America, for the purpose of determining the amount of terrestrial
                    refraction, and other astronomical objects, observed that his clock, which had
                    been regulated at Paris to beat seconds, lost about two minutes and a half daily
                    at Cayenne, and that, in order to bring it to measure mean solar time, it was
                    necessary to shorten the pendulum by more than a line. This fact, which appeared
                    exceedingly curious, and was scarcely credited till it had been confirmed by the
                    subsequent observations of Varin and Deshayes, was first explained in the third
                    book of the Principia, by Newton, who showed that it could only be referred to a
                    diminution of gravity arising from one of two causes—a protuberance of the
                    equatorial parts of the earth, and consequent increase of the distance from the
                    centre, or from the counteracting effect of the centrifugal force, occasioned by
                    the rotation of the earth. The former could not, on any reasonable supposition
                    regarding the figure of the earth, be regarded as adequate to produce the
                    effect; but the latter, which would produce a retardation of the pendulum at
                    Cayenne in the ratio of the square of the sine of 6° to that of 49° (the
                    respective latitudes of Cayenne and Paris), might amount to 1∙46 seconds. This
                    was the first direct proof that had been obtained of the diurnal rotation of the
                    earth.</p>
                <p>From this time the exact determination of the figure of the earth began to assume
                    a degree of importance which had not formerly attached to it. The centrifugal
                    force arising from the diurnal rotation completely set aside the idea of perfect
                    sphericity. Newton, assuming that the earth had been originally fluid, and
                    supposing its density to be the same throughout the whole mass, and supposing
                    moreover that its constituent molecules attract one another in proportion to the
                    inverse square of the distance, demonstrated that it would assume, in
                    consequence of the rotation, the form of a spheroid flattened at the poles; and
                    that the proportion of its equatorial to its polar axis would be 230 to 231. But
                    the supposition of the equal density of the earth is obviously very improbable,
                    and consequently the ratio of the equatorial and polar diameters must be
                    different from that now mentioned. Newton erroneously concluded that if the
                    density is greater in the interior of the earth than at the centre, the
                    compression would be greater than in the case of a spheroid of equal density<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193752382" xml:id="kp-eb0709-2382-0548"/>. This mistake was
                    pointed out by Huygens, who, in order to determine the amount of the compression
                    from theory, reasoned in this way. Suppose two tubes to be united at the centre
                    of the earth, forming a right angle with each other at that point, and extending
                    to the surface, one in the plane of the equator, and the other along the polar
                    axis, and filled with a homogeneous fluid. Now the fluid contained in the polar
                    branch exerts a pressure on the centre equal to the whole of its weight, while
                    the pressure of that in the other tube will be diminished by the centrifugal
                    force. The second column, therefore, if of the same length, will be less heavy
                    than the first; and in order to restore the equilibrium, it is necessary that
                    the equatorial tube shall have gained as much in length as it has lost in weight
                    through the effect of rotation. Hence the sea in the equatorial regions must be
                    higher, or at a greater distance from the centre, than the polar sea, and
                    consequently the earth must have a flattened form. Calculating from the
                    supposition that the density increases regularly from the surface to the centre,
                    where it is infinite, Huygens found the ratio of the diameters to be that of 578
                    to 579. This investigation is given in his work <hi rend="italic">De
                    Causa</hi><hi rend="italic">Gravitatis,</hi> published in 1690.</p>
                <p>The theoretical determinations of the form of the earth by Newton and Huygens
                    were at variance with the results of geodetic operations that had been carried
                    on in France under the superintendence of the first Cassini, from 1680 till
                    1716, for the purpose of making a geometrical survey of that country. Cassini
                    found the degree of the meridian to the south of Paris to be 57,092 toises,
                    while on the north of that city it was only 56,960 toises. This result led to
                    the conclusion that the earth is a protracted spheroid, or elongated at the
                    poles; a conclusion entirely inconsistent with the principles of hydrostatic
                    equilibrium, and the deductions of Newton and Huygens. The question, however,
                    was of too great importance to astronomy to be allowed to remain undecided.
                    Accordingly, the Academy of Sciences of Paris determined to apply a decisive
                    test, by the measurement of arcs at a great distance from each other. For this
                    purpose some of the most distinguished members of their body undertook the
                    measurement of two meridional arcs, one in the neighbourhood of the equator, and
                    the other in a high latitude. In 1735 Godin, Bouguer, and La Condamine,
                    proceeded to Peru, where they were joined by two Spanish officers, Don Georges
                    Juan and Antonio d’Ulloa, and, after ten years of laborious exertion, they
                    measured an arc of above three degrees, between the parallels of 2' north and 3°
                    4' 32" south latitude. The other party, consisting of Maupertuis, Clairaut,
                    Camus, Lemonnier, Outhier, and Celsius, were in some respects more fortunate,
                    inasmuch as they completed the measurement of an arc near the polar circle, of
                    57 minutes, and returned to Europe within sixteen months from the period of
                    their departure.</p>
                <p>The measurement of Bouguer was executed with great care; and, on account of the
                    locality (the extremities being on different sides of the equator), as well as
                    the excellent manner in which all the details were conducted, it has always been
                    regarded as a most valuable determination. The original base was measured twice,
                    and the difference between the two measures was scarcely two and a half inches.
                    A second base of 5259 toises was measured with the most scrupulous attention by
                    Bouguer, Condamine, and Ulloa, near the southern extremity of the arc, and the
                    result differed less than a toise from the length calculated from the triangles.
                    The latitudes at the two extremities of the arc were determined by simultaneous
                    observations of the same star with zenith sectors. In fact, as the nutation of
                    the earth’s axis was then unknown, and as a considerable time necessarily
                    elapsed before a large instrument could be transported from one extremity of the
                    arc to the other, the results of successive observations with <hi
                    rend="subscript"> a</hi> ∣ single instrument presented little accordance. By th
                    <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> simultaneous observations, the greatest deviation
                    from the mean did not exceed three or four seconds.</p>
                <p>In consequence of a misunderstanding that unhappily sprung up among the principal
                    persons engaged in this memorable expedition, their operations were conducted
                    separately, and we have accordingly three independent results, but all agreeing
                    very nearly with each other. The first is that of Bouguer, who found, after the
                    various reductions, the length of the degree of the meridian at the equator, and
                    reduced to the level of the sea, to be 56,753 toises. Condamine found 56,749
                    toises, and the Spanish officers 56,768 toises.</p>
                <p>The party of'Maupertuis, though their labours were sooner completed, had also to
                    contend with very great difficulties. At their departure from France they had
                    hoped to find a sufficient number of stations among the small islands situated
                    in the Gulf of Bothnia; but on their arrival it was found impracticable to carry
                    on a triangulation among the islands, consequently they were obliged to
                    penetrate into the forests of Lapland. They commenced their operations at
                    Tornea, a city situated on the mainland near the extremity of the gulf, and
                    which formed the southern extremity of their arc. From this place they carried a
                    chain of triangles northward to the mountain of Kittis, lat. 65° 51'. Here they
                    commenced the observations of latitude by observing the distance of their zenith
                    from the star δ Draconis; and having obtained a sufficient number of
                    observations, they returned to Tornea, to determine the latitude of their
                    station there in the same manner. At Tornea they observed not only the star <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> Draconis, but also α Draconis; and some doubt having arisen
                    respecting the accuracy of the determination at Kittis, they again repaired to
                    that station, to observe the last star there also. The amplitude of the
                    celestial arc was found, by taking the mean of the observations, to be 57'
                    29"∙6.</p>
                <p>It now remained only to measure a base, and thereby determine the terrestrial
                    distance between Tornea and Kittis. This was accomplished on the frozen surface
                    of the river, by two parties who measured separately, and the difference between
                    their results amounted only to about four inches. From this it resulted that the
                    terrestrial arc between Tornea and Kittis was 55,023 toises, giving 57,437
                    toises to the degree, and consequently exceeding the degree measured by Picard
                    in France by 337 toises.</p>
                <p>As all these determinations concurred in proving that the degrees of the meridian
                    increase very sensibly in length from the equator to the high latitudes, no
                    doubt could any longer be entertained that the earth is compressed at the poles.
                    The operations of the two Cassinis in France alone gave results leading to an
                    opposite conclusion; and it therefore became desirable to ascertain the cause of
                    the anomaly. For this purpose Maupertuis and his former associates undertook the
                    verification of Picard’s operations; and it resulted from the remeasurement of
                    the arc between Paris and Amiens that the degree was equal to 57,183 toises. But
                    a more extensive series of operations was undertaken some time after by Cassini
                    de Thury (the third of that name) and Lacaille. With a view to determine more
                    accurately the variation of the degree along the French meridian, they divided
                    the whole arc between Dunkirk and Collioure into four partial arcs, embracing
                    abou 2° each, by observing the latitudes at five different stations. While
                    engaged in this measurement, they discovered that the toise which had been used
                    by Picard was shorter by about a thousandth part of the whole than t <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193752395"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-2395-0549"/>which formed their standard, and that his final
                    results were • accordingly too great by about a thousandth part. They also found
                    the mean length of a degree between Paris and Bourges to be 57,071 toises;
                    between Bourges and Rhodez only 57,040 toises; and between Rhodez and Perpignan
                    57,048 toises; thus showing on the whole a very sensible diminution as we
                    proceed towards the south. The last portion which they examined was that between
                    Paris and Dunkirk; and after a very careful determination of the latitudes, and
                    the measurement of a base of verification near Dunkirk, they found the degree to
                    be 57,074 toises,· greater than any of the former, as ought to be the case on
                    the hypothesis of a polar compression.</p>
                <p>Anotherimportant operation was likewise u^ndertakenby Cassini and Lacaille,
                    namely, the measurement of a degree of a parallel of latitude. The place they
                    selected was near the mouths of the Rhone, under the forty-third parallel. One
                    of the observers took his station on the mountain Sainte Victoire, near Aix, and
                    the other on Saint Clair, near Cette. On the tower of the church of Sainte
                    Marie, a village situated between the two stations, a signal was made by firing
                    a quantity of loose gunpowder; and the instant of the flash was noted by each of
                    the observers. The difference of sidereal time thus determined was 7 minutes
                    33*25 seconds, corresponding to a difference of meridians of 1° 53' 19 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi>. The distance between the two stations, which was
                    ascertained by triangulation, being reduced to the distance on the parallel
                    intercepted between the two meridians (at the latitude of 43°), was found to be
                    78,663 toises, whence the length of the degree was computed to be 41,651 toises.
                    This exceeded by about 250 toises the length of a degree of the same parallel
                    computed on the hypothesis of the earth’s being a perfect sphere. The details of
                    all these operations are given in the <hi rend="italic">Méridienne</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Paris</hi><hi rend="italic">Vérifiée.</hi></p>
                <p>About the middle of the last century several arcs of meridian were measured in
                    various countries, which, though of inferior importance in comparison of the
                    more extensive surveys which have since been undertaken, are nevertheless
                    deserving of enumeration. In 1751 Lacaille measured an arc at the Cape of Good
                    Hope, whither he had gone for the purpose of determining the lunar parallax, and
                    making other astronomical observations. At the latitude of 38° 18∣'he found the
                    degree of the meridian to be 57,037 toises. This result was nearly the same as
                    had been obtained in France, 10° farther from the equator; and clearly proved
                    either the existence of great local irregularities in the form of the earth, or
                    the dissimilarity of the two terrestrial hemispheres. Considerable disposition
                    has been manifested by later observers to question the accuracy of this result;
                    fortunately the details of the operations have been preserved, and, on a careful
                    investigation of them by Delambre, no error of any importance was found either
                    in the methods or the calculations. If there is any considerable inaccuracy, it
                    must have proceeded from the use of inadequate instruments. But, otter making
                    all reasonable allowance for this cause of error, the Cape degree still
                    continues to appear anomalous; and it would be desirable to have the whole of
                    Lacaille’s ore re-measured.</p>
                <p>In 1751 the measurement of a terrestrial arc was undertaken in the Roman states
                    by the Jesuits Maire and B°scovich. It extended nearly two degrees, between lome
                    and Rimini, and it was found that the degree of if leridjan between these
                    parallels, namely, 42° and 44°, contained 56,973 toises. The details are given
                    at length y Boscovich, in a work of great elegance, and entitled e <hi

                <p>ιesganig, a Jesuit, in 1762 also executed two measures or a meridional degree,
                    one in Hungary and the other in the Austnan states; but it has been shown by
                    Baron Zach, in his <hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Astronomique,</hi> vol. vii. that the results merit no confidence, and, in
                    fact, would lead to certain error if employed as elements in determining the
                    figure of the earth.</p>
                <p>About the same time, in 1764, an arc of meridian was measured in North America,
                    on the peninsula between the Chesapeake and Delaware bays, by two Englishmen,
                    Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon. They employed no triangulation, but measured
                    the line with deal rods along the whole extent of the arc, the mean latitude of
                    which was 39° 12'. Their rods were afterwards compared with the five-feet brass
                    rods made by Bird. The latitudes were determined with a zenith sector. The
                    length of the degree, after the necessary corrections and reductions were made,
                    was found to be 60,625 English fathoms, or 56,888 toises. There is no doubt that
                    great care was bestowed on this operation; it is, however, easy to see that the
                    measurement of so long a line by means of rods is liable to many causes of error
                    from which the method of triangulation is exempt.</p>
                <p>In 1777 Beccaria undertook to measure a degree in the plains of Piedmont. He
                    found the degree of the meridian at the latitude of 44° 44' to contain 57,024
                    toises; but great uncertainty remained respecting the correctness of the
                    latitudes, the extreme points of the arc being in the near neighbourhood of
                    immense ranges of mountains, which could not fail to produce a very considerable
                    deviation of the plumb line. It was supposed that as both ends of the arc were
                    terminated by mountain ranges, whereas Boscovich’s arc had been carried across
                    the Appennines and terminated at the sea coast, the errors of the two measures
                    occasioned by the local attraction, being of opposite kinds, would neutralize
                    each other, and give a correct mean result.</p>
                <p>Amidst the rapid advances of mathematical science towards the end of last
                    century, the determination of the figure of the earth was not overlooked. In the
                    year 1785 a memorial was presented to the British government by Cassini de
                    Thury, stating the important advantages that would result to astronomy and
                    navigation, from having the difference of longitude of the Greenwich and Paris
                    observatories determined by a geodetic measurement. Fortunately this proposal
                    was agreed to. The English operations were placed under the superintendence of
                    General Roy, who to active and indefatigable zeal united great skill and
                    experience in practical astronomy and surveying. In the summer of 1784 a base of
                    rather more than five miles was measured on Hounslow Heath. In the measurement
                    of this base, deal rods were at first employed; butas these were found to warp,
                    and be affected with the variations of the hygrometrical state of the
                    atmosphere, glass tubes were substituted; and in 1791 the same base was measured
                    with a steel chain carefully made by Ramsden, yet the difference from the former
                    measure was found to be only three inches. The mean result was 27,404*2 feet
                    •reduced to the level of the sea, and the scale being taken at the temperature
                    of 62° of Fahrenheit. A chain of 32 triangles, in connection with this base,
                    extended over the country to Dover and Hastings; and two more, stretching across
                    the channel, connected them with the French signals on the opposite side. The
                    instruments employed in this survey were of the most excellent description, and
                    far superior to any that had ever been employed in similar operations. The
                    angles of each triangle were measured by a large theodolite constructed by

                    sphericity of the earth, the sum of the three angles of a triangle on the
                    earth’s surface exceeds 180°.</p>
                <p>The French part of this great operation was conducted with equal ability by
                    Cassini (the fourth of that name), Mechain, and Delambre. The angles were
                    measured with the repeating circle of Borda; an instrument of a very different
                    description from the theodolite, but which in geodetic operations may fairly be
                    allowed to give, if not equally, at least sufficiently correct results, while in
                    practice it is much more commodious. The result of the combined measures showed
                    the meridian of Paris to be 2° 19' 51" east of Greenwich, or 9" less than had
                    been determined by Dr Maskelyne.</p>
                <p>Soon after this time a series of geodetic measurements was commenced both in
                    France and England, which, in point of extent, as well as minute accuracy, far
                    surpassed all the operations which had yet been undertaken with a view to
                    determine the figure of the earth. In 1791 the National Convention of France
                    having agreed to remodel the system of weights and measures, determined to adopt
                    a standard taken from nature, which might be universally applicable in all
                    countries, and capable of being restored in any future age, if by accident it
                    should happen to be lost. Two such standards were proposed,—namely, the length
                    of the pendulum, which makes a given number of vibrations in a given latitude;
                    and the quadrant of the terrestrial meridian. Of these the pendulum is by far
                    the most easy to be determined; but it was objected, that as the length of the
                    pendulum varies at different latitudes, and also depends in some degree on the
                    geological character of the country where it is measured, its length, if it
                    should happen to be lost, could not be recovered, without knowing the precise
                    place at which it had formerly been determined. The length of the quadrant of
                    the meridian is, however, invariable, and, if the earth is a regular spheroid of
                    revolution, must be the same at all places. Accordingly, the Convention chose
                    the ten millionth part of the meridian from the equator to the pole as the unit
                    of their new scale; and in order that this unit might be determined with the
                    greatest possible precision, it was resolved to remeasure the arc of the
                    meridian of Paris, and to extend it from Dunkirk to Barcelona, a distance
                    comprehending altogether an arc of about nine degrees. The practical execution
                    of this undertaking was confided to two astronomers of distinguished ability,
                    Delambre and Mechain, by whom the requisite operations were carried on during
                    the years 1792, 1793, and 1794, amidst all the dangers and difficulties arising
                    from the disorganized state of the country, with a resolution and courage of
                    which the annals of science afford few examples. The triangles amounted to 115
                    in number. Each of the three angles of every triangle was separately observed
                    with the repeating circle. The different observations, with the original
                    registers and remarks of the observers, were compared by commissioners, among
                    whom were some of the ablest men in France. A form was drawn up, after which all
                    the calculations were made. The calculations of the triangles, as well as of the
                    azimuths, were examined by Tralles, Van Swinden, Legendre, and Delambre himself.
                    The triangles were connected in the neighbourhood of Paris with a base of
                    upwards of seven miles in length, being 6075∙9 toises, at the temperature of 16∣
                    centigrade, or 61∣ of Fahrenheit. A base of verification of 6006∙25 toises was
                    measured by Mechain, near Perpignan, at the southern extremity of the arc; and
                    the measured length was found to differ by less than a foot from the length
                    deduced by calculation from the first base, though the distance was more than
                    436 miles. A line of this length, measured with extreme precision, is obviously
                    quite sufficient to enable us to infer, with all the requisite exactness, the
                    length of the quadrantal arc; but the French astronomers resolved to extend the
                    triangulation still farther. Accordingly, Mechain repaired again to Spain, and
                    in the year 1805 continued the chain of triangles from Barcelona to Tortosa on
                    the coast of the Mediterranean. At this place his labours were prematurely
                    terminated by an epidemic fever. The prolongation of the arc was, however,
                    committed to two philosophers of distinguished reputation, Biot and Arago. An
                    immense triangle, one of the sides of which exceeded 100 miles, connected the
                    coast of Valentia with the small island of Formentera, the most southerly of the
                    Balearic group, and distant no· less than 12° <hi rend="italic">22'</hi> 13"∙39
                    from Dunkirk, the northern extremity of the arc. The result of the whole gave a
                    value of the quadrantal arc, differing somewhat from that determined by Delambre
                    and Mechain, but so little that the length of the toise would be scarcely
                    affected by four times the millionth part of itself. The details of this
                    magnificent operation are given at length in the four volumes of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Base Metrique.</hi></p>
                <p>The English survey, which had been interrupted by the death of General Roy in
                    1790, was resumed in 1793 under the direction of Colonel Mudge. The original
                    triangles between Greenwich and Dover were extended along the coast to Dunnose
                    in the Isle of Wight, and thence through Devonshire and Wiltshire, and connected
                    with a base of verification measured on Salisbury Plain. The length of this base
                    was found, after the proper reductions, to be 36574 ’ 4 feet, differing scarcely
                    one inch from the length deduced by calculation from the base on Hounslow Heath.
                    So near a coincidence, though probably owing in some degree to a compensation of
                    errors, affords a convincing proof of the extreme accuracy with which every part
                    of the operation had been conducted. In 1802 the triangulation was carried into
                    Yorkshire, and a meridian arc measured from Dunnose to Clifton. The latitudes at
                    the terminal points were determined with Ramsden’s zenith sector. The arc was
                    afterwards extended to Burleigh Moor, comprehending nearly four decrees. It may
                    be remarked, that both the French and English arcs present this singular
                    anomaly, that when portions of them, at particular places, are considered
                    separately, the length of the degree appears to increase on going southward.</p>
                <p>The survey has been continued, with occasional interruptions, up to the present
                    time, under the able direction of Lieutenant-Colonel Colby; and the
                    triangulation has been carried to the remotest parts of Scotland, and over a
                    considerable part of Ireland. In the course of the operations, several important
                    improvements, both in respect of the instruments employed, and in the method of
                    conducting geodetic measurements in general, have been introduced into practice.
                    A base of upwards of seven miles has been measured near Londonderry; and it now
                    only remains to determine the latitudes of some stations, to give us the
                    elements of a new and greatly prolonged arc.</p>
                <p>In the years 1801, 1802, and 1803, Maupertuis’Swedish arc was re-measured by
                    Svanberg, and extended "nearly 40' to the south. The methods were the same as
                    had been employed by Delambre. The extremities the new arc were at Mallörn and
                    Pahtawara. The distance was found to be 92,778 toises, and the difference o the
                    latitudes 1° 37' 20"∙3; whence 1° — 57,196 toise»- This agrees much better than
                    the result of Maupertuis (57,422 toises) with other measures; but the
                    difference, which implies an error of 12" in the latitude of Kittos <hi
                    rend="superscript"> as</hi> determined by the French academicians, has not been
                    sa tisfactorily accounted for; so that there is still some dou about the length
                    of the degree in that latitude. (<hi rend="superscript"> ee</hi> Svanberg’s <hi

                    in India. The first was in the neighbourhood of Madras, and comprehended only l
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> 35'. The second, however, is the longest which
                    has yet been measured. The first, and a large part of the second, was
                    accomplished under the direction of Colonel Lambton; and the instruments and
                    methods of observation and calculation were exactly the same as those that had
                    been employed by Colonel Mudge in the English survey. The southern extremity of
                    the second arc was at Punnae, near Cape Comorin, latitude 8° 9' 32''∙51; and the
                    northern at Daumergidda, latitude 18° 3' 16"O7. The amplitude is consequently 9°
                    53' 43"∙56, and the distance between the extremities was found to be 598,629∙98
                    fathoms (about 680 miles), giving 60,495 fathoms, or 362,970 feet, for the
                    length of the degree. Several bases were measured, and the whole of the
                    operations appear to have been conducted with great skill and accuracy. This arc
                    has since been extended by Captain Everest to Kulliampoor, latitude 24° 7' 11
                    <hi rend="superscript"> ff</hi> ∙8; so that the whole length now includes very
                    nearly sixteen degrees. The details of Colonel Lambton’s operations are given in
                    the different volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Asiatic Researches</hi> (see
                    vols. viii. x. xii.), and those of Captain Everest, in his “<hi rend="italic"

                    East India Company, but not yet published.</p>
                <p>Various geodetic operations on a less extensive scale have been recently
                    executed, which are better adapted, perhaps, to give information respecting the
                    local curvature than the general form of the earth. Beccaria’s arc has been
                    remeasured by Plana and Carlini: the results clearly demonstrate the existence
                    of some errors in the original measurement, but they are not yet altogether
                    satisfactory, and the country is very unfavourable. The distance between
                    Göttingen and Altona has been measured by Gauss; and the amplitude of the
                    corresponding celestial arc is known with the utmost precision, from
                    observations of the latitude made at the respective observatories of the two
                    places. The amplitude, however, is only about two degrees, and there is some
                    doubt about the exact length of the iron bars with which the base was measured.
                    A more extensive arc has been measured in Russia by Struve. It extends at
                    present to three and a half degrees, and it is understood that it is in
                    contemplation to prolong it still farther. Many new methods have been employed
                    in this measurement; and it acquires additional value from its high latitude,
                    and the acknowledged skill and accuracy of the observer.</p>
                <p>The above are the principal arcs of meridian, but some arcs of parallel have also
                    been measured. Theoretically speaking, the figure of the earth may be determined
                    from the measurement of arcs of parallel, as readily as from meridional arcs;
                    and the geodetical operations in the one case Her in no respect from those in
                    the other. But the great, and, we fear, insurmountable difficulty, is to
                    determine with sufficient precision the difference of astronomical longitudes.
                    In a subsequent part of this article we shall have again occasion to mention
                    Cassini’s measurement of an arc of parallel across the mouth of the Rhone; of
                    the English are between Beachy Head and Dunnose; and that <hi rend="superscript"

                    which the present advanced state of analytical science might lead us to expect.
                    We have ady mentioned the results found by Newton and Huy- , <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> ens. Maclaurin first demonstrated that the ellipsoid
                    ’ revolution is a figure which satisfies the conditions of ¶uilibrium in the
                    case of a revolving homogeneous body, ' <hi rend="superscript"> 10s</hi> e
                    particles attract one another according to the law of the inverse square of the
                    distance; and he moreover determined the amount of the attraction in a particle
                    situated anywhere on the surface of such a body. This was an important step
                    towards the solution of the problem. A few years afterwards, Clairaut published
                    his <hi rend="italic">Theorie</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Figure de la
                    Terre,</hi> which, among other results, demonstrated with uncommon elegance,
                    contained a very remarkable theorem which establishes a relation between the
                    oblateness of the earth and the variations of gravity at different points of its
                    surface, and consequently gives the means of determining the earth’s figure by
                    means of observations of the length of the seconds pendulum at different
                    latitudes. Maclaurin’s discovery gave the intensity of the gravitating force on
                    the surface of the spheroid, or in its interior; but it was necessary to assign
                    the force with which an exterior point is attracted. This was partly
                    accomplished by D’Alembert, who proved that the attraction of any ellipsoid
                    whatever upon a point situated in the prolongation of one of its axes, is to the
                    attraction of a similar spheroid haying the same centre, and passing through the
                    attracted point, as the mass of the first spheroid is to the mass of the second.
                    Legendre found an approximate expression by means of series, for the attraction
                    on a point placed anywhere without a spheroid of revolution; and Laplace
                    extended the solution to ellipsoids in general. But the complete solution was
                    reserved for Mr Ivory, who obtained in finite terms a very simple expression for
                    the attractive force of an ellipsoid on an exterior point, and thereby completed
                    the theory of Maclaurin. It may be stated in a general way, that notwithstanding
                    all the researches that have been made respecting this very intricate subject,
                    the only positive results which theory has yet supplied are the three following
                    :—Is/, Maclaurin’s demonstration that a homogeneous mass revolving about an axis
                    will be in equi-libriowith the figureof an ellipsoid of revolution; 2<hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi>, Clairaut’s theorem for determining the ellipticity by
                    means of pendulum observations; and, 3d, the expression for the attraction of
                    ellipsoids on exterior particles, found by Mr Ivory. A complete theory would
                    determine whether there are or are not other figures besides the ellipsoid,
                    under which the equilibrium could subsist; but this has not yet been
                    accomplished. Indeed it has not even been proved that the sphere is the only
                    figure which could be assumed by a body at perfect rest, and whose molecules are
                    subjected to no other forces than their mutual attractions.</p>
                <p>Our limits do not permit us to enter into details respecting the numerous
                    experiments that have been made of late years to determine the figure of the
                    earth by measuring the variations of gravity at different places by means of the
                    pendulum. The most valuable series of observations of this kind we yet possess
                    are those of Captain Foster, reduced under the direction of Mr Baily, and
                    published in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical
                    Society,</hi> vol. vii. But a discovery recently made by Bessel proves that less
                    accuracy has been obtained by this method than was supposed. It has been found,
                    that a pendulum, when vibrating, drags along with it a portion of air, the
                    precise effect of which can be ascertained in no other way than by actual
                    experiment in vacuo with each individual pendulum. The probable correction which
                    it would be necessary to apply to the results that have already been found,
                    cannot be satisfactorily determined.</p>
                <p>The mean of the pendulum experiments gives rather a higher value of the
                    ellipticity than the results of geodetic measures; but there arc many elements,
                    particularly the irregular constitution of the exterior crust of the earth, and
                    the density of the strata surrounding the station, which can scarcely be
                    determined, and which yet affect materially the results of the experiments. 1his

                <p>Besides the methods which have now been alluded to, physical astronomy furnishes
                    other means of arriving at a knowledge of the figure of the earth. The
                    precession of the equinoxes, and nutation of the earth’s axis, are phenomena
                    depending on the compression of the earth; and as their amount is now
                    ascertained, from astronomical observations, with the utmost accuracy, we can
                    reciprocally deduce from them a knowledge of the compression. They do not,
                    however, give us an absolute value of the amount of compression, but they make
                    known the limits within which it must necessarily be confined. These limits are
                    ^^and But a more delicate measure of the same element is furnished by some
                    irregularities in the moons motion to which it gives rise; and as the lunar
                    theory has now attained a very high state of perfection, and as the small
                    irregularities which cause so much perplexity in geodetical measures here
                    entirely disappear, this is perhaps the most satisfactory method of all of
                    determining the ellipticity of the earth. The equations into which the
                    irregularity in question enters were discovered by Laplace; and the ellipticity
                    necessary to produce the observed effect was found, on calculation, to be <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> ⅛; confirming in a most remarkable manner the
                    deductions from the measurement of arcs and the observations of the
                    pendulum.</p>
                <p>SECTION II.</p>
                <p>OF THE MEASUREMENT OF TERRESTRIAL ARCS.</p>
                <p>The determination of the figure of the earth, being founded on the comparison of
                    lines actually measured on its surface with the corresponding arcs of the
                    celestial sphere, requires a combination of geodetical and astronomical
                    operations, which it will be our object in the present section to explain.
                    Theoretically considered, the geodetical line to be measured may lie in any
                    direction, because it can always be reduced to the meridian or to any other
                    given direction; but, for practical reasons, which will be pointed out
                    hereafter, it ought to be taken, as nearly as the nature of the country in which
                    the measurement is made will permit, either in the direction of the meridian, or
                    of a parallel of latitude. Differences of latitude, however, can be determined
                    with greater precision than differences of longitude; the meridional arcs are
                    consequently the best adapted to the purpose. Satisfactory results can only be
                    obtained from the measurement of lines of very considerable length, for example,
                    of several degrees; and this circumstance renders the geodetical operations both
                    laborious and complicated. In no place of the world, probably, and certainly in
                    no populous country, could it be possible to find a territory so free from
                    obstructions as to admit of the direct measurement of a line of two or three
                    hundred miles in the same direction. Hence, when an operation of this nature is
                    to be undertaken, the country in which the direction of the line to be measured
                    lies is divided into triangles; the angles of each triangle are accurately
                    observed with a theodolite, or some other equivalent instrument; and the side of
                    one of them being actually measured, all the other sides are computed from it by
                    the rules of trigonometry. In this manner the length of the whole line is
                    ascertained, and on comparing it with the celestial arc, the data are obtained
                    for deducing the dimensions and form of the earth.</p>
                <p>It appears, then, that in order to determine the figure of the earth by the
                    measurement of degrees, four distinct sets of operations are necessary: Is/, The
                    measurement of one side of a triangle, or of <hi rend="italic">the base</hi> as
                    it is called; 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, the observation of the angles of each
                    triangle, together with the height of the station, in order that the triangles
                    may be reduced, if necessary, to the horizontal plane, and to the level of the
                    sea; 3d, the observation of the <hi rend="italic">azimuths</hi> of the sides of
                    the triangles, or the angles they make with the meridional line; 4∕A, the
                    latitudes of the extreme points of the line. It is immaterial in what order
                    these operations are undertaken. We shall begin with the measurement of the
                    base.</p>
                <p>The length of the base must be regulated in some degree by the nature of the
                    locality; but being the fundamental element from which the sides of all the
                    triangles are deduced, it should not be less than five or six miles. A piece of
                    ground must therefore be selected, as nearly level as possible, and admitting a
                    line of that length to be described on it. The direction of the base is first
                    marked out by pickets; and, in order to place these in the same straight line,
                    or rather in the same vertical plane, a telescope, mounted in the manner of a
                    transit instrument, is set up at one extremity, by means of which the observer
                    is enabled to direct an assistant, by signals, to the exact position in which
                    the picket is to be placed, and also to bring their tops exactly into the same
                    level. As a farther guide, a rope may then be stretched between the pickets;
                    and, for greater security in the subsequent operations, the whole extent may be
                    approximately measured by rods or chains, in the usual manner. The extremities
                    of the base ought to be permanently marked by points. The centres of metal
                    tubes, cannon for example, let into the ground to a considerable depth, answer
                    this purpose very conveniently.</p>
                <p>These preliminary operations being accomplished, the next step is to proceed to
                    the more delicate operation of measuring the exact distance between the terminal
                    points, or extremities of the base.</p>
                <p>Various methods have been practised for this purpose. In the measurement of the
                    first base of the trigonometrical survey on Hounslow Heath by General Roy, deal
                    rods were at first employed, as had been done by Lacaille, Lemonnier, and
                    others; but though every precaution was used in selecting the best seasoned
                    timber, and every means employed to secure the rods from flexure, it was
                    discovered, in the course of the operations, that they were liable, from
                    variations in the state of the atmosphere as to moisture or dryness, to sudden
                    and irregular changes of such magnitude as to destroy all confidence in the
                    results. They were therefore laid aside; and glass rods, consisting of straight
                    tubes twenty feet in length, and about an inch in diameter, and enclosed in
                    wooden cases, were substituted. The only alteration to which these were subject
                    arose from the expansion and contraction from variations of temperature; and as
                    such alterations follow constant and ascertainable laws, their effects could be
                    easily computed, and a correction made for them. But the apparatus ultimately
                    adopted, both in the measurement of this base, and the other bases subsequently
                    measured for the purpose of verifying the operations in the English survey,
                    consisted of two steel chains, made with great care by Ramsden, of a hundred
                    feet in length, and composed’each of forty links, joined in the manner of a
                    watch chain. The chains were supported by deal coffers, and after being placed
                    in a straight line, were stretched with a weight of fifty-six pounds. Their
                    temperature and inclination to the horizon were careful y noted at the same
                    time, and the proper corrections subsequently made.</p>
                <p>This method has been objected to, on account of the uncertainty of giving the
                    chain always the same, degree o tension, and of the rubbing and wear of the
                    joints; bu the best proof of the accuracy of the results obtained y it consists
                    in the fact, that the two measurements of t <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> base
                    on Hounslow Heath, first by glass rods, and secon y <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193752447" xml:id="kp-eb0709-2447-0553"/>• by the steel chains,
                    differed from each other, after all the</p>
                <p>• reductions were made, by less than three inches, although ' the whole length
                    exceeded five miles. For an account of the comparison of the chains with one
                    another, and with the standard brass yard made by Ramsden, we must refer to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> vol. i.</p>
                <p>The use of chains has been confined to the English and Indian surveys. Bouguer,
                    in the Peruvian measurement, employed an iron rod of about a toise in length,
                    which, from the frequent comparisons that have since been made of it with other
                    standards, has been particularised by the name of toise of Peru. For the
                    determination of the meridian of Dunkirk, Borda employed rules of platina,
                    exactly two toises in length, and furnished with a very ingenious contrivance
                    for ascertaining the expansion. Along one side of the rule there was a slip of
                    brass, firmly fixed at one extremity, but at liberty to move along the rule at
                    the other end, according to the relative expansion of the two metals. The
                    relative expansion being read off by means of a micrometer, gave a ready means
                    of computing, from tables previously constructed, the absolute expansion of the
                    platina rule. Four rules were made use of, three of which were always placed on
                    the ground at once; and in order to prevent any derangement, they were not
                    brought into absolute contact. A small interval of a few millimetres was left
                    between them, which was measured by means of a slider attached to the preceding
                    end of each rule, and which was pushed out till it came into contact with the
                    following end of the preceding rule. See Delambre, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Various other contrivanceshave been used for the measurement of the base line.
                    MM. Plana and Carlini, in the re-measurement of Beccaria’s arc, employed
                    measuring rods of wood, twelve metres in length, of the form of hollow
                    parallelepipeds. For the Hanoverian base measure, between Altona and Gottingen,
                    Gauss employed three rods of hammered iron, each twelve French feet in length.
                    But the most ingenious apparatus which has yet been invented for this purpose,
                    is that which was made by our celebrated artist Troughton for the Irish base. As
                    this instrument is probably destined to supersede all others previously used, we
                    shall briefly describe the principle on which it is constructed.</p>
                <p>Let AB and DE (Plate CCXLIV. fig. 1) represent two bars of different metals,
                    firmly united to a transverse bar at the middle C, but entirely free to move
                    independently of each other at the extremities, according to their different
                    expansions. APand BQ are two tongues of steel attached to the extremities of the
                    two rods AD and BE, by double conical joints, around which they are capable of
                    making a small angle with the lines perpendicular to AB or DE. At a certain
                    given temperature the bars are exactly of the same length, when, consequently,
                    AP and BQ are parallel to each other, and perpendicular to the bars. Let us now
                    conceive the bars to receive an increase of temperature, and that the dilatation
                    of AB is greater than that of DE. In consequence of the increased temperature,
                    both bars <hi rend="superscript"> w</hi> i∣∣ be lengthened, but their lengths
                    will no longer be equal; consequently the two tongues AP and BQ will no longer
                    be parallel; for, suppose AB to become <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> and DE to
                    become <hi rend="italic">de,</hi> then AB being by hypothesis a more expansive
                    metal than DE, <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> will be longer than <hi rend="italic"
                    >de,</hi> and the steel tongues will take the positions <hi rend="italic"
                    >ax</hi> and <hi rend="italic">by,</hi> inclined to each other. But if the point
                    P is taken at such a distance from the bars that PA is to PD in the ratio of the
                    dilatation of AB to DE, then in the new position <hi rend="italic">ax,</hi> the
                    point P will not sensibly deviate from the perpendicular AP, at least for
                    moderate variations of temperature. In the same manner, the point Q will not
                    sensibly deviate from its first position in the perpendicular BQ, so that the
                    distance between P and Q remains sensibly the same. It is easy, however, to see
                    that the dilatation of the bars must be confined within narrow limits; for, as
                    the leno-th °u to <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> gue is invariable, P will not
                    be found exactly in the line AP after the expansion has taken place; it will be
                    on the same side of AP on which are the points <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> and its distance from AP will be accurately measured by
                    the quantity AP × (tan. APa — sin. APa); and as the same thing takes place with
                    regard to Q, the distance between P and Qwill be increased by twice this
                    quantity. But as the angle APa must in all cases be extremely small, the
                    difference between its tangent and its sine is altogether inappreciable. It is
                    unnecessary to remark, that the same consequences <hi rend="italic"
                    >(mutatis</hi><hi rend="italic">mutandis')</hi> take place when the temperature
                    falls below the assumed standard.</p>
                <p>In the instruments made use of in the measurement of the Irish base, the bar AB
                    was of brass, and DE of iron. The length of each was ten feet, and the distance
                    between them two inches. The length of the tongue is hence easily found from the
                    relative dilatation of the two metals. Suppose the expansion of brass to be to
                    that of iron in the ratio of 83 to 53 for an increase of 1° of temperature, and
                    let PD = <hi rend="italic">x</hi> inches, we shall have <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">x</hi> + 2 ≡≡ 53: 83;</p>
                <p>53</p>
                <p>whence <hi rend="italic">x =</hi> — = 3ģ inches very nearly. But the precise
                    position of the points P and Q must be determined by actual experiment: for the
                    expansion or contraction of no two bars, even of the same metal, are ever found
                    to be exactly the same.</p>
                <p>In practice, five or six sets of bars, constructed in the manner now described,
                    and placed in strong deal boxes supported on trestles, are laid along the line
                    to be measured, and accurately levelled. They are placed at a small distance
                    from each other, and the distance between the dots on the adjacent steel tongues
                    of two succeeding bars is accurately measured by an ingenious micrometrical
                    apparatus constructed so as to form a compensating instrument of exactly the
                    same nature as the measuring bars.</p>
                <p>The conception of this elegant apparatus belongs to Lieutenant-Colonel Colby; and
                    the practical results it gives correspond with its theoretical excellence. It is
                    computed that the greatest possible error of the base measured on the eastern
                    shore of Lough Foyle, in the county of Londonderry, cannot exceed two inches,
                    though the length is very nearly eight miles.</p>
                <p>The reduction to the level of the sea is made as follows: Let <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> = radius of earth, <hi rend="italic">x</hi> = height above the level of
                    the sea, <hi rend="italic">a =.</hi> measured length of the base, and <hi
                    rend="italic">a'</hi> = its reduced length; then</p>

                    may be neglected, by reason of their smallness.</p>
                <p>It is easy to see, that as the base is not, correctly speaking, a straight line,
                    but an arc of a circle, or rather ellipse, the sum of the lengths of all the
                    rods or chains horizontally applied to it is not precisely the length of the
                    arc, but of the circumscribing polygon. In order to determine how far this
                    circumstance can affect the result, let us suppose the length of the measuring
                    rod to be ten feet; when laid on the ground, exactly in the horizontal plane, it
                    forms two tangents to the surface, of five feet each, and therefore each half
                    length of the rod ought to be diminished by the difference between the tangent

                <p>We come now to the triangulation. The first thing to be done is to select proper
                    stations for the vertices of the triangles. The selection will necessarily
                    depend on the nature of the country through which the survey is made; but there
                    are certain principles which ought to be observed, as nearly as the
                    circumstances will permit. The stations should be chosen, so that each angle of
                    the principal triangles should approach as nearly as possible to 60°, because a
                    small error in the estimation of a very acute or obtuse angle will greatly
                    affect the length of the opposite side computed from it. Excepting in
                    unavoidable cases, no angle ought to be less than 30°. The sides cannot be too
                    long, while the signal at one extremity is visible from the other. The signals
                    may be towers, spires, or other conspicuous objects conveniently situated; but
                    such signals can seldom be well bisected by the wire of the telescope.
                    Flag-staffs are better when the distances are not too great. Delambre preferred
                    signals erected on purpose. They were generally constructed of wood, and of the
                    form of a truncated pyramid. One considerable advantage arises from the use of
                    signals constructed in this manner, namely, that the instrument can be placed
                    exactly at the centre of the station. Frequently Bengal lights, reverberating
                    lamps, and white lights, are employed; but these of course can only be seen
                    during the night. The best signal of this sort was invented by Lieutenant
                    Drummond. It is formed by directing a stream of hydrogen gas on a small piece of
                    ignited quicklime; an intense light is produced, which may be seen at very great
                    distances. Care should be taken to place the signals, if they are to be observed
                    by day, in such positions that they may be projected on the sky; if projected on
                    forests or mountains, they will seldom be distinctly visible. Svanberg
                    constructed his signals with openings, to permit the light of the sky to be seen
                    through them.</p>
                <p>The triangles being marked out, and the signals prepared, the next object is to
                    measure the angles. When the theodolite is used for this purpose, no correction
                    is required on account of the different^altitudes of the signals, the reduction
                    being effected by the instrument itself; but when a sextant or repeating circle
                    is employed, the observed angles must be reduced to the plane of the
                    horizon.</p>
                <p>Let P, Q, and R (fig. 2), be the three stations, PQR the observed angle oblique
                    to the horizon; produce PQ and PR till they meet Q'R', a line parallel to the
                    plane of the horizon; through Q' R' let a plane be conceived to pass parallel to
                    the horizontal plane, meeting PZ, the vertical passing through P, in P'; then Q'
                    P' R' i <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> the horizontal projection of QPR, and the
                    angles ZPQ, ZPR are the complements of the inclinations of the line PQand PR to
                    the horizon.</p>
                <p>With P as a centre, and a radius =1, let a sphere be described, intersecting PZ,
                    PQ, and PR in the points A, B, and C respectively; the angle BAC is evidently
                    equal to the horizontal angle Q'P'R'. Now, in the spherical triangle ABC, we
                    have given by observation the side AB = the zenith distance of Q, AC = the
                    zenith distance of R, and BC the oblique angle at the centre of the station,
                    from which we are to find the angle BAC — Q'P'P√.</p>

                <p>From this formula the value of A is easily computed, when the inclinations of the
                    lines PQ and PR to the horizon are not very small. In practice, however, it
                    frequently happens that these inclinations are very small, or that the angles
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> differ very little from
                    right angles. When this is the case, the logarithmic calculation of the formula
                    becomes troublesome, particularly if it is required to determine A with great
                    exactness; and it is better to adopt a different method of proceeding.</p>
                <p>Instead of seeking to find the projected angle Q'P'R', we may find its difference
                    from the observed angle QPR, which difference will seldom amount to more than a
                    few seconds. Since the arcs <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Another reduction is necessary. Unless the signals are constructed on purpose, it
                    will rarely happen that the instrument can be placed exactly in the centre of
                    the station. In this case it must be placed at some other point near the centre
                    of the station, and the observed angle reduced to the centre by calculation.
                    Suppose, for example, it were required to determine the angle ACB (fig. 3),
                    which the objects A and B subtend at C, and that the instrument cannot be placed
                    exactly at C. Let P be the point, at a short distance from C, where the
                    instrument is actually placed, and APB be the observed angle; then, since ĆP can
                    be measured, and CA, CB are supposed to be known, approximately at least, the
                    problem is, having given the angle APB, and the distances CA, CB, and CP, it is
                    required to determine the angle ACB.</p>
                <p>Let AC and BP intersect in E. Then, since AEB = ACB + CBP=APB + CAP, we have</p>
                <p>ACB —APB=CAP-CBP.</p>

                    obstacles intervene, by moving it along the line PB, till the angle CDB is
                    observed to be equal to BAC.</p>
                <p>When the three observed angles of each triangle have been reduced to the horizon,
                    they represent the angles of a spherical triangle, the sides of which are
                    intercepted by the verticals of the three stations, and the sum of the three
                    angles of each triangle exceeds 180° by a quantity which is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">spherical excess.</hi> The sides ought therefore to be calculated
                    by the rules of spherical trigonometry; but as the sides of the triangles are in
                    all cases very small in comparison of the radius of the earth, the calculation
                    made in this way (for which indeed the existing tables are not well adapted)
                    becomes exceedingly tedious. Instead, therefore, of calculating directly the
                    spherical triangle, it is more convenient to compute its deviation, which is
                    always very small, from a plane triangle. The method employed by Delambre was
                    the following.</p>
                <p>In the first place, the spherical angle, or that which is formed by tangents at
                    the surface, must be reduced to the corresponding plane angle formed by the
                    chords. This is easily accomplished by the help of the theorem above given for
                    reducing the observed angles to the horizon; for the angle formed by the chord
                    and the tangent of an arc is equal to the angle at the centre subtended by half
                    the arc; consequently when the lengths of the two sides of a spherical angle are
                    known nearly, the angle of <hi rend="italic">depression</hi> of the chords is
                    also known; and therefore the preceding theorem for reducing angles to the
                    horizon can be immediately applied, tor example, suppose the sides of a
                    spherical angle to be respectively <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">q</hi> miles, and the circumference of the earth to be 25,000

                    angles made by the chords, by means of which the triangle may be computed in the
                    same manner as if it were a plane triangle.</p>
                <p>To make this reduction, it is necessary to know, approximately<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193752486" xml:id="kp-eb0709-2486-0556"/> at least, the diameter of
                    the earth as well as the distances of the stations; but the result will be
                    little affected by a moderate error in either of these data. In fact, it is only
                    when the sides of the triangles are very large that the effects of the earth’s
                    curvature become at all sensible.</p>
                <p>But a more elegant manner of estimating the effects of the earth’s curvature,
                    though not always of so easy application, was proposed by Legendre. This
                    illustrious geometer discovered the following very remarkable property of
                    spherical triangles; namely, that when the sides are very small in comparison of
                    the radius of the sphere, if from each of the angles there be subtracted one
                    third part of the quantity by which the sum of the three angles exceeds two
                    right angles, or 180°, the angles thus diminished may be regarded as the angles
                    of a plane triangle, the sides of which are equal in length to those of the
                    proposed spherical triangle. The excess of the sum of the three angles above two
                    right angles is proved by trigonometry to be equal to <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    being the area of the triangle, and <hi rend="italic">r</hi> the radius of the
                    sphere; so that the theorem of Legendre may be enumerated as follows:</p>
                <p>“If the angles of a spherical triangle whose surface is small in comparison of
                    the surface of the whole sphere, be denoted by A, B, and C, and the opposites by
                    α, <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> the triangle may be
                    calculated as a plane triangle, the sides of which are <hi rend="italic">a,
                    b,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> and the opposite angles A — ⅜ s, B — ļ s,
                    C — -ģ- ≡, ε being the excess of the sum of the three angles of the proposed
                    spherical triangle above two right angles.” *</p>
                <p>In applying the above theorem, it is necessary first to calculate ι or ∙^-, which
                    can always be done <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> from the known parts of the
                    spherical triangle considered as rectilinear. This being done, we have only to
                    deduct ⅛ s from each of the observed angles, and then compute the remaining
                    parts, as in the case of a plane triangle.</p>
                <p>By this method, the distances between the several signals may be computed; and as
                    the angles at all the stations are given by observation, the inclinations of all
                    the sides of the triangles to any one of them are also known, so that it is only
                    necessary to determine very accurately the inclination of one side of a triangle
                    to the meridian, in order to ascertain the inclinations of all the other sides,
                    and thence to compute the meridian itself.</p>
                <p>• The determination of the azimuth of a signal is accomplished by means of
                    astronomical observation, and may be performed in various ways, but all
                    depending on the same principle. It is necessary, however, in any case to be
                    provided with the means of determining the time with very great precision. The
                    azimuth of the sun, or a star, at any given instant, can be determined with
                    sufficient accuracy. Let the observer, therefore, take his station at one of the
                    signals, and observe the angle formed between the other signal and the sun, or a
                    star, when nearly in the horizon, and let him note the instant of time at which
                    the observation was made. Knowing the error of his clock or chronometer, he
                    knows also the true time, and can consequently calculate the azimuth of the
                    observed celestial body. Taking the sum or difference, as the case may be, of
                    this and the observed angle, he obtains the azimuth of the distant signal, or
                    the angle which the straight line joining the two signals makes with the
                    meridian. The refraction will scarcely effect the result; but a small error with
                    respect to the time would lead to considerable errors. If the sun is observed,
                    the error of the clock must be determined by observations of his meridional
                    transits; but most frequently a circumpolar star, as Capella, is preferred.
                    Sometimes the observation is made on the pole star itself; but in this case it
                    is necessary to know the latitude of the station very accurately. Another method
                    is frequently resorted to. Having set up a mark very nearly in the meridian,
                    adjust a transit instrument upon it, and then, by means of the transits of stars
                    at different polar distances, or other means known in practical astronomy,
                    determine the deviation of the instrument from the meridian. This gives the
                    direction of the mark with respect to the meridian, and consequently the angle
                    to be added to or subtracted from the angle between the mark and the signal. For
                    greater security, the azimuths may be observed at several signals. They ought at
                    least to be observed at each extremity of the chain of triangles.</p>
                <p>The triangles being calculated and reduced to the horizon, we are now in a
                    condition to compute the length of the arc between the parallels of the extreme
                    stations. Let ABCDEFG, &amp;c. (fig. 4), be a chain of triangles lying nearly in
                    the direction of the meridian AZ, and traced on a spheroidal surface, supposed
                    to be formed by the continuation of the ocean. Let L be the last station, and LX
                    the perpendicular passing through L and meeting AZ in the point X; it is
                    required to determine AX.</p>
                <p>By means of the previous calculations, all the sides of the triangles are
                    supposed to have been computed, as well as the azimuth of C, or the inclination
                    of AC to the meridian. Let CD be produced to Μ. In the triangle ACM there are
                    given the side AC, and the two angles CAM, ACM. To find the third angle AMC,
                    first compute the spherical excess s; from each of the angles CAM, ACM, subtract
                    f «; take the sum of the two remainders from 180°, and there will be left the
                    value of AMC. The angles being thus given, and also the side AC, the other two
                    sides AM and CM are computed in the same manner as if the triangle were
                    rectilinear.</p>
                <p>In the. quadrilateral MDFN there are given the two opposite angles at M and F
                    (the first from the previous calculation, and the second by observation),
                    together with the two sides MD and DF. Draw the diagonal MF; then in the
                    triangle DMF there are given the two sides DM, DF, and the included angle D.
                    From D deduct ⅜ <hi rend="superscript"> f</hi>- the excess <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi> being computed by an approximate value of the area of the triangle, and
                    compute, as in a plane triangle, the side MF and the two angles DMF, DFM. To
                    each of these add ⅜ », and the two sums being deducted from the angles DMN and
                    DFN, there will remain the two angles FMN and MFN. Hence, since MF has been
                    already computed, we can find MN, FN, and the angle MNF, in the usual
                    manner.</p>
                <p>Now, in the triangle NPH, NH is known (for FH and FN have been calculated), and
                    the adjacent angles PNH, NFIP are given by observation; therefore we can compute
                    NP, PH, and the remaining angle NPH.</p>
                <p>To find PX we may produce II. to Z, and resolve the two triangles PIZ and ZLX. In
                    the first of these, the side PI, and the two adjacent angles PIZ, IPZ, are
                    already known; whence we find IZ, PZ, and the angle IZP. M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> e</hi> have then in the right-angled triangle LXZ, the side
                    LZ, and the angle LZX to find ZX. From PZ subtract Zλ, and there remains PX, the
                    quantity sought.</p>
                <p>In proceeding by the method now indicated, the spherical excess “must be first
                    computed for each of the triangles to be resolved; then each observed spherical

                    latitude of L, EX that of the point X, and ZX the distance between the

                    the versed sine of the arc whose chord is LX; therefore, making</p>

                    from the calculated meridional arc.</p>
                <p>Delambre employed a different method of computing the distance between the
                    parallels of the terminal points of the measured arc. It requires, however, the
                    dimensions of the earth to be previously known with tolerable accuracy. Let AB
                    (fig. 7) be the arc measured on the surface of the spheroid PAB; then, having
                    observed the Iatitude of the station A, and the azimuth of AB, that is the angle
                    BAP, we have sufficient data, supposing the dimensions of the earth to be nearly
                    known, to find not only the distance between the parallels of A and B, but also
                    the latitude and longitude of B, and the azimuth of BA, as observed from B.
                    Through A and B draw the normals AM and BN, meeting the axis in M and N; join
                    BM, AN; and about M as a centre, with an arbitrary radius, describe the circular
                    arcs <hi rend="italic">bp, pa,</hi><hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> forming the
                    spherical triangle <hi rend="italic">pab.</hi> Now, if we compare the triangle
                    PAB on the spheroid with <hi rend="italic">pab</hi> on the sphere, we find <hi
                    rend="italic">pa</hi> = PA in degrees, each being the colatitude of A; <hi
                    rend="italic">pb</hi> = PB, each being the colatitude of B; the angle <hi
                    rend="italic">apb</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> APB being the difference of
                    longitude of A and B, and also the angle <hi rend="italic">ρab=ο</hi> PAB, each
                    measuring the inclination of the planes PMA, AMB. But the angle <hi
                    rend="italic">pba</hi> is in general not equal to PBA; for as the normals do not
                    meet the axis in the same point, the planes AMB and ANB do not coincide; and <hi
                    rend="italic">pba</hi> is the measure of the inclination of PMB and AMB, whereas
                    PBA is the measure of the inclination of PMB and ANB. Now, m the triangle <hi
                    rend="italic">pba</hi> there are given the angles at <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> so that if the side <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> can
                    be determined in terms of AB, the other parts of the triangle may be computed,
                    and Aence the difference between <hi rend="italic">pb</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >pa,</hi> or the distance between the parallels, which being found in terms of
                    BA, <hi rend="superscript"> w</hi> dl be expressed in feet.</p>
                <p>We have therefore to find an expression for <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> or the
                    angle AMB. Now, in the triangle ABM there are given AB (thy measured arc), and
                    AM the normal at A (the dimensions of the earth being nearly known). But BM ≡

                    multiplied by it may be neglected without any sensible error. We may therefore
                    assume BM = BN. In the triangle ABM we have then given the three sides, whence
                    the angles may be computed, and consequently <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi

                    on the spheroid.</p>
                <p>When the distance between the parallels of the extreme points of the arc has been
                    ascertained, it only remains to determine the difference of their latitudes, or
                    the length of the corresponding celestial arc. This is the most difficult part
                    of the whole operation. The error of a single second in the difference of the
                    latitudes corresponds to about a hundred feet on the terrestrial meridian; and
                    when it is considered that the latitudes of the best determined spots on the
                    earth, even of the Observatories of Greenwich and Paris, are still uncertain to
                    the amount of at least half a second, it will be easily apprehended that the
                    errors of the latitudes are more to be feared than any which can affect the
                    measurement of the base, or the angles, or the direction of the meridian. In the
                    British survey, that of India, and some on the Continent, the latitudes were
                    observed with the zenith sector, an instrument peculiarly adapted to this
                    purpose. Ramsden’s zenith sector, made expressly for the determination of the
                    arc of meridian between Dunnose and Clifton, carried a telescope of eight feet
                    in length. With this superb instrument, for a description of which we must refer
                    to the second volume of the <hi rend="italic">Trigonometrical Survey,</hi> the
                    zenith distances of several of the northern stars were observed at both
                    extremities of the arc; and the difference of two zenith distances of the same
                    star is evidently the same as the difference of the latitudes of the two
                    stations. It may be remarked, that the result of this observation is independent
                    of the declination of the star; and if the observation is made at the second
                    station within a short time after it was made at the first, the result is also
                    nearly independent of the nutation.</p>
                <p>For the determination of the French are of meridian, the latitudes were observed
                    with the repeating circle. This instrument, on account of its portability, is of
                    the greatest use in geodetic operations; but it may be questioned whether it can
                    be safely relied on for the determination of so very important an element as the
                    latitude. Besides the want of power in the telescope, it is found to be affected
                    in some unaccountable way by a constant error, which, however carefully its
                    amount may have been determined, leaves a degree of uncertainty with regard to
                    the results. Mechain mistook the latitude of Barcelona by about 3". It is to be
                    regretted that the latitudes of Dunkirk and Formentera, the extremities of the
                    French arc, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193752512" xml:id="kp-eb0709-2512-0558"
                    />have not been determined with the zenith sector. All í the other operations
                    connected with the measurement of <hi rend="smallcaps">í</hi> that extensive arc
                    have been executed in a style of such decided superiority, that a more
                    satisfactory, if not more accurate, determination of the latitudes is alone
                    wanting to render it the most valuable application of science that has ever been
                    made with a view to ascertain the magnitude and exact figure of our globe The
                    measurement of an arc of parallel usually forms part of the operations connected
                    with the survey of a large extent of country. It will frequently happen that the
                    sides of some of the great triangles lie in a direction nearly perpendicular to
                    the meridian, in which case the arc of the terrestrial parallel may be easily
                    computed from an approximate knowledge of the earth’s dimensions; and if the
                    difference of longitude of the two stations, or the angle which their respective
                    meridians make with each other, has been accurately determined, the comparison
                    of the corresponding celestial and terrestrial arcs will give the length of the
                    degree on the parallel. By comparing this result with the length of a degree
                    measured on a different parallel, or on the meridian, we can easily deduce the
                    ellipticity Perhaps the simplest way of conveying an accurate idea of the nature
                    of the operations necessary to be undertaken in the measurement of an arc of
                    parallel, will be to describe the method that was actually followed in the
                    British trigonometrical survey, in determining the length of an arc of parallel
                    from the measured distance between Beachy Head and Dunnose Let BW (fig. 8) be an
                    arc of the great circle perpendicular to the meridian of Beachy Head at B,
                    meeting that of Dunnose in W; and let DR be an arc of the great circle
                    perpendicular to the meridian of Dunnose at D, meeting that of Beachy Head in R;
                    and let BL and DE be the parallels of latitude passing through B and D. It is
                    supposed that the latitudes of the two places have been determined, together
                    with the angles PBD and PDB, which they reciprocally make with each other and
                    the pole; and also that the distance between them on the arc of the great circle
                    has been measured: the question is then to find the difference of their
                    longitudes, or the angle BPD, and the distance in feet between the meridians on
                    the arcs of the small circles BL and DE passing through the places.In the small
                    spheroidal triangle WBD there were given by observation the two angles WBD and
                    WDB, which being reduced to the angles made by the chords, gave the two angles
                    of the corresponding plane triangle. The side BD was found by triangulation =
                    339,397∙6 feet; whence the chord of the perpendicular arc BW was found = 336,115
                    ’ 6 feet. In like manner the chord of DR was found = 336,980 feet The
                    terrestrial distances being thus found, it was next necessary to find the
                    difference of longitude, or the angle P, and the lengths of the arcs of parallel
                    BL and DE in degrees. For this purpose there are given PB'the colatitude of B,
                    PD the colatitude of D, the angle PBD, which is the azimuth of D as seen from B,
                    and PDB the azimuth of B as seen from D.The rigorous solution of this problem on
                    the spheroid is attended with considerable difficulty. An approximation is
                    however easily obtained from a property of spheroidal triangles (for the
                    demonstration of which we must refer to the <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans,</hi>
                    vol. lxxx.), namely, that the sum of the horizontal angles on a spheroid (or
                    indeed on any surface differing little from that of a sphere) is <hi
                    rend="italic">nearly</hi> the same as the sum of those which would be observed
                    on a sphere, the latitudes and difference of longitudes being the same on both
                    figures. Assuming therefore the sum of the two angles PDB and PBD to be the same
                    as the sum of two spherical angles, ŵe have, from Napier’s analogies (see <hi

                    of longitudes is equal to the cotangent of half the sum of the azimuthal angles
                    multiplied into the ratio of the cosine of half the difference of the
                    colatitudes to the cosine of half their sum. In the case under consideration the
                    angle P was found = 1° 26' 47"∙93.</p>
                <p>We have now given, in the right-angled triangle PBW, which may be considered as
                    spherical, the side PB and the angle P, whence BW was found ≡≡ 54/ 56"∙2l. And
                    from the triangle PDR, in which the side PD and the angle P are given, DR was
                    found = 55' 4"∙74.</p>
                <p>The chords of the two perpendicular arcs BW and DR, whose radius is the radius of
                    the earth, are found, from an approximate knowledge of the earth’s diameter, to
                    be three feet and a half shorter than the arcs themselves, whence the arc BW =
                    336,119∙1 feet, and DR = 336,983∙5 feet. Hence the length of the degree of the
                    great circle perpendicular to the meridian, at the middle point between W and B,
                    is found by proportion — 367,096 ’ 8 feet, and in the middle point between R and
                    D — 367,090∙8 feet. Therefore the mean, or 367,093*8, is the length of a degree
                    of the great circle perpendicular to the meridian in latitude 50° 4P, which is
                    nearly that of the middle point between Beachy Head and Dunnose.</p>
                <p>Now, by reason of the short distance between the two stations, and their small
                    difference in latitude, the two radii of curvature at B and D may be regarded as
                    intersecting each other on the axis at M (fig. 9). Therefore DM is the radius of
                    the great circle perpendicular to the meridian, and DE is the radius of the
                    parallel at D. Therefore 1° of the great circle: 1° of the parallel as DM: DE;
                    and DM: DE - 1: cos. latitude of D; whence 1: cos. 50° 44' 24" = 367,094:

                <p>The length of the degree of the great circle perpendicular to the meridian,
                    deduced in the manner now explained, is about 1250 feet greater than on the
                    spheroid which corresponds with the measurements of the meridional arcs. This
                    discrepancy gave rise to a suspicion of errors in the observation of the
                    azimuthal angles; and, in fact, die difference of longitude, in order to agree
                    with other determinations, ought to be about 18" greater than that which was
                    determined in the survey. With this correction the length of the degree of the
                    perpendicular circle is found = 365,838 feet. Assuming the dimensions of the
                    earth deduced from the survey, the length of the degree perpendicular to the
                    meridian at the mean latitude is 365,84 feet. Hence 1° parallel = 231,801
                    feet.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1824 an account is
                    given of some experiments performed by Dr Tiarks or determining the difference
                    of longitude of Dover and la - mouth. Twenty-four chronometers were transported
                    y sea, three several times, from the one place to the other, by which means the
                    difference of the apparent times was determined. The difference of longitude was
                    thus foun to be 6° 22' 6"; and the length of the parallel, <hi

                    measured is that between Marennes (near Bordeaux) and Padua. The details of the
                    operations, which were performed in 1822 and 1823, are given in the <hi

                    terrestrial arc was determined by triangulation in the usual manner, and the
                    astronomical amplitude by fire signals observed from station to station at five
                    intermediate stations. There are consequently six independent arcs; and the
                    final result is affected with the accumulated errors at all the stations. The
                    terrestrial distance was found to be 1,010,996 metres, or 3,316,976 English
                    feet; and the difference of time determined by chronometers 51 min. 56 ’ 24
                    sec., corresponding to 12° 59’ 3"∙75 of longitude. The mean length of the
                    degree, found from the partial arc between Marennes and Geneva, is 255,546 feet,
                    and from the whole arc between Marennes and Padua 255,470 feet, both of which
                    results are greater than the degree on the regular spheroid, which is found to
                    represent most nearly the meridional arcs under the same parallel of latitude,
                    namely, 45° 43' 12". No great reliance, however, can be placed on this
                    determination, on account of the uncertainty that exists respecting some of the
                    longitudes, the determination of which was found to be attended with great
                    difficulty. If the difference of longitude of Marennes and Padua were found by
                    good astronomical observations, the discrepancies would probably be
                    diminished.</p>

                    or the difference between L' and L. If L is nearly equal to L', the denominator
                    becomes very small, and the value of <hi rend="italic">e</hi> in consequence
                    uncertain. The most favourable determination, therefore, that can be obtained
                    is, when one of the degrees, Z', for example, is measured near the pole, and Z
                    at the equator, where L is zero. As an example of this method, we may deduce the
                    value of <hi rend="italic">e</hi> from a comparison of the lengths of a degree
                    at the equator and in England. Bouguer found the length of the degree at the
                    equator to be 362,932 English feet; and from the British arc, between Dunnose
                    and Clifton, the length of the degree is 364,970 feet, at the latitude of 52°
                    35'45". We have therefore Z = 362,932, Z' = 364,970, L = 0, L' = 52° 35' 45", by
                    substituting which in equation (9), there results</p>

                <p>The method of deducing the ellipticity and dimensions of the earth which has now
                    been explained, may be conveniently employed when the measured arcs are small;
                    but when the arcs are considerable (and it is necessary that they should extend
                    over several degrees, in order to give results deserving of confidence), we must
                    employ the more accurate expression of the arc found in equation (7); that is to
                    say, we must employ the whole arc measured, instead of the resulting length of a
                    single degree. Equation (7), when reduced to numbers, takes the form</p>

                    which <hi rend="italic">m, n,</hi> and the arc A, are numbers determined by

                <p>If the terrestrial meridian were a regular ellipse, the ellipticity deduced from
                    two measured arcs would be the same at every latitude. But it is found that no
                    two different measures that have yet been effected concur in giving exactly the
                    same figure to the meridian. Hence it becomes necessary to seek the most
                    probable mean among the different results. Each new measure affords a new
                    equation of condition, of the form of equation (10); and as the number of
                    unknown quantities remains the same, whatever may be the number of equations,
                    recourse must be had to the method of least squares, or some of the other
                    methods of combination employed by astronomers. In this way each individual
                    measurement serves to correct the results given by the former ones.</p>

                    dimensions and eccentricity of the osculating spheroid at that place. But,
                    speaking generally, the exact determination of the differences of longitude is
                    attended with so much uncertainty, that the results obtained from the comparison
                    of arcs of parallel, either with one another or with arcs of meridian, cannot be
                    relied on with much confidence. It is consequently unnecessary to point out the
                    equations to be employed in deducing the ellipticity from the comparison of two
                    arcs of parallel.</p>
                <p>We shall now proceed to apply the above formulas to the results of the principal
                    geodetic measurements that have been executed in different countries. The
                    following table contains twenty arcs of meridian, between the equator and 66° of
                    north latitude; and as they have all been determined with the utmost attention
                    to every circumstance which could be supposed to affect their accuracy, they may
                    be regarded as decidedly the best elements we yet possess for the solution of
                    the problem of the figure of the earth. We have excluded all the ancient arcs
                    except that of Bouguer, and also some recent ones, where the locality was
                    unfavourable. They are all reduced to the level of the sea. In reducing the
                    foreign measures, the metre has been assumed (according to Captain Kater’s
                    determination) = 3∙280899 feet, and the toise = 6 ’ 394596 feet, of
                    Schuckburgh’s scale. The original documents are given in the various works to
                    which reference has been made in the first section of this article.</p>

                <p>From any two of these equations we may deduce values of <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">e;</hi> but, as might be expected, the results are found
                    to be very different according as different arcs are selected for comparison. We
                    may also add any number of the equations together, for instance Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6,
                    and 7, the sum of which forms the continuous arc measured in India by Colonel
                    Lambton and Captain Everest: or Nos. 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, which form the French
                    are from Dunkirk to Formentera. But as it is impossible to satisfy at once all
                    the equations by any value whatever that can be assigned to <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> and e, in order to exclude all arbitrary hypotheses, it is necessary to
                    suppose all the observations to have been alike good, and deduce values of <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> from a combination of the
                    whole. The best method of effecting the combination is that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >minimum squares,</hi> the principle of which is contained in the following
                    rule: Multiply all the terms of each of the proposed equations by the
                    co-efficient of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in that equation, taken with its proper
                    sign, and make the sum of all the products equal to zero. This will give an
                    equation in which the sum of the squares of the errors is a minimum in respect
                    of <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Multiply then each equation by the co-efficient of
                    <hi rend="italic">ac</hi> in that equation, and make the sum of all the products
                    = 0. This will give a second equation, in which the sum of the squares of the
                    errors is a minimum in respect of <hi rend="italic">ae.</hi> From the two
                    equations thus obtained, the values of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ae,</hi> and consequentlye, are found in the usual manner. The
                    operation is extremely laborious when the equations are numerous, but it is
                    attended with no difficulty.</p>
                <p>By combining the above twenty equations in the manner now described, Μ. Schmidt
                    obtained the following results, which are given in No. 213 of Schumacher’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Astronomische Nachrichten,</hi> p.37l; and they are unquestionably
                    entitled to be regarded as the best determination of the magnitude and figure of
                    the earth which has been found from the operations that have been undertaken up
                    to the present time for the measurement of meridional arcs.</p>

                <p>From this table we see that the degrees increase gradually from the equator to
                    the pole; but the increase is by no means regular. It occurs in some instances
                    that the degrees appear to diminish on going northward; but these anomalies must
                    be ascribed either to errors in the observations or to local irregularity of
                    form or density. The most probable source of error is in the latitudes, first,
                    on account of the difficulty of the observation to the requisite degree of
                    accuracy; and, secondly, on account of the irregularities in the density of the
                    exterior crust of the earth, which cause a deflexion of the plumb-line from the
                    true zenith. Hence the longest arcs are the best; for the probable error in the
                    determination of the difference of latitudes is the same whether the arcs are
                    great or small. An error of 1" in the latitude corresponds to abouta hundred
                    feet on the ground.</p>
                <p>If we compare the degree found by some of .the measures which have been rejected
                    from the foregoing table, with the degree computed for the same latitudes, we
                    shal find the errors or anomalies much greater.</p>

                <p>Two of these differences are considerably greater than <hi rend="subscript">
                    a</hi> ny in the preceding table. Lacaille’s arc corresponds to one in the
                    northern hemisphere at a higher latitude by 11°, whence it has been inferred
                    that the two hemispheres are not exactly similar. The measurement of Plana and
                    Carlini appears to have been excellent; but both extremities of the arc were in
                    the immediate vicinity of lofty mountain ranges, and the very great deviation
                    from the mean result of the other measures can only be accounted for by the
                    disturbing effects of local attraction. Maupertuis arc was never reckoned of
                    much value, as it was evident from the first that there was an error in the
                    determination of the latitudes.</p>

                <p>It is remarkable that all these errors are affected with the same sign; and the
                    circumstance might seem to strengthen a conclusion indicated by a comparison of
                    the errors of the meridional arcs, namely, that the meridional curve is not
                    exactly an ellipse, but protuberant between the latitudes of 40° and 52°; in
                    consequence of which the degrees of meridian are shorter, and the degrees of
                    parallel longer between those latitudes, than if the earth were a regular
                    ellipsoid. There is no reason to infer that the meridians are not similar, or
                    that the earth is not a solid of revolution.</p>

                <p>THEORETICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE FIGURE OF THE EARTH FROM THE LAWS OF
                    HYDROSTATICS.</p>
                <p>In attempting to deduce the figure of the earth from the general laws of
                    hydrostatic equilibrium, we suppose the whole mass to have been originally
                    fluid, or in such a state, that all its molecules were at liberty to obey the
                    forces by which they are impelled. These forces are, líŕ, the attraction of the
                    molecules on one another, according to the Newtonian law; and, <hi rend="italic"
                    >%dly,</hi> the centrifugal force generated by the revolution of the whole mass
                    about a fixed axis; and the problem is, to determine the form which such a body,
                    under the influence of these forces, would ultimately take. In order to obtain a
                    solution of the question thus generally enunciated, it is necessary to know, <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori,</hi> the attractions of the different parts of the fluid
                    body on one another. But the attraction of its different parts depends on their
                    mutual arrangement; that is to say, on the internal constitution of the body or
                    the variations of its density, and also on its form. Of the density in the
                    interior of the earth we know little; and its form is the very element we are
                    seeking to determine. This mutual dependence of the attraction of the mass on
                    its form, and of its form on its attraction, renders it necessary to have
                    recourse to certain arbitrary assumptions respecting the primitive figure of the
                    earth and its internal structure, in order to determine<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193752590" xml:id="kp-eb0709-2590-0564"/> the relation of the forces
                    with which its different parts attract each other, and thence assign its figure,
                    and the variations of gravity at the different points of its surface.</p>
                <p>A fluid mass whose particles are impelled by no other forces than those which
                    result from their mutual attractions, would assume (it is natural to suppose)
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> spherical form. Such at least would be a figure of
                    equilibrium; for the surface of the sphere being everywhere at right angles to
                    the directions of the attracting forces, which in this case all pass through the
                    centre of gravity, a particle placed on its surface would have no tendency to
                    move along the surface in any direction. But if the mass is made to revolve, the
                    rotation gives rise to an extraneous force, tending to cause every particle to
                    recede from the axis, and which acts with an energy on each particle directly
                    proportional to the distance of the particle from the axis. Hence the attraction
                    of the mass on each particle, in the direction perpendicular to the axis of
                    rotation, is diminished, and the diminution is greatest towards the equatorial
                    parts, where the distance from the axis is greatest. In order, therefore, that
                    the equilibrium may be restored, an accumulation of matter must take place about
                    the equator, so that the mass will bulge out in that quarter, and become
                    flattened at the poles, where the force of attraction is not counteracted. This
                    consideration led Newton to suppose the figure of the earth to be that of an
                    oblate spheroid, or the figure that is generated by the revolution of an ellipse
                    about its shorter axis.</p>
                <p>Before proceeding with the investigation, it will be proper to inquire what are
                    the conditions necessary to ensure the equilibrium of a mass of fluid matter,
                    the particles of which are acted on by their mutual attractions and the
                    centrifugal force of rotation. Conceive the particles of a body A to be
                    solicited by accelerating forces of any kind. Suppose <hi rend="italic">dm</hi>
                    (which may be regarded as a rectangular parallelepipedon, having its faces
                    parallel to the planes of the co-ordinates) to be one of the molecules of the
                    mass, and <hi rend="italic">x, y, z,</hi> the co-ordinates of the solid angle
                    nearest the origin; then, putting <hi rend="italic">k</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> the density of the mass, we shall have <hi rend="italic">dm = h . dxdy
                    dz.</hi> Let X, Y, Z be the accelerating forces acting on <hi rend="italic"
                    >dm</hi> in the direction parallel to the respective axes of the co-ordinates,
                    then the motive forces in the direction of the same axes will be respectively
                    <hi rend="italic">Xdm, Υdnι, Zdm.</hi></p>
                <p>Now let <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the pressure in the
                    direction of the axis of <hi rend="italic">X,</hi> referred to the unit of

                    <hi rend="italic">dydz</hi> of the element <hi rend="italic">dm.</hi> But <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> may be regarded as a function of <hi rend="italic">x, y,
                    z</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> therefore at the point whose co-ordinates are <hi
                    rend="italic">x + dx, y, z,</hi> the pressure on the unit of surface is <hi
                    rend="italic">p +</hi> ŵ, and consequently the whole pressure on the face of <hi

                    of the axis of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> by the two forces <hi rend="italic">p .

                    may remain at rest, this last force or pressure must be exactly balanced by the
                    motive force acting in the direction of the same axis; that is to say, we must
                    have <hi rend="italic">~ dxdydz =</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">X&lt;Zmi.</hi> In the
                    same manner, we must have <hi rend="italic">~ dxdydz =</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    '</hi></p>
                <p>Let the first of these equations be multiplied by <hi rend="italic">dχ,</hi> the
                    second by <hi rend="italic">dy,</hi> and the third by <hi rend="italic">dz,</hi>
                    the sum of the products gives <hi rend="italic">dp = h (Xdx + Υdy +
                    Zdz)...............(⅛).</hi> The first member of this equation being an exact
                    differential, it is necessary, in order that the equilibrium be possible, that
                    the second member be an exact differential likewise. This, therefore, is a
                    condition which must be satisfied.</p>
                <p>At the surface of the mass the pressure <hi rend="italic">p</hi> vanishes, and
                    equation <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> becomes</p>
                <p>0 = <hi rend="italic">k (Xdx + Υdy + Zdz),</hi> which expresses that the
                    resultant of the three forces X, Y, Z, is perpendicular to the surface.</p>
                <p>If the fluid is homogeneous, the density <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is constant,
                    and may be represented by unit. In this case equation (6) becomes <hi
                    rend="italic">dp = Xdx + Υdy + Zdz,</hi> and the equation of the surface is <hi
                    rend="italic">J(Xdx + Υdy +</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">ZćZc)</hi> = constant.</p>
                <p>It will be remarked that this last equation does not belong merely to the
                    exterior surface or to the homogeneous fluid: by giving a different value to the
                    constant it will form the equation of any surface in the interior of a mass of
                    heterogeneous fluid, at every point of which the pressure or the density is the
                    same. For let the second member of equation (6) be a complete differential, and
                    equal to <hi rend="italic">kdf.</hi> We have then <hi rend="italic">dp</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">hdf,</hi> whence <hi rend="italic">h</hi>
                    is necessarily a function of <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and/. But on integrating
                    the equation,/ will be given in a function ofy&gt;, consequently <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> must be a function of <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> When
                    therefore <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is constant, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> must be
                    constant, or <hi rend="italic">dp</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> 0; hence <hi
                    rend="italic">J*</hi><hi rend="italic">(Xdx + Ydy + Zdz)</hi> = constant.</p>
                <p>The different surfaces defined by this equation all possess the common property
                    of intersecting at every point the resultant of the accelerating forces X, Y, Z
                    at right angles; hence they are denominated <hi rend="italic">level
                    surfaces.</hi></p>
                <p>It follows, therefore, that when the above equation is satisfied, two conditions
                    necessary to the equilibrium are fulfilled; namely, that the resultant of all
                    the forces urging any particle in the interior of the mass is perpendicular to
                    the level surface passing through that particle; and that the force acting on
                    any particle of the surface is perpendicular to the surface. When the fluid is
                    homogeneous, or the density equal throughout the mass, the first of these
                    conditions is always satisfied, and the second is of itself sufficient. Writers
                    on this subject have therefore in general considered that all the conditions
                    necessary to ensure the equilibrium of a fluid mass, whether homogeneous or
                    heterogeneous, revolving about a fixed axis, are comprehended in the single
                    equation <hi rend="italic">J'</hi><hi rend="italic">(Xdx + Υdy + Zdz) =</hi>
                    constant; and this is the view which has been taken of the question by Clairaut,
                    D’Alembert, Lagrange, Laplace, Legendre, and Poisson. It has, however, been
                    demonstrated by Mr Ivory, in an elaborate paper in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophic Transactions for</hi> 1824, that when, as in the case of t' <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ιe</hi> earth, a mutual attraction exists among the
                    constituent molecules of the mass, another condition must be fulfilled, and that
                    the equilibrium will not necessarily take place, unless the figure of the mass
                    is such, that any “interior body of the fluid, bounded by a level surface, be

                    is to that with which a particle at P is attracted in the same direction as CE
                    to CP, or <hi rend="italic">x</hi> to a; therefore the forceat E P . —. Now if
                    we suppose the area of a section of the column perpendicular to the axis = 1,
                    the mass of the element of the column will be 1 × <hi rend="italic">dx =

                    But the centrifugal force at F is to that at Q as CF to CQ, or as <hi

                    attracts D in the direction DF, perpendicular to the plane of the equator, is to

                <p>Within the limits to which the present article must necessarily be confined, it
                    would be in vain to attempt to give a general solution of this very intricate
                    problem. We shall therefore content ourselves with demonstrating that all the
                    conditions of equilibrium will be satisfied, if the figure of the earth (assumed
                    to be fluid) is that of a spheroid of revolution of small ellipticity. We shall,
                    first, suppose the fluid to be homogeneous; and, secondly, that its density is

                <p>This equation being independent of the form of the canal, and of the situation of

                    that there are two, and only two, real and positive roots of the equation (1).
                    Thus there are two forms of the oblate spheroid, which, for a given velocity of

                    the spheroid is extremely flattened.</p>
                <p>In the preceding propositions it has been demonstrated that a fluid mass of
                    uniform density revolving about a fixed axis will be <hi rend="italic">in
                    equilibria,</hi> if its form is that of an oblate spheroid, provided the
                    velocity of rotation does not exceed a certain limit, which has been
                    ascertained. But it has been remarked, that if the same relation exists between
                    the attraction and the centrifugal force as exists in the case of the earth, the
                    ellipticity of such a spheroid would be different from the actual ellipticity of
                    the earth,t as determined by observation. It follows that the terrestrial
                    spheroid must be heterogeneous, or of variable density; and this supposition is
                    rendered more probable by what is otherwise known of the nature of the earth.
                    The difficulties of the problem are however greatly increased in the case of a
                    heterogeneous fluid; indeed it is only brought within the power of analysis by
                    assuming that the form of the revolving mass differs very little from that of a
                    sphere, and that it is regularly composed of concentric layers, increasing in
                    density from the surface towards the centre, according to a determinate law.
                    Admitting these assumptions, it may be demonstrated that the oblate spheroid of
                    revolution is in this case also a figure of equilibrium.</p>
                <p>The demonstration will be greatly simplified by means of the two following
                    propositions respecting the attraction of homogeneous spheroids of small
                    ellipticity, and which are easily deduced from the properties demonstrated in

                <p>Thus the expression of the force with which a homogeneous spheroid attracts a
                    point placed without it has been found in finite terms. The ingenious process of
                    analysis by which this result, of very great importance in the theory of the
                    figures of the planets, has been obtained, is one of the many discoveries for
                    which mathematical science is indebted to Mr Ivory.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prop.</hi> VII.—To find the measure of the forces with which
                    an oblate spheroid whose ellipticity is small, attracts a particle situated any
                    where on its surface, in the direction parallel to the axis, and in the
                    direction perpendicular to the axis, the density being variable.</p>
                <p>In the solution of this problem we suppose the spheroid to be composed of
                    infinitely thin concentric layers, bounded by spheroidal surfaces of different
                    ellipticities, and that the density is uniform for a single layer, but variable
                    from one layer to another.</p>
                <p>Let P'Q' (fig. 15) be the given spheroid, <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">, V</hi> its polar and
                    equatorial radii, and D the attracted point. LefD' be any point within the
                    spheroid P'Q', and PQD' be a spheroidal surface at every point of which the
                    density is the same, <hi rend="italic">α, b</hi> its polar and equatorial radii,
                    and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> its ellipticity. Also let <hi rend="italic">p,
                    q</hi> be another spheroidal surface indefinitely near PQ, of which the polar
                    radius <hi rend="italic">Cp = a + da,</hi> the equatorial <hi rend="italic">Cq =
                    b + db,</hi> and the ellipticity = <hi rend="italic">e + de.</hi> Between the
                    two surfaces PQ and <hi rend="italic">pq</hi> the density <hi rend="italic"
                    >h</hi> may be supposed constant.</p>
                <p>In order to find the attraction of the whole spheroid on D, we must first find
                    expressions in terms of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> for the forces with which D is
                    attracted by the elementary layer PQp*∕; the integration of these expressions
                    from <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = 0 to <hi rend="italic">a = a</hi> ’ will give
                    the attractions of the spheroid.</p>
                <p>Conceive for a moment the density of the spheroid CPQ to be uniform and = <hi
                    rend="italic">h.</hi> The forces X and Y with which this spheroid attracts D are
                    given by the last proposition, and the forces with which <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cpq</hi> attracts D will be found by substituting <hi rend="italic">a + da</hi>
                    for <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e + de</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> in the same expressions for X and Y. Now, as the
                    ellipticity varies from C to P', <hi rend="italic">e</hi> may be regarded as a
                    function of a; its variation is consequently included in the variation of <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> and the attractions of the spheroid <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cpq</hi> hence become <hi rend="italic subscript"> v 1</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The difference between the attractions of the spheroids <hi rend="italic"

                    THE EARTH AS DETERMINED BY OBSERVATIONS OF THE PENDULUM.As the various methods
                    of determining the length of a pendulum which makes a given number of vibrations
                    in a mean solar day, and the corrections that are required to reduce the
                    observations to the same circumstances in respect of altitude, temperature,
                    barometric pressure, &amp;c. form the subject of a separate article, we shall
                    here limit ourselves to a brief abstract of the results of some of the latest
                    and best observations.The ellipticity of the earth is deduced from the observed
                    number of vibrations made by an invariable pendulum of a given length at
                    different latitudes, by means of the theorem of Clairaut. Let N — the number of
                    oscillations made by a pendulum at the equator in a mean solar day, N' = the
                    number of oscillations made by the same pendulum at the latitude <hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> then Q. representing, as before,
                    the gravitation at the equator, and U the gravitation at latitude <hi
                    rend="italic">l,</hi> we have, by the last proposition in the preceding
                    section,U = Q (1 + n sin. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Γ).</hi> But by the property of the invariable pendulum, the square of the
                    number of vibrations is directly proportioned to the force of gravitation;
                    therefore U: Q = N' <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>: N <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>, whence N' <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = N <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> (1 + <hi rend="italic">n</hi> sin. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> Z).5
                    5In this equation <hi rend="italic">n = -m-e~</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> q
                    q</hi><hi rend="italic">-- e;</hi> therefore, as N' <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> is given by observation at any station, we can, by combining the results
                    at two different latitudes, determine N and <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> and
                    consequently <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> The pendulum gives no information
                    respecting the magnitude of the earth.Instead of N and N', we might substitute
                    in the above equation the lengths of the seconds pendulum at the equator, and
                    the latitude <hi rend="italic">l</hi> (the length of the seconds pendulum being
                    also directly proportional to the intensity of gravity); but as the invariable
                    pendulum is now almost universally employed for the measurement of the
                    variations of gravity, the formula under the above form is more immediately
                    applicable to the results of observation. The absolute length of the pendulum
                    (which is not very easily determined) has no concern with the present ques-For
                    the purpose of exhibiting the variations of gravity, we shall confine our
                    attention to the results that have been found from observations with the
                    invariable pendulum. The results given by pendulums of a different kind are
                    probably not less exact, but they are not directly comparable, on account of the
                    great uncertainty that remains respecting the correction that ought to be
                    applied for the buoyancy of the atmosphere.In the seventh volume of the <hi

                    French government in 1817, for the purpose of making scientific observations in
                    a voyage round the world. The stations at which the experiments were made were
                    the island of Rawak (near the coast of Guinea), Guam (one of the Ladrones), the
                    Isle of France, Mowi (one of the Sandwich Islands),, Rio Janeiro, Port Jackson,
                    Cape of Good Hope, Paris, and the Falkland Islands. <hi rend="italic">(

                    was dispatched to the South Seas, for the purpose, among other things, of
                    swinging the pendulum at various places. The stations at which experiments were
                    made were Ualan (one of the Caroline Isles), Guam, St Helena, Bonin Island (off
                    the south-east coast of Japan), Valparaiso, Greenwich, Petropaulouski, Sitka
                    (off the north-west coast of America), and Petersburg. (Mr Baily’s Report in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society,</hi> vol. vii.)</p>
                <p>14. Those of Captain Foster, in his last voyage, which commenced in 1828, and
                    which form perhaps the most valuable series of the whole. The observations were
                    made at fourteen different stations, principally in the southern hemisphere,
                    from the equator to the latitude of 63°. Captain Foster carried out with him
                    four pendulums, two of brass, one of iron, and one of copper, and at seven of
                    the stations all four were swung. The details are published at full length in
                    the volume of the <hi rend="italic">Astronomical Society &amp; Memoirs</hi> to
                    which we have already referred, with an excellent Report by Mr Baily.</p>
                <p>The results of all these observations are contained in the following table, in
                    which the observed number of vibrations at each station is corrected, for any
                    deviation from the standard temperature of 62°, or from the true correction for
                    the buoyancy of the atmosphere, and at-terwards reduced to a comparison with
                    Captain rosier-mean pendulum, assumed as making 86,400 vibrations in a mean
                    solar day at London.</p>

                    remark, that as the differences in the table present twenty-four alternations of
                    sign, the curve which represents all the observations intersects the meridian
                    having that ellipticity no less than twenty-four times along an arc of 152°
                    (from Spitzbergen to South Shetland), or, on an average, once for every 6į
                    degrees; and (with the exception of the island of Bonin) the deviations on the

                    ellipticity from fifty-one different observations, combined by the method of
                    least squares. Captain Foster’s observations are of course not included in the
                    table; but it contains those of Biot, made with a variable pendulum at different
                    stations along the French and British arcs of meridian, and more recently in
                    Italy and the Lipari Islands. The result gives <hi rend="italic">e</hi><hi

                <p>The differences between the observed and computed values are, in many instances
                    at least, too great to be ascribed entirely to errors of observation. They must,
                    therefore, be occasioned by real differences in the intensity of gravity,
                    arising either from variations in the density of the materials which compose the
                    exterior crust of the earth, or from local deviations of its form from that of
                    the regular spheroid. On attending to the preceding table it will be perceived
                    that the differences are generally in excess where the station is on small
                    islands, and especially if situated at a great distance from the main land. From
                    this it may be inferred, that such islands are composed of denser materials than
                    the general crust of the earth; but it is not improbable that part of this
                    effect may be occasioned by a difference of the level of the surface of the
                    ocean. On the shores of elevated continents, the direction of gravity is altered
                    by the action of the high land; and the surface of the water, which is
                    perpendicular to gravity, deviates from the regular curvature, and becomes
                    elevated above the general level of the ocean. Hence the apparent elevation is
                    less than the real elevation of the station, and the observed intensity of
                    gravity is consequently less than it was calculated to be. How far the
                    disturbing influence of this cause may affect the results, will be better
                    understood when we shall be furnished with numerous pendulum observations, made
                    in the interior of the large continents, and at a great distance from the
                    sea.</p>
                <p>All the pendulum experiments agree in giving a greater ellipticity to the earth
                    than that which is deduced from the comparison of arcs of meridian. To what
                    cause this discrepancy is to be assigned is by no means apparent. The geological
                    character of the country in the immediate neighbourhood of the station probably
                    exerts a considerable influence in accelerating or retarding the pendulum; but
                    the experiments have now been made at so many points, that we might expect to
                    find the effects of local irregularities almost entirely eliminated, and a much
                    nearer agreement between the results of the two methods of investigation than
                    actually exists. We can, however, have no difficulty in giving the preference to
                    the results of the geodetic measures.</p>
                <p>It was mentioned in the first section of this article that the ellipticity of the
                    earth may be deduced from certain inequalities in the motions of the moon, to
                    which it gives rise; but this part of the subject belongs to the theory of the
                    lunar perturbations. The ellipticity so deduced is about <hi rend="italic"
                    >ffţ,</hi> which agrees well with that given by the meridional arcs; and the
                    result has the advantage of being entirely independent of local disturbance.</p>
                <p>One conclusion cannot fail to be drawn from the results of this enquiry. However
                    irregular the surface of the earth may be in its details, its general form
                    agrees so nearly with the figure of hydrostatic equilibrium, that the agreement
                    cannot be regarded as fortuitous or accidental. The regular increase of gravity
                    from the equator to the poles, indicated by the pendulum experiments, also
                    proves that it is symmetrically constituted, or that the materials in its
                    interior are disposed about the centre of gravity in regular elliptical strata,
                    and arranged according to the order of density. The earth must therefore have
                    taken its present form while its particles were at liberty to arrange themselves
                    in obedience to the forces arising from thθn ’ mutual attractions and from the
                    rotation; in other words, it must have existed at some period of time in a state
                    of fluidity. This inference, which so many geological facts tend to confirm, may
                    be extended to all the other planets.</p>
