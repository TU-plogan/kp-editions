                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">FLANEL, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Flannel</hi></label>, a kind
                    of slight, loose, woollen stuff, composed of a woof and warp, and woven on a
                    loom with two treddles, after the manner of baize.</p>
                <p>Dr Black assigns as a reason why flannel and other substances of the same kind
                    keep the body warm, that they compose a rare and spongy mass, the fibres of
                    which touch each other so lightly, that the heat moves slowly through the
                    interstices, which being filled only with air, and that too in a stagnant state,
                    give little assistance in conducting the heat. From the experiments of Count
                    Rumford, it appears that there is no relation between the power which the
                    substances usually worn as clothing have of absorbing moisture, and that of
                    keeping the body warm. Having provided a quantity of each of these substances
                    mentioned below, he exposed them, spread out upon clean china plates, for the
                    space of twenty-four hours, to the warm and dry air of a room which had been
                    heated by a German stove for several months, and during the preceding six hours
                    had raised the thermometer to 85° of Fahrenheit; after which he weighed equal
                    quantities of the different substances with a very accurate balance. They were
                    then spread out upon a china plate, and removed into a very large uninhabited
                    room upon the second floor, where they were exposed forty-eight hours upon a
                    table placed in the middle of the room, the air of which was at 45° of
                    Fahrenheit. At the end of this time they were weighed, and then removed into a
                    damp cellar, where they were placed on a table in the middle of the vault, the
                    air of which was at the temperature of 45°, and, by the hygrometer, seemed to be
                    fully saturated with moisture. In this situation they were suffered to remain
                    three days and three nights, the vault being all the while hung round with wet
                    linen cloths, to render the air as completely damp as possible. At the end of
                    three days they were weighed, and the weights at the different times were found
                    as in the following table :—</p>

                <p>In regard to these experiments our author observes, ţ a though linen, from the
                    apparent ease with which it receives dampness from the atmosphere, seems to have
                    a much greater attraction for water than any other, yet it would appear,from
                    what is related above, that those bodies which receive water in its unelastic
                    form with the greatest ease, or a most easily wet, are not those which in all
                    cases attract the humidity of the atmosphere with the greatest avidity.
                    “Perhaps,” says he, “the apparent dampness of linen to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193753253" xml:id="kp-eb0709-3253-0615"/>the touch arises more from
                    the ease with which that substance parts with the water it contains, than from
                    the quantity of water it actually holds; in the same manner as a body appears
                    hot to the touch, in consequence of its parting freely with its heat; while
                    another body which is really at the same temperature, but which withholds its
                    heat with great obstinacy, affects the sense of feeling much less violently. It
                    is well known that woollen clothes, such as flannels, &amp;c. worn next the
                    skin, greatly promote insensible perspiration. May not this arise principally
                    from the strong attraction which subsists between wool and the watery vapour
                    which is continually issuing from the human body? That it does not depend
                    entirely on the warmth of that covering, is clear; for the same degree of warmth
                    produced by wearing more clothing of a different kind, does not produce the same
                    effect. The perspiration of the human body being absorbed by a covering of
                    flannel, it is immediately distributed through the whole thickness of that
                    substance, and by that means exposed, by a very large surface, to be earned off
                    by the atmosphere; and the loss of this watery vapour which the flannel sustains
                    on the one side by evaporation, being immediately restored from the other, in
                    consequence of the strong attraction between the flannel and this vapour, the
                    pores of the skin are disencumbered, and they are continually surrounded by a
                    dry and salubrious atmosphere.”</p>
                <p>Our author expresses his surprise that the custom of wearing flannel next the
                    skin should not have prevailed more universally. He is confident it would
                    prevent a number of diseases; and he thinks there is no greater luxury than the
                    comfortable sensation which arises from wearing it, especially after one is a
                    little accustomed to it. “It is a mistaken notion,” says he, “that it is too
                    warm a clothing for summer. I have worn it in the hottest climates, and at all
                    seasons of the year, and never found the least inconvenience from it. It is the
                    warm bath of perspiration confined by a linen shirt wet with sweat, which
                    renders the summer heats of southern climates so unsupportable; but flannel
                    promotes perspiration, and favours its evaporation; and evaporation, as is well
                    known, produces positive cold.</p>
                <p>It has been observed that new flannel, after some time wearing, acquires the
                    property of shining in the dark, but loses it on being washed. <hi rend="italic"
