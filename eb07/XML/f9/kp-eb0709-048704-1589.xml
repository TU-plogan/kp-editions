                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    clergyman and a man of otters, belonging to the protestant nonconformists, was
                    descended from people of respectability in North Wales, and first drew breath at
                    Shrewsbury, in the year 1714. Dr Charles Owen was for some time his tutor; but
                    previous-y to the period when he was under that master, he had been at a school
                    in Llanegrin. His parents from the first having designed him for the ministry,
                    he was in 1730 sent to prosecute his studies under Dr Doddridge at Northampton.
                    Here, by the rectitude of his conduct and wonderful proficiency, he gained the
                    esteem of that excellent person, who always spoke of him in the most respectful
                    terms. Having completed his academical studies, Mr <hi rend="superscript">

                    was at the same time chosen minister of a dissenting congregation m that
                    village. But notwithstanding the gratitude with '' nch Mr Coward deserves to be
                    remembered by many θ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> his charitable institutions,
                    he had certain peculiarities <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> ^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> em</hi> po <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> which rendered him
                    a very disagreeable companion. His doors were shut at an uncommonly early hour
                    of the night, and neither visitor nor resident could afterwards obtain
                    admission. Mr Farmer having one evening been detained a little beyond that hour,
                    found the doors shut against him, and was under the necessity of applying to a
                    Mr William Snell, solicitor, a man of eminence, and possessed of many excellent
                    qualifications. In the family of this gentleman he remained for about thirty
                    years, living in the greatest friendship and intimacy. Here also he gradually
                    prepared those valuable treatises^and dissertations which were afterwards given
                    to the public, and which acquired him so much celebrity as a man of letters. He
                    likewise continued to discharge the duties of his ministerial function to the
                    people of Walthamstow.</p>
                <p>When a day of thanksgiving was appointed for the suppression of the rebellion in
                    1745, Mr Farmer preached a sermon on that occasion, which was published the
                    following year. His next work was of much greater importance, being entitled, An
                    Inquiry into the Nature and Design of our Lord’s Temptation in the Wilderness.
                    In this production it was the design of Mr Farmer to prove that the whole was
                    transacted in vision, the different stages of which were intended to point out
                    to him the difficulties and duties of his subsequent ministry. The originality
                    of thought and profound erudition which this work displayed, soon obtained for
                    it a very extensive circulation, and called forth the exertions of those who
                    were of an opposite opinion. It received one reply under the title of Christ’s
                    Temptations real Facts, which possessed considerable merit, but was much
                    inferior to Mr Farmer’s in energy of expression, depth of thinking, and force of
                    argument. But the most masterly, perhaps, of all Mr Farmer’s literary
                    productions was his Dissertation on Miracles, designed to show that they are
                    arguments of a divine interposition, and absolute proofs of the mission and
                    doctrine of a prophet; a work which was first published in the year 1771. But as
                    great talents are frequently envied, so this work of Mr Farmer was declared by
                    some to have been chiefly borrowed from Lemoine’s treatise on the same subject;
                    slander which he refuted in a very able and satisfactory manner. In the year
                    1775 he published his celebrated Essay on the Demoniacs of the New Testament,
                    which may be considered as the completion of the design he had in view by his
                    dissertation on miracles. The hypothesis which he adopted had formerly been
                    defended with great ability by Mede, Sykes, Lardner, and others; but it was
                    reserved for the critical acuteness of Mr Farmer to free it from those
                    difficulties with which it was surrounded, and to place the subject in a much
                    clearer light. His essay on demoniacs was successively attacked by Dr
                    Worthington and Mr Fell, both of them men of considerable erudition, but much
                    inferior in ability to their antagonist.</p>
                <p>Mr Farmer having continued for several years the sole pastor of the congregation
                    at Walthamstow, an able colleague was appointed him in 1761, in consequence of
                    which he became the afternoon preacher to the congregation of Salter’s Hall, in
                    the city of London, and soon afterwards the Tuesday lecturer at the same place.
                    But he resigned his ministerial employments as he advanced in years, a
                    circumstance which the people committed to his charge very much regretted. In
                    the year 1785 an affection in his eyes nearly deprived him of sight, but by
                    means of a surgical operation he was for some time enabled to resume his
                    studies. Mortality is, however, the inevitable lot of all men, and in 1787 the
                    growing infirmities of Mr Farmer brought him to the grave, in the seventy-third
                    year of his age.</p>

                    which place he was born in the year 1735. Here he <pb break="no"

                    education, and afterwards became a student at Cambridge, and pensioner of
                    Emanuel College. He was considered as a young man well acquainted with books,
                    much esteemed among his friends, and looked upon as possessed of lively parts,
                    even before he had acquired any extraordinary reputation as a scholar. He was
                    made bachelor of arts in 1757, and master of arts in 1760. Several years after
                    this period, having been for some time a curate, he took the degree of bachelor
                    in divinity, and became a preacher at Whitehall. Besides the attention he paid
                    to the Greek and Roman authors, he prosecuted the study of books in his own
                    language, printed in black letter, and thus laid the foundation of a work which
                    added more to his literary reputation than any other performance. This was an
                    Essay on the Learning of Shakspeare, which he published in 1766. Men of letters
                    had long turned their attention to the learning of Shakspeare, in order to
                    ascertain its real extent. It could not be questioned that he was acquainted
                    with the history and mythology of the ancients, but it was still a matter of
                    dispute from what sources that acquaintance had been derived. To obviate this
                    difficulty, Mr Farmer’s knowledge of books enabled him to demonstrate, that
                    translations of the far greater part of the classical authors were to be met
                    with in the time of our distinguished dramatist; and as he showed that
                    Shakspeare had even copied the blunders and errors of these translations, he
                    made it manifest beyond the possibility of a rational doubt, that he was wholly
                    incapable of consulting the originals. This essay passed through three editions
                    in a very short time, and was much admired for the sprightliness of its
                    composition, whilst the readers of it were in general persuaded that he had
                    fully established his point This performance brought him into notice, and became
                    extremely favourable to his professional advancement. By the influence of Bishop
                    Hurd, he procured the chancellorship and a prebend in the cathedral of
                    Lichfield; and in 1775 he was elected master of Emanuel College, and took the
                    degree of doctor in divinity. He was soon afterwards appointed principal
                    librarian to the university, and served in turn the office of vice-chancellor.
                    He was made prebendary of Canterbury by Lord North, at that time prime minister,
                    and Mr Pitt twice offered him a bishopric; but the constraints and solemnity of
                    the episcopal character were not congenial to his natural temper, on which
                    account he declined the offer, and having resigned his office as prebendary, he
                    accepted of a residentiaryship of St Paul’s. This obliged him to reside three
                    months annually in London, which he spent with equal pleasure and advantage in
                    the society of literary men. From nature z he inherited a fund of good humour,
                    and was of such an obliging turn, that he buried party spirit in the
                    satisfaction which he found in the performance of beneficent actions. Though in
                    general an enemy to reforms of every kind, and anxious to preserve things as
                    they were, both in church and state, he was nevertheless instrumental in
                    amending the police of Cambridge, especially as it related to the paving and
                    lighting of the streets. At his instigation also, monumental sculpture was
                    admitted into the cathedral of St Paul’s, and will continue to exhibit a
                    striking proof of national gratitude, as well as serve to cover the nakedness of
                    the walls.It was at one time the intention of Dr Farmer to publish a history of
                    the town and antiquities of Leicester; but either his independent circumstances,
                    or a degree of native indolence, made him relinquish the design, and the few
                    materials which he had collected were therefore &lt;nven to Mr John Nichols, at
                    that time engaged in an elaborate work on the same subject. After a painful
                    illness of some length, Dr Farmer died at Emanuel College in the month of
                    September 1797, in the sixty-second year of his age. Dr Parr wrote an epitaph
                    for his tombstone, in which we find the following testimony to his worth: <hi
