                    latitude, and bounded by the River and Frith of Tay on the north, by the German
                    Ocean on the east, by the Frith of Forth on the south, and by parts of Kinross,
                    Perth, and Clackmannan on the west. Its greatest length is about fifty miles,
                    and its greatest breadth about twenty miles; but its medium length from east to
                    west is only about thirty-six miles, and its breadth from north to south about
                    fourteen miles. Its area, therefore, contains about 504 square miles, or 322,560
                    English acres.</p><p>The most prominent features in Fifeshire, when viewed at a distance from the
                    south, are the two Lomond Hills, in the middle of the county, the westmost of
                    which rises 1721 feet above the level of the sea; Largo Law, farther east, 952
                    feet; and Kelly Law, 810 feet. Besides these, there are numerous other
                    elevations scattered throughout the county; and indeed it is everywhere found to
                    present a pleasant variety of hill and valley, stretching in general from west
                    to east, parallel to the Tay and the Forth. The principal valley is that through
                    which the river Eden flows, and is called the Howe of Fife. It lies to the north
                    of the Lomond range of hills, and divides the county into the northern and
                    southern portions. The valleys of the Leven and the Ore, and the valleys
                    connected with, or as it were opening into, the Howe of Fife, are of much
                    smaller extent and appearance. The hills and country on the north of the Howe of
                    Fife seem to be a continuation of the Ochil Hills, and have been considered by
                    geologists as belonging to the old red sandstone formation. The prevailing rocks
                    found there are red and white sandstone, amygdaloid, compact felspar, claystone,
                    clinkstone, greenstone, basalt, traptuff, and wacke. Limestone is also found
                    near Newburgh, and shell marl in abundance at Rossie and Lords Carnie.</p><p>The mineral structure of the Howe of Fife, and of some of the other valleys, has
                    never yet been minutely explored. Sandstone quarries, however, have been opened
                    at different <pb break="no" facs="nls:193752317" xml:id="kp-eb0709-2317-0543"/>places, and here and there are to be seen
                    eminences of ' gravel regularly stratified. The rocks of the southern division
                    of Fifeshire chiefly belong to the coal formation of geologists, and form a
                    portion of the great coal field of the Forth. Here glance coal, or blind coal as
                    it is sometimes called, is met with occasionally; and slate coal, pitch coal,
                    and cannel coal, are occasionally found together in the same bed, and sometimes
                    in separate strata in the same pit.</p><p>From a charter dated in March 1291, it would appear that coal has been worked in
                    this county for more than five centuries. William de Oberville there grants
                    liberty to the convent of Dunfermline to open a coal-pit in his lands of
                    Pityncreiff. But it has been alleged that this is not the first instance of a
                    Scottish charter containing a right to work coal; for one dated 1284-85 is said
                    to exist, from which it may be inferred that coal was worked in the lands of
                    Tranent before that period. The pincipal coal works in the county at present are
                    those in the parishes of Dunfermline, Dysart, Wemyss, and Markinch; but coal is
                    also worked at present, or has been so formerly, in the parishes of Torryburn,
                    Inverkeithing, Dalgety, Burntisland, Abbotshall, Auchterderran, Scoonie, Largo,
                    and Pittenweem.</p><p>In the southern division of Fifeshire limestone is aiso abundant. The lime works
                    at Charleston, belonging to the Earl of Elgin, are perhaps the greatest in
                    Scotland. Upwards of 100,000 tons are said to be raised annually in his
                    lordship’s quarries; which quantity is either shipped or sold in its native
                    state, or after being caleined. The Carron Company also work out extensively the
                    lime on their estate of Newbigging, in the parish of Burntisland, and ship it at
                    the harbour of Starleyburn, on the Forth, for their works at Carron, where it is
                    used for smelting iron. The great iron work on the Devon is also supplied for a
                    similar purpose with limestone from Whinnyhall, in the parish of Burntisland.
                    The limestone in the interior of the county is likewise transported across the
                    Howe of Fife, and by the way of Newburgh, to the Carse of Gowrie, and
                    Forfarshire and Perthshire.</p><p>Sandstone abounds in the southern division of the county; and, in many places, it
                    is of a fine grain and durable nature. The pincipal quarry in the county is at
                    Cullello, in the parish of Aberdour. The stone obtained from it, in consequence
                    of its superior quality, has been used for some of the finest buildings in
                    Edinburgh, as well as carried over land to great distances. Ironstone also
                    abounds in the coal field, and was once worked extensively at Balgonie, where it
                    was smelted. But it is now chiefly worked at Dysart, and sold to the Carron
                    Company. The other rocks found in this coal field are bituminous shale, slate
                    clay, flinty slate, wacke, traptuff, amygdaloid, greenstone, and basalt. Stones
                    somewhat resembling the precious garnet are sometimes found imbedded in the
                    traptnff at Ely, and are known by the name of the Ely rubies. Copper and zinc
                    are also said to have been met with in different places, and lead has been
                    worked in the Lomond Hills. Marl is also often found in the marshes and in the
                    lakes, and sometimes in dry seasons it is carried away for agricultural
                    purposes.</p><p>There are none of the mineral springs in the county so remarkable as to be at
                    present frequented as watering places. those which arise in the coal fields are
                    frequently chalybeate. One of the two mineral springs at Dysart yields a
                    chalybeate water of considerable strength. In the Howe °l Fife springs issuing
                    from the sandstone or gravel are said to be frequently saline. But in the
                    portions of the county where the trap-rocks abound, the springs, whatever
                    virtues they are supposed to possess, seldom yield any thing <hi rend="superscript"> 5ut</hi> pure water. From the Inkcraig of Carnock, adjoining
                    to a dam dike, there is said to issue a spring of petroleum, <hi rend="superscript"> ro</hi> 5J which there constantly drops a liquid resembling
                    ink.</p><p>the only streams of any note in the county are the Leven and the Eden. The
                    former, which issues from Loeh Leven, in Kinross-shire, flows eastward, through
                    a beautiful strath, by Leslie, Balgonie, and Balfour, and, after a course of
                    about twelve miles, during which it receives the Lothrie and the Orr, falls into
                    the Frith of Forth at the town of Leven. From the declivity of its channel, it
                    is well fitted for impelling machinery; and accordingly a great many mills and
                    other works have been erected on its banks. An act of parliament was lately
                    obtained, the chief object of which was the erection of works and the
                    construction of mechanism, to regulate the rise or fall of the water in the
                    lake, and to restrain or increase the flow of the river for the benefit of the
                    bleachfields and other manufactories erected upon its banks; and these objects
                    have been accomplished at a sum considerably exceeding L.30,000. The Leven
                    abounds in salmon and sea trout, and where it falls into the sea there is a
                    salmon fishery. The Eden is formed by the confluence of several small streams in
                    the parish of Strathmiglo on the west, near the boundary of Fife with
                    Kinross-shire, and winding slowly through the level valley, and sometimes
                    overflowing its banks, passes the town of Cupar, and loses itself in the German
                    Ocean about eighteen miles from its source. It contains trout, pike, and eels,
                    and has also a salmon fishery where it discharges itself into the sea. The Guard
                    Bridge over this river, consisting of six arches, was built in the beginning of
                    the fifteenth century.</p><p>There are a number of lakes in the county, none of them very large, but some of
                    them very beautiful, such as those at Lindores,Kilconquhar, Kinghorn,
                    Loehgellie, Camilla, Lochfittie, and Otterston. Most of these lakes abound in
                    pike, perch, and eels, and are frequented by ducks, coots, and other water fowl.
                    The county once contained many more lakes, which have been drained at great
                    expense. Amongst these, the most considerable are the lakes of Rossie and
                    Lochore. Their beds are now used in raising valuable crops.</p><p>From the extensive drainage of the lakes, and the general improvement of the
                    county, its climate within the last forty years has been considerably
                    ameliorated, and is more free than formerly from the injurious fogs which used
                    to arise from the lochs and damp lands. At present the climate may be described
                    as mild. The harvests are early, and snow seldom lies long. As the direction of
                    the hills in the county is from east to west, it is much exposed to the easterly
                    winds, which often check vegetation in the spring months; and hoar frosts are
                    not unfrequent so late as the middle of June. The heaviest rains are from the
                    south-west, the south-east, and the north-east, and the winds from the two last
                    points bring the heaviest falls of snow. The driest and most steady weather
                    comes from the north-west and east.</p><p>Four fifths of the county at least are considered at present as arable, and the
                    remainder consists of hills, marshes, moors, lands covered with drifted sand and
                    chiefly bearing bent, extensive plantations, and high roads. Along the banks of
                    the Forth, above the trap-rocks, and the tract of country on the north of the
                    Howe of Fife, the soil is for the most part of excellent quality, being rich
                    loam, good clay, and gravel mixed with loamy earth. The soil from St Andrews to
                    the western parts of the county, where the strata underneath consist of
                    freestone, coal, or slate, is in general greatly inferior. The Howe of Fife
                    contains a considerable proportion of moor and moss, besides a tract of loam
                    partly deep and moist, and partly light and dry.</p><p>Within the last forty years extensive woods haye been planted in the county. For
                    instance, there is a forest of Scotch firs in the Howe of Fife, stretching for
                    many miles in length, on the Leven, Crawfurd, and other estates. I o-rests of
                    all kinds of trees have also been planted on the Raith estate, by Mr Ferguson,
                    the proprietor; and a princely ride along the Cullello Hills, of considerable
                    Iengt , <pb break="no" facs="nls:193752330" xml:id="kp-eb0709-2330-0544"/>was formed and adorned with plantation several
                    years ago by Mr Stuart of Dunearn. Indeed there is hardly a proprietor in
                    Fifeshire of the least consequence who has not contributed extensively to the
                    creation of forests and pleasure grounds on his estate. The oldest woods in Fife
                    are round Leslie House, the seat of the Earl of Rothes.</p><p>There are a great number of splendid mansions in the county belonging to the
                    nobility and gentry, and situated upon their estates. There are some of these
                    estates pretty large, and a greater number above L.500 Scotch of valuation than
                    in any other county in Scotland. But of the 638 estates which it contained in
                    1811, 491 were below that amount. The annual value of the real property, as
                    assessed in April 1815, amounted to L.405,770 sterling.</p><p>In the year 1811, the number of freeholders entitled to vote for a county member
                    of parliament was only 207. In 1832, the roll of these voters last made up under
                    the old law contained 234 names, and of this number sixty-three were considered
                    as paper voters; that is, two or three were apparent heirs of owners who were on
                    the roll, and the remainder of the sixty-three were merely nominal owners of the
                    estates from which they derived their privilege. The number of voters for the
                    county member at present on the roll, under the act 2 and 3 William IV. cap. 65,
                    is 2228.</p><p>The average size of the farms in Fife used to be about 150 acres; few of them
                    were what might be called large, the greater number were small. Of late years,
                    however, the tendency has been to join several together under one tenant. Many
                    of the farmers are now men of capital and enterprise; and under their direction,
                    supported by the liberality of the proprietors, the recent extensive
                    agricultural improvements, which are visible throughout every part of the
                    county, have been undertaken. The most improved implements of husbandry are
                    everywhere in use. Thrashing-mills are to be found on most farms, some of them
                    moved by horses, a few by wind-mills, others by waterwheels, and of late a
                    number by steam-engines, a power which seems to be in progress of superseding
                    all others. The farm-steadings, and the dwellings of the peasantry, have in a
                    great measure been renewed within the last thirty years, and much improved and
                    enlarged; and the greater part of the fields in the county are well enclosed
                    either with stone dikes or hedges.</p><p>All the farm crops common in the south of Scotland are cultivated here upon a
                    large scale, and almost always according to the most approved system. Flax is
                    now seldom raised. The crops commonly cultivated are, different kinds of oats,
                    barley, wheat, rye, beans, peas, and tares; clover and ryegrass, potatoes, and
                    turnips; and mangel worzel has in some places been recently introduced.
                    Farm-yard dung, the cleanings of the streets of the many towns and villages, and
                    the sea-weed cast ashore and cut upon the rocks, are the principal manures. Lime
                    is universally used, and marl in a few places. Bone dust has also been tried
                    within the last few years, and, upon the whole, very successfully.</p><p>Cattle of the Fife breed have long been in high repute both as fattening and
                    dairy stock. The prevailing colour is black; limbs short and body round; horns
                    small, white, and turned up at the points; bone small in proportion to the
                    carcass; and weighing, when fat, and from three to four years old, from forty to
                    sixty stone. The cows, when well fed, yield from ten to fourteen Scotch pints of
                    milk daily during the best of the grass season, and continue long in milk; yet,
                    except in the neighbourhood of the considerable towns, the dairy is considered
                    as a secondary object. The oxen were formerly much employed in labour, but they
                    are now seldom to be seen at work. Flocks of sheep are not very numerous. The
                    horses are much the same as in all the lowlands of Scotland. A great many pigs
                    have of late years been reared in the county, and many of them are killed and
                    shipped in a fresh state for the London market. Pigeons are very numerous, the
                    pigeon-houses being lately estimated at no less than 300. Rabbits are in some
                    places protected; and hares, pheasants, and partridges are plentiful. There are
                    few grouse or black-cock; and fallow deer have been frequently seen at
                    Lochfittie, Torbain, and other places.</p><p>Grain is sold in stock and sample at various weekly markets in Fife, of which the
                    most considerable are at Anstruther, Auchtermuchty, Kirkaldy, Largo, and
                    Newburgh. There are also weekly markets at Dunfermline, Cupar, and other places,
                    for the same purpose; and every town of any consequence has one or two yearly
                    fairs for the sale of cattle, &amp;c. although it must be admitted that the
                    number of the yearly fairs in Fife has been much diminished.</p><p>The staple manufacture of this county is linen. Dunfermline has long been famous
                    for its extensive and almost exclusive manufacture of damasks and diapers. Of
                    late years, by the introduction of French improvements in the machinery, and the
                    ingenuity of the workmen, the quality of the fabrics has been much improved, and
                    the trade greatly enlarged. Ticks, checks, sail-cloth, dowlas, and other plain
                    linens and sheetings of every, quality, are made in several towns in the county,
                    but the great seat of the manufacture is Kirkaldy. In 1812, no less than
                    4,500,000 yards of linen cloth were made by the manufacturers, and stamped of
                    the value of L.280,000; and in 1800, about 600,000 yards of plain linen were
                    supposed to have been made by private families for their own use, which were not
                    stamped. The number of hands employed in all the branches of this manufacture in
                    1800 was computed at 23,192; but the number of hands now employed is greatly
                    increased. No part of the work of weaving in this county is at present, however,
                    carried on with the aid of steam power. There was one steam-loom factory lately
                    in Kirkaldy, but it has been converted into a spinning mill.</p><p>Flax has seldom or never been spun by the hand since the introduction of spinning
                    mills. These now amount to forty-five in number, and include in all upwards of
                    29,000 spindles. Of these, Mr Fergus of Strathore employs at present, in his
                    great work at Prinlaws, 2684 spindles; and erections have been made at the same
                    work for receiving about 3000 more. Messrs C. Arthur and Sons at Kinghorn run
                    upwards of 2000; Nelson and Co. at Kirkland 1800; Mr John Rutherford,
                    Dunfermline, 1376; Henry Balfour and Co. Leven, 1240; Arthur Aitken and Co.
                    Dunfermline, 1066; W. &amp; J. Yule, Ceres, 1048; Mr Swan, Kinghorn, 1026; Mr
                    George Moon, Russel Mill, 1012; but the various other mills have less than 1000
                    spindles each at work. Supposing each spindle to spin half a spyndle daily,
                    making suitable allowances for stoppages and holidays, the various mills in Fife
                    will spin 13,000 spyndles daily, 78,000 per week, or 3,900,000 per
                    mill-spinner’s year of fifty weeks; producing yarn to the value of L.438,750,
                    and consuming 6500 tons of flax. The persons employed at these mills consist of
                    hecklers, male and female preparers, spinners, reelers, &amp;c.; and allowing
                    one individual for each twelve spindles, there will be employed at the spinning
                    mills in Fife, of all ages and in all the departments, about 2240 people. Messrs
                    Nelson and Company, at the Kirkland works, manufacture a large proportion of
                    their yarns into sail-cloth and other fabrics, and Mr Rutherford, Dunfermline,
                    converts the greater part of his yarns into threads of all colours. The yarns at
                    the other mills are generally sold as they are spun.</p><p>Besides the trades and manufactures of the county ∏ <hi rend="superscript">
                    ιa</hi> y be mentioned ship-building, which is carried on at Dysart, where there
                    is a wet dock, and a Morton’s slip for raising the vessels out of the water for
                    repair; and at Burntislan , <pb break="no" facs="nls:193752343" xml:id="kp-eb0709-2343-0545"/>where there is a good harbour and dry dock; as
                    also at Kirkaldy, Anstruther, and Scotscraig. There are, besides, in the county,
                    forty-eight brewers of ale and beer, the greater part of whom also make malt;
                    fifty-six other maltsters, six extensive distilleries, 1140 retailers of ale and
                    spirits, about 200 retailers of foreign wines, twenty-two dealers in vinegar,
                    900 dealers in tea, ten manufacturers of tobacco, and about 800 dealers in that
                    article; one soap work and eighteen tallow chandlers; two papermills on the
                    water of Leven, and nine bleachfields on the same stream, four in the
                    neighbourhood of Kirkaldy, and six in other parts of the county; ten brick and
                    the manufactories, and two potteries; four iron founderies, numerous smiths and
                    wrights, ten works for tanning leather, about as many curriers, two skinners,
                    and two glue manufacturers.</p><p>The shipping of the county is pretty extensive, and the vessels belonging to it
                    are of such burden as to trade to all parts of the world; a number of them being
                    engaged in the whale fisheries, and others in the Baltic, American, and
                    Australian trade. The exports are the manufactures already mentioned, and the
                    produce of the whale fisheries, coal, limestone, lime, potatoes, and grain of
                    all sorts; and the imports from foreign parts are timber, bark, hides, tallow,
                    flax, hemp, tar, iron, &amp;c.; and coastwise, pavement and slates, groceries,
                    and other articles required for home consumption. For the state of the harbours

                    Bank of Scotland at Dunfermline, Kirkaldy, and St Andrews; of the Commercial
                    Bank of Scotland at Cupar, Colinsburgh, Dunfermline, and Kirkaldy; of the
                    National Bank of Scotland and of the Glasgow Bank at Kirkaldy; and of the
                    British Linen Company at Cupar.</p><p>Fifeshire contains thirteen royal burghs with parliamentary privileges. St
                    Andrews, Cupar, Anstruther Easter, Pittenweem, Crail, Kilrenny, and Anstruther
                    Wester, with a constituency at present of 635, send one member to parliament;
                    Kirkaldy, Dysart, Burntisland, and Kinghorn, with a constituency of 415, send
                    another; and Dunfermline, having a constituency of 500, and Inverkeithing of
                    thirty-eight, join with Stirling, Q,ueensferry, and Culross in electing a member
                    to represent them. The voters in these thirteen Fife burghs have now increased
                    their constituency to 1588, instead of the 304 individuals who formerly composed
                    their corporations.</p><p>The courts in the county for the trial of crime and civil suits consist, 1+ of
                    the burgh courts, the magistrates of which have jurisdiction within their
                    respective royalties or burgh territory only; 2&lt;7Zy, of the sheriff courts,
                    for similar purposes, which are held at Dunfermline for the parishes in that
                    presbytery, and at Cupar for the other parts of the county, at each of which
                    towns the cases are tried either by the sheriff in person, or by substitutes, of
                    whom he has for the purpose one constantly resident at Cupar, and another at
                    Dunfermline, he himself being usually resident in Edinburgh; 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> of the justice of peace courts, which are held periodically at Cupar,

                    Andrews. There is also a small jail attached to the town-hall of almost every
                    burgh in the county, but many of these are seldom used for the recep-t <hi rend="superscript"> on</hi> °f prisoners. With the exception of the jails of
                    Cupar, ⅛kaldy, and Kinghorn, which are the best in the county, having been
                    erected within the last twenty-five years, none of them have airing ground
                    attached to them for the use of ae prisoners, or are well fitted as places of
                    confinement.</p><p>The great turnpike-roads of the county, which are madfe and maintained by the
                    revenue of the toll-bars, and the ∣ye-roads, which are maintained by a tax on
                    householders, on carriages, and on each plough-gate of land, are under the
                    charge of parliamentary trustees, consisting chiefly of the justices of the
                    peace, and commissioners of supply for the county. Each of the four presbyteries
                    forms a district for managing its own roads. The accounts of the turnpike
                    trustees are printed and published annually. The accounts of the bye-road trusts
                    have however not yet been published. The turnpike-roads and many of the
                    bye-roads are in excellent order, great attention being paid to the introduction
                    of the most recent improvements in road-making. Private railways of wood or iron
                    have been used for many years in transporting for several miles the produce of
                    the coal and lime quarries to the harbours where they are shipped. The most
                    extensive of these railroads is that belonging to the Earl of Elgin. It proceeds
                    from near Dunfermline to Charleston harbour, and has been lately opened to the
                    public for the use of rail coaches carrying passengers.</p><p>Fifeshire is divided into sixty-one parishes, belonging to the four presbyteries
                    of St Andrews, Cupar, Kirkaldy, and Dunfermline, which compose the synod of
                    Fife; but there are four parishes besides in the presbytery of Dunfermline, and
                    one in the presbytery of Kirkaldy, which are not situated in this county.</p><p>The population of Fifeshire in 1801 was 93,743; in 1811, 101,272, an increase of
                    eight percent.; in 1821, 114,550, an increase of thirteen per cent.; and in
                    1831, 128,800, an increase above the preceding census of twelve per cent.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
