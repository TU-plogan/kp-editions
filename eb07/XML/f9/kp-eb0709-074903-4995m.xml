                <p><label type="entry">FORM</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Physics,</hi> denotes the
                    manner of being peculiar to each body; or that which constitutes it such a
                    particular body, and distinguishes it from every other. But Mr Harris uses the
                    term <hi rend="italic">form</hi> in another sense, as an efficient animating
                    principle; to which he supposes Ovid to refer in the first lines of his
                    Metamorphoses.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">In novafert animus</hi><hi rend="italic">mutatas dicere</hi>
                    formas, <hi rend="italic">Corpora.</hi></p>
                <p>These animating forms are not of themselves objects either of the ear or of the
                    eye; but their nature or character is understood in this, that were they never
                    to exert their proper energies on their proper subjects, the marble on which the
                    sculptor exercises his art would remain for ever shapeless, and the harp from
                    which the harper calls forth sounds would remain for ever silent.</p>
                <p>Substantial forms seem to have been first broached by the followers of Aristotle,
                    who thought matter, under different modes or modifications, not sufficient to
                    constitute different bodies, but that something substantial was necessary to set
                    them at a greater distance, and thus introduced substantial forms, on the
                    footing of souls, which specify and distinguish animals. What led to this
                    erroneous notion were the circumstances of life and death. For observing that,
                    as soon as the soul had departed out of a man, all motion, respiration,
                    nutrition, and other animal functions, immediately ceased, they concluded that
                    these functions depended on the soul, and consequently that the soul was the
                    form of the animal body, or that which constituted it such; indeed nobody
                    doubted that the soul was a substance independent of matter; and hence it was
                    concluded that the forms of other bodies were to be equally substantial. But to
                    this it is answered, that though the soul be that by which man is man, and
                    consequently the form of the human body as human, yet it does not follow that it
                    is properly the form of this body of ours, as it is a body, or of the several
                    parts thereof, ∞nsidered as distinct from one another. For those several parts
                    have their proper forms so closely connected with their matter, that it remains
                    inseparable therefrom long after the soul has quitted the body; thus flesh has
                    the form of flesh, bone of bone, and so forth, long after the soul is removed,
                    as well as before. The truth is, the body does not become incapable of
                    performing its accustomed functions because the soul has deserted it; but the
                    soul takes its leave because the body is no longer in a condition to perform its
                    functions.</p>
                <p>The ancient and modern corpuscular philosophers, therefore, with the Cartesians,
                    exclude the notion of substantial forms, and show, by many arguments, that the
                    form is only the <hi rend="italic">modus</hi> or manner of the body in which it
                    ;s inherent.</p>
                <p>And as there are only three primary modes of matter, figure, rest, or motion,
                    with two others arising therefrom, magnitude and situation, the form of all
                    bodies they hold to consist in these modes, and suppose the variations which
                    they are capable of sufficient to present all the variety observable in
                    bodies.</p>
                <p>Forms are usually distinguished into <hi rend="italic">essential</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">accidental.</hi> Though the five modes above mentioned, generally
                    taken, be adventitious, yet to this or that body, as to fire or water, they are
                    <hi rend="italic">essential.</hi> Thus it is <hi rend="italic">accidental</hi>
                    to iron to have this or that magnitude, figure, or situation, since it might
                    exist in different ones; yet to a knife or hammer, the figure, magnitude, and
                    position of parts, which constitute it a hammer or knife, are essential, and
                    they cannot exist or be conceived without these. Hence it is inferred, that
                    though there be no substantial, yet there are essential forms, by which the
                    several species of bodies become what they are, and are distinguished from all
                    others. <hi rend="italic">Accidental</hi> forms are those really inherent in
                    bodies, but in such manner as that the body may exist in all its perfection
                    without them; such as whiteness in a wall, heat in water, a figure of a man in
                    wax, and so on.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Form,</hi> in carpentry, is used to denote the long seats or
                    benches in the choirs of churches or in schools, for the priests, prebends,
                    religious persons, or scholars, to sit on. Du Cange supposes the name to be
                    derived from this, that the backs of the seats were anciently enriched with
                    figures of painting and sculpture, called in Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >forma</hi><hi rend="italic">et typi.</hi> In the life of St William of
                    Roschild, we meet with <hi rend="italic">forma</hi> as signifying a seat for an
                    ecclesiastic, or religious person, in a choir; and in that of St Lupicin, we
                    find <hi rend="italic">formula</hi> used in the same sense. In the rule of the
                    monastery of St Caesarea, the man who presides over the choir is called the
                    occupant of the first form or seat.</p>
