                <p>SELECTION.</p>
                <p>Animal matters in general are safe articles of food. In regard to the higher
                    classes, the mammalia and birds, this is universally true of those in a state of
                    health. A few exceptions occur among the fishes, depending either upon the
                    constitution of certain persons, who are injuriously affected by substances
                    generally alimentary, or upon some singularity in the nature of the individual
                    fish, by which it becomes poisonous, although the species is generally
                    nutritious and wholesome. As we descend still lower in the scale, these
                    exceptions occur more frequendy, and more species are absolutely and universally
                    unwholesome, or furnish poisons hurtful to every constitution. In the vegetable
                    kingdom, the alimentary vegetables form but a small proportion of the whole, and
                    almost an equal number are absolutely poisonous, or at least injurious, except
                    when <pb break="no" facs="nls:193754631" xml:id="kp-eb0709-4631-0721"/>given in
                    small quantities, to counteract some existing disease.</p>
                <p>Although quadrupeds, without exception, furnish articles which may be safely used
                    as food, their flesh differs much in palatability, and probably in its
                    nutritious qualities. There is also no part of this class of animals that may
                    not be, and indeed is not occasionally used as food, although the flesh, or
                    voluntary muscles upon the limbs, trunk, and head, is by far the most
                    considerable and important. The heart, the largest of the involuntary muscles,
                    is also commonly eaten; and the brain and spinal marrow or pith; all the glands,
                    the kidneys, liver, udder, and sweetbread; the compound internal organs, the
                    lungs, stomach, and intestines, the uterus, placenta, and even the contents of
                    the stomach, the fat and marrow of the bones, the blood and skin, are all
                    nutritious, and some of them highly prized; and even the bones themselves can be
                    made to furnish much wholesome nutriment. The milk of all quadrupeds is also
                    alimentary, and generally agreeable.</p>
                <p>These various organs, although each of them contains several immediate
                    principles, considered chemically, are characterized by some difference in their
                    composition. The muscular flesh consists principally of fibrine, combined with
                    some gelatinous mucus and osmazome; the tendons of the muscles, on the contrary,
                    are little else than gelatine in a very dense form. This is likewise the case
                    with the skin, the membranes in general, and the ligaments. Brain and medullary
                    nervous matter consist chiefly of coagulated albumen, which also, perhaps,
                    enters largely into the composition of glands. The fat, suet, and marrow of the
                    bones, are different forms of concrete animal oil. All these principle? are
                    digestible and nutritious, but in what comparative degree is far from being
                    ascertained. According to popular opinion, it is nearly inversely as their
                    solubility in water, muscular flesh being considered to furnish the strongest
                    aliment, and gelatinous organs the lightest. But these substances are not
                    exactly similar in all animals, nor even in the same animal at different periods
                    of life.</p>
                <p>In general the flesh and other parts are coarser in proportion to the size of the
                    animal, not only when different in kind; but in different varieties of the same
                    species, although well-grown individuals of the same variety are always better
                    than those which have not been sufficiently nourished. Thus the flesh of the
                    elephant and rhinoceros have been found to be very coarse and unpalatable,
                    whilst that of the rat and smaller quadrupeds is very delicate. The larger
                    varieties of the ox and sheep, also, are inferior to the smaller, as the kyloes
                    of the Western Islands, and the sheep of Wales and the Highlands of
                    Scotland.</p>
                <p>The whole organs of young animals are much more gelatinous than those of the
                    adult and aged, whilst these contain more fibrine and extract. Hence the flesh
                    of young animals is more bland and tender, and yields most to the action of
                    boiling water; whilst that of aged animals is more savoury, even to rankness,
                    and is firm to toughness.</p>
                <p>The flesh of very young animals is to our palates unpleasantly soft and flabby,
                    qualities of which every one is a judge; but it is at no period of life, not
                    even in the foetal state, actually unwholesome; and therefore there was no
                    rational ground for that enactment which provided that no butcher shall kill any
                    calf to sell being under five weeks old. The fact is, that cows large with calf
                    are frequently killed, and the foetus is always sold as very young veal, and
                    preferred by some people. By our butchers, calves are killed at from six to
                    sixteen weeks; but they are reckoned best at ten βr twelve. Lambs are generally
                    killed at from eight weeks to half a year.</p>
                <p>The flesh of quadrupeds in the vigour of life is more stringy, and again becomes
                    shorter as it advances to old age, when it becomes dry and unnutritious. Young
                    animals also differ from those that are aged, in the distribution of the fat,
                    which in the latter is chiefly collected in masses or layers external to the
                    muscles, and in the former is more interspersed among the muscular fibres,
                    giving the flesh a marbled appearance, which is always a desirable property in
                    butcher-meat.</p>
                <p>The beef of the larger breeds of oxen is in perfection when the animal is about
                    seven years old, that of the smaller breeds a year or two sooner. Cow beef, on
                    the contrary, can scarcely be too young. The flesh of a young heifer is highly
                    esteemed; that of an old fattened cow is very bad. Wedder mutton is in
                    perfection at five years. Ewe mutton is best when about two years old. Sucking
                    pigs are killed about three weeks old; but pork differs from other kinds of
                    butcher-meat in not requiring age to mellow it; so that swine for pork are
                    killed at from six to twelve months old; but for brawn, age is an advantage, or
                    rather necessary. The buck of the fallow-deer may be killed at six, but is
                    better at eight years of age. The female in general being naturally more tender,
                    and getting tough rather than mellowing by age, is sooner in perfection.</p>
                <p>The sex also greatly influences the quality of the flesh,: that of the female
                    being always more delicate and finely grained than that of the entire male, of
                    which the fibres are stronger and the taste more rank. Indeed the influence of
                    the genital organs on the flesh of animals is very remarkable. The delicacy of
                    the flesh, even of the female, is greatly improved by removing the ovaries, or
                    “spaying” them as it is called. Every day the testes are permitted to remain,
                    even though totally inactive as to their proper function, injures the delicacy
                    of the veal of the bull-calf; and an animal which is not castrated until after
                    puberty always retains much of the rankness and coarseness of the entire male.

                    directs that the male lambs should be castrated at from eight to fifteen days
                    after their birth, although it is not usual to perform the operation until the
                    age of three weeks, or even five or six months. But their flesh is never so good
                    as when they are castrated at eight days. Hazard goes farther, and recommends it
                    to be performed in a day or two after their birth, or as soon as the testes
                    descend into the scrotum. The female lambs are also spayed occasionally in
                    France, to render their flesh more delicate, and to improve the wool; but the
                    operation cannot be performed until the ovaries have acquired a sufficient size
                    to be brought out with the finger, when about three weeks old. In this country
                    the sow pigs which are not reserved for breeding are all spayed when about four
                    weeks old; the boar pigs are castrated a week sooner. On the other hand, the
                    males of those races in which the testes are active only at certain seasons, as
                    the deer tribe, have the coarse rank flesh of entire males only when rutting,
                    and at all other times they much more resemble the castrated individuals of
                    those animals, such as the bull, which are always capable of procreating their
                    species. Even with the ram there is a short period when the flesh is less rank,
                    and during the rutting season it is intolerable. Buck venison is highly
                    esteemed, and the boar is preferred for making brawn.</p>
                <p>The manner in which the animal has been fed has alsol considerable influence on
                    the quality of the flesh. Generally the lean of fat animals is better than that
                    of those that are poor, and perhaps an animal in a state of nature can never be
                    too fat. Artificial fattening may, however, be carried too far; and the practice
                    of feeding oxen <pb break="no" facs="nls:193754644" xml:id="kp-eb0709-4644-0722"
                    />on oil-cake for the market is now almost laid aside, as the beef acquires from
                    it an unpleasant rancidity. Also unwholesome fatness, such as that which takes
                    place in the first stage of the rot, and which, it is said upon very good
                    authority, some butchers induce artificially, is certainly not desirable. «
                    Several graziers and butchers having observed that sheep are much disposed to
                    feed during the first, stage, or four weeks after being tainted, omit no
                    opportunity of producing it to increase their profits.”<note anchored="true"

                    8vo. London, 1804-</p></note> But it is not only in regard to fatness that the
                    flesh of animals is affected by the nature of their food, for its flavour is
                    materially altered by it, and an epicure will readily distinguish by the taste,
                    whether mutton of the same race has been fed upon turnips, or upon the natural
                    grasses of a Highland farm.</p>
                <p>The effect of the food is more apparent in pork than in. any other kind of
                    butcher-meat. The fat of pigs fed on skimmed milk, though sour, is firmer, and
                    vastly superior to that of hogs fed upon peas or meal. And Mr Jackson says we
                    have no pork in £ngland or Ireland equal to that of Sardinia, where the hogs are
                    almost wild, and fattened upon chestnuts.</p>
                <p>The season of the year has considerable influence on the quality of butcher-meat,
                    though less than upon other kinds of aliment. Its influence depends upon the
                    more or less plentiful supply of food, upon the periodical change which takes
                    place in the body of the animal, and upon temperature. <hi rend="italic">In
                    season</hi> and <hi rend="italic">out of season</hi> are words often vaguely
                    applied, meaning, most commonly and correctly, the period of the year in which
                    the substance in question is naturally best and worst, but also occasionally
                    expressing the good or bad condition of the individual animal, without any
                    regard to the state of the species in general; and lastly and most improperly,
                    meaning that it is at that time desired or rejected by the higher classes of
                    society as being rare or common. The flesh of most full-grown quadrupeds is in
                    highest season during the first months of winter, after having enjoyed the
                    advantage of the abundance of fresh summer food. Its flavour then begins to be
                    injured by the turnips given as winter food, and in spring it gets lean from
                    deficiency of food. Although beef and mutton are never absolutely out of season,
                    or unfit for the table, they are best in November, December, and January. Pork
                    is absolutely bad or out of season during the summer months, and is only good in
                    those of winter. The males of the deer tribe are in highest season from the
                    middle of June to the beginning of September, when they begin to rut, after
                    which they become thin and exhausted. Females in general are out of condition
                    when they are suckling, or have lately suckled or given milk. Does which have
                    had no kids, or were soon deprived of them, follow the general rule of castrated
                    animals, and are in season from the middle of November to the middle of
                    February. Their condition is not much affected during the first months of
                    pregnancy. The season of the year when the young of quadrupeds have acquired the
                    proper age for being used as aliment is the period when they are in season. This
                    is naturally in the summer months, when lamb, veal, kid, and fawns are most
                    abundant. But breeders continue to furnish the tables of the wealthy with the
                    first t¼ ’ o of these at almost every season of the year, by selecting certain
                    breeds, such as the Dorsetshire sheep, which lamb very early, or by treating
                    them in such a way as to cause the female to come in heat at an unnatural time.
                    In this way lamb is procured as an article of luxury as early as November and
                    December; and, on the contrary, by keeping the ewe on a cold and poor hill
                    pasture, the lambing season is retarded.</p>
                <p>The mode of killing has considerable effect on the flesh of the animal. Most of
                    those slaughtered for food are either bled to death, or are bled profusely
                    immediately after being deprived of life in some other way.</p>
                <p>The common mode of killing cattle in this kingdom is by striking them on the
                    forehead with a pole-axe, and then cutting their throats to bleed them. But this
                    method is cruel, and not free from danger. The animal is not always brought down
                    by the first blow, and the rq&gt;etition is difficult and uncertain; and if the
                    animal be not very well secured, accidents may happen. Lord Somerville,<note

                    of pithing or laying cattle, by dividing the spinal marrow above the origin of

                    spinal marrow, when the bullock will immediately fall without any struggle; then
                    cut the arteries about the heart.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    after some practice, be performed with tolerable certainty, and although Lord
                    Somerville took a man with him to Portugal to be instructed in the method, and
                    made it a condition that the prize cattle should be pithed instead of being
                    knocked down, still pithing is not becoming general in Britain. This may be
                    partly owing to prejudice; but we have been told that the flesh of the cattle
                    killed in this way in Portugal is very dark, and becomes soon putrid, probably
                    from the animal not bleeding well, in consequence of the action of the heart
                    being interrupted before the vessels of the neck are divided. It therefore seems
                    preferable to bleed the animal to death directly, as is practised by the Jew
                    butchers.</p>
                <p>The Mosaic law so strictly prohibits die eating of blood, that the Talmud
                    contains a body of regulations concerning the killing of animals; and the Jews,
                    as a point of religion, will not eat the flesh of any animal not killed by a
                    butcher of their own persuasion. Their method is to tie all the four feet of the
                    animal together, bring it to the ground, and, turning its head back, to cut the
                    throat at once down to the bone with a long, very sharp, but not pointed knife,
                    dividing all the large vessels of the neck. In this way the blood is discharged
                    quickly and completely. ∣ The effect is indeed said to be so obvious, that some
                    Christians will eat no meat but what has been killed by a Jew butcher.</p>
                <p>Calves, pigs, sheep, and lambs, are all killed by dividing at once the large
                    vessels of the neck. Animals which are killed by accident, as by being drowned,
                    hanged, or frozen, or by a fall or ravenous animal, are not absolutely
                    unwholesome. Indeed they only differ from those killed methodically in not being
                    bled, which is also the case with animals that are snared, and in those killed
                    by hounds. Animals which die a natural death should never be eaten, as there are
                    undeniable instances of disease, and even death, being the consequence.</p>
                <p>Animals frequently undergo some preparation before they are killed. They are
                    commonly kept without food for some time, as, if killed with full stomachs,
                    their flesh is considered not to keep well. Oxen are commonly fasted two or
                    three days, smaller animals a day; but it is evident that the practice must not
                    be carried too far, as the opposite effect will be produced by the animal
                    falling off or getting feverish. It is generally understood that, in order to
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193754657" xml:id="kp-eb0709-4657-0723"/>have veal very
                    white, the calf is repeatedly bled largely before it is killed. But the practice
                    does not seem to be very common. It is altogether denied by the feeders, and not
                    confessed by the butchers. We are not, therefore, able to say what its effects
                    would be; but Dr Lister has stated that nothing contributes more to the
                    whiteness and tenderness of the flesh of calves than often bleeding them, by
                    which the colouring matter of the blood is exhausted, and nothing but colourless
                    serum remains. A much more cruel method of preparation for slaughter used to be
                    practised, though now much less frequently, in regard to the bull. By some
                    ancient municipal laws, no butcher was allowed to expose any bull-beef for sale,
                    unless it had been previously baited. The reason of this regulation probably
                    was, that baiting had the effect of rendering the flesh or muscular fibre much
                    more tender; for it is a universal law of the animal economy that, when animals
                    have undergone excessive fatigue immediately before death, or have suffered from
                    a lingering death, their flesh, though it becomes sooner rigid, also becomes
                    sooner tender than when suddenly deprived of life in a state of health. The
                    flesh of hunted animals also is soon tender and soon spoils;<note

                    that the quality of pigs’ flesh could be improved by the horrid cruelty, said to
                    be practised by the Germans, of whipping the animal to death. Another part of
                    the same receipt, to roast a pig wild-boar fashion, consists in making him
                    swallow, some hours before death, a quantity of vinegar aromatised with herbs.
                    We notice this, because we think the action of vinegar given to animals some
                    hours before death, in rendering the fibre mellow, deserves to be examined. It
                    is a common practice in the country to give poultry a spoonful or two of vinegar
                    some time before they are killed, when they are to be dressed immediately.
                    Popular practices are seldom without some foundation, and with this, the fact
                    that acetic acid or vinegar has a peculiar chemical action upon fibrine connects
                    itself. The Moors in West Barbary, before they kill a hedgehog, which is
                    esteemed a princely dish among them, “rub his back against the ground, by
                    holding his feet betwixt two, as men do a saw that saws stones, till it has done
                    squeaking, and then they cut its throat.” (Mr Jones, <hi rend="italic">Phil.
                    Trans.</hi> No. 254.)</p>
                <p>There is no bird, and no part of any bird, nor any bird’s egg, which may not be
                    safely used as food. Gmelin quotes a singular instance of some persons having
                    been much affected after eating larks; and suspects that the flesh of the birds
                    may have been rendered poisonous by their having fed upon hemlock-seed, which
                    they eat with impunity. But there can be no doubt that this must be a mistake,
                    for larks are a common and favourite food in the very country where this
                    accident is said to have happened.</p>
                <p>The flesh of birds differs very much In its sensible properties, not only in
                    different kinds, but even in the different muscles of the same bird. The
                    pectoral muscles which move the wings are whiter, drier, and more tender than
                    those which move the legs. The tendons of the legs are also very strong, and at
                    a certain age become bony; but the flesh of the legs, when sufficiently tender,
                    either from the bird being young, or from long keeping, or sufficient cookerj',
                    is more juicy and savoury than that of the wings. Of a few birds, especially the
                    woodcock and snipe, the legs are at all times preferred to the breast. In the
                    black-cock, the outer layer of the pectoral muscles is of a dark-brown colour,
                    while the inner is white. A similar difference is observed in many other birds,
                    and perhaps it is general in a slight degree. The muscular organs of birds
                    differ from those of quadrupeds in their flesh never being marbled, or having
                    fat mixed with the muscular fibres.</p>
                <p>There is a great diversity in the flesh of the different classes of birds; but no
                    very accurate distribution of them in this respect can be made, as, though the
                    extremes are sufficiently marked, they run insensibly into each other. We may,
                    however, notice, as sufficiently distinct, 1. the white-fleshed, exemplified in
                    the common fowl and turkey; 2. dark-fleshed, game, grouse, black-cock; 3.
                    aquatic, goose, duck; and, 4⅛ rapacious, hawks and owls. Several species of the
                    first and third classes are domesticated, and reared in great numbers as
                    esteemed articles of food. The white-fleshed birds are very generally liked,
                    when good of their kind, and by many are preferred to game, which, however, when
                    sufficiently kept, is one of the greatest luxuries of an epicure’s table. It has
                    then acquired a peculiar odour, called <hi rend="italic">fumet,</hi> and an
                    aromatic bitter taste, most sensible in the back. The aquatic birds, both
                    swimmers and waders, are generally eaten, and many of them are very delicate;
                    but in general they are disposed to become very fat, and often acquire a rancid
                    and fishy taste. This is chiefly connected with the fat, and may be somewhat
                    avoided by skinning the bird, and removing the inside fat, before cooking. Of
                    the rapacious birds none are eaten, partly perhaps from prejudice, and partly
                    because those which touch carrion acquire a cadaverous smell.</p>
                <p>The muscular fibre is coarser in the larger than in the smaller birds of the same
                    class, and it becomes less tender as they get older. It is also much influenced
                    by sex, although of some birds the young cock is preferred, chiefly, we
                    apprehend, on account of its greater size and handsome appearance. By removing
                    the sexual organs at an early age, both sexes are much improved for the use of
                    the table, becoming larger, fatter, and more tender, as we see in the capon and
                    poulard. The manner in which birds are fed affects both their fatness and their
                    flavour. Birds seldom get very fat in their wild state, or when domesticated, if
                    allowed to go at large. The art of fattening poultry consists in supplying them
                    with abundance of healthy food, and confining them. Aquatic birds, ducks and
                    geese in particular, must be prevented from going into the water, both because
                    they never get fat, but also acquire a rancid fishy taste.</p>
                <p>The fattening of fowls for the London market is a con-: siderable branch of rural
                    economy in some convenient 1 situations. “They are put up in a dark place, and
                    <hi rend="italic">crammed</hi> with a paste made of barley-meal, mutton-suet,
                    and some treacle or coarse sugar, mixed with milk, and are found to be
                    completely ripe in a fortnight. If kept longer, the fever that is induced by
                    this continued state of repletion renders them red and unsaleable, and
                    frequently kills them.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    pullets is cleanliness, and high keeping with the best corn.</p>
                <p>Epicures in all ages have been exceedingly whimsical in the selection of certain
                    parts of particular birds as dainties, and the ancients more so than the
                    moderns; for although we still prize the combs of the common fowl, the trail of
                    the woodcock, and even collect with care the dreg which drops from it in the
                    process of roasting, the guts of the bustard, the gizzard and liver of the
                    goose, and the feet of the duck; we find that Homan epicures delighted in the
                    brains of ostriches and parrots, the tongue of the flamingo, and the enlarged
                    liver of the goose. The last still <pb break="no" facs="nls:193754670"

                    in great request, and the providing them is a considerable branch of rural
                    economy in some provinces. It is said that, at Strasburg, it is effected by
                    actually sewing up the anus of the tortured animal, after a certain preparation;
                    but we have not met with the barbarity set down in print, and it is perhaps not
                    true, otherwise so striking an exemplification of Sir E. Home’s doctrine, that
                    the fatness of animals depended upon the length of their intestinal canal, and
                    the length of time the faeces were retained in it, would not have escaped his
                    notice. The process followed in different parts of France is described at length
                    by Sonnini:<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    method is to enlarge the liver. Nobody is ignorant of the endeavours of
                    sensuality to cause the whole vital forces to be determined towards this part of
                    the animal, by giving it a kind of hepatic cachexy. In Alsace, the individual
                    buys a lean goose, which he shuts up in a small box of fir, sô tight that it
                    cannot turn in it. The bottom is furnished with a wide grating of rods, for the
                    passage of the dung. In the fore part there is a hole for the head, and below it
                    a small trough is kept always full of water, in which some pieces of wood
                    charcoal are left to steep. A bushel of maize is sufficient to feed it during a
                    month, at the end of which time the goose is sufficiently fattened. A thirtieth
                    part is soaked in water each night, and crammed down its throat next day,
                    morning and evening. The rest of the time it drinks and guggles in the water.
                    Towards the twenty-second day they mix with the maize some poppy oil, and at the
                    end of the month it is known by a lump of fat under each wing, or rather by the
                    difficulty of breathing, that it is time to kill it, otherwise it will die of
                    fat. The liver is then found weighing one or two pounds, and besides, the animal
                    is excellent for the table, and furnishes, during its roasting, from three to
                    five pounds of fat, which is used in the cookery of vegetables. Of six geese,
                    there are commonly only four, and these are the youngest, which answer the
                    expectation of the fattener. They are kept in a cellar, or place with little
                    light; and the Roman epicures, who prized their livers, had already observed,
                    that darkness was favourable to this kind of education, no doubt because it
                    prevents all distraction, and directs the whole powers towards the digestive
                    organs. The want of motion, and the difficulty of respiration, may be also taken
                    into consideration; the first by diminishing the waste of the system, and both
                    by retarding the circulation in the vena portarum, of which the blood ought to
                    become hydrogenated, in proportion as its carbon unites itself to the oxygen,
                    which that liquid absorbe. This favours the formation of the oily juice, which,
                    after having filled the cellular system of the body, enters into the biliary
                    system and substance of the liver, and gives it that fatness and size which is
                    so delightful to the palates of true gourmands. The liver thus only becomes
                    enlarged consecutively, and the difficulty of respiration does not appear till
                    the end, when its size prevents the action of the diaphragm.”</p>
                <p>“The leanness of geese subjected to this treatment is often mentioned; but it can
                    only occur in those whose eyes are put out, and feet nailed down to a board, as
                    the consequence of this barbarous treatment. Among a hundred fatteners, there
                    are scarcely two who adopt this practice, and even these do not put out their
                    eyes till a day or two before they are killed. And therefore the geese of
                    Alsace, which are free from these cruel operations, acquire a prodigious
                    fatness, which may be called an oleaginous dropsy, the effect of a general atony
                    of the absorbents, caused by want of exercise, combined with succulent food
                    crammed down their throats, and in an ιmder oxygenated atmosphere.” There are
                    certain months in which each kind of bird is considered to be in season, and
                    which are determined by the time of their breeding, the abundance of food, or
                    their migration. Some birds do not remain with us all the year, and are
                    therefore to be valued when we can get them. The migrating birds go farther
                    south in winter, and north in summer. They are, therefore, with us in winter or
                    summer, according to their habits in regard to temperature and the supply of
                    food. Those birds which remain during summer breed here, and their young may be
                    obtained before they fly, and whilst they are still delicate, as the gannet or
                    solan goose; others, as the woodcock, rarely breed in this country, and are only
                    got in their adult state.</p>
                <p>There is but little diversity in the mode of killing birds. Game is almost always
                    shot, as hawking is entirely out of fashion, although formerly birds killed in
                    this way were more esteemed, as, indeed, their flesh would be sooner tender.
                    Larks are caught in winter in traps and nets, and then killed. The heads are
                    twisted off young pigeons; but domestic birds, in general, are killed in a very
                    unskilful and barbarous manner. The common fowl has its neck drawn, by which the
                    spine is torn asunder at an uncertain plaçe; and if the spinal cord be not
                    divided, or be divided too low, the animal dies slowly, and is sometimes alive
                    after its feathers have been plucked off. The large blood-vessels are sometimes
                    also torn across. This is an advantage, both from shortening the sufferings of
                    the animal, and rendering its flesh whiter in consequence of the loss of blood.
                    Turkeys are bled to death by dividing the vessels under the tongue. The only
                    objection to this is that it is tedious, for probably it is not attended with
                    much pain. Geese are killed by splitting the skull with a knife. This is
                    sometimes very awkwardly performed, and neither any large vessels are divided,
                    nor the nervous energy destroyed. Domestic birds are generally kept confined and
                    fed upon choice food for some time before they are killed, and sometimes they
                    are crammed, or forced to eat more than they would voluntarily. They should
                    always be kept a day without food at the last, that their crops may be empty, as
                    food left in them is apt to taint the flesh.</p>
                <p>Of the reptiles, very few are used as food, though probably rather on account of
                    their disgusting appearance, than of their being hurtful, or even unpalatable,
                    as some of the greatest luxuries of the table belong to this class of animals.
                    Besides the green turtle, several other species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Testudo</hi> are eaten, especially the <hi rend="italic">Gra∙ca, Europoea,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">ferox.</hi> Of the lizards, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dracaena, Ainboinensis,</hi><hi rend="italic">agilis,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Iguana,</hi> are eaten. The flesh of the last is said to be
                    delicious, but unwholesome, especially to those persons affected with syphilis,
                    which, however, is probably a vulgar prejudice. The <hi rend="italic">Lacerta
                    scincus</hi> is held in estimation by the natives of the east as aphrodisiac.
                    The eggs of the <hi rend="italic">Iguana</hi> and of most species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Testudo,</hi> even of those whose flesh is said to be bad, as of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Imbricata,</hi> are nutritious and agreeable. The flesh of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Coluber</hi><hi rend="italic">natrix</hi> is eaten in some
                    places; and even the viper, whose bite is poisonous, furnishes a nutritious
                    broth to invalids. Of the frogs, the <hi rend="italic">Rana</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">esculenta</hi> is a favourite article of food with our continental
                    neighbours. The <hi rend="italic">Rana</hi><hi rend="italic">taurina,</hi> or
                    bull-frog, rivals the turtle in the opinion of our Transatlantic descendants.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Rana bombi-na,</hi> though a toad, is also eaten in some
                    places as a fish. We have no doubt that many other reptiles are used as food in
                    some countries; and we are not aware of a single instance where injurious
                    effects have been produced by any that have been tried. Their flesh seems in
                    general to be delicate and gelatinous; the fibre resembles that of chicken or
                    veal; and what is called the green fat of turtle is in reality <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193754683" xml:id="kp-eb0709-4683-0725"/>gelatinous, like the skin of
                    calf’s head, or the tendons of ox-heel, which are employed to make an imitation
                    of it, ’ We know little of the circumstances which influence the quality of
                    reptiles as esculent; but the modern Apicius says, the best size of a turtle for
                    taste is sixty pounds to eighty pounds, which is scarcely a tenth part of the
                    size they sometimes reach; and we may presume that, like most other oviparous
                    animals, they are best before they begin to lay their eggs, and out of season
                    for some time afterwards. Turtles often become emaciated and sickly before they
                    reach this country, in which case the soup would be incomparably improved by
                    leaving out the turtle, and substituting a good calf’s head.</p>
                <p>In some places fish constitutes the sole or chief food of the people, hence
                    called Ichthyophagi, and almost everywhere it is in request. In Siberia, dried
                    fish is used instead of bread. The Laplanders make a bread of fish bones, and
                    the Negroes of the western coast of Africa dry a species of sprat, and beat it
                    in wooden mortars to a paste, which keeps all the year, and is eaten with rice
                    or corn. Putrid fish is even the favourite and ordinary food of some tribes.
                    Fish, however, is not so universally a safe aliment as the two preceding classes
                    of animals; for although no species is generally unwholesome, yet, in some
                    situations, individuals of many different species are absolutely poisonous,
                    whilst others of the same species, and not to be distinguished by any certain
                    external characters, at the same place, and in the same season, are innocent and
                    nutritious, which render the eating of fish in such countries not free of
                    danger.</p>
                <p>i The subject of poisonous fishes is still involved in great obscurity, although
                    so important to those who are exposed to suffer from them. It is not peculiar to
                    any genus, species, or distinct variety, but occurs in individuals only, and
                    those of several genera of very different classes, such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clupea, Perca,</hi><hi rend="italic">Boracinus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sparus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Coryphana, Scomber, Muroena, Balistes,
                    Tetrodon,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cancer.</hi> Except the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Boymarus Islandicus,</hi> which is reputed poisonous by the Icelanders, because
                    the crows refuse to eat it, poisonous .fish occur chiefly in tropical seas. It
                    is only at certain seasons, however, that any poisonous fish occur; as in the
                    Carribbean Sea in May, June, and July, after having spawnetl. Their deleterious
                    effects are ascribed by some to the fish feeding on poisonous substances, as on
                    copper banks, medusae, and holothuriae, or the manchineel apple. The poison is
                    supposed to exist in the gall; and it is said that if the peritoneum and all the
                    entrails be speedily and dexterously removed, the flesh may always be eaten
                    without danger. A fish is suspected when it is of an unusually large size, or is
                    destitute of the natural fishy smell, or has black teeth, or when silver or an
                    onion boiled along with it becomes black; but all these tests are uncertain. The
                    poisonous quality is also said to be destroyed by salting the fish, or drinking
                    along with it sea water, or the ripe juice of the lime, sugar cane, or sweet
                    potato.</p>
                <p>Some ancient, as well as modern naturalists and physicians, consider the roe of
                    the barbel as unwholesome when eaten; others think it is hurtful only at certain
                    seasons to certain individuals, and when eaten in excess; and, lastly, some
                    declare the whole allegations to be erroneous and unfounded. Bloch, the great
                    ichthyologist, and Bose, both assert that they and others have eaten it without
                    any inconvenience; but Dr Crevelt of Bonn has published cases which leave little
                    doubt that in some cases the roe is actually injurious, although the flesh of
                    the same individual was eaten with impunity.</p>
                <p>The ancients had many prejudices in regard to the wholesomeness or
                    unwholesomeness of certain fishes. The Egyptian priests were forbidden to eat
                    fish of any kind, under the idea that it increased the sexual appetite, or that
                    it was a cause of the leprosy. For the latter reason the people were forbidden
                    to eat any fish not covered with scales. Moses adopted the same principle:
                    “Whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers,
                    them shall ye eat.” “Whatsoever hath no fins or scales in the waters, that shall
                    be an abomination unto you.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Levit, ch. xi. 9, 12.</p></note> Numa made a law for the
                    Ŕomans much to the same effect; but it did not continue in force, as we find the
                    lamprey and sturgeon among the luxuries of the emperors; and such fish now form
                    the chief support of the people in some districts, without being followed by any
                    bad effect.</p>
                <p>Fishes, however, present an infinite variety in regard to their fitness as
                    articles of food, in the colour and texture of their muscles, and in being more
                    or less gelatinous, fibrous, or oily. The muscles of many fish, with the
                    exception of the heart, are quite white, and in general, when the fish is good,
                    they become opaque when cooked. When they remain semitransparent and bluish
                    after sufficient boiling, they are not in season. Of some fishes the flesh is a
                    pale red at certain seasons, and the higher the colour of these kinds the more
                    are they esteemed. Of most fishes the muscles are disposed in flakes, and when
                    in perfection, there is, when cooked, a layer of white curdy matter between
                    them, resembling coagulated albumen. Some other fishes, chiefly those that are
                    flat, or eel-shaped, or without scales, have a fibrous flesh, not divisible into
                    flakes. The liver of the fish tribe abounds with oil, and of many species the
                    flesh is mixed or covered with oil or fat, as the eel or salmon; but of many
                    others the flesh seems to be totally free from it, as all the varieties of the
                    cod, haddock, whiting, and the flat fish.</p>
                <p>Almost every soft part of fishes is nutritious, and occasionally eaten. The great
                    bulk of the animal consists of the muscles of voluntary motion, covering the
                    spine and its appendages; but of some fishes, as turbot, ling, &amp;c. the pulpy
                    gelatinous skin is esteemed. Cod-sounds are the swimming bladders of the large
                    cod, and they are preserved separately, and transmitted to the capital for the
                    gratification of our epicures. In the fresh fish, the tongue, palate, and lips,
                    although too soft for most people, are preferred by some. The roe of most fishes
                    is eaten, and that of some constitutes a principal article of national food.
                    Caviare is the preserved roe of the sturgeon. The melt or soft roe of the
                    herring is eaten by many. The liver of the burbot is very large, and is much
                    esteemed. The enormous <hi rend="italic">vas</hi><hi rend="italic">deferens</hi>
                    of the male cod fried is one of the best garnishes for that fish; and some of
                    the smaller ⅛nd more delicate fishes are eaten whole, with the exception of the
                    head.</p>
                <p>So far as we have knowledge of the effect of sex upon the nutritive qualities of
                    fish, the male or melter is much preferred, as in the herring and salmon. In
                    spring the male only of the lump-fish or cock-padle, Cyclopterus lumpus, is
                    eaten.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Neill, <hi

                <p>The castration and spaying of fish was at one period practised, but only to a
                    very limited extent, and is now entirely laid aside. It was first performed by
                    Mr Tull of Edmonton, who seems to have been a fishmonger. The earliest notice of
                    his discovery is in the <hi rend="italic">History of the Royal Academy of
                    Sciences of Paris for</hi> 174∙2, in the extract from a letter to Μ. Geoffroy,
                    from Sir Hans Sloane, in which he states that he had seen the operation
                    performed on two small carps. A more detailed account of an improved process was
                    afterwards published in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Trans-</hi><pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193754696" xml:id="kp-eb0709-4696-0726"/><hi rend="italic"
                    >actions for</hi> 1754. Mr Tull’s object at first was to prevent the excessive
                    increase of fish in some of his ponds, where the numbers did not permit any of
                    them to grow to an advantageous size; but from castration the increase was not
                    only prevented, but the castrated fish grew much larger than their usual size,
                    were more fat, and, what was no trifling consideration, were always in season.
                    The operation was performed by making a longitudinal incision from between the
                    two fore-fins almost to the anus of the fish, laying aside the intestines, first
                    on one side, and then on the other, and dividing transversely the oviduct or vas
                    deferens. The wound in the integuments was then stitched up, and, without
                    further attention, few fish died of the operation. The operation was most easily
                    performed in May, when the ovaries and spermatic vessels are full. In France
                    Baron de la Tour operated so successfully that out of two hundred carps he did
                    not lose four. It was also tried in Germany, and it was observed that those fish
                    castrated in spring were in autumn still smaller than the others; but that in
                    the following spring they were large and fat, but, some people thought, not so
                    well tasted.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>In regard to the age of fish as affecting their fitness for food, we are inclined
                    to think that the ad⅛e “better small fish than none,” implying that the larger
                    they are the better, is not always correct; for although a well-grown and
                    well-nourished individual is always finer than one not in so good condition, and
                    although some fishes, naturally soft, may become firmer as they grow older, yet
                    many fishes are certainly more delicate when of a smaller size, probably from
                    being younger. Cod is generally preferred large, but we have seen large cod
                    exceedingly coarse. The haddock is certainly better when it does not exceed a
                    middling size; and the whole skate tribe are apt to get coarse and strong as
                    they get large. Ausonius says the bream is the only animal which improves by old
                    age:</p>
                <p>Tu melior pejore aevo, tibi contigit uni, Spirantum ex numero, non inlaudata
                    senectus-</p>
                <p>The flavour of fish is very much influenced by the nature of their food,
                    independently of their apparent condition; and hence there is the greatest
                    difference of the fish on different coasts, or in different rivers and lakes. In
                    general, sea-fish are best where the water is deep, and strong or salt, and
                    where the shore is bold and rocky. Hence the cod and ling caught near the
                    shores, estuaries, and bays, are greatly inferior in quality to fish caught off
                    headlands, in strong currents and deep water. Of the river fish, those which are
                    found in clear, rapid streams, with a rocky or gravelly bottom, in a mountainous
                    country, are indeed less fat, but better tasted; and hence the salmon of the
                    Elbe and Rhine are more valued than those of the other continental rivers. The
                    Thames salmon, however, is preferred in the London market to all other, and some
                    epicures pretend to be able to distinguish by the taste when it comes from a
                    favourite reach of the river. Certain, however, it is, that fislι caught in
                    slow-running waters, with a muddy bottom, such as occur in flat countries with a
                    rich soil, though generally larger and fatter, are very inferior in the more
                    essential points of flavour and firmness. Also the fish of large deep lakes,
                    with a gravelly bottom, is much preferable to that of small, shallow, and muddy
                    ponds or tanks. The bad qualities of fish in stagnant waters, into winch the
                    filth of cities was emptied, did not escape the notice of Galen. Fresh-water
                    fish bred in muddy bottoms or foul water are sometimes freed from the unpleasant
                    earthy taste by keeping them for some time in ponds of clear water with a
                    gravelly bottom.</p>
                <p>The season of the year has the most marked effect upon the quality of fish, as
                    connected with their spawning. In <hi rend="superscript">!</hi> general, fish of
                    every kind are best some time before they begin to spawn, and are unfit for food
                    some time after they have spawned. This, however, is not sufficient to prevent
                    those who have an easy opportunity, from catching and eating fish in this state;
                    and the legislature has found it necessary to fix the periods during which
                    salmon fishing is legal. When the salmon is in the sea, and about to enter the
                    rivers for the purpose of spawning, it is infested ŵith a parasitical insect,
                    which adheres to every part of the body, and dies and drops off after the fish
                    has been for a short time in fresh water. In this state it is in the highest
                    perfection, the flesh is firm, red, and delicious, the form elegant, and the
                    colours beautiful. On first entering the river, the silvery colour of the sides
                    is very slightly marked with spots; but when it has remained long in fresh water
                    this colour decays, and the spots become much larger, darker coloured, and more
                    obvious. At the time of spawning, the sides of the fish get of a very red
                    colour, and when the spawning is over the white colour entirely disappears, the
                    belly becomes livid, and the sides are streaked all over with a sooty or black
                    colour; and in this state the salmon are termed in the acts of parliament red
                    and black fish. The rays of their fins are all at this time jagged or torn, a
                    great part of their scales rubbed off, and their gills infested with parasitical
                    worms. In Ireland, where great freedom is used in destroying salmon during and
                    after spawning season, the eating of the fish at that time has been often, and
                    in many places, found to be productive of much disease and mortality; and the
                    same is probably sometimes the case in Scotland, although not so much observed
                    as to be generally known; but a very marked instance is mentioned by Dr
                    Walker.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>Other fish are probably unwholesome after spawning, but they are seldom caught in
                    that state. Young fish, not come to the age of spawning, are in season all the
                    year.</p>
                <p>In regard to their <hi rend="italic">habitat,</hi> or the situation where they
                    live, fishes may be divided into three families: 1st, Those which live entirely
                    in salt water, as the cod and herring; 2⅛ those which live entirely in fresh
                    water, as various species of the cyprinus; and, 3d, those which live alternately
                    in salt and fresh water, as the salmon and sturgeon. The comparative esculent
                    qualities of each depend upon a great variety of circumstances; but of the last
                    class it may be remarked, that as they enter the rivers for the purpose of
                    spawning, they are in greatest perfection when they are proceeding up tire
                    rivers, and are quite out of season when returning to the sea.</p>
                <p>Fish seldom undergo any preparation for killing, nor is there any attention paid
                    to the mode of depriving them of life. Most commonly they are killed as soon as
                    caught, and frequently by merely taking them out of the water. Sometimes, when
                    large, the fishermen strike them upon the head, or tear asunder the branchial
                    vessels. The Dutch carry all their fresh fish alive to market, and when any die
                    previous to being sold, they are exposed in a different manner, and at an
                    inferior price. This practice no doubt insures fresh fish, but if certainly
                    fresh, they will be in greater perfection if killed immediately when caught,
                    than preserved alive for any time in an unnatural situation.</p>
                <p>To improve the quality of fish, they are sometimes subjected to the process
                    called crimping. It has been examined<pb break="no" facs="nls:193754709"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-4709-0727"/> by Mr Carlisle, to whom we are indebted for the
                    following facts: “Whenever the rigid contractions of death have not taken place,
                    this process may be practised with success. The sea-fish destined for crimping
                    are usually struck on the head when caught, which it is said protracts the term
                    of this capability, and the muscles which retain this property longest are those
                    about the head. Many transverse sections of the muscles being made, and the fish
                    immersed in cold water, the contractions called crimping take place in about
                    five minutes; but if the mass be large, it often requires thirty minutes to
                    complete the process.” The crimping of fresh-water fishes is said to require
                    hard water, and the London fishmongers usually employ it. Mr Carlisle found
                    that, by being crimped, the muscles subjected to the process have both their
                    absolute weight and their specific gravity increased; so that it appears that
                    water is absorbed, and condensation takes place.<note anchored="true"

                    proportion to the vivaciousness of the fish. From these observations it appears
                    that the object of crimping is first to retard the natural stiffening of the
                    muscles, and then, by the sudden application of cold water, to excite it in the
                    greatest possible degree, by which means it both acquires the desired firmness,
                    and keeps longer. We may also here observe, that rigidity is a certain mark that
                    the fish is perfectly fresh, and has not begun to spoil.</p>

                <p>. Few insects are used in food. The locust is, however, consumed in great
                    quantities, both fresh and salted, so as to afford some compensation for the
                    ravages it commits. The Moors in West Barbary esteem as delicious, honeycomb
                    with the young bees in it; but Mr Jones says that they seemed insipid to his

                <p>Although the vegetable kingdom furnishes the human race, even those who eat flesh
                    most freely, with the greater part of their food, yet there are many more
                    exceptions to the fitness for human food in the vegetable than in the animal
                    kingdom, both from mere indigestibility or defect of nutritious qualities, and
                    from being directly deleterious and hurtful. The selection of vegetable food,
                    when we depart from that which is familiar and known, is therefore more
                    difficult, and subject to uncertainty. There is, however, a certain analogy
                    between the action on the animal economy among vegetables which resemble each
                    other in external form, or in their botanical characters. The arrangement,
                    therefore, of vegetables into natural groups or families, is calculated to
                    assist us in judging of the uses, medicinal or esculent, of untried
                    vegetables.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>All parts of vegetables are used as food; roots, stalks, or shoots; leaves,
                    flowers, fruits, seeds, and the whole plant. The seeds oſ the <hi rend="italic"

                    the most important part of our food in almost every climate. Their mucilaginous
                    shoots also support that class βf animals hence called graminivorous, whose
                    flesh is most generally eaten; and the abundance of different species in all
                    varieties of climate, and the absolute identity of their nature, is the cause,
                    as De Candolle well observes, that these animals may be transported and
                    naturalized from one end of the world to the other.</p>
                <p>PRESERVATION.</p>
                <p>As the supply of food is always subject to irregularities, the preservation of
                    the excess obtained at one time to meet the deficiency of another would soon
                    engage the attention of mankind. At first this method would be simple and
                    natural, and derived from a very limited observation; but in the progress of
                    society the wants and occupations of mankind would lead them to invent means by
                    which the more perishable alimentary substances of one season might be reserved
                    for consumption at another, or the superfluous productions of distant countries
                    might be transported to others where they are more needed. The principles of
                    this most important art have been nowhere better explained than in the 45th
                    number of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> by an eminent vegetable
                    physiologist.</p>
                <p>In general, organic substances, as soon as they are deprived of life, begin to
                    undergo certain chemical changes, more or less rapidly, and of different kinds,
                    according to their nature. Although the modes of change, especially in the first
                    stages, are almost as numerous as the substances themselves, yet ultimately they
                    terminate in one or more of the principal kinds of fermentation described by
                    chemists. To each of these, besides the presence of an organic substance capable
                    of undergoing it, several conditions are requisite, of which the principal are a
                    certain temperature, a certain degree of moisture, and the access of air; and it
                    is by obviating or modifying these conditions that we are enabled to prevent or
                    regulate the natural fermentation. The kind of fermentation which substances
                    undergo depends upon their composition, and it may be generally remarked, that
                    those which do not contain a considerable proportion of azote are incapable of
                    the putrefactive fermentation, but pass through the vinous, acetous, and
                    destructive, successively. On the other hand, those which contain a large
                    proportion of azote are capable only of the putrefactive and destructive; but
                    there are many substances containing a small proportion of azote, in which both
                    kinds of fermentation are combined.</p>
                <p>A great proportion of vegetables are used in a recent state, and, in this case,
                    the sooner after they are gathered the better. Vegetables, in general, should be
                    kept apart; for, if laid in contact, in a very short time they impart their
                    peculiar flavours to each other. Lecks or celery will <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193754722" xml:id="kp-eb0709-4722-0728"/>quickly spoil a whole
                    basketful of cauliflower or the finer vegetables. Another general rule is, that
                    they should not be kept in water, nor even washed or refreshed by sprinkling
                    them with water, till they are to be used, as the flavour is thereby greatly
                    injured; but if, by having been cut or gathered some time, they have become
                    flaccid, it is absolutely necessary to restore their crispness before cooking
                    them, otherwise they will be tough and unpleasant. This is to be done when the
                    size of the vegetable admits of it, as cauliflower, salad, celery, and the like,
                    by cutting off a piece of the stalk and setting the fresh surface, thus exposed,
                    in water, which will be absorbed; in other cases the whole vegetable must be
                    immersed in water.</p>
                <p>Most vegetable substances being more or less succulent, their full proportion of
                    fluids is necessary for their retaining that state of crispness or plumpness
                    which they have when growing. On being cut or gathered, the exhalation from
                    their surfaces continues, while, from the open vessels of the cut surface, there
                    is often great exudation or evaporation, and thus their natural moisture is
                    diminished, and the tender leaves become flaccid, and the thicker masses or
                    roots lose their plumpness. This is not only less pleasant to the eye, but is a
                    real injury to the nutritious powers of the vegetable; for in this flaccid and
                    shrivelled state its fibres are less easily divided in chewing, and the water
                    which exists in vegetable substances, in the form of their respective natural
                    juices, is directly nutritious. The first care in the preservation of succulent
                    vegetables, therefore, is to prevent them from losing their natural moisture. In
                    regard to the tender succulent vegetables this is not altogether possible,
                    because there is a constant exhalation from their surface, while the supply of
                    moisture is cut off. The principle of preserving them, then, is to retard and
                    diminish the exhalation. This is most effectually done by protecting them from
                    the action of the sun’s rays, from the air, and from heat. Even growing
                    vegetables become flaccid in a hot sun, because the exhalation is then greater
                    than the supply; and exposure to the sun is absolutely ruinous to all the more
                    delicate vegetables. The operation of heat and air is slower, but similar.
                    Succulent vegetables should therefore be kept in a cool, shady, and damp place.
                    They should also be kept in a heap, and not spread out, which greatly influences
                    their shrivelling. But when accumulated in too large heaps for any length of
                    time, they are injured in another way, by their heating, as it is called, which
                    is the commencement, in them, of a chemical change, or fermentation, which
                    altogether alters their nature. In many cases the chief business is to prevent
                    evaporation. Potatoes, turnips, carrots, and similar roots, intended to be
                    stored up, should never be cleaned from the earth adhering to them, because the
                    little fibres by which it is retained are thus wounded, and the evaporating
                    surface is increased. They should also be wounded as little as possible, and the
                    tops of turnips and carrots should be cut off close to, but above, the root. The
                    next thing to be attended to is to protect them from the action of the air and
                    of frost. T]ιis is done by laying them in heaps, burying them in sand or in
                    earth, immersing them in water, or covering them with straw or mats. The action
                    of frost is most destructive, as, if it be considerable, the life of the
                    vegetable is destroyed, and it speedily rots. A less degree of frost induces a
                    singular but hurtful change upon the potato, by converting part of its starch,
                    or mucilage, into sugar. The germination of seeds also converts their starch
                    into sugar, as is exemplified in the malting of barley. But, even after this
                    change has been induced, if the substance be thoroughly dried in a kiln or
                    otherwise, it will still remain a long time without decay.</p>
                <p>The maturation of fruits, although not thoroughly examined, seems to be a change
                    of the same kind, that is, sugar is formed at the expense of the other principle
                    of the unripe fruit. The maturation of fruits is intimately connected with a
                    certain species of decay, as exemplified in the firmer fruits. The rotten parts
                    of many pears is remarkably sweet, and the saccharine matter does not begin to
                    be formed in the medlar until its decomposition be far advanced. In other
                    instances, as in the apple, the decayed part is intensely bitter; and the softer
                    juicy fruits grow mouldy and offensive. The art of preserving fruits consists in
                    being able to prevent and retard these changes. A certain proportion of moisture
                    seems to be necessary for their decay; and hence, by careful exsiccation, grapes
                    are converted into raisins, plums into prunes, and figs are dried. But by
                    carefully excluding them from the. air, they may even be preserved without
                    dissipating their natural moisture. Thus currants, cherries, and damsons,
                    gathered perfectly dry and sound, may be put into bottles, closed with cork and
                    rosin, and buried in a trench, with the cork downwards. Fine bunches of grapes
                    may also be preserved in bags, by closing the cut end of the stalk with wax,
                    which prevents the escape of moisture; or they may be packed in very dry bran or
                    sand. Some may even be preserved by being kept immersed in water. This is
                    constantly practised in regard to the cranberry, and sometimes succeeds with
                    apples.</p>
                <p>The preservation of fruit is in many countries an object of much importance. In
                    some, the great object is to preserve the fruit in as natural a state as
                    possible. This is particularly the ease in regard to winter apples, and pears,
                    and grapes. The time for gathering fruits depends upon their exposure, and the
                    manner of gathering them influences their keeping. After having prepared the
                    fruit-room, a fine day is to be chosen, and, if possible, after two or three
                    preceding days of dry weather, and about two in the afternoon, the fruit is to
                    be gathered, and deposited in baskets of a moderate size, taking care that none
                    of it receive any bruise or blemish, for the injured part soon rots and spoils
                    the sound fruit in contact with it. As the summer fruits ripen more quickly
                    after they are pulled, only a few days consumption should be gathered at once,
                    by which means we can enjoy them for a greater length of time. Autumn apples and
                    pears should be gathered eight days before they are ripe; and, indeed, some
                    kinds never become fit for eating on the tree. If they have been necessarily
                    gathered in wet weather, or early in the morning, they should be exposed a day
                    to the sun to dry, and they should on no account be wiped, which rubs off the
                    bloom as it is called, which, when allowed to dry on some fruits, constitutes a
                    natural varnish, closing up the pores, and preventing the evaporation of the
                    juices. They should not be laid in heaps, which causes them to sweat, and
                    undergo a slight fermentation; for fruit thus treated, if it does not spoil,
                    gets dry and mealy; and hence, in this country, the ordinary apples imported
                    from England and the Continent are inferior to our own. The principal requisites
                    for a good fruit-room are great dryness, and equality of temperature, and the
                    power of excluding light. Some curious persons preserve fine pears by passing a
                    thread through the stalk, of which they seal up the end with a drop of
                    sealing-wax, enclose each separately in a cone of paper, and hang them up by the
                    thread brought through the apex. Experience has also proved that grapes keep
                    better when hanging than' when laid upon a table. The cut end should be closed
                    with wax, which prevents exhalation. Some hang them by the stalk, others by the
                    point of the bunch, as the grapes are thus less pressed against each other; but
                    it is in both cases necessary to visit them from time to time, and cut off, with
                    a pair of scissors, every berry that is mouldy or spoiled.</p>
                <p>More artificial modes of preserving grapes in a succident state are sometimes
                    used, and become necessary for their <pb break="no" facs="nls:193754735"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-4735-0729"/>transportation to distant countries. They are
                    often packed with bran and saw-dust; and Apicius says they may be preserved in
                    barley. The same classical gourmand was well acquainted with the use of water in
                    preserving the grapes in their natural state. “Take grapes from the vine without
                    wounding them. Boil rain water down to a third, and put it into a vessel, into
                    which you also put the grapes. Close the vessel with pitch and gypsum, and place
                    it in a cool situation, to which the sun has not access, and when you please you
                    will have green grapes. The water may be given to sick persons as hydromel.” The
                    boiling of the water so long is unnecessary, as a much shorter time would be
                    sufficient to expel the air, which is probably the manner in which it has some
                    effect. The water will acquire a slight acidity from the grapes; and hence it
                    was given, sweetened with honey, as a pleasant drink to the sick.</p>
                <p>Animal substances in general, when deprived of life, have a natural tendency to
                    undergo the putrefactive fermentation. Before this is established they pass
                    through a series of successive changes, which are intimately connected with our
                    subject. After death the bodies of animals cool more or less rapidly, according
                    to the temperature and conducting power of the air, or other substances with
                    which they are in contact. In fact they do not differ in this respect from an
                    equal mass of any other matter, heat-ed artificially to the same temperature,
                    and having the same conducting power. As this, however, is very weak, the bodies
                    of animals cool very slowly after death.</p>
                <p>For some time after death the muscular parts of animals continue to suffer
                    contraction, followed by relaxation, when stimulated, as by the point of a
                    needle, or the application of galvanism. But this irritability, or organic
                    contractility as it is termed by some modern physiologists, gradually disappears
                    in the different organs, and commonly in the muscles of the trunk before those
                    of the limbs. It is also observed, that, in the different classes of animals,
                    the duration of the irritability is inversely as the energy of muscular action
                    which they exhibit during life. It is strongest and most durable in animals
                    which are suddenly killed when in high health, and is weak and evanescent in
                    those which die of lingering diseases, or from fatigue.</p>
                <p>After the irritability has entirely ceased, the muscles begin to become rigid,
                    first those of the trunk, and then those of the limbs. Its duration is inversely
                    as the time of its commencement; and it is longest of beginning, but is greatest
                    and lasts longest, in those animals which are suddenly killed when in high
                    health. It appears very quickly, and lasts a short time only, in animals which
                    die of exhaustion or from fatigue. In whatever attitude the limbs are placed at
                    its commencement, they continue; and hence butchers take care to dress properly
                    the carcasses of animals while yet supple. For after rigidity has commenced, if
                    the position of the limb be forcibly changed, it is destroyed, and the joint
                    becomes permanently supple. Also muscles which are frozen when rigid, are
                    extremely supple as soon as they are thawed. Rigidity is perhaps never developed
                    in animals frozen to death.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>While this rigidity continues, the flesh of animals is hard and stringy, and, so
                    far as the palate is concerned, not yet fit for the table, although fully
                    nutritious, and in perfection for making soup. After the rigidity has totally
                    ceased, animal flesh is not long of experiencing the commencement of those
                    chemical changes which terminate in putrefaction; and it is of the utmost
                    importance, in domestic economy, to take care that all Urge joints be in this
                    intermediate state when they are cooked; for no skill in the culinary art wall
                    compensate for negligence in this point, as every one must have often
                    experienced to his great disappointment. Meat in which we are able to detect the
                    slightest trace of putrescency has reached its greatest degree of tenderness,
                    and should be used without delay; but before this period, which in some kinds of
                    meat is offensive, the degree of inteneration may be known by its yielding
                    readily to the pressure of the finger, and by its opposing little resistance to
                    an attempt to bend the joint. Poultry also thus part readily with their
                    feathers, and it would be advisable to leave a few when the bird is plucked, in
                    order to assist in determining their state. “No man who understands good living
                    will say, on such a day will I eat that turkey; but let him hang it up by four
                    of the large tail feathers, and when, on paying his morning visit to the larder,
                    he finds it lying upon a cloth prepared to receive it when it falls, that day
                    let it be cooked.” But as we cannot always choose our time for eating the joints
                    in our larder, we must, in providing them for a particular day, estimate that
                    they will then be in a proper state, or, if necessary, endeavour to hasten or
                    retard it. By experience we acquire some knowledge of the length of time for
                    which the different kinds of meat should be kept, although it is subject to
                    great variations, depending upon the .temperature, moisture, and ventilation of
                    the place where it is kept, upon the kind of meat, the age of the animal, and
                    upon peculiarities in the individual not understood.</p>
                <p>The chief means of preventing the fermentation of organic substances are,
                    reduction of temperature, desiccation, exclusion of air, and the action of
                    certain substances called antiseptic. Although most commonly employed in
                    combination with each other, we shall briefly explain the principles upon which
                    they act singly, and then notice their practical application in reference to the
                    animal and vegetable kingdoms.</p>
                <p>A moderate reduction of temperature acts by retarding vital and chemical action,
                    and a reduction, capable of freezing the juices and fluids of organized bodies,
                    by destroying vitality, and converting the water present into ice, and thus
                    removing a condition essential to chemical action. Many vegetable, and some
                    animal substances, such as eggs, possess what may be called latent life, and so
                    long as this continues they resist fermentation. A very low temperature puts an
                    end to it, while a high temperature calls it into action, after which it cannot
                    be suspended without destroying it altogether, and thus it is longest preserved
                    in a temperature just a little higher than the former. An egg which has been
                    frozen is killed, and rots soon after being thawed. On the other hand, by
                    incubation, or an equal degree of heat, the life of the chick becomes active,
                    and cannot again be checked with impunity; while, at a moderately low
                    temperature, the latent life of an egg continues a great length of time, ready
                    to be excited into action when placed in favourable circumstances, and resisting
                    the natural tendency to chemical change. The same observation nearly applies to
                    vegetables. Succulent roots, for example, can be long preserved in a moderatel,
                    low temperature; but if it be raised they begin to shoot, or if it be reduced
                    too much they die, and soon rot.</p>
                <p>On dead organic substances a reduced temperature acts by retarding or preventing
                    chemical change.</p>
                <p>The preservative effects of cold are of the utmost importance to the northern
                    nations, by enabling them to store up a sufficient stock of all manner of
                    provisions for their winter consumption, and to receive supplies from a great
                    distance. It is thus that veal frozen at Archangel is brought to Petersburg, and
                    the markets of Moscow present immense stocks of hogs, sheep, and fish. The same
                    advantage is <pb break="no" facs="nls:193754748" xml:id="kp-eb0709-4748-0730"
                    />taken of the cold in Canada, and all other countries where the frost is
                    sufficiently steady.</p>
                <p>Substances, so long as they are hard frozen, probably undergo no chemical change,
                    of which the most striking proof was afforded by the body of an animal, probably
                    antediluvian, being found imbedded in a mass of ice at the mouth of the Lena;
                    but in the act of freezing, or of the subsequent thawing, some alteration is
                    produced, which affects the nature of the substance. This may be either merely
                    mechanical, from the particles of ice, during their formation, tearing asunder
                    and separating the fibres; or chemical, by destroying the intimate union of the
                    constituents of the fluids, as in wine injured by having been frozen; or by
                    causing new combinations, of which we have an example in the sweetness acquired
                    by the potato.</p>
                <p>Captain Scoresby, contrary to popular belief, states that “the most surprising
                    action of the frost on fresh provision is in preserving it a long time from
                    putrefaction, even after it is thawed and returns into a warm climate. I have,”
                    says he, “eaten unsalted mutton and beef nearly five months old, which has been
                    constantly exposed to a temperature above the freezing point for four or five
                    weeks in the outset, and occasionally assailed by the septical influences of
                    rain, fog, heat, and electricity, and yet it has proved perfectly sweet. It may
                    be remarked that unsalted meat that has been preserved four or five months in a
                    cold climate, and then brought back to the British coasts during the warmth of
                    summer, must be consumed very speedily after it is cut into, or it will fail in
                    a day or two. It will seldom, indeed, keep sweet after being cooked above twenty
                    or thirty hours.”</p>
                <p>In freezing animal substances for the purpose of preserving them, no other
                    precaution is necessary than exposing them to a sufficient degree of cold.
                    “Animal substances,” says Captain Scoresby, “requisite as food, of all
                    descriptions (fish excepted), may be taken to Greenland and there preserved any
                    length of time, without being smoked, dried, or salted. No preparation of any
                    kind is necessary for their preservation, nor is any other precaution requisite,
                    excepting suspending them in the air when taken on shipboard, shielding them a
                    little from the sun and wet, and immersing them occasionally in sea-water, or
                    throwing sea-water over them after heavy rains, which will effectually prevent
                    putrescency on the outward passage, and in Greenland the cold becomes a
                    sufficient preservation, by freezing them as hard as blocks of wood.” “The
                    moisture is well preserved by freezing, a little from the surface only
                    evaporating, so that if cooked when three, four, or five months old, meat will
                    frequently appear as profuse of gravy as if it had been but recently killed.”
                    Captain Scoresby has not informed us why fish cannot be taken to Greenland in a
                    frozen state, though this is a mode of preservation much used in Russia and
                    Germany, and even in our own country.</p>
                <p>Some attention is necessary for thawing provisions which have been frozen. “When
                    used, the beef cannot be divided but by an axe or a saw; the latter instrument
                    is generally preferred. It is then put into cold water, from which it derives
                    heat by the formation of ice around it, and soon thaws; but if put into hot
                    water, much of the gravy is extracted, and the meat is injured without being
                    thawed more readily. If an attempt be made to cook it before it is thawed, it
                    may be burnt on the outside, while the centre remains raw, or actually in a
                    frozen state.” These observations, which we have transcribed from Captain
                    Scoresby,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>see his <hi
                    rend="italic">Account of the Arctic</hi><hi rend="italic">Regioni,</hi><hi

                    directions of earlier writers. Thus Kriinitz says, “when fish taken under the
                    ice are frozen, lay them in cold water, which thus draws the ice out of the
                    fish, so that it can be scraped off their scales. They taste much better
                    afterwards than when they are allowed to thaw in a warm room."<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclo∕&gt;.</hi> vol. X. p. 68G.</p></note> We do not know whether it be
                    ignorance or inattention to this direction on the part of the London fishmongers
                    which causes the salmon sent from Scotland in ice to be little esteemed.</p>
                <p>The second general method of preventing fermentation is desiccation, or the
                    removal of that degree of moisture which is an essential condition to this kind
                    of chemical action. Desiccation takes place in consequence of the air absorbing
                    the moisture of bodies exposed to its action. It is therefore promoted by the
                    size of surface exposed, by the dry state of the atmosphere, increased
                    temperature, and by the constant change of the air in contact with the body to
                    be dried, or, in other words, by exposing it to a free current of air. This mode
                    of checking fermentation is assisted by dividing or cutting the bodies to be
                    dried, especially across the grain, which acts not only by increasing the
                    surface, but perhaps still more by dividing the vessels containing the moisture
                    or fluids, and thus allowing them to be freely acted upon by the air, to which
                    the skin or epidermis, when entire, frequently exposes a very great obstacle. In
                    pharmacy, where exsiccation is often necessary, this is well understood, and
                    expressed in the collegiate directions for drying squills, and other succulent
                    roots. In domestic economy it is also practised in drying artichoke bottoms, and
                    guarded against when vegetables are required to be kept succulent, which are or
                    ought to be trimmed or wounded as little as possible till they are to be used.
                    Animal substances also dry much more slowly so long as the surface is entire;
                    and hence some country butchers skin veal joint by joint only, as it is
                    required. The influence of extent of surface is a matter of constant
                    observation. A little water, which would require days to evaporate out of a wine
                    glass, disappears in a few minutes when spread over a China plate. Also solid
                    substances dry more quickly in proportion to the smallness of their size, as the
                    surface exposed is proportionably greater. But none of the agents in
                    accelerating exsiccation has so great an influence as the dry state of the air
                    by which it is effected.</p>
                <p>Mr Hearne<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">* Journey to the Northern Ocean.</hi></p></note> gives an account
                    of the manner in which the Indians of North America preserve, by means of mere
                    exsiccation, the flesh of musk oxen, deer, or any other animat To prepare meat
                    in this manner, no farther operation is required than cutting the lean parts of
                    the animal into thin slices, and drying it in the sun, or by exposing it to the
                    heat of a fire, when it is reduced to powder by beating it between two stones.
                    Meat prepared in this way is very portable, and always ready for use, and it is
                    very substantial; for Mr Hearne found that he could always travel longer without
                    victuals after making a meal of it, than after any other kind of food. The
                    northern Indians dry their meat by the heat of a very slow fire, or by fastening
                    it to the tops of the women’s bundles, and allowing it to dry by the sun and
                    wind as they walk along. But the southern Indians expose it to the heat of a
                    very large fire, which, in Mi Hearne’s opinion, exhausts its juices, renders it
                    as hard as horn, and gives it a bitter taste, whereas the other is soft and
                    mellow in the mouth, and entirely free from smoke. Fish is also dried by them in
                    the sun, and pounded for th« sake of carriage.</p>
                <p>The third general means of preventing fermentation is the total exclusion of
                    atmospheric air, or rather of oxygen.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193754761" xml:id="kp-eb0709-4761-0731"/>
                <p>The truth of this is not so obvious to common observation as that of the others;
                    for, on the contrary, we every day see substances spoiled by being apparently
                    excluded from the air, but in reality by being shut up in confined air; and we
                    are taught to consider free ventilation as a powerful means of preservation. The
                    manner in which the latter acts we have shown to be by removing moisture,
                    especially when contaminated by the exhalation of the perishable substance. The
                    <hi rend="italic">rationale</hi> of the former is more obscure, but has been
                    ingeniously attempted by Gay-Lussac, and the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh
                    Review</hi> (No. xlv.), in order to explain the processes of Μ. Appert.
                    Gay-Lussac found that neither fresh vegetable juices nor animal matter fermented
                    so long as oxygen gas was perfectly excluded; and that the fermentation, in both
                    cases, commenced as soon as any portion of oxygen was admitted. When oxygen gas
                    is confined in contact with a fermentable substance, it is changed into an equal
                    bulk of carbonic acid gas, and all farther action ceases. Methods of preserving
                    fermentable substances, illustrative of this principle, have long been practised
                    imperfectly by housewives. Nothing can be simpler than Mr Raffald’s receipt for
                    preserving green peas, cranberries, currants, &amp;c. “Put them into dry clean
                    bottles, cork them close, and tie them with a bladder; keep them in a cool dry
                    place.” A variation of this process was to fill the bottles previously with
                    sulphurous acid vapour, by holding in them for some time a lighted sulphur
                    match. One effect of this is to remove all uncombined oxygen. Other methods of
                    excluding air were also employed, as filling up the interstices with water or
                    melted suet. The success of this process was greatly promoted by subjecting the
                    substances to the action of a certain degree of heat, after being put into the
                    bottles or jars in which they were to be preserved; and then we are desired “to
                    set them in a copper of hot water till they are hot quite through,” or to “put
                    them in an oven when the bread is drawn, and let them stand till shrunk a
                    quarter part.”</p>
                <p>In these cases the heat seems to act by coagulating and rendering insoluble and
                    inactive a kind of gluten, which seems to be a principal agent in beginning
                    fermentation. In general, in the old processes, we were directed not to cork or
                    tie up the vessels until they were quite cool, by which it now appears a very
                    great advantage was lost. But Mr Saddington obtained, in 1817, a premium from
                    the Society of Arts for a method of preserving fruit without sugar, for house or
                    sea stores; the chief peculiarity of which consisted in filling the bottles, as
                    soon as they are taken out of the bath, with boiling water to within an inch of
                    the cork, and immediately corking them very tight and laying them on their
                    sides, that the cork may swell and effectually exclude the air. Animal
                    substances have also long been occasionally preserved by the mere exclusion of
                    air. The most familiar example is the buttering of eggs, which has the effect of
                    closing the pores in the shell by which the communication of the embryo with the
                    external air takes place. It is best performed by rubbing over the shell with
                    butter while it is still warm after being laid; and an egg in this way retains
                    the curdy milk, and possesses all the properties of a new-laid egg for a great
                    length of time; but at whatever period after being laid the <hi rend="italic"
                    >egg</hi> is buttered over, its progress to decay seems to be arrested. The same
                    effect is produced, though not so perfectly, by immersing eggs in water. From an
                    experiment of Reaumur’s, it appears that the cutting off the access of air to
                    the embryo in the egg does not kill it or prevent it from being hatched, but, on
                    the contrary, preserves it alive for a much greater time than if it had not been
                    treated in this manner. He covered over eggs with spirit varnish, and he found
                    them capable of producing chickens after two years, when the varnish was
                    carefully removed.</p>
                <p>Although, however, the preservation of alimentary matters by the total exclusion
                    of air, assisted by subjecting them to a certain degree of heat, has long been
                    practised in some degree, we are certainly indebted to Μ. Appert,<note

                    scientific application of these principles upon a large scale. From extensive
                    experience and long perseverance he became convinced,</p>
                <p>“Is/, That fire has the peculiar property, not only of changing the combination
                    of the constituent parts of vegetable and animal productions, but also of
                    retarding, for many years at least, if not of destroying, the natural tendency
                    of those same productions to decomposition.</p>

                    those same productions, with all their natural qualities.”</p>
                <p>Upon these principles he invented many processes adapted to the different natures
                    of the substances to be preserved; but the fundamental conditions consist, 1.5/,
                    In enclosing in bottles the substances to be preserved. 2rfZy, In corking the
                    bottles with the utmost care; for it is chiefly on the corking that the success

                <p>Μ. Appert employed at first bottles made of glass, which it was difficult to
                    close exactly, especially when their mouths were large; but he now uses
                    cylinders of tin plate, which are soldered up after they are filled. This is
                    especially an improvement for animal substances, which require much more
                    attention than vegetables. Tin cases or canisters seem to have been first used
                    in London by Messrs Donkin and Gamble, by whom a very ingenious method of
                    testing the provisions put up by them was also invented as early as 1813.<note

                    undergoes the remainder of the cooking, when a small hole is opened at the top
                    of the cylinder, and immediately closed with solder while still hot. The whole
                    is now allowed to cool, and from the diminution of volume in the contents, in
                    consequence of the reduction of temperature, both ends of the cylinder are
                    pressed inwards and become concave. The cases thus hermetically sealed are
                    exposed in a <hi rend="italic">test-chamber,</hi> for at least a month, to a
                    temperature above what they are ever likely to encounter; from 90° to 110°
                    Fahrenheit. If the process has failed, putrefaction takes place, and gas is
                    evolved, which in process of time will bulge out both ends of the case, so as to
                    render them convex instead of concave. But the contente of whatever cases stand

                    of time. Another advantage is, that if there be any taint about the meat when
                    put up, it inevitably ferments, and is detected in the proving.</p>
                <p>All kinds of alimentary matters may be preserved in this way,—beef, mutton, veal,
                    and poultry, boiled and roasted, soups, broths and vegetables, creams and
                    custards. The testimonies in favour of the success of the process are of the
                    most unexceptionable kind. The meat is put up in canisters of from four pounds
                    to twenty pounds weight each, and the milk and soups in quart or pint bottles.
                    The meat is charged from Is. 8d. to 3s. a pound; roast higher than boiled, and
                    veal dearer than mutton or beef. The milk is 2∙⅛s. per dozen for quarts, 15s.
                    for pints, and 10s. for half pints; and soups from 30s. to 60s. per dozen for
                    quarts. The weight of the canister is deducted, and nothing is charged ìbr
                    canisters or bottles; and it should be observed, that the patent provisions
                    being cooked, and without bone, render them nearly equivalent to double the
                    weight of meat in the raw state; for, by experiment, the patentees found, that
                    the waste in cooking, and weight of bone, are about one half. Captain Neish took
                    a quantity to India; not one canister spoiled; and one which he brought home
                    contained beef in the highest state of preservation after two years, and having
                    been carried upwards of 35,000 miles in the warmest climates. The commissioners
                    for victualling the navy also examined some nearly four years old, which had
                    been in the Mediterranean and Quebec, and found it as sound, sweet, and fresh,
                    as if it had been only yesterday boiled. We are also enabled to add the
                    testimony of Captain Basil Hall, who has liberally communicated to us the result
                    of his personal experience and observation: “I can answer for the perfect
                    preservation of a great number of cases which were in my possession during the
                    voyage to China. I had L.88 worth, and not one failure. At that time milk was
                    preserved in bottles corked; but tin cases have been substituted with very great
                    effect, as I have myself tried. It is really astonishing how excellent the milk
                    is; and, indeed, every thing preserved in this way is good.</p>
                <p>“You must, on examining the lists of prices, bear in mind that meat thus
                    preserved <hi rend="italic">eats</hi> nothing, nor <hi rend="italic"

                    takes no care in the keeping—it is always ready, may be eat cold or hot, and
                    thus enables you to toss into a boat in a minute as many days’ <hi rend="italic"
                    >cooked</hi> provisions as you choose—it is not exposed to the vicissitudes of
                    markets, nor is it scourged up to a monstrous price, as at St Helena, because
                    there is no alternative. Besides these advantages, it enables one to indulge in
                    a number of luxuries which no care or expense <hi rend="italic">could</hi>
                    procure.”</p>
                <p>The property of salt to preserve animal substances from putrefaction is of most
                    essential importance to the empire in general, and to the remote grazing
                    districts in particular. It enables the latter to dispose of their live stock,
                    and distant navigation is wholly dependent upon it. All kinds of animal
                    substances may be preserved by salt, but beef and pork are the only staple
                    articles of this kind. In general, the pieces of the animal best fitted for
                    being salted are those which contain fewest large blood-vessels, and are most
                    solid. Some recommend all the glands to be cut out, and say, that without this
                    precaution meat cannot be preserved; but that this is a mistake, the salt udder,
                    and glands of the tongue, every day’s experience shows.</p>
                <p>The salting may be performed either by dry rubbing, or by immersing the meat in
                    pickle. Cured in the former way the meat will keep longer, but it is more
                    altered in its valuable properties; in the latter way it is more delicate and
                    nutritious. Six pounds of salt, one pound of sugar, and four ounces of
                    saltpetre, boiled with four gallons of water, skimmed and allowed to cool, forms
                    a very strong pickle, which will preserve any meat completely immersed in it. To
                    effect this, which is essential, either a heavy board, or flat stone, must be
                    laid upon the meat. The same pickle may be used repeatedly, provided it be
                    boiled up occasionally with additional salt to restore its strength, diminished
                    by the combination of part of the salt with the meat, and by the dilution of the
                    pickle by the juices of the meat extracted. By boiling, the albumen, which would
                    cause the pickle to spoil, is coagulated, and rises in the form of scum, which
                    must be carefully removed.</p>
                <p>Dry salting is performed by rubbing the surface of the meat all over with salt;
                    and it is generally believed that the process of salting is promoted if the salt
                    be rubbed in with a heavy hand. On the contrary, it is said, that in very hot
                    countries, for example, Jamaica, where it is so necessary that the action of the
                    salt should take place as quickly as possible, the mode of salting a round of
                    beef is to place it on two sticks over a tub of water, with the small end
                    uppermost, and to cover it with a heap of salt, which penetrates through the
                    veins and arteries, and among the fibres, in the state of a saturated solution.
                    However this may be, it is almost certain that very little salt penetrates,
                    except through the cut surfaces, to which it should therefore be chiefly
                    applied; and all holes, whether natural or artificial, should be particularly
                    attended to. For each twenty-five pounds of meat, about a pound of
                    coarse-grained salt (St Ubes’ is the best) should be allowed, and the whole,
                    previously heated, rubbed in at once. When laid in the pickling tub, a brine is
                    soon formed by the salt dissolved in the juice of the meat which it extracts,
                    and with this the meat should be rubbed every day, and a different side turned
                    down. In ten or twelve days it will be sufficiently cured.</p>
                <p>For domestic use, the meat should not be salted as soon as it comes from the
                    market, but kept until its fibre has become short and tender, as these changes
                    do not take place after it has been acted upon by the salt. But in the provision
                    trade, “the expedition with which the animals are slaughtered, the meat cut up
                    and salted, and afterwards packed, is astonishing.”<note anchored="true"

                    vol. i. p. 7δ&lt;J.</p></note> By salting the meat while still warm, and before
                    the fluids are coagulated, the salt penetrates immediately, by means of the
                    vessels, through the whole substance of the meat; and hence meat is admirably
                    cured at Tunis, even in the hottest season; so that Mr Jackson, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Reflections on the Trade of the Mediterranean,</hi> recommends
                    ships being supplied there with their provisions.</p>
                <p>“Take half a pound of black pepper, half a pound of red or kyan pepper, and half
                    a pound of the best saltpetre, all beat or ground very fine; mix these three
                    well together, then mix them with about three quarts of very' fine salt: this
                    mixture is sufficient for eight hundredweight of beef. As the pieces are brought
                    from the person cutting up, first sprinkle the pieces with the spice, and
                    introduce a little into all the thickest parts; if it cannot be done otherwise,
                    make a small incision with a knife. The first salter, after rubbing salt and
                    spice well into the meat, should take and mould the piece, the same as washing a
                    shirt upon a board; this may be very easily done, and the meat being lately
                    killed, is soft and pliable; this moulding opens the grain of the meat, which
                    will make it imbibe the spice and salt much quicker than the common method of
                    salting. The first <pb break="no" facs="nls:193754787"

                    who moulds and rubs the salt well into the meat, and, if he observes occasion,
                    introduces the spice; when the second salter has finished his piece, he folds it
                    up as close as possible, and hands it to the packer at the harness tubs, who
                    must be stationed near him: the packer must be careful to pack his harness tubs
                    as close as possible.</p>
                <p>“All the work must be carried on in the shade, but, where there is a strong
                    current of air, the harness tubs in particular; this being a very material point
                    in curing the meat in a hot climate. Meat may be cured in this manner with the
                    greatest safety when the thermometer, in the shade, is at 110°, the extreme heat
                    assisting the curing.</p>
                <p>“A good sized bullock, of six or seven hundredweight, may be killed and salted
                    within the hour.</p>
                <p>“The person who attends with the spice near the first salter has the greatest
                    trust imposed upon him; besides the spice, he should be well satisfied that the
                    piece is sufficiently salted before he permits the first salter to hand the
                    piece over to the second salter.</p>
                <p>“All the salt should be very fine, and the packer, besides sprinkling the bottom
                    of his harness tubs, should be careful to put plenty of salt between each tier
                    of meat, which is very soon turned into the finest pickle. The pickle will
                    nearly cover the meat as fast as the packer can stow it away. It is always a
                    good sign that ⅛e meat is very safe when the packer begins to complain that his
                    hands are aching with cold.</p>
                <p>“By this method, there is no doubt but that the meat is perfectly cured in three
                    hours from the time of killing the bullock. The saltpetre in a very little time
                    strikes through the meat: however, it is always better to let it lie in the
                    harness tubs till the following morning, when it will have an exceeding pleasant
                    smell on opening the harness tubs; then take it out and pack it in tight
                    barrels, with its own pickle.”</p>
                <p>Beef and pork, in a less degree, properly salted with salt alone, acquire a green
                    colour; but if an ounce of saltpetre be added to each five pounds of salt
                    employed, the muscular fibre acquires a fine red colour; but this improvement in
                    appearance is more than compensated by its becoming harder and harsher to the
                    taste; to correct which, a proportion of sugar or molasses is often added. But
                    the red colour may be given if desired, without hardening the meat, by the
                    addition of a little cochineal.</p>
                <p>Meat, when salted, is either preserved immersed in pickle, in close vessels, or
                    dried, when it gets the name of bacon, ham, or hung beef.</p>
                <p>Meat kept immersed in pickle rather gains weight. In one experiment by Messrs
                    Donkin and Gamble, there was a gain of three per cent., and in another of two
                    and a half; but in the common way of salting, when the meat is not immersed in
                    pickle, there is a loss of about one pound or one and a half in sixteen.</p>
                <p>The drying of salt meat is effected either by hanging it in a dry and well-aired
                    place, or by exposing it at the same time to wood smoke, which gives it a
                    peculiar flavour, much admired in Westphalia hams and Hamburg beef, and also,
                    perhaps, tends to preserve it, by the antiseptic action of the pyrolignic acid.
                    When meat is to be hung, it need not be so highly salted.</p>
                <p>Fish, in like manner, may be preserved either by dry salting or in pickle. The
                    former method is employed to a great extent on the banks of Newfoundland and in
                    Shetland. For information on this important subject, the article <hi

                <p>Dr Hibbert thinks that the cod-fish prepared in Shetland will always maintain its
                    pre-eminence over the cod of other places. In Newfoundland the fish are said to
                    be exposed, after being salted, on standing flakes, made by a slight wattle, and
                    supported by poles, often twenty feet from the ground. But the humidity is not
                    nearly so well extracted from the fish as when, according to the Shetland
                    method, they are carefully laid out upon dry beaches, the stones of which have
                    been during winter exposed to the abrading action of the ocean, and are thus
                    cleared from animal and vegetable matter.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    itself. They fill up the barrels with fish of the same kind and night’s
                    catching, and are exceedingly careful of the pickle, as they use no other in
                    filling of the barrels.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Herrings and salmon are also often cured by drying them in wood smoke after being
                    slightly salted, and are called red' herrings or Yarmouth herrings, and kipper
                    or smoked salmon.</p>
                <p>Butter is commonly preserved by working into each pound one or two ounces of
                    salt, until they be thoroughly incorporated. The best salt for the purpose is in
                    large crystals, and it should be thoroughly dried and coarsely-powdered. But Dr
                    Anderson recommends for the curing of butter, a mixture of two parts of the best
                    great salt, one of sugar, and one of saltpetre, beat into a fine powder. One
                    ounce of this mixture is sufficient for a pound of butter. He says that butter
                    cured in this way does not taste well till it has stood at least a fortnight
                    after being salted; but after that period it has a rich marrowy taste, that no
                    other butter ever acquires, and tastes so little salt, that one would imagine it
                    would not keep; and yet Dr Anderson has seen it perfectly sound and sweet when
                    two years old.</p>
                <p>Butter spoils and becomes rancid, chiefly from the milk, which is not entirely
                    expressed from it, and in consequence of the albumen, which is constantly
                    present. These maybe separated by melting the butter and keeping It over the
                    fire until all the water be evaporated, when the albumen will also be
                    coagulated, and sink to the bottom. To prevent all risk of producing an
                    empyreumatic taste, the vessel containing the butter should not be exposed
                    directly to the fire, but placed in a larger vessel filled with water, which is
                    made to boil, forming what the chemists call a water-bath. While the butter
                    remains fluid, it resembles a perfectly transparent oil, and on cooling it
                    becomes opaque, and is firmer and a little paler than the butter before it was
                    clarified. It will keep for a considerable time without salt; but if it be
                    salted as common butter, it will continue much longer sweet in hot climates,
                    than if it had been cured in its original state.<note anchored="true"

                    highly rancid. It is melted in an earthen pot, and boiled until all the water be
                    evaporated. After being taken from the fire, a little coagulated acid milk and
                    salt, or betel leaf and reddle, are added. It is kept in pots, and eaten when

                <p>Vinegar, in itself a very destructible substance when exposed to the air, tends
                    greatly to preserve vegetable substances when both are carefully excluded from
                    it. In general, however, the vegetable is previously salted. After the pickles
                    are prepared, the bottles are to be carefully corked, tied up with bladder, and
                    sealed over with wax or rosin. For the making of pickles, the vinegar now
                    distilled from wood, as in itself containing no principles of decay, must be
                    preferable to common vinegar.</p>
                <p>Μ. Parmentier has given a minute description of the process of making sour krout
                    on the great scale. The heads of winter cabbages, after removing the outer
                    leaves, are to be cut into fine shreds, by means of an instrument made on
                    purpose, and then spread out to dry upon a cloth in the shade. A cask is to be
                    set on end, with the head taken out. If it formerly contained vinegar or wine,
                    so much the better, as it will promote the fermentation, and give the cabbage a
                    more vinous taste; if not, the inside may be rubbed over with some krout barm.
                    Caraway seeds are to be mixed with the shreds of cabbage, a good layer of salt
                    placed at the bottom of the cask, and then cabbage shreds to be evenly packed,
                    to the depth of six inches. A man having on strong boots, well washed and nicely
                    clean, must now get into the cask, and tread down the shreds to half their
                    original bulk. The same process is to be repeated, with additional layers of
                    salt and shreds, till the whole be packed. They are then to be covered with a
                    layer of salt, or till the barrel be filled within two inches of the top, over
                    which the outside leaves of the cabbages are to be spread. About two pounds of
                    salt are required for twenty cabbages.</p>
                <p>The head of the barrel, which should have been previously well fastened together,
                    is lastly to be put within the barrel above the leaves, and loaded with stones,
                    to prevent the mixture from rising during the fermentation. The mass thus
                    compressed subsides, and the cabbages give out their juice, which rises to the
                    surface, is green, muddy, and fetid. It is to be drawn off by a spigot placed
                    two or three inches down, and replaced by fresh brine every day, until it come
                    off clear, which will take twelve or fifteen days, according to the temperature
                    of the place. The essential point for keeping sour krout good, is to take care
                    that it be always covered at least an inch with pickle. For home consumption
                    enough may be made at one time to serve the year, and the pickle is then renewed
                    at the beginning of spring, and at midsummer. When intended as ship provision
                    for long voyages, the sour krout must be repacked very firmly into other casks,
                    which are then to be filled with fresh pickle, and closed as accurately as
                    possible. When well made and preserved, it has a very pleasant acidity, and is
                    not only very healthy, but agrees with many persons who cannot use fresh
                    cabbages. It is also considered to be a very excellent antiscorbutic; and
                    Captain Cook attributed his success in preserving the health of his crew in his
                    voyage partly to its use.</p>
                <p>Vinegar is never used for the preservation of butcher meat, but salmon is often
                    pickled in it, with the addition of salt and spices.</p>
                <p>Pryolignic acid has lately been much extolled, as having a specific power in
                    preserving animal matters. It consists of acetic acid, impregnated with an
                    empyreumatic oil. The acid is in general very strong, and being free from the
                    mucilage which promotes the spoiling of common vinegar, it is so far a better
                    antiseptic; but the empyreumatic oil may also add to its powers, either by
                    keeping away insects, to which it is very offensive, or by a direct antiseptic
                    power not understood. Professor Jörg of Leipsic is said to have recovered
                    tainted flesh by rubbing it with the oil separated from the acid; and there is
                    no doubt that the smoking of beef, hams, salmon, and herrings, makes them keep
                    longer than the mere drying, and the degree of previous salting, would lead us
                    to expect.</p>
                <p>Sugar has also the power of preserving vegetable substances from decay, but, on
                    account of its expense, it is only used for fine fruits and aromatic substances.
                    The preservation of these by means of sugar constitutes a principal part of the
                    art of confectionary, and attention to many minutiae is necessary for the
                    success of each preparation. The most general principles only can be noticed
                    here.</p>
                <p>Vegetable substances may be either preserved in syrup or candied; or their juices
                    may be employed in malting syrups, jellies, or fruit-cakes. The art of
                    confectionary is very difficult, and, to attain perfect success, requires
                    attention to many particulars, which at first seem frivolous and even improper,
                    but which have been found by experience to be essential. The clarification and
                    boiling of the sugar to its proper degree is of primary importance, and has not
                    perhaps been sufficiently examined by scientific men.</p>
                <p>A weak syrup has a tendency to ferment, and quickly becomes sour if kept in a
                    temperate degree of heat; it is therefore not calculated to prevent the natural
                    fermentation of vegetable juices, which always increase its tendency to corrupt.
                    Pharmaceutists have ascertained that a solution, prepared by dissolving two
                    parts of double-refined sugar in one of water, or any watery fluid, and boiling
                    the solution a little, forms a syrup, which neither ferments nor crystallizes;
                    and the proportion may be considered as the basis of all syrups, and seems to be
                    the degree of boiling syrup called smooth by the confectioners, as exemplified
                    in their <hi rend="italic">Syrops</hi><hi rend="italic">de Capillaire,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Orgeat,</hi> and others.</p>
                <p>Sugar is equally powerful in preserving animal substances from putrefaction. As a
                    novelty to modern artists, we translate from their great precursor, Caelius
                    Apicius, a method of preserving meat at any time without salt: “Let fresh meat
                    of any kind be covered with honey; but hang up the vessel, and use it when you
                    please. This succeeds better in winter; but will last a few days in summer. The
                    same may be done with meat that has been cooked.”</p>
                <p>Other methods of preserving food have been tried, but rather as a matter of
                    curiosity than utility.</p>
                <p>The property of charcoal to restore sweetness to flesh beginning to be tainted,
                    was first pointed out by Μ. Lowitz in Petersburg, in 1786,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>CreU⅛ <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annah.</hi></p></note> who made numerous experiments upon the subject. For
                    their success, it is necessary that the charcoal have been recently burnt, and
                    that it be applied in a certain quantity. Too little fails in its effect, and
                    too much affects the nature of the substance upon which it acts. By some it has
                    been supposed to act merely mechanically, by absorbing fluid and putrescent
                    exudations; but it is more probable that it acts chemically, by absorbing oxygen
                    gas from the air in contact with the meat. In the fourth volume of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal of Science</hi> (p. 367), there is an account of some
                    successful experiments, in which alternate layers of meat and charcosd were
                    packed in canisters, previously filled with carbonic gas, and then carefully
                    luted up and covered with bladder.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">de Pharmacie</hi> for
                    September 1818, Μ. Raymond, professor of chemistry at Lyons, has related some
                    experiments which he made upon the antiseptic properties of chlorine. Beef
                    exposed to the action of this gas for a few minutes underwent no change in the
                    course of six months, except becoming dry from the action of air and time. A
                    Guinea pig, suffocated in the same gas, and afterwards immersed for a few
                    minutes in water saturated <pb break="no" facs="nls:193754813"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-4813-0735"/>with chlorine, and then exposed to the air for
                    four months, without having its entrails removed, showed no sign of pu- ,
                    trefaction in four months. He also found that tainted meat recovered the smell
                    and appearance of fresh meat by being immersed in liquid chlorine.</p>
                <p>PREPARATION.</p>
                <p>Alimentary matters are used either in their crude or raw state, or after having
                    undergone some kind of preparation.</p>
                <p>Fruits and salads, although they admit of various forms of cookery, are most
                    frequently eaten in as fresh and natural a state as possible.</p>
                <p>Cookery is either necessary to destroy some deleterious property, or to render
                    food more palatable and nutritious. Of the former effect the most remarkable
                    example is furnished by various species of <hi rend="italic">arum,</hi> which in
                    their crude state are acrid, or even poisonous, but by being cooked become mild
                    and wholesome. The acrimony resides in a very volatile principle, which is
                    easily dissipated by heat. A more familiar example in this country is furnished
                    by the onion tribe, the acrimony and flavour of which are entirely destroyed by
                    being long subjected to the action of heat.</p>
                <p>numerous as the receipts are, the processes of cookery are but few. In some, the
                    chief object is to extract the fluid or soluble parts of the substance cooked;
                    in others, to alter the nature of the substance itself, and often to combine
                    both purposes. Fire is a principal agent in almost all the processes of cookery,
                    and the most economical mode of applying it has engaged the attention of many
                    philosophers and artists.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Convenience and economy are the objects proposed by all alleged improvements. The
                    nature of the fuel is of no little importance, and is different in different
                    countries. Pit coal has the advantage' of forming a lasting fire, and producing
                    an intense degree of heat, which renders it almost indispensable for roasting;
                    but its smoke is very detrimental, both by the unpleasant flavour it imparts,
                    and by the inconvenience arising from the flame, and from the soot deposited
                    upon the vessels and in the chimney. Wood and turf evolve less smoke, but their
                    flavour is more penetrating, and they give less heat, and are less durable. The
                    cleanest and most generally usefill fuel is charcoal of wood, or coke, neither
                    giving out any smoke, or imparting any flavour. Charcoal is more easily kindled,
                    but coke lasts longer, and gives out more heat. Well burnt cinders are an
                    excellent substitute for coke, which in every family ought to be carefully
                    preserved for the purposes of cookery.</p>
                <p>The heat, from whatever fuel produced, is applied in various ways to the
                    substances to be cooked, either directly or indirectly. Heat is applied
                    directly, as radiant heat in the process of roasting, in which the effects are
                    produced entirely by the rays of heat impinging directly upon substances placed
                    at a short distance before it. For this purpose a clear glowing fire is
                    necessary, and the bars of a good roasting grate should impede as little as
                    possible the radiation of its heat. Another very direct mode of applying heat,
                    is by placing the substance over the fire by suspending it in the stream of
                    heated air ascending from it, or laying it directly on the burning fuel, or on
                    bars, or a plate of iron, or other substance capable of supporting the heat.
                    Broiling is the result of this mode of applying heat. Heat is also often applied
                    through the intervention of fluids, chiefly of water or steam, as in boiling or
                    stewing; or of some oily substance, as in frying. The peculiarity of baking
                    consists in the substance being heated in a confined space, which does not
                    permit the escape of the fiιmes arising from it.</p>
                <p>To understand the theory of cookery, we must attend to the action of heat upon
                    the various constituents of alimentary substances, as applied directly and
                    indirectly through the medium of some fluid. In the former way, as exemplified
                    in the processes of roasting and broiling, the chief constituents of animal
                    substances undergo the following changes; the fibrine is corrugated, the albumen
                    coagulated, the gelatine and osmazome rendered more soluble in water, the fat
                    liquefied, and the water evaporated. If the heat exceed a certain degree, the
                    surface becomes first brown, and then scorched. In consequence of these changes,
                    the muscular fibre becomes opaque, shorter, firmer, and drier; the tendons less
                    opaque, softer, and gluey; the fat is either melted out, or rendered
                    semitransparent. Animal fluids become more transparent; the albumen is
                    coagulated and separated, and they dissolve gelatine and osmazome. Lastly, and
                    what is the most important change, and the immediate object of all cookery, the
                    meat loses the vapid nauseous smell and taste peculiar to its raw state, and it
                    becomes savoury and grateful. Heat applied through the intervention of boiling
                    oil or melted fat, as in frying, produces nearly the same changes, as the heat
                    is sufficient to evaporate the water, and to induce a degree of scorching. But
                    when water is the medium through which heat is applied, as in boiling, stewing,
                    and baking, the effects are somewhat different, as the heat never exceeds 212°,
                    which is not sufficient to commence the process of browning or decomposition,
                    and the soluble constituents are removed by being dissolved in the water,
                    forming soup or broth; or, if the direct contact of the water be prevented, they
                    are dissolved in the juices of the meat, and separate in the form of gravy.</p>
                <p>It is evident, that whether the heat be applied directly or indirectly, there
                    must be a considerable loss in the cooking of animal substances in public
                    institutions, where the allowance of meat is generally weighed out in its raw
                    state, and includes bones, and is served out cooked, and sometimes without bone;
                    and it is a matter of importance to ascertain nearly their relative proportions.
                    Much, no doubt, depends upon the piece of the meat cooked, and the degree of
                    cookery, and the attention bestowed upon it. We have been informed by persons
                    who salt rounds of beef to sell by retail after they are boiled, that they are
                    able to get 19 lb. of cold boiled beef from 25 lb. raw; but the meat, it must be
                    confessed, is always rather under-done. Messrs Donkin and Gamble boiled in steam
                    56 lb. of Captain’s salt beef; the meat, when cold, without the bones, which
                    amounted to 5 lb. 6 oz. weighed only 35 lb. In another experiment, 113 lb. of
                    prime mess beef gave 9 lb. 10 oz. of bones, and 47 lb. 8 oz. meat; and in a
                    third, 213 lb. mess beef gave 13 lb. 8 oz. bones, and 103 lb. 10 oz. meat; or,
                    taken in the aggregate, 372 lb. of salt beef, including bones, furnish, when
                    boiled, 186 lb. 2 oz. without bone, being about 50 per cent.; or, disregarding
                    the bone altogether, salt meat loses, by boiling, about 44∙2 per cwt. We are
                    indebted to Professor Wallace, of the University of Edinburgh, for the detail of
                    a very accurate and extensive experiment in a public establishment, of which the
                    results were, that, in pieces of ]0 lbs. weight, each 100 lbs. of beef lost, on
                    an average, by boiling, 26∙4; baking, 30∙2; and roasting, 32-2: mutton, the leg,
                    by boiling, 21-4; by roasting, the shoulder 31∙1, the neck 32∙4, the loin 35∙9.
                    Hence, generally speaking, mutton loses, by boiling, about one fifth of its
                    original weight, and beef about one fourth; again, mutton and beef lose, by
                    roasting, about one third of their original weight.</p>
                <p>The loss arises in roasting from the melting out of the fat and evaporating the
                    water, but the nutritious matters remain condensed in the cooked solid; but in
                    boiling, the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193754826" xml:id="kp-eb0709-4826-0736"
                    />loss arises partly from fat melted out, but chieflyfrom gelatine and osmazome
                    dissolved in the water in which the meat is , boiled; there is therefore a real
                    loss of nourishment unless the broth be used, when this mode of cooking becomes
                    the most economical.</p>
                <p>Vegetable substances are most commonly boiled or baked; or, if apparently fried
                    or roasted, there is always much water present, which prevents the greater
                    action of the fire from penetrating below the surface. The universal effect of
                    cookery upon vegetable substances, is to dissolve in the water some of their
                    constituents, such as the mucilage and starch, and to render those that are not
                    properly soluble, as the gluten and fibre, softer and more pulpy.</p>
                <p>We cannot pretend to enter into the details of the various processes, nor explain
                    the many precautions requisite to ensure success. For practical receipts we
