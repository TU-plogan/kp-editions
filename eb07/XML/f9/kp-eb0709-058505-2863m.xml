                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">FINCH, <hi rend="smallcaps">Heneage</hi></label>, first Earl
                    of Nottingham, and Lord High Chancellor of England, was the son of Sir Heneage
                    Finch, recorder of London, and born in December 1621. He received his education
                    at Westminster school, and at Christ Church College, Oxford, of which he was a
                    gentleman commoner; and he studied law in the Inner Temple, where, by his
                    talents and diligence, he became remarkable for great legal acquirements. On the
                    restoration of Charles II. he was made solicitor-general, and created a baronet.
                    He was also appointed reader of the Inner Temple, and chose as his subject the
                    statute of the 39th Elizabeth, concerning the payment and recovery of debts of
                    the crown, which he treated with great force of reason and depth of legal
                    erudition. As solicitor-general, he took an active part in the trials of the
                    regicides; and, in 1661, he was chosen member of parliament for the university
                    of Oxford, by the recommendation of Lord Clarendon; but, according to the author
                    of <hi rend="italic">Athence Oxonienses,</hi> he did his constituents no good,
                    when they wanted his assistance for taking off the tax upon hearths. In 1665,
                    after the prorogation of the parliament which then sat at Oxford, he was created
                    doctor of civil law in full convocation; but after the ceremony had terminated,
                    the public orator, being called upon to do his duty, stood up, and, in allusion
                    to the tax above mentioned, observed, “that the university wished they had more
                    colleges to entertain the parliament men, and more chambers, but by no means
                    more chimneys ;” an expression of academical opinion which, however undignified
                    in itself, startled the new-made doctor of laws, who changed colour, and seemed
                    by no means to relish the quaint remark of the orator. In 1667, i when Lord
                    Clarendon was impeached for certain alleged high crimes and misdemeanours, Sir
                    Heneage, mindful of his old friend, stoutly defended him against the charges
                    preferred by his enemies. In 1670 he was appointed attorney-general, and, some
                    years afterwards, lord keeper. He was then raised to the peerage by the style
                    and title °f Baron Finch of Daventry, in the county of Northampton; and, in
                    1675, appointed lord high chancellor of Eng-officiated as high steward at the
                    trial of Lord ōtanord, who, in the madness of that time, was found guilty of
                    high treason by his peers, on a charge of being concerned in the Popish plot. In
                    1681 he was created arl of Nottingham, and died, the following year, at his
                    ∣ouse in Queen Street, Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields, from the exhaustion produced by
                    long-continued exertion. Lord Nottingham was distinguished for both sagacity and
                    eloquence; and though he lived in times when it was difficult to pursue a steady
                    and consistent course, he conducted himself <hi rend="superscript"> in such
                    a</hi> manner as to retain the favour of the court without forfeiting the
                    approbation of the people. “He was a person,” says Mr Justice Blackstone, “of
                    the greatest abilities, and most incorrupted integrity; <hi rend="subscript">
                    a</hi> thorough master and zealous defender of the laws and constitution of his
                    country; and endued with a pervading genius that enabled him to discover and
                    pursue the true spirit of justice, notwithstanding the embarrassments raised by
                    the narrow and technical notions which then prevailed in the courts of law, and
                    the imperfect ideas of redress which had possessed the courts of equity. The
                    reason and necessities of mankind arising from the great change in property, by
                    the extension of trade, and the abolition of military tenures, co-operated in
                    establishing his plan, and enabled him, in the course of nine years, to build a
                    system of jurisprudence and jurisdiction upon wide and rational foundations,
                    which have also been extended and improved by many great men who have since
                    presided in Chancery; and from that time to this, the power and business of the
                    court have increased to an amazing degree.” In the name of the Earl of
                    Nottingham have been published, 1. Several Speeches and Discourses on the trials
                    of the Regicides; 2. Speeches delivered in both Houses of Parliament; 3. Speech
                    at the Sentence of William Viscount Stafford, 7th December 1680; 4. Answers to
                    his Majesty’s command upon several Addresses presented to his Majesty at Hampton
                    Court, 19th May 1681; 5. The Arguments upon which he made the Decree in the
                    cause between the Honourable Charles Howard, plaintiff, Henry Duke of Norfolk,
                    Henry Lord Mowbray his son, Henry Marquis of Dorchester, and Richard Marriot,
                    Esq. defendants, folio; 6. An Argument on the claim of the Crown to pardon on
                    Impeachment, folio. He also left in manuscript, <hi rend="italic">Chancery
