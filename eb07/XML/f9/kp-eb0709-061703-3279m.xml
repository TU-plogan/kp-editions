                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">FLECHIER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Esprit</hi></label>, bishop of
                    Nismes, one of the most cbrated preachers of his age, and author of a number of
                    works, was born at Pernes, a small town in the diocese of Carpentras, on the
                    10th of June 1632, and educated under the eye of his uncle, Father Audifret,
                    general of the congregation of Christian doctrine, a learned and estimable man.
                    According to the constitution of the congregation, Fléchier, having completed
                    his own education, was immediately employed in teaching. In 1659, when only
                    twenty-seven, he professed rhetoric at Narbonne, and there pronounced the neral
                    oration of Μ. de Rebé, archbishop of that city, which, however, is not to be
                    found in his collected works, probably because it was deemed unworthy of the
                    reputation which he subsequently acquired. A few months afterwards, on the death
                    of Audifret, followed as it was by some changes in the government of the
                    congregation, which he d not relish, Fléchier laid aside the habit of the <hi

                    where he was at first employed m the humble occupation of a parochial catechist;
                    but he soon made himself known by his Latin and French Γηθηϊ’π· P <hi

                    Regius,</hi> given by Louis XIV. in 16U2. This was the commencement of
                    Fléchier’s reputation. He was now entrusted with the education of Louis Urbain
                    Lefevre de Caumartin, afterwards intendant of finances and counsellor of state;
                    and as the house of Louis de Caumartin, the father of his pupil, was then
                    frequented by the most considerable personages both of the court and the city,
                    Fléchier was thus introduced into the first society, amongst which his talents,
                    amiability, gentleness of demeanour, and regularity of manners, soon procured
                    him many friends. The Duke of Montausier, who was not prodigal of his notice,
                    conceived a great regard for Fléchier, declared himself his patron, and having
                    presented him to the dauphin, procured him the place of reader to that young
                    prince. The sermons of Fléchier increased his reputation, which was afterwards
                    raised to the highest pitch by his funeral orations. Having been chosen to
                    pronounce that of Madame de Montausicr, he displayed so great talent on the
                    occasion that his discourse opened to him the doors of the French Academy, into
                    which he was received in 1673, in the room of Μ. Godeau, bishop of Venice. He
                    was admitted the same day with Racine, and having precedence in addressing the
                    Academy, his discourse was warmly applauded; the great poct however was less
                    fortunate than the orator, for his address being scarcely audible, was coldly
                    received and unfavourably judged of; so much is chance concerned even in the
                    success of eminent merit. The favours of the court now flowed upon Fléchier. The
                    king gave him successively the abbey of St Leverin, in the diocese of Poitiers,
                    the office of almoner to the dauphiness, and, in. 1685, the bishopric of Lavaur,
                    accompanying his kindness with the most flattering expressions of favour and
                    regard. “I have made you wait a little for a place which you have long merited,”
                    said the monarch; “but I did not wish to deprive myself sooner of the pleasure
                    of hearing you.” From the see of Lavaur Fléchier was, in 1687, translated to
                    that of Nismes, which was more valuable, and also accounted more honourable. His
                    own wish was to remain at Lavaur; but the king overcame his repugnance to the
                    proposed translation by making him sensible that he would be more useful to the
                    church at Nismes than at Lavaur, and that in the former place there was more
                    labour to be performed and more good to be done. In fact the Calvinists were
                    very numerous at Nismes; and although several had made abjuration, their
                    conversion was at best but equivocal. But Fléchier, by his prudent conduct, in
                    which zeal was tempered by charity, brought back the greater number of these
                    sectaries to the bosom of the church, and made himself esteemed and beloved even
                    by those who declined to abjure their faith. During the troubles in the Cevenncs
                    he softened, as much as in him lay, the rigour of the edicts, and showed himself
                    so sensible of the evils of persecution, and so indulgent even to what he
                    regarded as error, that his memory is, even at this day, held in veneration
                    amongst the Protestants of that district. In the famine which succeeded the
                    winter of 1709, he distributed immense sums, making no distinction between
                    Catholics and Protestants; all were his children, and all shared his beneficence
                    in proportion to their respective wants. He also published an eloquent pastoral
                    letter on the subject of a cross of St Gervais, which, it was pretended, worked
                    miracles, and warned his flock against those lying wonders, by which the
                    credulity of the people has frequently been abused. This appears to have been
                    amongst his last efforts in the cause of truth and religion. I he good bishop,
                    indeed, foresaw that his end was now approaching; and, having prepared for
                    himself a humble tomb, he died at <pb break="no" facs="nls:193753292"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-3292-0618"/>Montpellier on the 16th February 1710, at the
                    advanced age of seventy-eight. “He died,” says D’Alembert, “lamented by the
                    Catholics, regretted by the Protestants, and having always exhibited to his
                    brethren an admirable model of zeal and charity, simplicity and eloquence.”

                    Nismes, 1782, in 10 vols. 8vo. If we except the History of Theodosius, pulpit
                    eloquence is the only branch of the belles-lettres cultivated by Fléchier in
                    which he excelled. His Funeral Orations have been compared with those of
                    Bossuet, without attending to this distinction, that comparisons become useless
                    between two kinds of genius which are totally different. That of Bossuet was
                    sublime throughout. Fléchier, on the other hand, was only remarkable for the
                    nobleness of his thoughts and the harmony of his diction. It is true that he
                    possessed in an eminent degree these two qualities of an orator, and that nobody
                    has carried the latter further than he; but even in that department where he has
                    been most successful, Fléchier is not without faults, and may be reproached with
                    an ambition of giving point to his thoughts, an affectation of symmetry in the
                    style, and a love of antitheses, all at variance with the principles of good
                    taste. But if his funeral orations and sermons lose much of their merit by a too
                    measured elegance, his pastoral instructions and synodal discourses are wholly
                    free from such affectation, indeed as remarkable for simplicity of style as for
                    generosity of sentiment, and that indulgent spirit which laments whilst it
                    combats error, and which, repudiating all attempts at persecution, seeks to win
                    men over to the right way, not by the instrumentality of fear, but through the
                    medium of their understanding and affections. “C’est dans ces ouvrages,” says a
                    distinguished French critic, “que la philosophie elle-même apprendra l’usage
                    qu’on doit faire des lumières et du sentiment, et se convaincra que Thumanité
                    n’a pas de consolation plus solide que la religion, comme la politique n’a pas
                    de meilleur appui.” <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
