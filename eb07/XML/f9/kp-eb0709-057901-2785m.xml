                    silver, wrought delicately in the manner of little threads or grains, or both
                    intermixed. The word is compounded of <hi rend="italic">fil οrjilum,</hi> a
                    thread, and <hi rend="italic">granum,</hi> a grain, and in Latin is called <hi

                <p>There is no manufacture in any part of the world which has been more admired and
                    celebrated than the fine gold and silver fillagree of Sumatra; and what renders
                    it a matter of still greater curiosity, is the coarseness of the tools employed
                    in the workmanship, and which, in the hands of an European, would not be thought
                    sufficiently perfect for the most ordinary purposes. They are rudely and
                    inartificially formed by the goldsmith, from any piece of old iron which he can
                    pick up. When one of them is engaged to execute a piece of work, his first
                    request is usually for a piece of iron hoop to make his wire-drawing instrument;
                    an old hammer head, stuck in a block, serves him for an anvil; and his pair of
                    compasses is often composed of two old nails tied together at one end. The gold
                    is melted in a piece of <hi rend="italic">ρreeoo</hi> or earthen rice-pot, or
                    sometimes in a crucible of ordinary clay. In general no bellows are used, but
                    the fire is blown with the mouth, through a joint of bamboo; and if the quantity
                    of metal to be melted is considerable, three or four persons sit round the
                    furnace, which is an old broken quallee or iron pot, and blow together. At
                    Padang alone, where the manufacture is most considerable, they have adopted the
                    Chinese bellows. The method of drawing the wire differs but little from that
                    which is used by European workmen. When drawn to a sufficient fineness, it is
                    flattened by beating it on the anvil; and when flattened, a twist is given to it
                    like that in the whalebone handle of a punch ladle, by rubbing it on a block of
                    wood with a flat stick. After twisting they again beat it upon the anvil, and
                    thus it becomes flattened wire with indented edges. The end of the wire is
                    folded down with a pair of pincers, and thus is formed a leaf, or element of a
                    flower in their work, which is cut off. The end is again folded and cut off,
                    till they have <hi rend="italic">got</hi> a sufficient number of leaves, yhich
                    are laid on singly. Patterns of the flowers or foliage, <hi rend="superscript">
                    ιn</hi> which there is seldom much variety, are prepared on paper of the size of
                    the gold plate on which the fillagree is to be laid. According to these, they
                    begin to dispose on the plate the larger compartments of the foliage, for which
                    they use plain flattened wire of a larger size, and fill it up with the leaves
                    before mentioned. In order to fix the work, they employ a gelatinous substance,
                    made of the red-hot berry called <hi rend="italic">boca sago,</hi> ground to a
                    pulp on a rough stone, which pulp they place on a young cocoa nut about the size
                    oτ a walnut, the top and bottom being cut off. After the leaves have been all
                    placed in order, and stuck on bit by bit, a solder is prepared of gold filings
                    and borax moistened with water, which is strewed over the plate, when it is put
                    in the fire for a short time, and the whole becomes united. This kind of work on
                    a gold plate is called <hi rend="italic">carrang</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >papan;</hi> but when the work is open, it is called <hi rend="italic">carrang
                    trouse.</hi> In executing the latter, the foliage is laid out upon a card, or
                    soft kind of wood, and stuck on, as before described, with the sago berry; and
                    the work, when finished, being strewed over with the solder, is put into the
                    fire, when the card or soft wood burning away, the gold remains connected. If
                    the piece be large it is soldered at several times. In the manufacture of badjoo
                    buttons, they first make the lower part flat, and having a mould formed of a
                    piece of buffalo’s horn, indented to several sizes, each like one half of a
                    bullet mould, they lay their work over one of these holes, and with a horn punch
                    press it into the form of a button; after which they complete the upper part.
                    When the fillagree is finished they cleanse it by boiling it in water with
                    common salt and alum, or sometimes lime juice; and in order to give it that fine
                    purple colour which they call <hi rend="italic">sapo,</hi> they boil it in water
                    mixed with brimstone. The manner of making the little balls with which their
                    works are sometimes ornamented, is simple. They take a piece of charcoal, and
                    having cut it flat and smooth, make in it a small hole, which they fill with
                    gold dust, and this being melted in the fire, becomes a little ball. They are
                    very inexpert at finishing and polishing the plain parts, hinges, screws, and
                    the like, being in this as much excelled by the European artists as the latter
                    fall short of them in the fineness and minuteness of the foliage. The Chinese
                    also make fillagree mostly of silver, which looks elegant, but wants the
                    extraordinary delicacy of the Malay work. The price of the workmanship depends
                    upon the difficulty or uncommonness of the pattern. In some articles of usual
                    demand it does not exceed one third of the value of the gold, but in matters of
                    fancy it is generally equal to that of the metal.</p>
