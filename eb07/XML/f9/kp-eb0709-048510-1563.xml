                <p><label type="entry">FANSHAWE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Richard</hi></label>, a
                    distinguished cavalier in the heroic age of the civil wars and the protectorate,
                    was the youngest son of Sir Henry Fanshawe, brother of Lord Viscount Fanshawe of
                    Dromore in Ireland, and born at Ware-park, Hertfordshire, in June 1608. He had
                    only attained his seventh year at the time of his father’s death", when the care
                    of his education devolved on his mother, who placed him under the celebrated
                    schoolmaster Thomas Farnaby, and, in due time, sent him to Cambridge, where he
                    was admitted as a fellow-commoner of Jesus College in November 1623. Having
                    prosecuted his studies with success, and, in particular, discovered a taste for
                    classical learning, he was, in January 1626, removed to the Inner Temple; but at
                    his mother’s death, which happened soon afterwards, he resolved to pursue a line
                    of life more congenial to his inclination, and, with this view, he visited
                    France and Spain, where, in the course of his travels, he acquired the languages
                    and studied the manners and institutions of those countries. On his return to
                    England he was appointed secretary of legation to the embassy at Madrid, whither
                    he immediately repaired, and was left as charge d’affaires at the Spanish court
                    from the time of Lord Aston’s resignation till the appointment of Sir Arthur
                    Hopton as his successor in 1638.</p>
                <p>On the breaking out of the civil war, Fanshawe, being then in England, declared
                    at once for the king, and was entrusted with several important employments. In
                    1644, whilst attending the court at Oxford, he was made secretary to the Prince
                    of Wales, whom he accompanied in his expedition to the western parts of England,
                    and thence to the islands of Scilly and Jersey. In 1648, he was appointed
                    treasurer of the navy under Prince Rupert, an office which he held till 1650,
                    when he was created a baronet, and sent to Madrid to represent the necessitous
                    condition of the king his master, and to implore assistance from Philip IV.
                    Recalled to Scotland, where Charles II. had now made his appearance, he served
                    there in the capacity of secretary of state, but without taking either the
                    covenant or the engagement; and being recommended by the king to the York party,
                    he was received with great kindness by the latter, and entrusted with the broad
                    seal and signet. In 1651, Sir Richard was taken prisoner at the battle of
                    Worcester, conveyed thence to London, and there committed to close custody; but
                    having contracted a dangerous illness, he was liberated on giving bail to the
                    amount of four thousand pounds, chiefly, as would appear, through the
                    intercession and influence of Cromwell. In 1654, we find him at Tankerley-park,
                    which he had hired of his friend Lord Strafford, to whom he dedicated his
                    translation of the <hi rend="italic">Lusiad</hi> of Camaens, written during his
                    residence there. Early in 1659, he obtained the discharge of his bail, on
                    pretence of going abroad with the eldest son of the Earl of Pembroke, and
                    immediately repaired to Breda, where Charles II. received him with open arms,
                    knighted him, and appointed him master of requests and Latin secretary.</p>
                <p>On the restoration, Sir Richard expected, from a promise which had been formerly
                    made to him, to be appointed secretary of state; but, through the paramount
                    influence of Monk, Duke of Albemarle, the office was conferred on a creature of
                    his own, Sir William Morrice. “1he king, says Lady Fanshawe, in her <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> promised Sir Richard<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193751576" xml:id="kp-eb0709-1576-0486"/> that he should be
                    one of the secretaries of state, in the event of his restoration, and both the
                    Duke of Ormond and Lord Chancellor Clarendon were witnesses to it; but that
                    false man (Monk) made the king break his word for his own accommodation, and
                    placed Mr Morrice, a poor country gentleman of about L.200 a year, a fierce
                    presbyterian, and one who never saw the king’s face; but still promises were
                    made of the reversion to Sir Richard.” In the parliament which met on the 8th
                    May 1661, he took his seat as one of the representatives of the university of
                    Cambridge, and was soon afterwards sworn a privy counsellor for Ireland. He was
                    then sent as envoy extraordinary to Portugal; and being shortly afterwards
                    appointed ambassador to the court of that country, he negotiated the treaty of
                    marriage between Charles II. and the Infanta Donna Catharina, daughter of John
                    VI. and returned to England towards the close of the year. In 1662 he was again
                    sent as ambassador to the court of Lisbon, and, on his return to England the
                    following year, was sworn a member of the privy council. Being considered by the
                    king of Portugal as the fittest person to bring about an accommodation between
                    that country and Spain, Sir Richard was, in the beginning of 1664, sent as
                    ambassador to the court of Philip IV. by whom he was received with the most
                    flattering marks of distinction, under the impression, as appears, that he was
                    authorized, on the part of England, to give up Tangier and Jamaica to Spain. The
                    Spaniards, however, finding themselves disappointed in this expectation, altered
                    their tone; and cordiality having given place to coldness and distrust, the
                    ambassador found himself exposed to frequent mortifications, and involved in the
                    greatest perplexities. At the earnest desire of Spain he had made a journey to
                    Lisbon, for the purpose of endeavouring to bring about an accommodation with
                    Portugal, but returned without effecting any thing. At length, however, when the
                    life of Philip IV. appeared to be drawing towards a close, a project of a
                    treaty, containing greater commercial advantages, and insisting on fewer
                    inconvenient conditions, than any that had formerly been proposed, was suddenly
                    submitted to him, accompanied with an urgent demand of immediate acceptance or
                    rejection, on account of the king’s illness, which, it was alleged, might be
                    followed by an entire change in the Spanish councils. In this emergency, the
                    ambassador, after comparing the project with his instructions, and suggesting
                    certain additions and modifications, which were agreed to, consented to sign the
                    treaty, to which was annexed a secret article respecting Portugal, and
                    immediately transmitted it to England. But objections having been taken to it in
                    council, chiefly on the ground that the ambassador had exceeded his powers, the
                    king was advised to withhold his ratification, and Sir Richard was in
                    consequence recalled. But whilst he was preparing to return home, he was, on the
                    4th of June 1666, seized with a violent fever, which put an end to his life, at
                    Madrid, on the 16th of the same month, the very day on which he had intended to
                    take his departure for England.</p>
                <p>Sir Richard Fanshawe was married in Wolvercot church, near Oxford, on the 18th
                    May 1644, to a daughter of Sir John Harrison, by whom he had six sons and eight
                    daughters, of whom only one son and four daughters survived him. Lady Fanshawe
                    was related to her husband, inasmuch as her mother was daughter to Robert
                    Fanshawe, Esq. of Fanshawe-gate, grand-uncle to Sir Richard. She is also the
                    author of <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> which she composed for the use of her
                    only surviving son, and which, besides many traits of natural feeling and noble
                    sentiment, contain a very interesting account of the losses and sufferings of
                    the Fanshawe family in the royal cause, and more particularly of the proceedings
                    of her husband, Sir Richard, to whom she seems to have been most affectionately
                    attached, and of whom, from the time of their marriage, she was the constant
                    companion, amidst all the difficulties and perils of those troubled times. For a
                    very judicious and discriminating notice of these <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>
                    the reader is referred to the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> (vol. 1.
                    p. 75.)</p>
                <p>Although much of Sir Richard Fanshawe’s life was spent in active employment, he
                    found leisure to produce the following works: 1. An English translation, in
                    verse, of Guarini’s <hi rend="italic">Pasto Fido,</hi> 1646, in 4to; 2. A
                    translation from English into Latin verse of Fletcher’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Faithful Shepherdess,</hi> 1658; 3. An Ode on the king’s proclamation in 1630,
                    an English translation of the fourth book of the Aeneid, Odes of Horace
                    translated into English, and a Discourse of the Civil Wars of Rome, inserted in
                    the octavo edition of the <hi rend="italic">Faithful Shepherdess</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> 4. A translation of the <hi rend="italic">Lusiad</hi> of
                    Camaens, 1655, in folio; 5. Two pieces, entitled, <hi rend="italic"

                    published after his decease, 1671, in 4to, and <hi rend="italic">Fiestas de
