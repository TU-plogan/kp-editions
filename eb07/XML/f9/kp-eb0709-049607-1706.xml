                <p><label type="entry">FEAST, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Festival</hi></label>, in a
                    religious sense, is the ceremony of feasting and thanksgiving. The word is
                    formed from the Latin <hi rend="italic">festum,</hi> which some derive <hi
                    rend="italic">a feriari,</hi> to keep holiday; others, however, derive it from
                    the Greek <hi rend="italic">⅛τια,(n, I feast</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >entertain,</hi> from i&lt;rna, <hi rend="italic">hearth,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">fire.</hi> Feasts and the ceremonies connected with them have
                    formed great part of the religion of almost all nations and sects; of the
                    Greeks, Romans, Hebrews, Christians, and Mahommedans.</p>
                <p>The first feasts amongst the Greeks were celebrated in solemn assemblies of the
                    whole nation, on occasion of their games, as the Olympian, the Pythian, the
                    Isthmian, and Nemaean; but in process of time they had many others the principal
                    of which are enumerated in the course of this work.</p>
                <p>The Romans also had abundance of stated feasts in honour of their deities and
                    heroes; as the Saturnalia, Cerealia, Lupercalia, Liberalia, Neptunalia,
                    Consualia, Portumnalia, Vulcanalia, Palilia, Divalia, and others. They had also
                    feasts instituted occasionally, as Carmentalia, Quirinalia, Terminalia,
                    Floralia, Compitalia, Lemuria, Vernalia; besides other moveable and occasional
                    ones, to give thanks to the gods for benefits received; to implore their
                    assistance, or to appease their wrath, as the Paganalia, Feralia, Bacchanalia,
                    Ambarvalia, Amburbalia, Suovetaurilia, and various others, denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">feriae</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> as Sementinae, Latinae,
                    &amp;c. The feasts were divided into days of sacrifice, and days of banqueting
                    and feasting; days of games, and days of rest or <hi rend="italic">feriae.</hi>
                    As there was but little history written, or at least published, in those days,
                    one end of these feasts was to preserve the remembrance of past occurrences.</p>
                <p>The principal festivals of the Jews were the feast of trumpets, that of the
                    expiation, that of tabernacles, that of the dedication, that of the passover,
                    that of pentecost, and that of purification. The modern Jews have other feasts
                    marked in their kalendar, but these are of modern institution. The Mahommedans,
                    besides their weekly feast or Sabbath, which is observed on Friday, have two
                    solemn feasts, the first of which is called the Feast of Victims, and celebrated
                    on the tenth day of the last month of their year; and the second is called
                    Bairam. The Chinese have two solemn annual feasts, in the memory of Confucius,
                    besides others of less note on various days of the year.</p>
                <p>Festivals amongst us are either <hi rend="italic">immoveable</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">rnονeable. Immoveable feasts</hi> are those constantly celebrated
                    on the same day of the year. The principal of these are Christmas day or the
                    Nativity, the Circumcision, Epiphany, Candlemas or the Purification, Lady Day or
                    the Annunciation, called also the Incarnation and Conception, All Saints, and
                    All Souls; besides the days of the several apostles, which with us are feasts,
                    though not <hi rend="italic">feriae. Moveable feasts</hi> are those which are
                    not confined to the same day of the year. Of these, the principal is Easter,
                    which gives the law to the rest, all of them following and keeping their proper
                    distances from it; as Palm Sunday, Good Friday, Ash-Wednesday, Sexagesima,
                    Ascension-Day, Pentecost, and Trinity-Sunday. The four feasts which the English
                    laws take special notice of are, the Annunciation of the blessed Virgin Mary, or
                    Lady Day, the 25th of March; the nativity of St John the Baptist, on the 24th of
                    June; the Feast of St Michael the Archangel, on the 29th of September; and that
                    of St Thomas the Apostle, on the 21st of December.</p>
                <p>Besides these feasts, which are <hi rend="italic">general,</hi> and enjoined by
                    the church, there are others <hi rend="italic">local</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >occasionaD</hi> enjoined by the magistrate, or voluntarily observed by the
                    people, as days of thanksgiving for delivery from wars, plague», and other
                    evils; and also the vigils or wakes in commemoration of the dedication of
                    particular churches.</p>
                <p>The prodigious increase of festival days in the Christian church commenced
                    towards the close of the fourth century, and was occasioned by the discovery
                    which was tnθ <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> made of the remains of martyrs and
                    other holy men, or the commemoration of whom they were established. B¶ instead
                    of being set apart for pious exercises, these festiva s were abused in
                    indolence, voluptuousness, and criminal prac <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751719"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-1719-0497"/>tices. Many of them were instituted on’ a Pagan
                    model, and perverted to the most scandalous purposes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Feast</hi> is also used to signify a banquet or sumptuous
                    entertainment, without any immediate view to religion.</p>
                <p>The use of the word, in this sense, arises from the circumstance that part of the
                    ceremony in many of the ancient festivals, both those of the heathens and of the
                    Christians, was good eating; though Huet chooses to derive the word from <hi
                    rend="italic">festinare,</hi> which, in an ancient Latin version of Origen’s
                    Commentary on Matthew, signifies to feast: <hi rend="italic">Ui</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">veniens illuc</hi><hi rend="italic">Jesus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >festinct, cum discipulis</hi><hi rend="italic">suis.</hi></p>
                <p>Social or civil feasts were also expressed by the words <hi rend="italic"
                    >convivium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">compotatio</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >concarnatio.</hi> Cicero says that, in the Roman language, the word <hi
                    rend="italic">convivium,</hi> which means people assembled at table, is more
                    significant of refinement than the Greek word <hi rend="italic">compotatio</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">concoenatio.</hi> The Roman term, says he, expresses the
                    conjunction of body and mind which ought to take place at an entertainment; the
                    Greek merely denotes what relates to the body alone.</p>
                <p>As food is necessary to our existence, eating together forms a bond of
                    association among mankind. People at a feast, says one of the ancients, seem to
                    form but one body and one soul. All nations, whether savage or civilized, have
                    regarded the pleasures of the table as the occasion of the most agreeable
                    society. This species of enjoyment, abstracting from its susceptibility of
                    abuse, makes but one family of all whom it brings together. It levels the
                    distinctions introduced by policy or prejudice, and disposes men to regard one
                    another as brethren. It is here that people feel the equality established by
                    nature, forget the evils of life, extinguish their hatred, and cause their
                    enmities to cease. For this reason Aristotle considers as a breach of die social
                    principle the custom of eating apart which obtained amongst the ancient
                    Egyptians, and praises the convivial repasts established by Minos and
                    Lycurgus.</p>
                <p>The Persians generally deliberated on business at table, but never determined or
                    put their determinations in execution, except in the morning before having
                    eaten.</p>
                <p>When the Germans, says Tacitus, wanted to reconcile enemies, to form alliances,
                    to appoint chiefs, or to treat of war and peace, it was during the repast that
                    they took counsel; a time in which the mind is most open to the impressions of
                    simple truth, or most easily animated to great attempts. These artless people
                    during the conviviality of the feast spoke without disguise, and next day
                    weighed the counsels of the former evening; they deliberated at a time when they
                    were not disposed to deceive, and took their resolution when they were least
                    liable to be deceived.</p>
                <p>By a fundamental law of the state, people of rank amongst the Rhodians were
                    obliged to dine daily with those who ∣ad the management of affairs, in order to
                    deliberate with them concerning such things as were necessary or useful for the
                    country; and on this account the principal ministers of the kingdom were obliged
                    to keep open table for all who could be of service to the state.</p>
                <p>Amongst the Romans, the place where they supped was generally the vestibule, lest
                    a more retired part of the house should encourage licentiousness and disorder.
                    There were several laws which restricted their meals to the vestibules. But when
                    luxury reigned at Rome, the wealthy had superb halls for their entertainments.
                    Lucullus had many, each of which bore the name of some deity; and this was a
                    mark which indicated to the servants the expense of the entertainment. The
                    expense of a supper in Lucullus’s hall of Apollo amounted to fifty thousand
                    drachmas. The all i∏ which Nero feasted imitated the revolutions of the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> e</hi> avens, by the circular motion of its walls and its
                    ceiling; . represented the different seasons of the year, changing at every
                    course, and showering down flowers and perfumes on the guests.</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> +</hi> uP <hi rend="superscript"> ie r</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> "≡ <hi rend="superscript"
                    > s</hi> did not, like us, confine themselves to one table at their feasts; they
                    had generally two; one for the service of animal food, which was afterwards
                    removed; and another for the dessert, at which last they sung, and poured out
                    their libations. The Greeks and eastern nations observed the same custom, and
                    even the Jews in their solemn feasts and at sacrifices.</p>
                <p>The Romans, in the time of Nero, had tables made of citron wood brought from
                    Mauritania, which were covered with purple and gold, and raised on feet of
                    carved ivory. It is said that these tables were more precious than gold itself.
                    Dion Cassius affirms that Seneca had five hundred of these, which he made use of
                    one after another; and Tertullian informs us that Cicero had only one. The
                    Romans usually chose the king of the feast, or chairman as we would call him, by
                    a cast of the dice.</p>
                <p>We learn from Herodotus that the ancients had neither cups nor bowls, but drank
                    out of little horns tipped with silver or gold. <hi rend="superscript">
                    l</hi></p>
                <p>The Greeks and Romans kept a domestic for the purpose of reading during their
                    meals and feasts. The head of the family sometimes performed the office of
                    reader himself; and we learn that the Emperor Severus often read whilst his
                    family sat or rather reclined at table. The time of reading was generally at
                    supper; and guests were invited to a reading, as they arc now a-days to play
                    cards. In their flourishing times the Greeks did not, according to their own
                    expression, profane the sanctity of the table, but rather adorned it with
                    ingenious and elegant conversation, proposing moral topics, of which Plutarch
                    has preserved a collection. Ancient philosophers have remarked, that heroes
                    rarely assembled convivially without bringing affairs of consequence into
                    discussion, or deliberating upon those which regarded either present affairs or
                    future contingencies.</p>
                <p>When Rome became corrupted with luxury, singers, dancers, musicians,
                    stage-players, and people who told pleasant tales, were brought into the hall to
                    amuse the guests. Plutarch informs us that Caesar, after his triumphs, treated
                    the Roman people at twenty-two thousand tables; and by calculation it would seem
                    that there must have been at these tables upwards of two hundred thousand
                    persons.</p>
                <p>It was a custom among the Romans, at the end of a feast, to drink out of a large
                    cup as often as there were letters in the names of their mistresses.</p>
                <p>Feasting seems to have been the chief delight of the Germans, Gauls, Britons, and
                    all the other Celtic nations; and in this they indulged themselves to the
                    utmost, as often as they had an opportunity. “Amongst these nations,” says an
                    author who had carefully studied their manners, “there is no public assembly,
                    either for civil or religious purposes, duly held; no birth-day, marriage, or
                    funeral, properly celebrated; no treaty of peace or alliance rightly cemented,
                    without a great feast.” It was by frequent entertainments of this kind that the
                    great men or chieftains gained the affections and rewarded the services of their
                    followers; and those who made the greatest feasts were sure to be most popular,
                    and to have the largest retinue. These feasts, in which plenty was more regarded
                    than elegance, commonly lasted several days, and the guests seldom retired until
                    they had consumed the provisions and exhausted the liquors provided for the
                    occasion. Athenaeus describes an entertainment given by Arcamnes, a wealthy
                    prince of Gaul, which continued a whole year without interruption, and at which
                    all the people of Gaul, and even all strangers who passed through that country,
                    were made welcome. At these feasts they sometimes consulted about the most
                    important affairs of state, and formed resolutions relating to peace and war;
                    imagining that men spoke their real sentiments with the greatest freedom, and
                    were apt to form the boldest designs, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751732"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-1732-0498"/>when their spirits were exhilarated with the
                    pleasures of the table. The conversation at these entertainments frequently
                    turned on the great exploits which the guests themselves or their ancestors had
                    performed in war; a circumstance which sometimes occasioned quarrels, and even
                    bloodshed.</p>
                <p>As to the drink used at these feasts, particularly in Britain, it seems probable
                    that before the introduction of agriculture into the island, mead, or honey
                    diluted with water, was the only strong liquor known to its inhabitants, as it
                    was to many other ancient nations. And this continued to be a favourite beverage
                    amongst the ancient Britons and their posterity long after they had become
                    acquainted with other liquors. The mead-maker was the eleventh person in dignity
                    in the courts of the ancient princes of Wales, and took place next to the
                    physician. An ancient law of that principality shows how much this liquor was
                    esteemed by the British princes. “There are three things in the court which must
                    be communicated to the king before they are made known to any other person:
                    first, every sentence of the judge; second, every new song; and, third, every
                    cask of mead.” This was perhaps the liquor which is called by Ossian the joy and
                    strength of shells, with which his heroes were so much delighted. After the
                    introduction of agriculture, ale or beer became the most general drink of all
                    the British nations who practised that art, as -it had long been of all the
                    Celtic nations on the Continent. If the Phoenicians or Greeks imported any wine
                    into Britain, it was only in small quantities; and that generous liquor was but
                    little known in this island until after it had been conquered by the Romans.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Charles V. of France, the custom of placing the lights upon the
                    table had not yet been introduced. A number of domestics held the lights in
                    their hands during the whole time of the repast.</p>
