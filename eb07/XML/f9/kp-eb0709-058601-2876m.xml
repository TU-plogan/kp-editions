                <p><label type="entry">FINISTERRE</label>, a maritime department of France. It is
                    bounded by the sea on three sides, and on the east by the departments of the
                    Côte du Nord and of Morbihan. It is in the shape of a triangle, and extends over
                    2890 square miles, or, according to the Almanac-Royal, 693,384 hectares, of
                    which 252,704 are under the plough, 106,281 are in fallow, 23,389 are pasturel
                    and, 148,364 are woods, 35,868 are waste, 56,414 are covered with lakes and
                    estuaries, 22,267 are the beds of rivers and harbours, and the remainder roads,
                    and the sites of cities, towns, and villages. The surface is very unequal,
                    consisting of chains of hills running through the peninsula, some reaching the
                    height of 1000 feet, with valleys between them of various extent.</p>
                <p>The civil divisions are into five arrondissements, forty-three cantons, and 287
                    communes, inhabited by 452,450 persons. The inhabitants are a distinct race from
                    the French, and mostly speak the old language of the Brey-zards, the name by
                    which they are distinguished. They are obstinate in their adherence to old and
                    antipathy to new customs. Their clothing is little altered in the last thousand
                    years, which in form and colour varies in each place, thus showing the dwelling
                    of each person. There are whole communes in which no individuals are to be found
                    who can read or write. They live either in scattered houses or small hamlets,
                    and more than 25,000 houses are so wretched in appearance when seen, that they
                    resemble the huts of savages. They are mostly hidden behind hedges and banks,
                    and only visible by the smoke which issues from the doors, for they have neither
                    chimneys nor windows. The cattle and the families live together in a state of
                    disgusting filth. The females, who are commonly very ugly, are oppressed by
                    their labour, and so contemptuously treated that they are not even suffered to
                    eat with the men.</p>
                <p>With all this they are said to be hospitable, upright, brave, and patriotic, and
                    content with their barley bread, milk, and (but of late years) potatoes. The
                    agriculture is in a backward state, and produces less corn than is required for
                    the consumption; and since the population has increased, severe scarcity would
                    be annually felt but for the introduction of potatoes, which are now extensively
                    cultivated. The sheep, cows, and especially the horses, are diminutive; but the
                    swine are fine and numerous.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of the towns in general are more like the other parts of the
                    French nation. Those on the coast pursue the fisheries with success, especially
                    that for sardinias. The only mines are those of lead, in which silver is found
                    mixed with that metal. In two mines, at Poul-lalouen and Huelgoet, 900 workmen
                    are employed, who raise yearly 600 tons of lead, and from it extract 26,000
                    ounces of silver.</p>
                <p>In some parts, especially at Morlaix, there are some manufactories of linen,
                    sail-cloth, twine, cordage, and paper. At that port also the surplus productions
                    of the soil are exported to other portions of the kingdom, as well as to foreign
                    parts.</p>
