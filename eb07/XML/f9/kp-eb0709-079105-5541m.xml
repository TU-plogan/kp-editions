                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    Casting in Sand.</hi> The sand commonly used for casting small works is at first
                    of a pretty soft, yellowish, and clammy nature; but it being necessary to strew
                    charcoal dust in the mould, it at length becomes of a quite black colour. The
                    sand is worked over and over, on a board, with a roller and a sort of knife; and
                    is placed over a trough to receive it, after it has by these means been
                    sufficiently prepared.</p>
                <p>This being done, the workmen take a wooden board of a length and breadth
                    proportional to the things to be cast, and putting a ledge round it, they fill
                    it with sand a little moistened, to make it duly cohere. They then take either
                    wood or metal models of what they intend to cast, and apply them to the mould,
                    and press them into the sand so as to leave their impression there. Along the
                    middle of the mould is laid half a small brass cylinder, as the chief canal for
                    the metal to run through, when melted, into the models or patterns; and from
                    this chief canal are placed several others, which extend collaterally to each
                    model or pattern placed in the frame. After this frame is finished, they take
                    out the patterns, by first loosening them all round, that the sand may not give
                    way; then they proceed to work the other half of the mould with the same
                    patterns in just such another frame, only that it has pins, which, entering into
                    holes corresponding to it in the other, make the two cavities of the pattern
                    fall exactly on each other.</p>
                <p>The frame, thus moulded, is carried to the melter, who, after extending the chief
                    canal of the counterpart, and adding the cross canals to the several models in
                    both, and strewing mill dust over them, dries them in a kind of oven prepared
                    for the purpose. Both parts of the mould being dry, they are joined together by
                    means of the pins; and to prevent them giving way, by reason of the melted metal
                    passing through the chief cylindrical canal, they are screwed or wedged up like
                    a kind of press.</p>
                <p>Whilst the moulds are thus preparing, the metal is fusing in a crucible of a size
                    proportional to the quantity of metal intended to be cast. When the moulds have
                    cooled, the frames are unscrewed or unweuged, and the cast work taken out of the
                    sand, which sand is worked over again for other casting.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Foundery</hi><hi rend="italic">of Statues.</hi> The
                    casting of statues depends on the due preparation of the pit, the core, the wax,
                    the outer mould, the inferior furnace to melt off the wax, and the upper to fuse
                    the metal.</p>
                <p>The pit is a hole dug in a dry place, something deeper than the intended figure,
                    and made according to the prominence of certain parts of it. The inside of the
                    pit is commonly lined with stone or brick; but when the figure is very large,
                    they sometimes work on the ground, and raise a proper fence to resist the
                    impulsion of the melted metal. The inner mould, or core, is a rude mass, to
                    which is given the intended attitude and contours. It is raised on an iron
                    grating strong enough to sustain it, and is strengthened within by several bars
                    of iron. It is generally made either of potters' clay mixed with hair and horse
                    dung, or of plaster of Paris mixed with brick dust. The use of the core is to
                    support the wax and the shell, and lessen the weight of the metal. The iron bars
                    and the core are taken out of the brass figure through an aperture left in it
                    for that purpose, which is soldered up afterwards. It is necessary to leave some
                    of the iron bars of the core, which contribute to the steadiness of the
                    projecting part, within the brass figure. The wax is a representation of the
                    intended statue. If it be a piece of sculpture, the wax should be all from the
                    hand of the sculptor himself, who usually forms it on the core; though it may be
                    wrought separately in cavities, moulded on a model, and afterwards arranged on
                    the ribs of iron over the grating, filling the vacant space in the middle with
                    liquid plaster and brick dust, by which means the inner core is proportioned as
                    the sculptor carries on the wax. When the wax, which is of the intended
                    thickness of the meta), is finished, small waxen tubes perpendicular to it from
                    top to bottom are filled, to serve both as canals for the conveyance of the
                    metal to all parts of the work, and as vent-holes to give passage to the air,
                    which would otherwise occasion great disorder when the hot metal came to
                    encompass it.</p>
                <p>The work being brought thus far, must be covered with its shell, which is a kind
                    of crust laid over the wax, and which being of a soft matter, easily receives
                    the impression of every part, which is afterwards communicated to the metal upon
                    its taking the place of the wax, between the shell and the mould. The matter of
                    this outer mould is varied according as different layers are applied. The first
                    is generally a composition of clay, and old white crucibles well ground and
                    sifted, and mixed up with water to the consistence of a colour fit for painting;
                    and it is applied with a pencil, by means of which it is laid on seven or eight
                    times successively. For the second impression horse dung and natural earth are
                    added to the former composition; but for the third impression only horse dung
                    and earth are used. Lastly, the shell is finished by laying on several more
                    impressions of this last matter, made very thick with the hand. The shell, thus
                    finished, is secured by several iron girths bound round it, at about half a foot
                    distant from each other, and fastened at the bottom to the grating under the
                    statue, and at top to a circle of iron where they all terminate.</p>
                <p>If the statue be so large that it would not be easy to move the moulds with
                    safety, these must be wrought on the spot where it is to be cast. This is
                    performed in two ways. In the first place, a square hole is dug in the ground,
                    much larger than the mould to be made therein, and its inside is lined with
                    walls of freestone or brick. At the bottom is made a hole of the same materials,
                    with a kind of furnace, having its aperture outwards; and in this is a fire
                    made, to dry the mould, and afterwards melt the wax. Over this furnace is placed
                    the grating, and upon this the mould, formed as above. Lastly, at one of the
                    edges of the square pit is made another large furnace, to melt the metal. In the
                    other way, it is sufficient to work the mould above ground, but with the
                    precaution of a furnace and grating underneath. When finished, four walls are
                    run around it, and by its side a melting furnace is prepared. For the rest, the
                    method is the same in both cases. The mould being finished, and enclosed as
                    described, whether below ground or above it, a moderate <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193755554" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5554-0792"/>fire is lighted in the
                    furnace under it, and the whole co vered with planks, that the wax may melt
                    gently down, and run out at pipes contrived for that purpose at the foot of the
                    mould, which are afterwards exactly closed with earth, as soon as the wax is all
                    carried off. When this is done, the whole is filled up with bricks thrown in at
                    random, and the fire in the furnace augmented, until both the bricks and mould
                    become red hot. The fire is then extinguished, and every thing being cold again,
                    the bricks are taken out, and their place filled up with earth, moistened, and
                    beaten a little at the top of the mould, in order to render it the firmer. These
                    preparatory measures being duly taken, there remains nothing but to melt the
                    metal, and run it into the mould. This is done by means of the furnace above
                    described, which is commonly made in the form of an oven with three apertures,
                    one to put in the wood, another for a vent, and a third to run the metal out at.
                    From this last aperture, which is kept very close whilst the metal is in fusion,
                    a small tube is laid, by which the molten metal is conveyed into a large earthen
                    basin, over the mould, into the bottom of which all the large branches of the
                    jets or casts, which are to convey the metal into the different parts of the
                    mould, are inserted.</p>
                <p>These casts or jets are all terminated with a kind of plugs, which are kept
                    close, so that, upon opening the furnace, the brass, which rushes out with
                    violence, may not enter any of them till the bason be full enough of matter to
                    run into them all at once; upon which occasion they pull out the plugs, which
                    are long iron rods with a head at one end, capable of filling the whole diameter
                    of each tube. The whole of the furnace is then opened with a long piece of iron
                    fitted at the end of each pole, and the mould filled in an instant. This
                    completes the work in relation to the casting part; the rest is the sculptor’s
                    or carver’s business, who, taking the figure out of the mould and earth with
                    which it is encompassed, saws off the jets with which it appears covered over,
                    and finishes it with chisels, gravers, puncheons, and other instruments.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Foundery</hi> of <hi rend="italic">'Betis.</hi> The
                    metal for casting bells, it is to be observed, is different from that employed
                    for casting statues; there being no tin in the statue metal, whereas in the bell
                    metal there is a fifth, and sometimes more.</p>
                <p>The dimensions of the core and the wax for bells, especially a chime, are not
                    left to chance, but must be measured upon a scale, or diapason, which gives the
                    height, the aperture, and the thickness, necessary for the several tones
                    required. It is on the wax that the several mouldings and other ornaments and
                    inscriptions, to be represented in relief on the outside of the bell, are
                    formed. The clapper or tongue is not properly part bf the bell, but is furnished
                    from other hands. In Europe it is usually of iron, with a large knob at the
                    extremity; and is suspended in the middle of the bell. In China it is only a
                    huge wooden mallet, struck by the hand against the bell; and hence they can have
                    but little of that consonance so much admired in some of our chimes of bells.
                    The Chinese have a method of increasing the sound of their bells, by leaving a
                    hole under the cannon; but this our bell-founders would reckon a defect.</p>
                <p>The proportions of our bells∙differ very much from those of the Chinese. In ours,
                    the modern proportions are, to make the diameter fifteen times the thickness of
                    the brim, and the height twelve times. The parts of a bell are, first, the
                    sounding bow, terminated by an inferior circle, which grows thinner and thinner;
                    secondly, the brim, or that part of a bell whereon the clapper strikes, and
                    which is thicker than the rest; thirdly, the outward sinking of the middle of
                    the bell, or the point under which it grows wider to the brim; fourthly, the
                    waist or furniture, and the part that grows wider end thicker quite to the brim;
                    fifthly, the upper vase, or that part which is above the waist; sixthly, the
                    pallet, which supports the staple of the clapper within; and, seventhly, the
                    bent and hollowed branches of metal uniting with the cannons, to receive the
                    iron keys, by which the bell is hung up to the beam, and which forms its support
                    and counterpoise when rung out.</p>
                <p>Without entering into the details of the operations, we may state, that the
                    business of bell foundery is reducible to three heads; first, the proportion of
                    a bell; secondly, the forming,of the mould; and, thirdly, the melting of the
                    metal.</p>
