                <p><label type="entry">FARQUHAR, <hi rend="smallcaps">George</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated comic writer, was the son of a clergyman, and born in 1678 at
                    Londonderry, in Ireland, where he received the rudiments of his education, and
                    gave early indications of that genius for which he afterwards distinguished
                    himself. As he was one of a numerous family, his parents, having no fortune to
                    leave to their children, resolved to give him the compensatory benefit of a
                    liberal education; and, with this view, young Farquhar, as soon as he was
                    qualified for the university, was sent to Trinity College, Dublin. This took
                    place in 1694. At first our youth Farquhar made great progress in his studies,
                    and even acquired considerable reputation; but at length the retirement and
                    restraint of a college life proving distasteful to him, he quitted Trinity,
                    where he found himself incapable of seeking advancement by the slow and regular
                    progression of university degrees; and betaking himself to the stage, he
                    obtained admission into the company of the Dublin theatre. Though his voice was
                    somewhat weak, he had the advantage of a good person, which, with his evident
                    talents, ensured him a favourable reception as an actor; and he resolved to
                    continue on the boards until something better should present itself for his
                    acceptance. But an accident of rather a serious kind put an end to this
                    resolution, and suddenly altered the whole complexion of his life. Being to play
                    the part of Guyomar in Dryden’s <hi rend="italic">Indian Emperor,</hi> and
                    having forgotten to blunt his sword, or exchange it for a theatrical rapier,
                    Farquhar, in the scene where Guyomar is supposed to kill the Spanish general
                    Vasquez, run through the body his brother tragedian who represented that part.
                    The poor general of the scene believed himself killed in good earnest, but
                    happily the wound, though dangerous, did not prove mortal. Farquhar, however,
                    was so shocked at the occurrence, that he quitted the stage, determined never
                    again to expose himself to the risk of such accidents. But this histrionic essay
                    had <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751628" xml:id="kp-eb0709-1628-0490"/>been
                    sufficient to form his taste and develope his talents tor dramatic
                    literature.</p>
                <p>Having now no inducement to remain at Dublin, Farquhar proceeded to London,
                    where, in 1696, Wilks the actor, knowing his lmmour and abilities, prevailed on
                    him to write a play, at the same time assuring him that he was generally
                    considered as better qualified to furnish compositions for the stage than to act
                    a part in those of other writers. His first comedy, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Love in a Bottle,</hi> was brought out in 1698, and well received, on account
                    of its sprightly dialogue and busy scenes. About this time the Earl of Orrery,
                    to whom Farquhar was already known by his literary talents, and esteemed for his
                    character, gave him a commission as lieutenant in his own regiment, then in
                    Ireland, in which capacity he served several years, and gave proofs both of
                    courage and conduct. In 1700 he produced his <hi rend="italic">Constant Couple,
                    or Trip to the Jubilee,</hi> so called because itwasthen the jubilee year at
                    Rome, whither persons of all countries flocked for indulgences and amusements.
                    In Sir Harry Wildair he delineated a gay and airy character, so impregnated with
                    wit and vivacity, and withal so well adapted to the peculiar talents of Wilks,
                    that the player acquired almost as much reputation as the dramatist. Towards the
                    close of this year Farquhar visited Holland, probably in his military capacity,
                    and, in several letters which he wrote, gave a very humorous description of the
                    people, and the adventures he met with, particularly of an entertainment given
                    by the Earl of Westmoreland, whilst uot only that nobleman himself, but King
                    William and others, were detained by a violent storm. In 1701 he was a
                    spectator, if not a mourner, at the funeral of Dryden. Encouraged by the success
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Constant Couple,</hi> he this year wrote a continuation
                    of the play, called <hi rend="italic">Sir Harry Wildair, or the Sequel of the
                    Trip to the Jubilee,</hi> in which Mrs Oldfield, whom the author had introduced
                    to the stage, was as greatly admired, and obtained as much reputation, in her
                    part, as Wilks had previously done in his.</p>
                <p>In 1702 he published his <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies,</hi> consisting of
                    poems, letters, and essays, all filled with humorous and pleasant sallies. Some
                    of these letters were, it is said, published from copies returned at his request
                    by Mrs Oldfield, to whom they had been addressed. At the end there is a <hi
                    rend="italic">Discourse upon Comedy,</hi> in reference to the English stage; and
                    one of the letters contains <hi rend="italic">The Picture,</hi> a descriptive
                    character of the writer, in which he is represented as an ingenious,
                    good-natured, and thoughtless person. In 1703 lie brought out another comedy,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">The Inconstant, or the Way to win him</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but as the public taste, influenced by fashion, was now
                    turning in favour of French and Italian operas, which have long been the bane of
                    our native genius, this production, though not inferior in merit, was more
                    coldly received than any of its predecessors. This year Farquhar married (as he
                    was led to believe) a person of fortune. The lady, it seems, had fallen
                    violently in love with him, and resolved to have him at any rate; but, knowing
                    his habits, and aware that he was too dissipated to think of matrimony unless
                    advantages were annexed to it, she caused a report to be circulated that she had
                    a great fortune, and followed this up by an intimation of her love for the
                    dramatist. Farquhar fell into the snare, and married her. But although he found
                    himself grossly deceived, his circumstances embarrassed, and his family
                    increasing, he, with rare magnanimity, never once upbraided his wife with the
                    imposition she had practised on him, but behaved to her with all the delicacy
                    and tenderness of a kind and indulgent husband.</p>
                <p>Early in 1704, Farquhar, in conjunction with another person, produced a farce
                    called <hi rend="italic">The Stage-coach,</hi> which was well received. His
                    comedy entitled <hi rend="italic">The Twin Rivals</hi> was played in 1705, and
                    <hi rend="italic">The Recruiting Officer</hi> made its appearance in 1706. His
                    last production, <hi rend="italic">The Beaux Stratagem</hi> was only performed a
                    few days before his death, which happened in April 1707, but not until he had
                    been made aware of the complete success of the comedy. ’ <hi rend="italic">The
                    Beaux Stratagem</hi> is generally regarded as Farquhar’s masterpiece, and
                    certainly, of all his plays it is that which has kept the firmest hold of the
                    stage. The characters are said to have been drawn from living originals whom the
                    author met with in Lichfield and its vicinity; but whether this was the case or
                    not, he has sufficiently generalized his delineations to divest them of partial
                    or localized distinctions, and has thus imparted to them an interest which
                    neither time nor change of manners has in any material degree impaired. Towards
                    the close of his life Farquhar was unhappily oppressed with debt, which obliged
                    him to sell his commission; a circumstance which, with some collateral
                    disappointments, preyed upon his spirits, and hurried him to a premature grave
                    before he had attained the age of thirty. Soon after his death, the following
                    letter, addressed to Mr Wilks the actor, was found amongst his papers: “Dear
                    Bob, I have not any thing to leave thee to perpetuate my memory but two helpless
                    girls; look upon them sometimes, and think of him that was to the last moment of
                    his Efe, thine, George Farquhar.” This affecting recommendation, resembling the
                    testament of Eudamidas, was not lost on the generous player, who watched over
                    the orphans of his gifted friend, and, when they came of age to be put out in
                    the world, procured each of them a benefit to supply the means necessary for the
                    purpose.Of Farquhar’s merits as a dramatic writer various opinions have been
                    entertained, and different judgments consequently pronounced. It can scarcely be
                    disputed, however, that he was commonly fortunate in the choice of his subjects,
                    which he embellished with a great variety of characters and incidents; that his
                    style is in general simple, unaffected, and natural; that his dialogue is full
                    of gaiety and wit, and flows in a natural, easy current, less sparkling and
                    brilliant than that of Congreve, but at the same time also less elaborate; and
                    that his plots, though almost all founded on improbable or romantic
                    suppositions, are naturally conducted, and full of anmsing vivacity. He has been
                    justly reproached with licentiousness, which, in his discourse upon comedy, he
                    even attempts to defend; but this was the vice of the age rather than of the
                    writer, who felt himself obliged to consult its taste, and adapt his
                    compositions to its prevailing manners; and is certainly not less imputable to
                    Congreve than to Farquhar. The tone of their characters, indeed, appears to have
                    been that of the society of the time, of which these are, as it were,
                    reflections; and hence in the comedies of both there is a relative truth, which
                    must not be lost sight of in estimating the moral qualities of their works. The
                    manners represented are no doubt detestable, and vice appears rampant and
                    unblushing, without the mask of hypocrisy, which, in less degenerate times, she
                    is compelled to assume as a reluctant homage to virtue; but these manners are
                    real, not imaginary; and it is from such delineations alone that we can acquire
                    accurate conceptions of the true spirit and character of the age when they were
                    relished and applauded. Pope, it seems, used pettishly to stigmatize Farquhar as
                    a mere farce-writer. But posterity has been more just to his merits than the
                    Wasp of Twickenham; and his productions, with all their faults, still keep their
                    place on the stage, and are likely to do so, as long as the redeeming attributes
                    of wit and genius possess any attraction in scenic representation.</p>
