                <p><label type="entry">FELONY</label>, in the general acceptation of the law,
                    comprehends every species of crime which occasions at common law the forfeiture
                    of lands or goods. This most frequently happens in those crimes for which a
                    capital punishment either is or used to be inflicted; for those felonies which
                    are called <hi rend="italic">clergyable,</hi> or to which the benefit of clergy
                    extends, were anciently punished with death in all lay or unlearned offenders;
                    though now, by the statute law, that punishment is for the first offence
                    universally remitted. Treason itself, says Sir Edward Coke, was anciently
                    included under the name of <hi rend="italic">felony</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and in confirmation of this we may observe, that the statute of treasons (25
                    Edw. III. c. 2), speaking of some dubious crimes, directs a reference to
                    parliament, that it may be there adjudged “whether they be treason or <hi
                    rend="italic">other</hi> felony.” All treasons, therefore, strictly speaking,
                    are felonies; though all felonies are not treason. And to this also we may add,
                    that all offences now capital are in some degree or other felonies; but this is
                    likewise the case with <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> some other offences which
                    are not punished with death, as suicide, where the party is already dead,
                    homicide by chance-medley or in self-defence, and petit-larccny or pilfering;
                    all which are, strictly speaking, felonies, as they subject those who commit
                    them to forfeitures. Upon the whole, therefore, the only adequate definition of
                    felony seems to be that which was before laid down, namely, an offence which
                    occasions a total forfeiture of either lands or goods, or both, at the common
                    law, and to which capital or other punishment may be superadded, according to
                    the degree of guilt.</p>
                <p>The word <hi rend="italic">felony,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">felonia,</hi> is
                    undoubtedly of feudal original, being frequently to be met with in the books of
                    feuds, and in other works; but the derivation of it has much puzzled the
                    juridical lexicoraphers Prataeus, Calvinus, and others. Some derive it from the
                    Greek <hi rend="italic">φrlKος, an impostor</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >deceiver</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> others from the Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >fallo, fefelli,</hi> to countenance which they would have it called <hi
                    rend="italic">fellonia.</hi> Sir Edward Coke, as his manner is, has given us a
                    still stranger etymology; that it is <hi rend="italic">crimen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">animo felleo perpetratum,</hi> a crime perpetrated with a bitter
                    or gallish inclination. But all agree in the description that it is such a crime
                    as works a forfeiture of the offender’s lands or goods. And this gives great
                    probability to Sir Henry Spelman’s derivation from the Teutonic or German, in
                    which language, indeed, as the word is clearly of feudal origin, we ought rather
                    to look for its signification, than amongst the Greeks and Romans. <hi
                    rend="italic">Eelon,</hi> then, according to him, is derived from two northern
                    words, namely, <hi rend="smallcaps">fee,</hi> signifying the fief, feud, or
                    beneficiary estate; and <hi rend="smallcaps">lon,</hi> which means price or
                    value. Felony is therefore the same as <hi rend="italic">pretium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">feudi,</hi> the consideration for which a man gives up his fief;
                    as we say in common speech, such an act is as much as your life or estate is
                    worth. In this sense it clearly signifies the feudal forfeiture or act by which
                    an estate is forfeited, or escheats to the lord.</p>
                <p>To confirm this we may observe, that in the sense of forfeiture to the lord, the
                    feudal writers constantly use it. For all those acts, whether of a criminal
                    nature or not, which at this day are generally forfeitures of copyhold estates,
                    are styled <hi rend="italic">feloniae</hi> in the féodal law: <hi rend="italic"
                    >scilicet, per quas feudum</hi><hi rend="italic">amittitur.</hi> Thus, <hi
                    rend="italic">si domino</hi><hi rend="italic">deservire noluerit;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">si</hi><hi rend="italic">per annum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">diem</hi><hi rend="italic">cessaverit</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">petenda investitura</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> si</hi><hi rend="italic">dominum
                    ejuravit,</hi> id est, <hi rend="italic">negavit se a domina feudum habere; si a
                    domino in jus eum vacante, ter citatus non com-paruerit</hi>; all which, with
                    many others, are still causes of forfeiture in our copyhold estates, and vyere
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">felonies</hi> by the feudal constitutions. So
                    likewise injuries o a more substantial or criminal nature were denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">felonies,</hi> that is, forfeitures; as assaulting or beating the
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751758" xml:id="kp-eb0709-1758-0500"/> lord;
                    vitiating his wife or daughter, <hi rend="italic">si</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >dominum</hi><hi rend="italic">cuxurbi-taverit,</hi> id cst, <hi rend="italic"
                    >cum</hi><hi rend="italic">uxore ejus concubuerit</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    all these are esteemed felonies, and the latter is expressly so denominated, <hi
                    rend="italic">si</hi><hi rend="italic">fecerit</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >feloniam,</hi><hi rend="italic">dominum</hi><hi rend="italic">forte
                    cucurbitando.</hi> And as these contempts or smaller offences were felonies or
                    acts of forfeiture, of course greater crimes, as murder and robbery, fell under
                    the same denomination. On the other hand, the lord might be guilty of felony, or
                    forfeit his seig-nory to the vassal, by the same act as that by which the vassal
                    would have forfeited his feud to the lord. <hi rend="italic">Si</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dominus commisit</hi><hi rend="italic">feloniam, per quam
                    vasaUus</hi><hi rend="italic">amitteret</hi><hi rend="italic">feudum si</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">eum commiserit</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >dominum, feudi</hi><hi rend="italic">proprietatem etiam dominus perdere
                    debet.</hi> One instance given of this sort of felony in the lord is beating the
                    servant of his vassal, so that his service is lost; which seems merely in the
                    nature of a civil injury, in as far as it respects the vassal. And all these
                    felonies were to be determined <hi rend="italic">per laudamentum sive
                    judicium</hi><hi rend="italic">parium suorum,</hi> in the lord’s court; as with
                    us forfeitures of copyhold lands are presentable by the homage in the
                    court-baron.Felony, and the act of forfeiture to the lord, being thus synonymous
                    terms in the feudal law, we may easily trace the reason why, upon the
                    introduction of that law into England, the crimes which induced such forfeiture
                    or escheat of lands (and, by a small deflection from the original sense, such as
                    induced the forfeiture of goods also) were denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >felonies.</hi> Thus it was that suicide, robbery, and rape, were felonies; that
                    is, the consequence of such crimes was forfeiture: but by long use we began to
                    signify by the term of <hi rend="italic">felony</hi> the crime actually
                    committed, and not the penal consequence thereof. And upon this system only can
                    we explain the reason why treason in ancient times was held to be a species of
                    felony; we mean, because it induced a forfeiture Hence it follows, that equal
                    punishment does not by any means enter into the true idea and definition of <hi
                    rend="italic">felony.</hi> Felony may be without inflicting capital punishment,
                    as in the cases instanced of self-murder, excusable homicide, and petit-larceny;
                    and it is possible that capital punishments may be inflicted, and yet the
                    offence be no felony, as in the case of heresy by the common law, which, though
                    capital, never worked any forfeiture of lands or goods, an inseparable incident
                    to felony. And of the same nature was the punishment of standing mute, without
                    pleading to an indictment; which at the common law was capital, but without any
                    forfeiture, so that such standing mute was no felony. In short, the true
                    criterion of felony is forfeiture; for, as Sir Edward Coke observes, in all
                    felonies which are punishable with death, the offender loses his lands in
                    feesimple, and also his goods and chattels; but in such as are not punishable he
                    loses his goods and chattels only The idea of felony is indeed so generally
                    connected with that of capital punishment, that we find it hard to separate
                    them; and to this usage the interpretations of the law now conform. If a
                    statute, therefore, makes any new offence felony, the law implies that it shall
                    be punished with death, that is, by hanging as well as forfeiture, unless the
                    offender pray the benefit of clergy; which all felons are entitled once to have,
                    unless the same is expressly taken away by statute.</p>
