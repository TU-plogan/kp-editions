                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">FALCONER, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>, a poet
                    of considerable emin ence, born at Edinburgh about the year 1730, was the son of
                    a poor but industrious barber, all of whose children, except the subject of the
                    present notice, were either deaf or dumb. William appears to have passed but a
                    short period at school, where he received the scanty education required to
                    qualify him for an inferior employment; yet he is believed to have contracted a
                    taste for reading, and a desire for higher attainments than his circumstances
                    permitted him to aspire to. At an early age he was entered as an apprentice on
                    board a merchant-vessel belonging to Leith; and Dr Currie mentions, on the
                    authority of a naval surgeon, that he afterwards served as a common sailor on
                    board the ship of which Campbell, author of <hi rend="italic">Lexiphanxs,</hi>
                    was purser, and attracted the notice of that individual by indications of talent
                    which were deemed by him worthy of cultivation. How long he continued in this
                    humble capacity is not known; but by some friendly intervention, he was
                    appointed second mate of a vessel called the Britannia, employed in the Levant
                    trade, which, however, was wrecked during her passage from Alexandria to Venice,
                    and only three of the crew, including Falconer, saved. This event, the date of
                    which has not been ascertained, appears to have made a deep impression on his
                    mind, and probably suggested the idea of his poem entitled <hi rend="italic">The
                    Shipwreck,</hi> on which his reputation chiefly rests. The first essays of his
                    muse attracted little attention, and were probably commonplace enough; though,
                    if Clarke be right in the opinion that he was the author of “Cease, rude
                    Boreas,” an exception must, of course, be made in favour of that popular song.
                    Falconer is supposedto have continued in the merchant service until the spring
                    of 1762, when he recommended himself to the notice of Edward Duke of 5 ork, by
                    the dedication of <hi rend="italic">The Shipwreck,</hi> and enlisted his royal
                    highness amongst the number of his admirers and patrons. Desirous <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193751524" xml:id="kp-eb0709-1524-0482"/>to place him in a situation
                    where he could be befriended, the duke advised him to enter the navy; and before
                    the end of summer, he was rated as midshipman on board the Royal George. But as
                    this ship was paid off at the peace of 1763, and as Falconer’s period of service
                    had been tar too short to enable him to obtain the commission of lieutenant, he
                    was advised to exchange the military for the civil department? of the navy; and,
                    in the course of the same year, he received an appointment as purseŗ of the
                    Glory frigate, a situation which he held until that vessel was laid up in
                    ordinary at Chatham. Being thus once more left without professional employment,
                    he devoted his leisure to literary pursuits. In 1764, he published a new edition
                    of <hi rend="italic">Ihe Shipwreck,</hi> in 8vo, corrected and enlarged; and the
                    following year appeared <hi rend="italic">The Demagogue,</hi> a political
                    satire, intended as a sort of antidote to the writings of Wilkes and Churchill,
                    but much more remarkable for virulence than wit. His time, however, was chiefly
                    occupied with the compilation of an <hi rend="italic">Universal Marine
                    Dictionary,</hi> a work much wanted, and which, when brought out in 1769, was
                    received with general approbation. Before this period he appears to have left
                    his retreat at Chatham for an abode of a less comfortable kind in the
                    metropolis, where, depressed by poverty, that evil-spirit which tracks the
                    footsteps of genius, he subsisted for a time on various resources. But, in the
                    midst of his difficulties, when his situation had become truly distressing, he
                    received an appointment to the pursership of the Aurora frigate, which had been
                    commissioned to carryout to India Messieurs Vansittart, Scrofton, and Forde, as
                    supervisors of the Company’s affairs; and he was also promised the office of
                    private secretary to these functionaries. From this favourable turn of fortune
                    the friends of the poet, whilst they rejoiced in the present relief which it
                    afforded, conceived him in a fair way eventually to realize a competent
                    independence; but <hi rend="italic">dis aliter</hi><hi rend="italic">visum,</hi>
                    Providence had decreed it otherwise. The Aurora sailed from England on the 30th
                    September 1769, and after touching at the Cape of Good Hope, was never more
                    heard of; she was supposed to have foundered in the Mozambique Channel, but not
                    a trace remained by which the cause of the calamity could be discovered, or even
                    conjectured.</p>
                <p>Besides the productions already mentioned, Falconer was the author of several
                    pieces, the most considerable of which are an Ode on the Duke of York’s second
                    departure from England as rear-admiral, and a Poem on the death of Frederick,
                    Prince of Wales. But as these and similar effusions could never have survived
                    the occasion which produced them, his fame as a poet must entirely rest on <hi
                    rend="italic">The Shipwreck,</hi> which, with all its faults, has a fair chance
                    of immortality, appealing, as it does, directly to the feelings of one class of
                    men, and indirectly to the natural sympathies of all. There is a warmth in its
                    colouring, and a reality in its descriptions, which strongly impress the minds
                    particularly of youth, and, notwithstanding the didactic character pf the poem,
                    sustain its interest, and enliven even the duller parts by a sort of reflected
                    radiance. Natural feeling, natural imagery, and natural truth, are expressed in
                    natural language, which, if it never rises to a great elevation, seldom sinks
                    below the dignity of the subject, and is throughout animated by a glow of
                    feeling which awakens a kindred emotion in the breast of the reader. Falconer
                    has no striking outbursts of genius; he does not aspire to produce a great
                    effect by a few bold touches, or the rapid and masterly grouping of appalling or
                    horrible circumstances. He labours in detail, bringing before us, without
                    apparent effort, the events as they arise, and conducting us with an interest
                    constantly increasing towards the catastrophe. He paints with minute fidelity as
                    well as picturesque effect; but it is from the general result, rather than from
                    any portion or portions of the work considered separately, that the talents of
                    the artist should be judged. Such a tremendous picture of shipwreck as that
                    which Byron has, in wild sportiveness thrown out in Don Juan, immeasurably
                    transcends the powers of Falconer, and indeed stands alone in its terrible
                    sublimity; but, on the other hand, the latter, by the careful elaboration of
                    natural circumstances, and the general truth of his delineation, ultimately
                    impresses the mind of the reader, if not with such vivid force, perhaps with
                    even more enduring effect. Of the didactic merits of the poem, nautical men, who
                    are necessarily the most competent judges in this particular, have spoken in
                    terms of high commendation; and it has even been said that the rules and maxims
                    therein delivered for the management of a ship in a perilous emergency are the
                    very best which a practical mariner could adopt. But in our estimation this
                    forms one of the principal defects of the poem considered as such, though it
                    fell in with the spirit of the time when <hi rend="italic">The Shipwreck</hi>
                    was produced, and may still recommend it to sailors; nor by ordinary readers,
                    who cannot understand or appreciate this sort of instruction, is it likely to be
                    viewed in any other light than as an incumbrance to the march of the narrative
                    and the progression of events.</p>
