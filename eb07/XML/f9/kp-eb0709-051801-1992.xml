                    celebrated as a restorer of ancient mathematics, and an original author of
                    modern improvements, was born at Toulouse about 1595. His public life was
                    occupied by the active duties attached to the situation of a counsellor of the
                    parliament of Toulouse, in which he was distinguished both for legal knowledge
                    and for strict integrity of conduct. Besides the sciences, which were the
                    principal objects of his private studies, he was an accomplished scholar, an
                    excellent linguist, and even a respectable poet.</p>
                <p>His <hi rend="italic">Opera</hi><hi rend="italic">Mathematica</hi> were published
                    at Toulouse, in two volumes folio, 1670 and 1679; they are now become very
                    scarce. The first contains the <hi rend="italic">Arithmetic of Diophantus,</hi>
                    illustrated by a commentary, and enlarged by a multitude of additional
                    propositions. In the second we find a <hi rend="italic">Method or the Quadrature
                    of Parabolas</hi> of all kinds, and a <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Maxima and
                    Minima, on Tangents, and on Centres of Gravity</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    containing the same solutions of a variety of problems as were afterwards
                    incorporated into the more extensive method of fluxions, by Newton and Leibnitz;
                    and securing to their author, in common with Cavalleri, Roberval, Descartes,
                    Wallis, Barrow, and Sluse, an ample share of the glory of having immediately
                    prepared the way for the gigantic steps of those illustrious philosophers. The
                    same volume contains also several other treatises on <hi rend="italic">Geometric
                    Loci,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Spherical Tangencies,</hi> and on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rectification of Curves,</hi> besides a restoration of <hi
                    rend="italic">Apollonius'</hi><hi rend="italic">'s</hi><hi rend="italic">Plane
                    Loci</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> together with the author’s correspondence,
                    addressed to Descartes, Pascal, Roberval, Huygens, and others.</p>
                <p>It was too much Fermat’s custom to leave liis most important propositions wholly
                    undemonstrated; sometimes, perhaps, because he may have obtained them rather by
                    induction than by a connected train of reasoning; and, in other cases, for the
                    purpose of proposing them as a trial of strength to his contemporaries. The
                    deficiency, however, has in many instances been supplied by the elaborate
                    investigations of Euler and Lagrange, who have thought it no degradation to
                    their refined talents to go back a century in search of these elegant
                    intricacies, which appeared to require further illustration. It happened not
                    uncommonly, that the want of a more explicit statement of the grounds of his
                    discoveries deprived Fermat, in the opinion of his rivals, of the credit justly
                    due to him for accuracy and originality. It was thus that Descartes attempted to
                    correct his method of <hi rend="italic">maxima</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >minima,</hi> and could never be persuaded that Fermat’s first propositions on
                    the subject were unexceptionable. Fermat , was however enabled to pursue his
                    favourite studies with less interruption than Descartes; and the products of his
                    labour were proportionate, as Lacroix remarks, to the opportunities he enjoyed,
                    as well as to the talents he possessed.</p>
                <p>There is a very ingenious proposition of Fermat, wnι deserves to be particularly
                    noticed, on account of the discussion that it not long ago excited among
                    mathematic <pb break="no" facs="nls:193752005" xml:id="kp-eb0709-2005-0519"
                    />philosophers. He has demonstrated that the true law of the refraction of light
                    may be deduced from the principle, that it describes the path by which it can
                    arrive in the shortest possible time from any one point of its tract or course
                    to another; on the supposition, however, that the velocity of light is inversely
                    proportional to the refractive density of the medium: and the same phenomena of
                    refraction have been shown by Maupertuis to be deducible, upon the opposite
                    supposition with respect to the velocities, from the law of the minimum of
                    action, considering the action as the product of the space described into the
                    velocity. But the law of Fermat is actually a step in the process of nature,
                    according to the conditions of the system to which it belongs in its original
                    form; whilst that of Maupertuis is at most only an interesting commentary on the
                    operation of an accelerating force. It was Newton who showed the necessary
                    connection between the action of such a force and the actual law of refraction;
                    demonstrating that all the phenomena might be derived from the effect of a
                    constant attraction, perpendicular to the surface of the medium: and, except in
                    conjunction with such a force, the law of Maupertuis would even lead to a false
                    result. For if we supposed a medium acting on a ray of light with two variable
                    forces, one perpendicular to the surface, and the other parallel to it, we might
                    easily combine them in such a manner as to obtain a constant velocity within the
                    medium, but the refraction would be very different from that which is observed,
                    though the law of Maupertnis would indicate no difference; so that the law must
                    be here applied with the tacit condition that the refractive force is
                    perpendicular to the surface. In Laplace’s theory of extraordinary refraction,
                    on the contrary, the tacit condition is, that the force must <hi rend="italic"
                    >not</hi> be perpendicular to the surface; so that this theory not only requires
                    the gratuitous assumption of a different velocity for every different obliquity,
                    which is made an express postulate, but also the implicit admission of the
                    existence of a force, determinate in direction and in magnitude, by which that
                    velocity is modified, and without which the law of Maupertuis would cease to be
                    applicable. It may indeed be said, that the supposition of a medium exhibiting
                    unequal velocities, and attracting the light perpendicularly, is unnatural, and
                    that the law is the more valuable for not being applicable to it; but a
                    mathematical equation is true even with respect to impossible quantities, and a
                    physical law, however useful it may be, requires physical proof; and it will not
                    be asserted that the law of Maupertuis has been or can be established by
                    physical evidence sufficiently extensive to render it universal.</p>
                <p>Fermat died at Toulouse in the end of 1664, or beginning of 1665, at the age of
                    seventy. He left a son, Samuel de F ermat, who was a man of some learning, and
                    published translations of several Greek authors. <hi rend="smallcaps">(l.
