                <p><label type="entry">FARS</label>, a province of Persia, bounded by Irak on the
                    north, Kerman and Laristan on the east, Kuzistan on the west, and on the south
                    by the Persian Gulf. This province is divided into the Germaseer and Sirhud, or
                    the warm and the cold climates. It is in general sandy and barren, though with
                    some considerable exceptions. The l’abris, formed by the junction, within a few
                    miles of the town of Zeitoon, of two streams which take their rise in the
                    mountains of Fars, is the most considerable river of the province. It divides
                    Fars from Kuzistan, and, eight miles below the town of Endian, falls into the
                    sea. The warm region of this district extends from the sea to the latitude of
                    Kazeroon, and runs parallel with the gulf from the banks of the Tabris to the
                    confines of Laristan. It is chiefly a sandy plain at the foot of the mountains,
                    the cultivation of which depends on the periodical rains; and when these prove
                    abundant, the country yields abundance of dry grain; but when the rains fail,
                    which too frequently happens, a famine generally ensues. The sandy plain, or the
                    Dushtistan as it is called, is divided into two districts, which are separated
                    by the projecting mountain or Bung. These two districts are thinly peopled and
                    badly cultivated; and the few mud villages which are scattered over the plain
                    bespeak but too clearly the wretchedness and poverty of their possessors. The
                    cold region comprehends most of the mountainous part of Fars, extending from the
                    latitude of Kazeroon to that of the town of Yezdekhast, situated on the bed of
                    what appears to have been formerly a river, which separates this province from
                    Irak. The mountains are here intersected by plains, which seldom exceed eight or
                    ten miles in breadth, whilst in length they vary from fifteen to a hundred. They
                    are in general fertile, affording abundance of pasturage; nor are they so
                    deficient in water as they have sometimes been represented. A few of them, such
                    as those of Shiraz, Kazeroon, and Merdesht, are tolerably well cultivated. But
                    they are for the most part, particularly to the northward and westward,
                    destitute of inhabitants. It is mentioned by Kinneir, in his Geographical Memoir
                    of the Persian Empire, that in 1809 he travelled in this country “through the
                    most delightful valleys, covered with wood and verdure,” but all was solitary,
                    nor was the face of a human being anywhere to be seen. The country, it appears,
                    had been possessed by a predatory tribe, who, in consequence of their licentious
                    conduct, had been extirpated by the vengeance of the prince, and who having in
                    consequence fled to the lofty and inaccessible mountains, lived there on the
                    scanty fare of a sort of bread afforded by acorns, and thence sallying forth on
                    the low country beneath, robbed and plundered the unwary traveller, sometimes
                    extending their inroads to villages, the inhabitants of which they either
                    murdered, or carried away captive, to be sold for slaves in an unknown and
                    distant land. The face of the country in the eastern parts of Fars is somewhat
                    different, being open, the plains of greater extent, and of a sandy soil, where
                    water is not so plentiful. The great range of mountains seen from the coast is a
                    mere elongation of the chain of Mount Tagros, which extends in a continued
                    succession of ridges from the borders of the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea and
                    the Caucasus. These hills in Fars are situated at different distances from the
                    sea. At Bushire they are distant twenty-four miles. But towards Bunder Reig the
                    plain becomes contracted; and a low ridge, known by the name of Kohi Bung, or
                    the hill of Bung, and about seven or eight miles broad, suddenly projects to the
                    south, and touching the sea, separates the district of Leerawee from that of
                    Hiadouat. Beyond this hill, at the plain of Leerawee, the mountains are about
                    twenty miles distant from the sea, at which distance they continue for eighteen
                    or nineteen miles, when they again approach the south; and this branch is known
                    by the name of Zeitoon, on turning the southern point of which they again
                    abruptly retire to the northward; and at the port of Mashoor they are thirty
                    miles from the sea. The principal towns of the province are Shiraz, the capital,
                    with 40,000 inhabitants; Bushire, the chief port in the Persian Gulf; Darabjerb,
                    Bebahan, and some others. Within its confines also are the ruins of the cities
                    of Shapoor and Persepolis; the latter containing some magnificent remains of
                    antiquity.</p>
