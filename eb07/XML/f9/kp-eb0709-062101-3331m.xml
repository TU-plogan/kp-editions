                    sub-prcceptor of the young princes of France, was the son of an advocate before
                    the council, originally from Rouen, and born at Paris on the 6th of December
                    1640. He studied under the Jesuits, in the College of Clermont, where he passed
                    six years; and he ever afterwards cherished sentiments of the liveliest
                    gratitude towards his kind and able masters. Being intended by his father for
                    the bar, he now applied himself to the study of the civil law and of history, to
                    which he added the belles-lettres, for which he had a strong predilection, and
                    he was admitted as an advocate before the parliament of Paris in 1658. He
                    remained at the bar nine years, during which time the peaceable life he led, a
                    natural taste for solitude, and religious sentiments, the fruits of his early
                    education, insensibly produced in his mind an inclination for the church. As
                    soon as his resolution was fixed, he made a corresponding change in his
                    pursuits, and the works which had hitherto been the objects of his study were
                    replaced by theology, the fathers, ecclesiastical history, and the canon law, in
                    all which he became very learned. He had already been some time in priest’s
                    orders, when, in 1672, he was chosen, on account of his merit, as preceptor to
                    the sons of the Prince of Conti, who were educated along with the dauphin. At
                    the expiration of this engagement, the king, who had occasion to observe and
                    appreciate his merit, entrusted him with the education of the Count of
                    Vermandois, which, however, he did not complete, as this young prince died in
                    1683. In 1684, the king conferred on him the abbey of Loc-Dieu, belonging to the
                    order of Citeaux; and in 1689, appointed him sub-preceptor to the Dukes of
                    Burgundy, Anjou, and Berry. The Abbé Fleury having thus found himself associated
                    with Fénélon, shared the labour which that illustrious prelate bestowed on the
                    education of his august pupils, and contributed essentially to its success. It
                    was in 1696, whilst he was still occupied with the instruction of the princes,
                    that he was named one of the forty of the French Academy to fill the place of La
                    Bruyère. In other respects he led as retired a life at court as he could have
                    done in the most profound solitude. Entirely occupied with the duties of his
                    office, to which he devoted himself without reserve, he had but few moments of
                    leisure; but these, when he could command them, were given to useful pursuits.
                    When the education of the princes was completed, Louis, who not only knew howto
                    distinguish talents, but also how to reward them, conferred on Fleury the rich
                    priory of Argenteuil; upon which the abbe, faithful to the discipline
                    established by the canons, resigned his abbey into the hands of the king. It was
                    then that, free from all care, he devoted himself entirely to pursuits worthy a
                    man of his station; but Louis XIV. having died, in 1716, he was recalled to the
                    court by the regent, to become confessor to the young king. In appointing him to
                    this office the regent is reported to have said, “I have chosen you because you
                    are neither Jansenist, nor M&lt; linist, nor Ultramontanist.” Fleury discharged
                    with zeal and sagacity the delicate functions of his new situation, which,
                    however, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193753344" xml:id="kp-eb0709-3344-0622"/>he
                    resigned in 1722, by reason of his great age. He died on the 14th of July 1723,
                    in his eighty-third year. Fleury was alike remarkable for his great learning and
                    extreme simplicity of manners; in him Christian humility was blended with true
                    dignity, and the gentlest disposition with the loftiest spirit. He was mild,
                    affable, benign, charitable; an ardent lover of truth, and a bright pattern of
                    those virtues which he inculcated on others. His understanding, naturally
                    excellent, was cultivated with infinite labour; and his heart was as carefully
                    disciplined as his understanding. Profound knowledge, sterling rectitude of
                    principle, innocent manners, a simple, laborious, and edifying life, sincere
                    modesty, admirable disinterestedness, unfailing regularity, and the utmost
                    fidelity in the discharge of all his duties; such are the traits of the
                    character of Fleury as delineated by his contemporaries; a character which, in
                    their judgment, exhibited an assemblage of all the talents and virtues which
                    form the profound scholar, the honest man, and the devout Christian. The
                    following is a list of the numerous works which he left behind him, part of
                    which were composed during brief snatches of leisure, whilst occupied with the
                    education of his different royal and noble pupils: 1. <hi rend="italic">Histoire
