                    Magalhaens</hi></label>, a very large tract of country, occupying the whole
                    southern portion of South America beyond the united provinces of the Rio de la
                    Plata, with the exception of portions of its western and eastern coasts, which
                    form parts of Chili and of Buenos Ayres respectively. Its limits on the north
                    have repeatedly been altered. In the year 1740 an imaginary line was drawn
                    across the continent, in about 35° of south latitude, and which separated the
                    possessions of the Spaniards from the territory of the Indians. But this
                    boundary was never respected by either party, inroads having been repeatedly
                    made by both into the neighbouring country. In 1822 the government of Buenos
                    Ayres built fortresses on a frontier which extended to nearly the 38th degree of
                    south latitude, with the intention of repelling the roving tribes from all the
                    country which lies to the north of that parallel. The Indians, however, never
                    recognised this line of demarcation, and made frequent irruptions into the
                    possessions of Buenos Ayres, plundering the country, and committing dreadful
                    havoc. From this debateable land Patagonia extends to the 56th degree of south
                    latitude; a parallel including Cape Horn, which is in fact a small island, and
                    the most southerly of those lying immediately contiguous to Tierra del Fuego. In
                    longitude it extends from the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193492582"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-2582-0115"/>63d to the 75th meridians west from Greenwich. Its
                    length, including Cape Horn, is above one thousand miles; but its breadth at the
                    widest is not much more than one third of that space, and it gradually narrows
                    to a point at the southern extremity, where the land bends in a curve to the
                    south-east. The interior of this vast country is but little known, only the
                    sea-coast territory and the numerous islands having been as yet explored to any
                    extent. Indeed, until very lately, our knowledge of any part of it, with the
                    exception of the eastern coast, was confined to isolated and often
                    widely-separated portions of the country; but a survey of the coasts, taken
                    between the years 1826 and 1836, by orders of the British government, and also
                    some recent voyages, undertaken in vessels belonging to Great Britain, the
                    United States, and other countries, have gone far to supply this blank in
                    geography.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The surveying

                    notices of these expeditions which appeared in the Journal of the Geographical
                    Society ∙ the first, by Captain King, commander of the expedition, being

                    which is known to traverse the continent almost from end to end without a break,

                    the neighbourhood of the equator it rises in several places more than 20,000
                    feet above the level of the sea; at Santiago of Chili, in latitude 34° south
                    nearly, the highest land is 14,000 feet; farther south it continues to decline;
                    and from the island of Chiloe to the Strait of Magalhaens,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>With regard to the orthography of this great
                    navigator’s name, Captain King says in a note, “There has existed much
                    difference of opinion as to the correct mode of spelling this name. The French
                    and English usually write it Magellan, and the Spaniards Magallanes; but by the
                    Portuguese, and he was a native of Portugal, it is universally written
                    Magalhāes......I have convinced myself of the propriety of following the
                    Portuguese orthography for a name which to this day is very common both in
                    Portugal and Brazil.”</p></note> Captain King estimates the average height at
                    3000 feet. He adds, however, that “there are some mountains which may be between
                    five and six thousand feet high.” About the parallel of 40° the coast begins to
                    assume, and retains to its furthest extremity, a very different appearance from
                    that which it exhibits to the northward. On the coast of Chili, and indeed along
                    the whole of the western shore of the continent, to its northern extremity, a
                    belt of comparatively low land interposes between the occan and the cordillera
                    of the Andes, and which affords but very few places of shelter for vessels. But
                    southward of the parallel specified, the base of the mountain chain is washed by
                    the Pacific, the waters of which, flowing as it were into the deep ravines 'that
                    wind through its ramifications, form numerous channels, sounds, and gulfs, and
                    in many instances insulate considerable portions of land. Indeed the whole
                    western coast of Patagonia is girdled by a chain of large islands and extensive
                    archipelagos, barren to seaward, but impenetrably wooded towards the mainland.
                    Of these the most conspicuous are the Archipelago of Chonos, Wellington Island,'
                    the Archipelago of Madre de Dios, Hanover Island, and Queen Adelaide’s
                    Archipelago. The land of Très Montes is however an exception, being a peninsula,
                    and the only part of the continent, within the above limits, that is exposed to
                    the swell of the occan. It forms the northern part of the Gulf of Penas, and is
                    connected with the mainland by a narrow isthmus called Ofqui, over which the
                    Indians, in travelling along the coast, carry their canoes, to avoid the risk of
                    passing round the peninsula, an undertaking of extreme danger. It was here that
                    the celebrated Byron, ancestor of the great poet, and his shipwrecked
                    companions, crossed over with their Indian guides; but the route is not much
                    frequented, for this part of the coast, like all the rest, is very thinly
                    peopled, and the task of pulling their èanoes to pieces and reconstructing them,
                    which is absolutely ne cessary, is too great to be performed, except upon
                    occasions of extraordinary emergency.</p>
                <p>The largest river of the coast to the south of the Archipelago of Chiloe is
                    called San Tadeo. It is, however, of inconsiderable size, and falls into the
                    Gulf of St Estevan, over a shallow bar, upon which there is but very little
                    depth of water. At the head of this gulf is St Quentin’s Sound, of easy access,
                    and affording excellent anchorage. The Guaianceo Islands form the southern head
                    of the Gulf of Penas. These are succeeded by Wellington Island, separated from
                    the continent by the Mesier Channel, the extent of which is about 160 miles, and
                    of course the island which it insulates is nearly of the same length; but its
                    breadth at the greatest does not eχeeed sixty or seventy miles. The Mesier
                    Channel joins the Strait of Coneepeion behind the Madre de Dios Archipelago, at
                    the Brazo Aneho of Sarmiento. About thirty miles within the Mesier Channel,
                    Captain King says, the west side appears to be formed by a succession of large
                    islands; and on both sides of the channel the coast is hilly, but not very
                    elevated, there being in many places much low and generally thickly-wooded land.
                    The same character distinguishes the Mesier from all the other channels. In this
                    locality the trees are nearly of the same description as those which are found
                    in all parts between Cape Très Montes and the Strait of Magalhaens. Of these the
                    most common are an evergreen beech, .a birch-like beech, the winter’s bark, a
                    tree resembling a cypress, of which the Indians make their spears, and a very
                    hard and heavy wood, of a red colour, which is used as fuel. A great quantity of
                    timber grows in the vicinity of Mesier Channel, but it attains no height, and,
                    from the humidity of the climate, is found to be decayed at the heart, and of
                    very little use. About half way through, the Mesier Channel changes its
                    character entirely, becoming very narrow, tortuous, and strewed with islands,
                    whilst the land on either side rises abruptly from the water in mountainous and
                    precipitous ridges. This character it preserves to its junction with the Wide
                    Channel, in which the breadth increases to two miles and a half, and then
                    running thirty-four miles with a direct and unimpeded course, falls into the
                    Strait of Coneepcion. This strait separates the archipelago of Madre de Dios
                    from the mainland, which in this part is much intersected by deep sounds. The
                    principal of these is called the Canal of St Andrew, and it extends to the base
                    of the snowy range of the eordillera, which is described to be “suddenly and
                    boldly closed by tremendous and astonishing glaciers.” Sarmiento’s Puerto Buono,
                    as its name indicates, is a safe and commodious harbour, the depth of water
                    being only nine fathoms all over, an advantage which few ports in this quarter
                    afford. Behind Hanover Island, which is separated from the mainland by
                    Coneepeion Strait, the continent is very much intersected by extensive sounds
                    trending deeply into the land, like the St Andrew Channel, to the base of the
                    Andes. South of Hanover Island is Queen Adelaide’s Arehipelago, through which
                    there are several channels that communicate with the Strait of Magalhaens. The
                    principal of these, called Smyth’s Channel, falls into the strait at Cape
                    Tamar.</p>
                <p>The general character of Western Patagonia, given by its recent explorers, is
                    very unfavourable. Wood and water are indeed abundant everywhere; fish are
                    easily caught; and the steamer or race-horse duck, geese, wild-ducks, and other
                    smaller birds, are everywhere numerous; but of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193492595" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2595-0116"/>any other useful productions
                    the country is quite destitute. “If,” says Lieutenant Skyring, “we force a
                    passage through the woods, it is over fallen trees and moss; if we walk over
                    open, flat ground, we find the place a swamp; and if we climb the hills, we
                    travel over a continuous rock, generally covered by a spongy moss, and entirely
                    destitute of soil of any description.” The forests are so dense as to be
                    impervious to the sun’s rays, so that the rain, which falls here incessantly, is
                    never carried away by evaporation. The consequence is, that every foot of earth,
                    and every tree and shrub, on these inhospitable shores, is always thoroughly
                    wet. Of course the country is uninhabitable, except by savages. Clouds, wind,
                    and rain, only cease their annoyance during the very few days on which the wind
                    is easterly, or perhaps southerly. Probably there are not ten days in twelve
                    months on which rain or snow does not fall, and not thirty on which it does not
                    blow strongly. But it is mild, and the temperature is surprisingly uniform
                    throughout the year.</p>
                <p>The most striking feature of <hi rend="italic">Southern Patagonia</hi> is the
                    long and comparatively narrow channel called the Strait of Magalhaens, which
                    separates Tierra del Fuego, and a great number of other· islands, from the
                    mainland. The manner in which the land, continental as well as insular, is
                    penetrated in all directions by large and small arms of the sea, is such as to
                    defy verbal description. The indentations frequently assume the character of
                    immense inland seas, one of which, called Otway Water, nearly insulates a large
                    portion of the continent, to which the name of Brunswick Peninsula has been
                    given. A natural canal connects Otway Water with Skyring Water, which,
                    stretching from east to west, along with another arm of the sea called
                    Obstruction Sound, trending in a semicircle from north to south, nearly cuts off
                    another large portion of the continent, which has been called King William IV.’s
                    Land. The south-eastern shore of the Otway Water is high, rocky, and generally
                    precipitous; but the northern coast is formed by low, undulating, grassy plains,
                    wholly destitute of timber. The shores of Skyring Water have the same general
                    character. In some parts the country is wooded, and possesses a dry and light
                    but tolerably good soil. Captain King thus speaks of the survey which had been
                    made of this part of Patagonia. “In this examination, the southern part of the
                    cordillera was ascertained. The eastern shores of the interior channels were
                    found to be low plains, with no hills nor mountains visible in the distance; and
                    such being the feature also of the northern shores of the Otway and Skyring
                    Waters, it is probable that all the country to the east of the sounds is a
                    continued pampa or plain.” Traces of Indians were observed, but they do not
                    appear to inhabit the shores of these interior-sounds, at least permanently. No
                    guanacoes were discovered, but several large herds of deer were observed feeding
                    on the shores. Sea-otters and black-necked swans in great numbers were the only
                    other living things observed in these dreary solitudes.</p>
                <p>“The Strait of Magalhaens,” says Captain King, “being a transverse section of the
                    continent, exhibits a very good view of its geological structure. The strait may
                    be divided into three portions, the western, central, and eastern. The western
                    end and centre are of primitive character, rugged, and very mountainous; whilst
                    the eastern portion is of a recent formation, and low. The western part is
                    composed of a succession of stratified rocks, a difference at once
                    distinguishable by the form and nature of the ranges, and the direction of the
                    shores; the hills are irregularly heaped together; the sounds are intricate and
                    tortuous in their course; and the shores are formed by deep sinuosities and
                    prominently projecting headlands. The channels also are studded with innumerable
                    islands and rocks, which are extremely dangerous for navigation. Near the centre
                    of the strait, the rock being clay-slate, the mountains are higher, and more
                    precipitous and rugged in their outline, and consequently not easily to be
                    ascended. They are in general three thousand, but some are found to be four
                    thousand feet in height; and one, Mount Sarmiento, is upwards of six thousand
                    feet high, and is covered throughout the year with snow. The line of perpetual
                    snow in the strait seems to be about three thousand five hundred or four
                    thousand feet above the sea. The strait here is quite free from islands; and it
                    is a remarkable fact, that where the greenstone formation terminates, there the
                    islands cease to appear.” The slate formation continues as far as Fresh-Water
                    Bay, situated about the middle of the eastern shore of Brunswick Peninsula, Cape
                    Negro forming its northern extremity, and projecting from the narrow isthmus
                    which unites the peninsula with the mainland. At Cape Negro the clay formation
                    commences, and in that portion of the strait to the eastward of it the hills are
                    remarkable for the regularity and parallelism of their direction, and their
                    general resemblance to each other. Captain King thus concludes his geological
                    observations: “The irregularity of the topographic features of the more western
                    portion of the strait, combined with its confused assemblage and immense number
                    of islands and rocks, the regularity of the strata, the coinciding parallelism
                    of all the bays, channels, and sounds, and the total absence of islands in the
                    central portion or slate formation, together with the remarkable similarity of
                    the direction of the hills and coast line, and the stratification of the
                    north-eastern tract, which is very different from that of the centre, are very
                    striking facts, and, geologically considered, are of great interest.”</p>
                <p>The character of the vegetation is also very interesting, not so much from the
                    variety of plants, as from their stunted growth to the westward, their
                    luxuriance in the centre, and the total absence of trees to the eastward. This
                    remarkable dissimilarity, of course, arises from the soil differing very much in
                    these several localities. Light and thin in the west and east, it is unfit for
                    plants which take a deep root; but in the centre, where there are large valleys
                    irrigated by numerous streams, which swell in the winter months, and deposit a
                    great quantity of alluvium, a good superficial soil is formed, and here
                    accordingly the shrubs and plants become particularly luxuriant and productive,
                    whilst trees of several feet in diameter are numerous. The trees are similar to
                    those already mentioned as belonging to Western Patagonia, and they are not of
                    much value. It is remarkable that, in this rigorous climate, the veronica, and
                    even the fuchsia, were found in full flower within a short distance of the base
                    of a mountain, covered about two thirds down with snow, and with a temperature
                    of 36°. During summer, Captain King found it at night as low as 29°, yet the
                    most delicate plants received no injury from the cold. This is singular enough;
                    but the following facts relative to climate are still more remarkable. “I have
                    occasionally,” says this navigator, “during the summer, been up the greater part
                    of the night at my observatory, with the internal as well as the external
                    thermometers as low as freezing point, without being particularly warmly clad,
                    and yet not feeling the least cold; and in the winter the thermometer, on
                    similar occasions, has been at 24° and 26°, without my suffering the slightest
                    inconvenience. This I attributed at the time to the peculiar stillness of the
                    air, although within a short distance in the offing, and overhead, the wind was
                    high.” The water of the ocean near the surface is here so much warmer than the
                    air, that in the middle of winter, which is June, a difference of no less than
                    thirty degress has been observed, on which occasions the sea was covered with a
                    cloud of vapour, the result of a well-known law. Parrots and humming-birds,
                    generally the inhabitants of warm regions, are very numerous in the southern and
                    western parts of the strait; a fact which proves that <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193492608" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2608-0117"/>the climate is mild although
                    the temperature be comparatively low.</p>
                <p>Tierra del Fuego is divided into three islands by two channels or sounds. The
                    most westerly of these is high and rugged; and although in the valleys, ravines,
                    and sheltered nooks, there is no want of vegetation, yet, in comparison with the
                    eastern part of the strait, it has a very dismal and uninviting aspect. It bears
                    the appropriate name of South Desolation. To the east of it lies Clarence
                    Island, which is only fifty-two miles in length by twenty-three in breadth. It
                    is equally rocky with the former, but has a much more verdant and agreeable
                    appearance. These two islands are of course surrounded by others without either
                    number or name; and the southern and western part of Tierra del Fuego may be
                    briefly described by stating, that deep but narrow arms of the sea intersect
                    high mountainous islands, the summits of which are covered with snow, whilst
                    their steep and rocky shores are more than partially covered with evergreen
                    woods. Throughout the year cloudy weather prevails, much rain falls, and fine
                    days are very rare. The natives, too, unlike those in other parts of the
                    country, are an ill-conditioned race, low in stature, badly formed in body, and
                    of a colour as dark as old mahogany. The eastern island, which is by far the
                    largest of the three, is known on our charts by the name of King Charles’s South
                    Land. The northern part partakes of the geological character of the eastern
                    portion of the strait; the centre is a continuation of the slate formation; and
                    the south shore, or seaward coast line, is chiefly composed of greenstone. The
                    eastern portion of Tierra del Fuego is a better country than any south of the
                    forty-fifth parallel. The eastern shore towards the south part is lofty, but
                    near the northern part it is very low. The interior is also low, with extensive
                    plains abounding with guanacoes. The natives are a much better race of men than
                    those in the western part of Tierra del Fuego, and the climate is also more
                    favourable. At Port Famine, in the Strait of Magalhaens, situated in latitude
                    53. 38½. south, and longitude 70. 54. west from Greenwich, Captain King took
                    careful observations of the climate from the beginning of January till the
                    middle of August From his tables it appears that the mean temperature for the
                    autumnal period, the months of February, March, and April, was 47° 2'; the
                    maximum and minimum being respectively 68° and 28°. For the three following
                    months, or the winter period, the mean temperature was 34° 5', and the maximum
                    and minimum 49° 5' and 12° 6′ respectively. The natives of this territory are
                    like those of Eastern Patagonia, but they have no horses. Balls, and bows and
                    arrows, are their arms and hunting weapons. They depend for subsistence chiefly
                    on seals, guanacoes, and birds. As a native of Tierra del Fuego is seldom out of
                    sight of his canoe, or a wigwam, the only constructions on which he exercises
                    his skill, some idea of these must be given. The canoe is made of several large
                    pieces of bark sewed together. Its shape is nearly that which would be assumed
                    by the strong bark of a tree from twelve to twenty feet in length, and about
                    eighteen inches or two feet in diameter, when separated from the solid wood in
                    one piece, and joined at the ends, but kept open towards the middle by means of
                    sticks. It is ballasted by clay, and always carries a small fire. There are two
                    kinds of wigwams, one of which is made of small straight trees, the upper ends
                    of which are united, whilst the lower form a circle. The other is formed by
                    branches stuck in the ground, then bent together at the top, and slightly
                    covered with skins, bark, grass, or leafy twigs. A small aperture is left for
                    the smoke to escape by, but here the rain as readily finds entrance.</p>
                <p>To the south of Tierra del Fuego are a vast number of islands, the largest of
                    which are called Hoste and Navarin Islands. The south shores of these consist of
                    hornblende, which is the principal rock of which the islands in the neigh
                    bourhood, as well as of that of Cape Horn itself, are composed. The south summit
                    of this small but celebrated island is situated in 55.58. 4L of south latitude,
                    and 67. 21. 14. of longitude west from Greenwich. With the most boisterous and
                    humid climate on the globe, and with a low but eminently uniform temperature,
                    vegetation flourishes here with surprising beauty and luxuriance. Some causes
                    hitherto unexplained considerably modify the assigned law of diminution of
                    temperature in proportion to elevation, for here it does not appear to hold
                    true. Captain Foster, an accurate observer, says, that the character of
                    vegetation on the mountains of Staten Island and Cape Horn did not vary in the
                    least from that of the lowland plains. The hills about Cape Horn are very rarely
                    covered with snow, yet, from the temperature at the level of the sea, and the
                    known altitude of the hills, this ought to be the case.</p>
                <p>It may be observed, that there are several other islands which lie still farther
                    south than Cape Horn; but although clothed with vegetation, they are small, and
                    do not appear to contain inhabitants. The vegetation of Horn Island is similar
                    to that of Staten Island, which has been very fully described by several
                    intelligent navigators. It is rendered remarkable by its position off the
                    south-eastern extremity of the South American continent, by the peculiarity of
                    its shape, it being so deeply indented by bays as to form nearly four different
                    islands, and by the circumstance of its offering a good departure for ships
                    bound to different parts of the Pacific, as well as a landfall for those
                    returning from the islands situated in that quarter. It is about thirty-four
                    miles in length from east to west, and its extreme breadth is about nine miles.
                    Staten Island is separated from Tierra del Fuego by the Straits of Le Maire, in
                    which there generally runs a very dangerous tide-rip. It is composed of an
                    accumulation of lofty hills of clay-slate, separated by narrow ravines, little
                    or no level ground being seen. The scenery of the island is wild and romantic in
                    the extreme; and although rugged and uncultivated, it is grand and pleasing. It
                    is clothed all over with luxuriant vegetation, consisting chiefly of beautiful
                    evergreen trees, the most common being the antarctic beech, and a multitude of
                    minor plants and shrubs, many of which bear excellent fruits. The seal, the
                    otter, the rat, and the mouse, are the only quadrupeds on Staten Island; but
                    birds are more numerous. It has long been the resort of vessels in search of
                    seals, and they have in consequence become considerably less numerous than
                    formerly. The climate of this island, like that of Tierra del Fuego, is
                    extremely humid and boisterous, the sky being constantly charged with vapour.
                    There are several harbours in Staten Island, but they are all, with one
                    exception, confined to its northern side.</p>
                <p>The eastern coast of Patagonia, from the entrance of the Strait of Magalhaens to
                    the river Plata, is comparatively low. From Cape Virgins, at the mouth of the
                    straits, to Port St Julian, in latitude 49. 15. 20. south, where porphyritic
                    clay-stone commences, the coast is formed of clay cliffs horizontally
                    stratified, and the country is undulating, with extensive pampas covered with
                    grass and destitute of trees, like those of Buenos Ayres, which they otherwise
                    resemble. “At Port St Julian,” says Captain King, “the country becomes hilly,
                    and continues so as far to the northward as latitude 44°, the rock being
                    porphyritic. The clay formation to the southward has been likened to the
                    appearance of the coast of Kent, and at a short distance it bears certainly a
                    very great resemblance to it; but the cliffs, instead of being chalk, are
                    composed of a soft marly clay, without any gravel or impressions of organic
                    remains, excepting at Port St Julian, where fossil shells, both bivalves and
                    univalves, are found imbedded in clay cliffs; and on the sur- .-face are lying
                    strewed about large oyster-shells.” In the clay formation there are three
                    rivers, namely, the Gallegos, in latitude 51.38.; Port Santa Cruz, in latitude
                    50. 7.; and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193492621" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2621-0118"
                    />Port St Julian. The first does not extend farther into the interior than forty
                    miles, and Port St Julian is of still smaller size. The Gallegos can only be
                    entered at high water, and here the tide rises about forty-six feet, the stream
                    being very strong. Port Santa Cruz appears to be a very considerable river. In
                    the sketch of the surveying voyages communicated to the Geographical Society by
                    Sir John Barrow, it is thus spoken of :—“In a twenty days’ excursion up the
                    river Santa Cruz, we passed through a similar country, without variety, until
                    extensive beds of lava were found overlying the whole country. We reached nearly
                    to the eastern flank of the Andes; but, for want of provisions, could go no
                    farther. The river was then, at two hundred miles from its. mouth, almost as
                    large, and quite as rapid, as at twenty miles from the sea. Perhaps it runs for
                    a great distance along the base of the Andes, and so collects a great body of
                    water; or it may run from a lake into which streams pour. Its water is not
                    muddy. The current runs six knots an hour; none of our boats could pull against
                    it anywhere. Its average width is two hundred yards, and its mean depth ten
                    feet, perhaps more.” The same writer thus speaks of the country in general: “One
                    naturally asks why Eastern Patagonia should be condemned to perpetual sterility,
                    while the western side of the same country, in the same parallel of latitude, is
                    injured by too much rain? The prevailing westerly winds and the Andes are the
                    causes. The winds bring much moisture from the Pacific, but they leave it all,
                    condensed, on the west side of the mountains. After passing the cordillera,
                    those same winds are very dry. Easterly winds are very rare upon the east coast;
                    they are the only ones which carry rain to the almost deserts of Patagonia.
                    Westward of the Andes, an east wind is dry, and free from clouds. All this
                    country is exposed to severe cold weather in winter, and to excessive heat in
                    summer. Great and sudden changes of temperature take place, when, after very hot
                    weather, cold winds rush northwards with the fury of a hurricane. Even the
                    wandering Indians avoid this region, and only cross it to get salt, or visit
                    their burying places.” We are informed by Falconer, the Jesuit missionary, that
                    after the dead have been interred twelve months, the graves are visited by the
                    tribe, for the purpose of collecting the bones, and conveying them to their
                    family sepulchres, where they are set up, and adorned with all the beads and
                    ornaments which the friends and family of the deceased are able to collect for
                    the occasion. The ceremony is performed by certain women of the tribe, whose
                    peculiar office it is to attend to these rites. ∣In corroboration of the
                    Jesuit’s testimony, Captain King informs us, that near Port Desire he had seen
                    the graves of the Indians upon the summits of hills, but without the bodies,
                    which he supposes to have in all probability been removed by the Indians. The
                    Port Desire here mentioned is situated in lat. 47. 45. south, having a narrow
                    entrance with strong tides, but affording in the offing very good anchorage, as
                    well as shelter from the prevailing winds. Not many years before Spanish
                    domination ceased in America, that government formed an establishment here; but,
                    from the dry and parched nature of the land, it completely failed. Thirty miles
                    to the northward is Cape Blanco, between which place and the Rio Negro, more
                    than four hundred miles to the north, navigation is considered as dangerous,
                    there being many extensive shoals, and strong tides. For an account of the Rio
                    Negro, the most important river of Patagonia, see the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Negro, Rio.</hi> The Colorado, which rises near Mendoza, in La
                    Plata, is also a very large stream, falling into the Atlantic in latitude 40.0.
                    nearly. It brings down a great quantity of water throughout the year, but as it
                    does not run into any of the numerous ports near its opening, it is of no use to
                    vessels as a place of shelter or anchorage.</p>
                <p>The aboriginal natives of Patagonia are a tall and extreme ly robust race of men.
                    Their bodies are bulky, and their heads and features large, but their hands and
                    feet are small. Their limbs are neither so muscular nor so large boned as their
                    height and apparent bulk would lead one to suppose; they are rounder and
                    smoother than those of white men. Their colour is a rich reddish brown, rather
                    darker than the hue of copper. Their heads are furnished with a profusion of
                    rough, lank, and coarse black hair, which is tied above the temples by a fillet
                    of plaited or twisted sinews; and they wear no other covering upon this part of
                    their body. “A large mantle,” says one of the recent voyagers, “made of skins
                    sewed together, loosely gathered about them, hanging from the shoulders to their
                    ankles, adds so much to the bulkiness of their appearance, that one ought not to
                    wonder at their having been called gigantic. I am not aware that any Patagonian
                    has appeared during late years whose height exceeded six feet and some inches;
                    but I see no reason to disbelieve the Jesuit Falkner’s account of the Casique
                    Cau-gapol, whose height, he says, was seven feet and some inches Among two
                    hundred or three hundred natives of</p>
                <p>Patagonia, scarcely half a dozen men are seen whose height is under five feet
                    nine or ten inches; the women are proportionally tall. I have nowhere seen an
                    assemblage of men and women whose <hi rend="italic">average</hi> height and <hi

                    athletic as are many of the South Sea islanders, there are also many among their
                    number who are slight and of lower stature. The Patagonians seem to be high
                    shouldered, owing perhaps to their habit of folding their arms across the chest,
                    in their mantles, and thus increasing their apparent height and bulk, because
                    the mantles hang loosely, and almost touch the ground. Until actually measured,
                    it is difficult to believe that they are not much taller than is the case.” This
                    description is so precise, and, from measurements having been made, so
                    satisfactory, that the question as to the actual size of the Patagonians may be
                    regarded as completely set at rest. Is it more improbable that there should be
                    races of men <hi rend="italic">above</hi> the European standard, than it is that
                    there should be races whose height is <hi rend="italic">below</hi> it? Yet we
                    know beyond a doubt that the Esquimaux are so.</p>
                <p>With the exception of the head, little hair grows upon their bodies; and from the
                    face it is carefully removed by shells or pincers. They do not disfigure their
                    naturally coarse features by piercing either nose or lip, but they bedaub their
                    body with white, black, or red paint, forming grotesque figures, such as circles
                    around their eyes, or great marks across their faces. This ornamental
                    bodypainting is practised by all the different races of Patagonians, from Cape
                    Hom to Buenos Ayres. On their feet and legs they wear boots made of the skins of
                    horses’ hind legs; spurs made of wood, but of iron if they can get it, balls <hi
                    rend="italic">(bolas</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi> such as are used by the
                    inhabitants of the pampas; whilst a long tapering lance, and a knife if it can
                    be procured, complete their equipment. “Mounted upon horses of a middle size,”
                    says the writer already quoted, “under fifteen hands high, and rather well bred,
                    the Patagonians seem to be carried no better than dragoons who ride eighteen
                    stone upon horses able to carry ten; yet they go at full speed, in chase of
                    ostriches or guanacoes. When hunting or making long journeys, they often change
                    horses. The women are dressed and booted like the men, with the addition of a
                    half petticot. They clean their hair, and plait it into two tails. Ornaments of
                    brass, beads, bits of coloured glass, or such trifles, are prized by them. The
                    huts of these wanderers are somewhat like gipsy tents. Poles are stuck in the
                    ground, to which others are fixed. Over them are thrown the skins of animals, an
                    irregular tilt-like hut being thus formed.” It is to be observed, that the
                    inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, and of the islands to the south and south-vest,
                    where the climate is so singularly mild, wear little or no clothing. The
                    Patagonians <pb break="no" facs="nls:193492634" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2634-0119"
                    />appear to possess nothing like towns, but lead a wandering and unsettled life,
                    somewhat resembling that of the Tartars.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Falkland</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Malouine Islands,</hi>
                    being situated off the coast of Patagonia, may, in a geographical point of view,
                    be considered as belonging to it. This group consists of two large islands and a
                    number of small ones, some of which are mere rocks, the whole being situated
                    between 50. 0. and 51. 20. of south latitude, nearly opposite the southern
                    extremity of Patagonia, which is the nearest land. The two large islands, which
                    are separated from each other by a broad channel, are called Eastern and Western
                    Falkland; the names of the others it is unnecessary to specify. East Falkland
                    Island is favourably situated, both for colonization and for the refreshment of
                    vessels bound round Cape Horn. It has other advantages, such as excellent
                    harbours, abundance of wild cattle, and antiscorbutic herbs, which point it out
                    as a desirable resort for ships. The climate is upon the whole mild, the general
                    range of the thermometer being in winter from 30° to 50°, and in summer from 50°
                    to 75°. The weather is rather unsettled; but neither rain, snow, nor hail falls
                    here in such abundance as in Southern and Western Patagonia, whilst it is free
                    from the parching dryness of the eastern coast. The soil is good, producing
                    spontaneously different kinds of vegetables; and wheat, flax, potatoes, turnips,
                    and the like, have here been very successfully cultivated; but the island is
                    destitute of trees. For fuel, peat and turf, which are abundant, are used, and
                    also two or three species of shrubs, which are found growing all over the
                    island. Herds of homed cattle, hogs, and horses, all wild, are plentiful; whilst
                    rabbits, foxes, and game, especially wild geese and ducks, are extremely
                    numerous. Fish abounds in all the bays and inlets, and those most common, when
                    salted, are thought superior to cod. Seals are found on the island, or on the
                    neighbouring rocks; and hair-seals, lions and elephants as they are called,
                    abound along the shores. Many black whales have also been caught in its
                    neighbourhood, in consequence of which the island has of late years been much
                    resorted to by fishing-vessels belonging to various nations. The Falkland
                    Islands were uninhabited when first discovered, and, with the exception of
                    occasional and transient residents, have still remained so; yet their position
                    will always render them important in the estimation of commercial nations. In
                    the year 1766 the English formed a settlement on one of them; but it was
                    destroyed in 1770 by a Spanish expedition from Buenos Ayres. Of late years
                    measures have been taken by the Argentine Republic for forming an establishment
                    here; that government laying claim to sovereignty and jurisdiction, not only
                    over the Falkland Islands, but likewise over Tierra del Fuego, Cape Hom, and the
                    islands adjacent in the Atlantic Ocean, as having succeeded to the sovereign
                    rights of Spain. This claim has been resisted; but it is unnecessary to enter
                    into the merits of what seems based on so singular an assumption. Besides, it
                    does not appear to be very material to whom they belong; the point of importance
                    is their colonization, which would be highly advantageous to vessels navigating
                    these seas.</p>
                <p>It seems highly probable that Magalhaens was the original discoverer of the
                    southern coast of Patagonia and the northern coast of Tierra del Fuego, as well
                    as of the strait which bears his name. Sir Francis Drake passed the strait in
                    the year 1578; and being driven by storms to the south, discovered the western
                    and south-western coast of Tierra del Fuego, and also Cape Horn; although the
                    honour of the discovery of the latter has generally been ascribed to Jacob Le
                    Maire, a Dutchman in the service of the states of Holland. In the year 1616,
                    this navigator was the first who doubled that terminus of South America, and
                    called it Cape Hom, after a village in Holland. Proceeding in a north-easterly
                    direction, he crossed the strait which bears his name, and discovered Staten
                    Island, which he so designated after the states of Holland. It is supposed that
                    Davies, one of the companions of Cavendish, in his voyage to the South Seas in
                    1592, was the first person who saw the Falkland Islands; but they were not,
                    properly speaking, discovered till the year 1594, when Sir Richard Hawkins
                    examined them, and called them in honour of his queen and himself, Hawkins’
                    Maiden Land. The name, however, was subsequently changed to Falkland Islands by
                    Strong, another English navigator. During the early part of the eighteenth
                    century, they were re-discovered by some French navigators; and hence the origin
                    of the French name, Malouine Islands. To Captain Cook we are indebted for the
                    first accurate account of the south-eastern coast of Tierra del Fuego, which he
                    explored in 1774; and so little was known concerning it before this period, that
                    when actually in sight of Cape Horn, he was unable to decide whether it was a
                    detached island or a part of Tierra del Fuego. Amongst the other distinguished
                    names connected with the discovery or investigation of this part of the South
                    American continent, are those of Sarmiento (whose account of a voyage down the
                    western coast, and through the Strait of Magalhaens, has never been surpassed),
                    Sir John Narborough, Cordova, Byron, Willis, Carteret, Bougainville, and Weddel.
                    To these may now be added the names of the commanders of the recent expedition,
                    Captains King, Stokes, and Fitzroy. It only remains to be noticed, that although
                    repeated attempts have been made to form permanent settlements in Patagonia, or
                    upon the neighbouring islands, particularly by die Spaniards, none of these has
                    ever succeeded. With regard to population, it must be quite obvious that no
                    accurate idea can be formed. It has, however, been estimated at 200,000, though
                    from what data we know not. By far the greatest part of the country, that which
                    stretches along the eastern side of the Andes, from their base to the Atlantic
                    Ocean, is altogether unknown, with the exception of a very few places upon the
                    coast. It is quite possible, therefore, that the inhabitants may be far more
                    numerous in this region than is supposed; but the general sterility of the
                    country holds out little prospect of any great commercial advantages to be
                    gained by intercourse with them, except in the precious metals, which are
                    doubtless to be found in the Patagonian Andes. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. r.
