                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">PHILOPOEMEN</label>, a celebrated general of the Achaean
                    league, was born in Megalopolis, a city of Arcadia, in Peloponnesus, and from
                    his very infancy discovered a strong inclination to the profession of arms.
                    Having been nobly educated by Cassander of Mantinea, a man of great probity and
                    uncommon abilities, he was no sooner able to bear arms than he entered amongst
                    the troops which the city of Megalopolis sent to make incursions into Laconia,
                    and in these inroads never failed to give some remarkable instance of his
                    prudence and valour; but when there were no troops in the field, he used to
                    employ bis leisure in hunting and other manly exercises. When Cleomenes, king of
                    Sparta, attacked Megalopolis, Philopoemen displayed equal courage and greatness
                    of soul. He also signalized himself some time afterwards in the battle of
                    Sellasia, where Antigonus gained a complete victory over Cleomenes. Antigonus,
                    who had been an eye-witness of his prudent and intrepid behaviour, endeavoured
                    to gain him over to his interest; but the patriotic Greek rejected all his
                    offers, having an utter aversion to a court life, which he compared to that of a
                    slave, conceiving a courtier to be only a slave of a better condition. As he
                    could not live idle and inactive, he proceeded to the island of Crete, which was
                    then engaged in war, and served as a volunteer, until he acquired a complete
                    knowledge of the military art; for the inhabitants of that island were in those
                    days accounted excellent warriors, and were scarcely ever at peace amongst
                    themselves. Philopoemen, having served some years with the troops of the island,
                    returned home, and upon his arrival was appointed general of the horse; a
                    command in which he behaved so well, that the Achaean cavalry, heretofore of no
                    reputation, became in a short time famous all over Greece. He was soon
                    afterwards appointed general of the Achaean forces, and applied himself to
                    re-establish military discipline amongst the troops of the republic, which he
                    found in a very low condition, and universally despised by their neighbours.
                    Aratus, indeed, was the first who raised the Achaean state to that pitch of
                    power and glory to which it attained; but the success of his enterprise was not
                    so much owing to his courage and intrepidity as to his prudence and politics. As
                    he depended on the friendship of foreign princes, and their powerful succours,
                    he neglected military discipline at home; but the instant Philopoemen was
                    appointed commandcr-in-chief, he roused the courage of his countrymen, and
                    laboured to put them into a condition to defend themselves without the
                    assistance of foreign allies. With this view he made <hi rend="italic"
                    >great</hi> improvements in the Achaean discipline, changing the manner of their
                    exercise, as well as their arms, which were both very defective. For the space
                    of eight months he had exercised his troops every day, making them perform every
                    movement and evolution, and accustoming them to manage with dexterity their
                    arms, when news reached him that Machanidas was advancing, at the head of a
                    numerous army, to invade Achaia. He was glad of this opportunity to try how the
                    troops had profited by his discipline; and accordingly, taking the field, he met
                    the enemy in the territories of Mantinea, where a decisive battle was fought, in
                    which the Achaeans were completely victorious. On this occasion the
                    Lacedaemonians lost above 8000 men, of whom 4000 were killed on the spot, and as
                    many taken prisoners. The loss of the Achaeans was very inconsiderable, and
                    those who fell were mostly mercenaries. This happened about the year before
                    Christ 204.</p>
                <p>But what most contributed to raise the fame and the reputation of Philopoemen,
                    was his uniting the powerful city of Lacedaemon to the Achaean commonwealth, by
                    which means the Achaeans were enabled to eclipse all the other states of Greece.
                    In this transaction, which happened in the year 191, we cannot help noticing one
                    circumstance, which, in our opinion, reflects greater lustre on Philopoemen than
                    all his warlike exploits. The Lacedaemonians, overjoyed to find themselves
                    delivered from the oppressions under which they had long groaned, ordered the
                    palace and furniture of Nabis to be sold, and the sum thence accruing, to the
                    amount of 120 talents, to be presented to Philopoemen, as a token of their
                    gratitude; and deputies were appointed to carry the money, and desire
                    Philopoemen, in the name of the senate, to accept of the present. But so great
                    was the opinion which the Spartans entertained of his probity and
                    disinterestedness, that no one could be found who would undertake to offer the
                    present; and, struck with veneration and the fear of displeasing him, they all
                    begged to be excused. At last, by a public decree, they obliged one Timolaus,
                    who had formerly been his guest, to repair to Megalopolis, where Philopoemen
                    then lived, and offer him this testimony of their regard. Timolaus, with great
                    reluctance, set out for Megalopolis, where he was kindly received and
                    entertained by Philopoemen. Here he had an opportunity of observing the
                    strictness of his conduct, the greatness <pb break="no" facs="nls:193496612"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-6612-0425"/>of his mind, the frugality of his life, and the
                    regularity of his manners; all which struck him with such awc, that he durst not
                    once mention the present he had come to offer, and, alleging some other pretence
                    for his journey, he returned home with the money. The Lacedaemonians sent him
                    again; but still he could not prevail on himself to mention the true cause of
                    his journey. At last, being sent a third time, he ventured, with reluctance, to
                    apprise Philopoemen of the offer he had to make in the name of the
                    Lacedaemonians. Philopoemen heard him with great calmness; but the instant he
                    had finished, the general set out with him for Sparta, where, after
                    acknowledging his obligation to the Spartans, he advised them to lay out their
                    money in reforming or purchasing those miscreants who divided the citizens, and
                    set them at variance by means of their seditious discourses, that, being paid
                    for their silence, they might not occasion so many distractions in the
                    government. “It is much more advisable,” said he, “to stop an enemy’s mouth than
                    a friend’s; as for me, I shall always be your friend, and you shall reap the
                    benefit of my friendship without expense.”</p>
                <p>About two years afterwards, the city of Messene withdrew itself from the Achaean
                    league. Philopoemen attacked them, but was wounded, taken prisoner, and poisoned
                    by the magistrates; and thus died one of the greatest heroes whom Greece or any
                    other country had ever produced. He was no way inferior in valour, military
                    knowledge, and virtue, to any of the boasted heroes of Rome. Had Achaia been
                    nearer to an equality with Rome, he would have preserved his country from the
                    yoke which the Roman republic imposed upon it. Both the Greek and Roman writers
                    place him on a level with Hannibal and Scipio, who were his contemporaries, and
                    died the same year. They allow him to have been not only one of the greatest
                    commanders, but also one of the greatest statesmen, of his age. To his valour
                    and prudence Achaia owed her glory, which upon his death began to decline; for
                    after him there was none in that republic capable of opposing her enemies with
                    the same steadiness and prudence. Philopoemen was therefore called the last of
                    the Greeks, as Brutus was afterwards styled the last of the Romans. See the
