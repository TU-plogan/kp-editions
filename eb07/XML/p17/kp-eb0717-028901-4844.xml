                <p><label type="entry">PERTHSHIRE</label>, one of the most extensive and beautiful
                    counties in Scotland, being very compact and almost circular in form, is
                    situated nearly in the centre of the kingdom. Its extreme length from east to
                    west is about seventy-seven miles, and its greatest breadth from north to south
                    is about sixty-eight miles. Its area has been variously estimated; but the
                    nearest approximation to accuracy gives 2588 square miles of land and more than
                    fifty of water. Of the 1,656,320 acres forming its superficial contents, from
                    500,000 to 600,000 are, according to the most recent statements, under
                    cultivation; as many more are still uncultivated, though capable in part of
                    tillage; and the remainder is almost wholly barren and unproductive. On the east
                    Perthshire is bounded by the counties of Forfar, Fife, and Kinross; on the
                    north, by Inverness and Aberdeen; on the south, by Stirling and Clackmannan; and
                    on the west, by the shires of Argyle and Dumbarton. Its ancient and still
                    popularly known divisions are Monteith, Athole, Stratheam, Breadalbane, Rannoch,
                    Stormont, Perth proper, and Gowrie, to which some add Bal-quhidder and
                    Glenorchy. It is under the jurisdiction of a sheriff and two substitutes, one of
                    whom resides at Perth, and the other at Dumblane. There are within its
                    boundaries seventy-eight parishes, or portions of parishes, some of them running
                    into other adjacent counties.</p>
                <p>Perthshire is distinguished amongst the counties of Scotland for the rich,
                    varied, and picturesque beauty of its surface. From the commanding range of the
                    Grampians, and numerous other secondary elevations, the country slopes gently
                    down into extensive tracts of rich and fertile land, •beautifully diversified,
                    and adorned with wood and water, hill and dale, in every possible combination.
                    Where the elevated ranges gradually disappear in the champaign country, nothing
                    can exceed the rich and undulating character of the scenery, broken into noble
                    and irregular valleys, or spreading out into extensive alluvial tracts, watered
                    by streams of almost every size and character. The county of Perth is now
                    generally divided into the highland and lowland divisions, the surface of the
                    former being far more extensive than that of the latter. The fertile or lowland
                    districts are chiefly, but by no means entirely, situated towards the eastern
                    and the southern boundaries of the county. The fine valley of Stratheam, having
                    the Grampian range on the north-west, with the Ochils and Sidlaw hills on the
                    east, traverses it from north-east to south-west, and, including certain
                    portions of the contiguous valleys of the Tay and the Almond, forms one of the
                    richest and most extensive tracts in the kingdom. Besides the extensive valley
                    of Strathearn, there are others of considerable dimensions, studded with lakes,
                    and enlivened with streams of every variety of character. Such are those of the
                    Tay, the Isla, and the' Almond, and the valley of the Tummel, with its clear,
                    soft, and beautiful lake, richly fringed on the margin with wood of various
                    kinds, rising boldly up on the south, into the steep ridges of Schehallion and
                    Faragon. Glenlyen and the val ley of the Brann are not less rich and beautiful;
                    and there are many others scarcely inferior to these in size and picturesque
                    variety of scenery.</p>
                <p>Perthshire is distinguished for its noble ranges of mountains, as well as for the
                    great elevation to which some of them attain. The highest is Benlawers, 4015
                    feet: Benmore is 3903; Cairn Gower, 3690; and Schehallion, 3564. This last
                    mountain is distinguished by its fine conoidal outline, as well as for being the
                    spot selected by Dr Maskelyne fçr making his experiments to-determine the
                    density of the earth. Benledi rises to the height of 3550 feet; Ben Ard-lanach
                    to that of 3500; and Ben Venu to that of 3000; besides many others of
                    considerable though inferior altitude. The principal lake is Loch Tay, fifteen
                    miles in length, and about two at its greatest breadth. The outline of this fine
                    lake is somewhat deficient in beauty, from the nearly straight and rigid
                    character of its shores, particularly on the north side. At Killin and Taymouth,
                    however, the scenery is varied and noble, presenting ample materials to the
                    pencil of the artist. Loch Ericht is about sixteen miles in length, but half of
                    it is included in the county of Inverness. The country around it is bare, wild,
                    and devoid of interest. Loch Rannoch, which is nearly twelve miles in length
                    from east to west, exhibits greater variety of outline, and its banks are
                    agreeably diversified with old birches, the remnants of the once extensive
                    forest of Rannoch. The finest view of Schehallion is obtained from the northern
                    bank of this lake, at a point about four miles above Kinloch Rannoch. Viewed
                    from the spot in question, the mountain presents a figure nearly conical,
                    appearing to rise out of the lower extremity of the loch, and show ing, in
                    contrast with the water, one of the most magnificent natural objects to be seen
                    in this or in any other country. Loch Earn, about six or seven miles in length,
                    is a beautiful lake, with a richly-wooded, and in many places a
                    highly-cultivated, but narrow strip of margin, from which the hills ascend
                    rapidly and steeply. On the south-west there is the noble chain of lakes, Loch
                    Ketterin, Loch Achray, and Loch Vennachar, which discharge their waters into the
                    Forth. The scenery of these lakes is so well known as the locality of Sir Walter
                    Scott’s poetical romance, the Lady of the Lake, that it is unnecessary to
                    describe its peculiar features. They are of the most varied and striking kind,
                    such indeed as require to be seen in order to be fully appreciated; and the
                    pencil rather than the pen must be employed to convey to those who have not
                    beheld them a just conception of their mingled beauty, wildness, and
                    magnificence. Divided from these by a ridge of elevated hills, we find Loch Ard,
                    Upper and Lower, and Loch Con, from which the Forth takes his rise. The
                    well-known lake of Monteith is in the vicinity of the latter. There are many
                    other lakes, such as Loch Tummel, Loch Garry, Loch Voíl, and Loch Lubnaig, all
                    of some extent, and some of them rich in picturesque beauty of situation and
                    outline. In the eastern quarter of the county is to be found another chain of
                    lakes extending from near Dunkeld towards Blairgowrie, which are less known than
                    they deserve to be. These are the three lochs of the Lowes, Marly, and Clunie.
                    An old mansion on the loch of Chmie is said to have been the birthplace of the
                    admirable Crichton.</p>
                <p>The rivers of Perthshire are, the Tay, the largest stream in Scotland, with a
                    course about ninety miles in length; the Isla, with its tributary the Ericht;
                    and the Earn. The Tay and the Earn belong exclusively to this county, their
                    entire course being confined to it; the Isla in the early part of its course
                    sweeps through the western part of Forfarshire. The Tay is considered to
                    discharge more water into the sea than any other river in Great Britain; the
                    basin which it drains not only being very extensive in itself, and the seat of
                    elevated mountain ranges, but abounding in streams of considerable magnitude,
                    the principal of which it absorbs in its progress towards the German Ocean. Of
                    those minor streams, which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193494857"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-4857-0290"/>augment the volume of the Tay, the chief are the
                    Lyon, the Almond, the Isla, the Brann, the Garry, and the Tummel. Throughout a
                    considerable part of its course the scenery on the banks of the Tay is of the
                    grandest and most impressive character; particularly in the upper part of its
                    course, from Loch Tay, through the strath which takes its name from the river,
                    to the pass of Bimam, where its banks become more level, and the country around
                    assumes a softer character. But what is lost in boldness and grandeur is fully
                    compensated by the rich and varied beauties of a wooded and cultivated soil,
                    enriched with noble seats and stately mansions. The Earn passes through a rich
                    and picturesque country; in some places bold and alpine in its character, and in
                    others abounding in the mellow beauties of cultivation. On its banks, not far
                    from its confluence with the Frith of Tay, stands the village of Pitcaithley,
                    celebrated for its mineral waters, and now a favourite resort of fashionable
                    valetudinarians. The Tummel is one of the finest rivers in Scotland, and is
                    especially rich in wild and romantic scenery, from its source in Loch Rannoch,
                    to its confluence with the Tay, immediately below the village of Logierait. The
                    Earn and the Lyon, the Almond, the Brann, and the Airdle, besides other smaller
                    streams, we can only afford to notice generally. They all partake more or less
                    of the character <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the fine districts which they
                    traverse; imparting life and animation to many a mountain solitude, besides
                    draining and watering extensive tracts of country.</p>
                <p>Of the temperature of a region differing so much in exposure and elevation,
                    nothing certain can safely be affirmed. In the upper and more elevated
                    districts, where the mountain ranges slope down into the level country, and
                    amongst the numerous glens which penetrate these in all directions, the climate
                    is charged with moisture in a higher degree, the winters are longer and more
                    severe, the snow frequently lies longer on the ground, and the spring is
                    generally later than in the lower districts of the county. The highest summer
                    temperature rarely exceeds sixty-five degrees, and the mean temperature, in
                    three different situations in the county (none of them, however, more than 150
                    feet above the sea), has been found to be forty-seven degrees. The cloudy
                    character of the atmosphere in the mountainous districts, by excluding the light
                    of the sun, retards the ripening of the crops, and accumulates moisture, which
                    tends to lower the average temperature. The district of Perth proper is said to
                    be the least humid, the average water being only twenty-three inches; but in the
                    Carse of Gowrie, on the shores of the Frith of Tay, the mean quantity of rain
                    for twelve years was twenty-four inches and a half; at Perth, for a period of
                    sixteen years, it was 26∙95 inches; and at Belmont, in Strathmore, for thirty
                    years, it was as high as 30∙40 inches. The extensive drainage, executed of late
                    years by various proprietors, has no doubt tended considerably to ameliorate the
                    climate.</p>
                <p>As far as is yet known, the minerals of Perthshire, in a commercial or economical
                    point of view, are of no great public importance. Abundance of coal is to be
                    found at Culross on the Forth, where it has long been wrought; but the situation
                    renders it of no use to the inland and higher districts. Limestone is plentiful,
                    and is wrought in considerable quantities; but for want of proper fuel it is not
                    so generally used as it would be, peat, the only fuel in the upper districts,
                    not being strong enough for the purpose of calcination. Lord Willoughby d’Eresby
                    and Sir Niel Menzies have, however, lately devoted their attention to the
                    compression of peat; and the results which they have obtained encourage the hope
                    that that species of fuel may yet be rendered available to the improvement of
                    the barren districts in which it abounds. Marble of a pretty good quality is
                    found in Glentilt, and is now becoming an article of some importance in
                    commerce. Slate is wrought in various places, particularly in the neighbourhood
                    of Dunkeld; ironstone is found on the Devon, where it supplies the extensive
                    ironworks established there; and copper and lead mines are said to have been at
                    one time in operation, but have long since been abandoned. On the east side of
                    the county shell-marl is plentiful, and is freely used as a manure. In the
                    higher districts the general basis is granite, but in the lower sandstone
                    prevails. The sandstone, which is of the primitive kind, stretches from the
                    valley of Strathmore to the neighbourhood of Callander, with a dip varying from
                    15° to 25° towards the north-west. It seems to have received this position from
                    the action of the central force which elevated the range of trap hills
                    traversing the island from Montrose to Dumbarton.</p>
                <p>In a county of so great extent, and possessing such a variety of surface,
                    considerable diversity must exist in the character of the soil. The carse or
                    alluvial lands on the shores of the Frith of Tay have long been celebrated for
                    their fertility. They are considered as the joint produce of river and sea
                    deposition for a series of ages. The general character of the soil is that of a
                    rich clay, very deep, in some places alternating with layers of peat, and having
                    sand and marine deposits at the bottom. This soil is not wholly alluvial, being
                    sometimes mixed with the debris of trap-rocks, and also of the sandstone, which,
                    as already mentioned, forms a geological characteristic of the lowland districts
                    of Perthshire. Considerable tracts of this inferior description of alluvial soil
                    are found accompanying the courses of the principal rivers, and extend into the
                    upper portions of Strath-Tay, Strath-Airdle, and Strath-Tummel. A soil composed
                    of clay and sand, and called by agriculturists a <hi rend="italic">till,</hi>
                    extends along a vast tract of this county from east to west, and is supposed to
                    be formed from the red sandstone prevalent in that district. Peat is to be met
                    with almost everywhere in Perthshire; that known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Moss Flanders</hi> is said to extend over ten thousand acres, and
                    is amongst the largest continuous tracts of this description in the united
                    kingdom.</p>
                <p>In the arable districts of this county, such as the Carse of Gowrie, and the
                    fertile lands skirting part of the course of its principal rivers, the modes of
                    agriculture and management of farms are much the same as in the other
                    agricultural counties of Scotland. But of late years a spirit of improvement has
                    been introduced, which has been much felt in this county, chiefly in the upper
                    districts, where the old “runrig” system long kept its ground tenaciously,-under
                    the modified form of joint farms. The arable farms vary in extent from fifty to
                    five hundred acres, and upwards; and in the Carse of Gowrie the rents are as
                    high as in any part of the kingdom. Wheat is raised on the best soils, and has
                    been attempted, not unsuccessfully, as high up in the county as Dunkeld. In the
                    wheat-growing soils this crop usually alternates with beans and peas, barley,
                    hay, and oats. Flax is more extensively raised in Perthshire than in any other
                    part of Scotland, arising most probably from its being the raw material of the
                    indigenous manufacture of the county. Potatoes and turnips are extensively
                    cultivated, and of late years on the most improved methods. The pasture-farms in
                    the higher parts of the county are large, and raise great numbers of sheep,
                    chiefly of the black-faced kind. Other descriptions of live stock are not so
                    much cultivated. Dairy farming does not form a prominent feature in the rural
                    economy of this county. In some favoured spots orchards succeed well, many of
                    them are very large, and their produce is highly celebrated. Perthshire is
                    remarkable for the great extent and beauty of its woods. Of these, many are of
                    natural wood, chiefly oak. But extensive plantations of various kinds of trees
                    have been made during the last fifty years by several proprietors, especially by
                    the late Duke of Atholl, whose planting operations have been carried on upon the
                    most extensive scale, at once beautifying and enriching one of the finest parts
                    of the county. To him Perthshire is indebted for the introduction of the larch,
                    which has been <pb break="no" facs="nls:193494870" xml:id="kp-eb0717-4870-0291"
                    />found singularly adapted to the climate and soil. The plantations of this tree
                    have thriven amazingly, and are of great extent and value. Larch has been used
                    in ship-building, instead of oak; but their relative value for such a purpose is
                    not yet fully ascertained. In 1674 the valued rental of Perthshire was L.339,892
                    Scots; and in 1815 the annual value of assessed property amounted to L.555,552
                    sterling.</p>
                <p>This county is particularly rich in splendid seats and mansions belonging to the
                    great proprietors. Of these, the most remarkable are Dunira, Taymouth Castle,
                    Dunkeld House, the Palace of Scone, Kinfauns Castle, Murthly House, Dupplin
                    Castle, and Blair Castle. Castle Huntly and Blair Castle are fine specimens of
                    the old baronial and castellated habitations of the ancient lords of the soil;
                    and Doune Castle is considered as one of the finest ruins of its kind in
                    Scotland. Perthshire is not remarkable for antiquities, secular or
                    ecclesiastical. Druidical circles and Roman remains are found in various places.
                    Of the former, one circle almost entire, called by the country people Standing
                    Stanes, formerly existed at Craigmakerran, the property, we believe, of the
                    guildry of Perth; but about twenty-five years ago it was barbarously destroyed,
                    and the stones blasted for the purpose of being employed in the erection of a
                    farm-steading. Before this act of Vandalism was committed, the circle in
                    question, which stood on a projecting crag, about six miles from Perth, on the
                    Isla road, was perhaps one of the most perfect of the kind in the kingdom. Of
                    the latter, the camp or station at Ardoch, and that at Comrie, are well known,
                    as well as the Roman road, which seems to have connected them. There is another
                    at Delvin, which is scarcely less remarkable. The ruins of the cathedrals of
                    Dunblane and Dunkeld are also in excellent preservation, though the architecture
                    is by no means of the highest order. The tower of Abernethy, which has long
                    puzzled the heads of antiquaries, is unfortunately decaying rapidly, as is also
                    the fine old abbey of Culross.</p>
                <p>Red deer are still numerous in Perthshire, and impart a feature of peculiar
                    interest to its forest scenery. The deer-forest of Athole is said to contain
                    80,000 acres; and the number of the deer in the whole county is estimated at
                    6000, of which about 100 are annually killed. Harts are destroyed in the months
                    of August and September, and hinds in January, the last month of the season.
                    From several of the large proprietors having combined to preserve the deer, it
                    is considered that their number must be greatly upon the increase. Feathered
                    game of every description abounds in the upland district of Perthshire, and
                    affords a rich treat to die sportsman. Many of the moors are let to sportsmen,
                    and bring large sums annually. Salmon is amazingly plentiful, especially in the
                    Tay, and is also found in the tributaries of that river. The fisheries on the
                    Tay alone are understood to bring a rental of L.10,000 a year, and those on the
                    Earn are likewise said to be productive. The export of salmon forms a
                    considerable article of commerce, as is mentioned in the account of Perth.</p>
                <p>The principal towns are Perth and Culross, which are royal burghs; Crieff,
                    Callander, Kincardine, Doune, Comrie, Dunblane, Auchterarder, Dunkeld, and
                    Blairgowrie. Of the latter class, the largest is Crieff, the population of which
                    in 1831 amounted to nearly 5000. It is a chief seat of the linen manufacture,
                    which is also the principal occupation of Blairgowrie and Auchterarder, with a
                    population of about 8000 each. None of the other towns is very remarkable, if we
                    except Comrie, which is celebrated for the frequency of earthquakes in its
                    neighbourhood; Dunblane, for its mineral waters; and Doune, once a great
                    Highland mart, for its manufactory of pistols. The villages are numerous, and
                    many of them populous and thriving; but it is unnecessary to particularize them.
                    The greater part of Coupar Angus is included in the county of Perth.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of linen, as already mentioned, is the staple manufacture of
                    Perthshire; but cotton goods are also produced to a considerable extent. Mills
                    for spinning flax, bleachfields, and calico-printfields, are numerous; and there
                    are some large establishments for spinning cotton-yarn at Stanley near Perth,
                    and at Danston. Paper is likewise manufactured to a considerable extent; and
                    oil-mills are to be found in various places. A great many shoes are made in
                    Perth, and the tanning of leather is carried on to a considerable extent at
                    Crieff and at Thornhill. Of agricultural produce, large quantities of sheep and
                    black cattle from the upper districts are brought to the country markets and
                    sold there. Wool is likewise an article of considerable sale. From the more
                    fertile districts large quantities of grain are annually brought to market. Bark
                    and timber, principally larch and oak, also form commercial articles of no small
                    importance. The produce of its fisheries has already been noticed as being
                    amongst the list of exports. Limestone, slate, freestone, marl, and marble, from
                    the fine quarries of Glentilt, are also brought to market, although, from the
                    difficulty of transport, to a much less extent than they would otherwise be
                    done.</p>
                <p>In a word, the leading characteristics of this noble county are the variety and
                    diversity of its scenery and productions, and the picturesque manner in which
                    these are frequently grouped together. Fertility and barrenness, the wildest
                    alpine magnificence, and the most delicious scenes upon which the eye of the
                    lover of natural beauty could desire to rest; the rugged mountain towering in
                    rude majesty, and the sweet glen enlivened with sunshine or curtained with mist;
                    the rich alluvial plains of England contrasting with the glories of Switzerland
                    in a more softened and subdued form; these are the general and prominent
                    features by which it is distinguished. To the tourist it presents attractions of
                    almost every kind. It is a sort of shifting diorama, in which new scenes
                    remarkable for new beauties continually present themselves to his view, leaving
                    upon his mind the impression that the· last is, in some respects, the finest he
                    has yet beheld. To the sportsman it opens a boundless field of amusement in its
                    beautiful streams and its extensive moors, where the grouse, undeterred by the
                    deadly hostility of man, renew their race but only to invite renewed
                    destruction. In this county the naturalist has still much to explore; and after
                    all the labours of Lord Webb Seymour, Professor Playfair, and some others,
                    Glentilt alone would occupy a generation of mineralogists and geologists. In a
                    word, this county, rich in every kind of natural beauty, and possessing many
                    localities which have a deep historical interest attached to them, is not
                    undeserving of the preeminence which has, by universal consent, been assigned to
                    it, and merits a far larger share of attention than in the present article we
                    have been able to bestow upon it.</p>
                <p>The population of the county of Perth, in 1831, amounted to 142,894 persons,
                    being an increase since 1821 of only 3844. The number of families was 31,749,
                    and that of inhabited houses 23,809. Of the relative numbers employed in trade
                    and agriculture we have no recent returns. The county sends a member to
                    parliament, as does also Perth, the principal city. Culross, Queensferry,
                    Dunfermline, Inverkeithing, and Stirling, unite in returning a third. The only
                    change affecting this county made by the reform act, was enfranchising the city
                    of Perth, which previously had only a fraction of a representative.</p>
