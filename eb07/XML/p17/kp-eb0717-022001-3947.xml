                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">PENNANT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated naturalist, was born in Flintshire, about the year 1726. His family
                    had their residence in that country for several hundred years; and he himself
                    informs us that he acquired the rudiments of his education at Wrexham, whence he
                    was sent to Fulham. Not long after this he went to the university of Oxford,
                    where his progress in classical knowledge was very considerable, after which he
                    turned his attention to the study of jurisprudence; but it is nowhere said that
                    he ever followed the law as a profession.</p>
                <p>We are informed that his taste for natural history, by his knowledge of which he
                    afterwards became so conspicuous, was first excited by the perusal of
                    Willughby’s Ornithology, a copy of which had been sent him in a present. He
                    began his travels at home, which was certainly the most proper step, to acquire
                    a knowledge of the manners, curiosities, and productions of his native country,
                    before he attempted to delineate those of any other nation. He then visited the
                    Continent, where he acquired additional knowledge respecting his most favourite,
                    studies, and became acquainted with some of the most celebrated literary
                    characters which that period produced. When he returned home he married, and had
                    two children; but he was thirty-seven years of age before he gained possession
                    of the family estate, after which he took up his residence at Downing.</p>
                <p>On the death of his wife he again set out for the Continent, where he became
                    acquainted with Voltaire, Buffon, Pallas, and other eminent characters. Being an
                    author as early as the year 1750, when only twenty-four years of age, he had
                    acquired a considerable degree of reputation in that capacity by the time he
                    became acquainted with the above-mentioned philosophers. His reputation as a
                    naturalist was established by his British Zoology, in four volumes 4to; and
                    still further increased by his epistolary correspondence with no less a
                    personage than Linnaeus. He undertook a tour to Cornwall at an early period of
                    life, and also felt an irresistible propensity to survey the works of nature in
                    the northern parts of the kingdom. For this purpose he set out for Scotland in
                    1771, and published an amusing account of his tour, in three volumes 4to, which
                    was destined to receive such a share of public favour as to pass through several
                    editions. His Welsh tour was published in 1778, and his journey from Chester to
                    London in 1782, in one volume 4to. About the year 1784 appeared his Arctic
                    Zoology, a work which was very much esteemed, both in his own and in many other
                    countries. He also gave the world a natural history of the parishes of Holywell
                    and Downing, within the latter of which he had resided during more than fifty
                    years. Not long before his death appeared his View of Hindustan, in two volumes
                    4to, to undertake which, it seems, he had solicitations from private friends, as
                    well as the wishes of persons entirely unknown to him, which were expressed in
                    the public prints. This was unquestionably a very bold attempt in a man who was
                    turned off seventy, a period at which the faculties of the mind must certainly
                    be impaired, especially when exerted with vigour for such a number of years
                    before. Notwithstanding his great age, however, the work is executed in an able
                    manner, bearing a strong resemblance to the introduction of his Arctic
                    Zoology.</p>
                <p>He also published a letter on the earthquake which was felt at Downing in
                    Flintshire, in the year 1753; another which was inserted in the Philosophical
                    Transactions in 1756; his Synopsis of Quadrupeds in 1771; a pamphlet on the
                    militia; a paper on the turkey, and a volume of miscellanies.</p>
                <p>Pennant was enabled to exhibit the greatest hospitality at his table, in
                    consequence of the ample fortune which had been left him at his father’s
                    decease; and he gave the profits arising from the sale of several publications
                    to charitable endowments. By his generous patronage a number of engravers met
                    with great encouragement, and he contributed not a little to the promotion of
                    the fine arts. About the age of fifty he married for the second time, a Miss
                    Mostyn, sister of his neighbour, the late Sir Roger Mostyn of Flintshire. The
                    concluding part of his life was cheerful, and it may be affirmed that he
                    scarcely felt the advances of old age. He died at his seat at Downing in 1798,
                    in the seventy-second year of his age.</p>
                <p>Pennant inherited from nature a strong and vigorous constitution; his countenance
                    was open and intelligent; his disposition was active and cheerful; and his
                    vivacity, both in writing and conversation, made him perpetually entertaining.
                    His heart was kind and benevolent, and in the relations of domestic life his
                    conduct was highly worthy of imitation. The distresses in which his poor
                    neighbours were at any time involved gave him unfeigned uneasiness, and he
                    endeavoured to relieve them by every means in his power. He was possessed of
                    candour, and free from common prejudices, a truth fully evinced in all his
                    publications. The people of Scotland were proud to confess that he was the first
                    English traveller who had fairly represented their country, in its favourable as
                    well as in its less pleasing appearances. His style is lively, and fitted to
                    convey the ideas which he intended to express, but it is not always correct. In
                    zoology his arrangement is judicious, and his descriptions characteristic. If we
                    discover several traces of vanity in those works which he published near the
                    close of life, it ought to be remembered that it is the vanity of an old man,
                    which is seldom disagreeable, especially when united with amiable manners and a
                    benevolent disposition.</p>
