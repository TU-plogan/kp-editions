                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    of some kind seem to be absolutely necessary, and to none more than to the man
                    of study; for the most vigorous mind cannot bear to be always kept on the
                    stretch. The sports, amusements, pleasures, and recreations, of our ancestors,
                    as described by Fitz-Stephen,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Otherwise called William Stephanides, a monk of Canterbury,
                    who lived in the reigns of Stephen and Richard I. He wrote a Latin treatise, in
                    which he gives an account of the several pastimes which were countenanced in his
                    time. Bale, in his writings, draws a pleasing portrait of this person; and he is
                    likewise sketched with much commendation by Leland. “The time which other people
                    usually misemployed in an idle and frivolous manner,” says Bale, “he consecrated
                    to inquiries which tended to increase the fame and dignity of his country; in
                    doing which, he was not unworthy of being compared to Plato, for, like him, he
                    made the study of men and heaven his constant exercise.”</p></note> added
                    strength and agility to the wheels of state mechanism, whilst they had a direct
                    tendency towards utility. Most of these ancient recreations are resolvable into
                    the public defence of the state against the attacks of a foreign enemy. The play
                    at ball, derived from the Romans, was first introduced by this author as the
                    common exercise of every school-boy. The performance was in a field, whither the
                    most substantial and considerable citizens resorted to give encouragement and
                    countenance to this feat of agility. The intention of the amusement at this
                    period of time was to render the juvenile race active, nimble, and vigorous;
                    qualities which were requisite whenever their assistance should be wanted for
                    the protection of their country. The next species of pastime indeed does not
                    appear to have had this tendency; but it was only, as it should seem, an annual
                    custom. This was cock-fighting. The author informs us, that in the afternoon of
                    Shrove-Tuesday, upon which day this custom prevailed, they concluded it by
                    throwing the ball; which seems to insinuate that cock-fighting was merely in
                    conformity to ancient usage, and limited only to part of the day, in order to
                    make way for a more laudable performance. We may reasonably, suppose, although
                    our author is entirely silent upon this head, that whilst cock-fighting was
                    going on, cockthrowing was the sport of the lowest class of people, who could
                    not afford the expense of the former. Another spe-» cies of manly exercise was
                    truly martial, and intended to qualify the adventurers for military discipline.
                    “Every Friday in Lent,” says Fitz-Stephen, “a company of young men comes into
                    the field on horseback, attended and conducted by the best horsemen; then march
                    forth the sons of the citizens, and other young men, with disarmed lances and
                    shields, and there practise feats of war. Many courtiers likewise, when the king
                    is near the spot, and attendants upon noblemen, do repair to these exercises;
                    and while the hope of victory does inflame their minds, they show by <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193492556" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2556-0113"/> good proof how
                    serviceable they would be in martial affairs.” This is evidently of Roman
                    descent, and immediately brings to our recollection the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ludus</hi><hi rend="italic">Trojae,</hi> supposed to be the invention, as it
                    was the common exercise, of Ascanius. The common people, in this age of
                    masculine manners, made every amusement where strength was exerted the
                    subjectmatter of instruction and improvement. They were taught to exert their
                    bodily strength in the maintenance of their country’s rights; and their minds
                    were also improved by such exertion, being formed to every manly and generous
                    principle.</p>
                <p>In the intervals of industry and labour, commonly called the holidays, indolence
                    and inactivity, which at this day prevail, were found only in those whose lives
                    were distempered with age or infirmity. The view which Fitz-Stephen gives us of
                    the Easter holidays is animated. “In Easter holydays they fight battles upon the
                    water. A shield is hanged upon a pole fixed in the middle of the stream. A boat
                    is prepared without oars, to be borne along by the violence of the water; and in
                    the forepart thereof standeth a young man, ready to give charge upon the shield
                    with his lance. If so be that he break his lance against the shield, and doth
                    not fall, he is thought to have performed a worthy deed. If without breaking his
                    lance he runs strongly against the shield, down he falleth into the water; for
                    the boat is violently forced with the tide; but on each side of the shield ride
                    two boats, furnished with young men, who recover him who falleth as soon as they
                    may. In the holydays all the summer the youths are exercised in leaping,
                    dancing, shooting, wrestling, casting the stone, and practising their shields;
                    and the maidens trip with their timbrels, and dance as long as they can well
                    see. In winter, every holyday before dinner, the boars prepared for brawn are
                    set to fight, or else bulls or bears are baited.”</p>
                <p>These were the recreative pursuits to which our sturdy forefathers devoted their
                    leisure, as far back as the year 1130. Their immediate successors breathed the
                    same generous spirit. In the year 1222, being the sixth year of Henry III., we
                    find, that certain masters in exercises of this kind made a public profession of
                    their instructions and discipline, which they imparted to those who were
                    desirous of attaining excellence and victory in these honourable achievements.
                    About this period, persons of better rank and family introduced the play of <hi
                    rend="italic">tennis,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The word <hi rend="italic">tennis</hi> seems to owe its origin to the French
                    language; and if so, the game is probably of French invention. Yet the word <hi
                    rend="italic">tenez</hi> will hardly afford incontrovertible evidence upon this
                    subject. For the holding or keeping possession of the ball is no part of the
                    game, but rather a circumstance casually attending it; since, during the
                    performance of it, the ball is in continual motion, so that there can be no <hi
                    rend="italic">tenez</hi> at this juncture. Perhaps some town in France called
                    <hi rend="italic">Τennois</hi> may have been the place where the balls were
                    first made, and the game first introduced.</p></note> and erected courts or
                    oblong edifices for the performance of the exercise.</p>
                <p>About the year 1253, that is, in the 38th year of Henry III. the <hi
                    rend="italic">quintan</hi> was a sport much in fashion in almost every part of
                    the kingdom. This contrivance consisted of an upright post firmly fixed in the
                    ground, and having upon the top of it a cross piece of wood, moveable upon a
                    spindle, one end of which was broad like the flat part of a halbert, whilst at
                    the other end was hung a bag of sand. The exercise was performed on horseback.
                    The masterly performance was, when, upon the broad part being struck with a
                    lance, which sometimes broke it, the assailant rode swiftly on, so as to avoid
                    being struck on the back by the bag of sand, which turned round instantly upon
                    the stroke being given, with a very swift motion. He who executed this feat in
                    the most dexterous manner was declared victor, and the prize to which he became
                    entitled was a peacock. But if, upon the aim being taken, the competitor
                    miscarried in striking at the broadside, his want of skill became the ridicule
                    and contempt of the spectators.</p>
                <p>Dr Plott, in his Natural History of Oxfordshire, tells us that this pastime was
                    in practice in his time at Deddington, in that county. “They first,” says he,
                    “fixed a post perpendicularly in the ground, and then placed a small piece of
                    timber upon the top of it, fastened on a spindle, with a board nailed to it on
                    one end, and a bag of sand hanging at the other. Against this board they
                    anciently rode with spears. Now as I saw it at Deddington only with strong
                    staves, which violently bringing about the bag of sand, if they make not good
                    speed away, it strikes them on the neck or shoulders, and sometimes perhaps
                    strikes them down from their horses; the great design of the sport being to try
                    the agility both of man and horse, and to break the board; which, whoever did,
                    was accounted conqueror; for whom heretofore there was some reward always
                    appointed.”</p>
                <p>These feats of honourable contest were succeeded by the gilded banners of
                    exhibition, and all the long train of dependents in the interest of indolence.
                    For the writers of these times inform us, that the soft pleasures of the stage
                    forced the passes to public favour in the year 1391, and likewise in the year
                    1409; so that utility, which before stood upon the right hand of pleasure, was
                    now ordered to withdraw for a season. The drama, it seems, was attempted by a
                    set of useless and insignificant persons called <hi rend="italic"
                    >parish-clerks,</hi> who, because they had the knowledge of the alphabet,
                    ignorantly presumed that this included every other species of knowledge. The
                    subject was truly serious, being the creation of the world; but the performance
                    must have been ludicrous. It was, however, honoured with the attendance of noble
                    personages; and royalty itself deigned to cast a favourable eye upon it, for the
                    king and queen were present. These interludes lasted no longer than the time
                    requisite for the former confederacy of utility and pleasure to resume its
                    powers. The lance, the shield, the ball, and the equestrian procession, came
                    forward again, and put the dramatic usurper to flight. After this period, these
                    objects of generous pleasure seem to have had their audience of leave; and one
                    general object, no less manly than the former, filled their stations, we mean
                    archery. This continued till the reign of Charles I.; for we find in many
                    hospitals founded during that reign, that amongst the articles of benefaction
                    recorded upon their walls was this singular provision, <hi rend="italic">arms
                    for the boys,</hi> which signified <hi rend="italic">bows and arrows.</hi></p>
                <p>There are, at this day, many places which were formerly resorted to for the
                    practice of this noble art, distinguished by appellations which indicate their
                    ancient usage; such as Brentford Butts, Newington Butts, and many others of the
                    like denomination. It appears from 33 Henry VIII. that, by the intrusion of
                    other pernicious games, archery had for a long time been disused; and to revive
                    it this statute was enacted. It seems that the bows of the best kind were made
                    of yew; and, that this wood might be readily obtained for the purpose, yew-trees
                    were planted in church-yards. The sons of those only who were persons of fortune
                    and fashion, if under seventeen years of age, were permitted to use such bows.
                    The words of the statute are singular, and run thus: “No person under seventeen
                    years, except he, or his father or mother, have lands or tenements to the yearly
                    value of ten pounds, or be worth in value or moveables the sum of forty marks
                    sterling, shall shoot with any bow of yew, which shall be bought for him, after
                    the feast of our lady next coming, under the pain to lose and forfeit six
                    shillings and eightpence.” Upon these words two observations present themselves.
                    One is, that the yewwood, not being so common as other wood, might probably be
                    soon found deficient, as it was the best wood for making bows, if the use of it
                    had not been confined to particular ages and persons, as young people wantonly
                    destroy what <pb break="no" facs="nls:193492569" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2569-0114"
                    />is put into their hands for useful purposes. The other observation is, that
                    the age of seventeen is by this statute distinguished as the age of discretion,
                    when young people are more attentive and considerate in things of private
                    concernment. This statute makes provision of other kinds of wood for the common
                    people; and to the intent that every person may have bows of mean price, it
                    enacts, that every bowyer shall, for every bow that he makes of yew, make four
                    other bows, meet to shoot with, of elm, witch-hazel, ash, or other wood apt for
                    the same, under pain of losing and forfeiting, for every such bow so lacking,
                    the sum of three shillings and fourpence. It seems there was a species of yew at
                    this time called <hi rend="italic">elk,</hi> a wood which was stronger and more
                    pliant than the common yew mentioned in the statute, and the price of which it
                    fixed. “Moreover, no bowyer shall sell or put to sale to any of the king’s
                    subjects, any bow of yew of the tax called <hi rend="italic">elk,</hi> above the
                    price of three shillings and fourpence, under the pain to forfeit twenty
                    shillings for every bow sold above the said price.”</p>
                <p>About the beginning of the reign of James I. military prowess appears to have
                    sounded a retreat. This king, to gratify the importunity of the common people,
                    and at the same time to obviate his own fears, published a book of sports, in
                    which the people had some time before been indulged on Sunday evenings, but
                    which had lately been prohibited. These sports consisted of dancing, singing,
                    wrestling, church ales, and other profanations of that day.</p>
                <p>Charles, his successor, wisely abolished these sports. The act of Charles states
                    in part the several amusements, by which we may conjecture what were the
                    remainder as stated in the book of sports by James. It is necessary to
                    transcribe the portion of the act relating to this subject. “Forasmuch as there
                    is nothing more acceptable to God, than the true and sincere worship of Him, and
                    service according to His holy will, and that the holy keeping of the Lord’s day
                    is a principal part of the service of God, which in many places of this realm
                    hath been, and now is, prophaned and neglected by a disorderly sort of people,
                    in exercising and frequenting bear-baiting, bull-baiting, interludes, and
                    common-plays, and other unlawful exercises and pastimes, neglecting divine
                    service both in their own parishes and elsewhere: Be it enacted, that from and
                    after forty days next after the end of this session of parliament, there shall
                    be no meetings, assemblies, or concourse of people, out of their own parishes,
                    on the Lord’s day, within this realm of England, or any the dominions thereof,
                    for any sports or pastimes whatsoever; nor any bear-baiting, bull-baiting,
                    interludes, common-plays, or other unlawful exercises or pastimes, used by any
                    person or persons within their own parishes; and that every person and persons
                    offending in any of the said premises, shall forfeit for every offence the sum
                    of three shillings and fourpence; the same to be employed and converted to the
                    use of the poor of the parish where such offence shall be committed.” All this
                    was no doubt very proper, and showed the piety of the unfortunate monarch by
                    whom it was enacted. But this age witnessed the close of the ancient manly
                    sports of Britain.</p>
