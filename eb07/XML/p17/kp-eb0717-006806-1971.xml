                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    the remitting or forgiving an offence committed against the king.</p>
                <p>Law, says Beccaria, cannot be framed on principles of compassion to guilt; yet
                    justice, by the CQnstitution of England, is bound to be administered in mercy.
                    This is promised by the king in his coronation oath; and it is that act of his
                    government which is the most personal and most entirely his own. The king
                    condemns no man; that unpleasant task he leaves to his courts of justice; the
                    great operation of his sceptre is mercy. His power of pardoning was said by the
                    Saxons to be derived <hi rend="italic">a lege suae dignitatis ς</hi> and it is
                    declared in parliament, by stat. 27 Henry VIII. c. 24, that no other person has
                    power to pardon or remit any treason or felonies whatsoever, but that the king
                    has the whole and sole power thereof, united and knit to the imperial crown of
                    this realm.</p>
                <p>Mr Godwin, in his Inquiry concerning Political Justice, attacks this prerogative
                    in the following terms: “What is the rule that ought in all cases to prescribe
                    to my conduct? Surely justice; understanding by justice the greatest utility of
                    the whole mass of things that may be influenced by my conduct. What then is
                    clemency? It can be nothing but the pitiable egotism of him who imagines he can
                    do something better than justice. Is it right that I should suffer constraint
                    for a certain offence? The rectitude of my suffering must be founded on its
                    tendency to promote the general welfare. He therefore that pardons me,
                    iniquitously prefers the imaginary interest of an individual, and utterly
                    neglects what he owes to the whole. He bestows that which I ought not to
                    receive, and which he has no right to give. Is it right, on the contrary, that I
                    should not undergo the suffering in question? Will he, by rescuing me from
                    suffering, do a benefit to me, and no injury to others? He will then be a
                    notorious delinquent, if he allow me to suffer. There is indeed a considerable
                    defect in this last supposition. If, while he benefits me, he do no injury
                    toothers, he is infallibly performing a public<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193491984" xml:id="kp-eb0717-1984-0069"/> service. If I suffered in
                    the arbitrary manner which the supposition includes, the whole would sustain an
                    unquestionable injury in the injustice that was perpetrated. And yet the man who
                    prevents this odious injustice has been accustomed to arrogate to himself the
                    attribute of clement, and the apparently sublime, but in reality tyrannical,
                    name of forgiveness. For, if he do more than has been here described, instead of
                    glory he ought to take shame to himself, as an enemy to the interest of human
                    kind. If every action, and especially every action in which the happiness of a
                    rational being is concerned, be susceptible of a certain rule, then caprice must
                    be in all cases excluded; there can be no action which, if I neglect, I shall
                    have discharged my duty; and if I perform, I shall be entitled to applause.”</p>
                <p>That human nature is such as in the aggregate to need control, no one who is
                    acquainted with it will deny; and there appears to be no other method of
                    controlling mankind but by general laws, which, through the natural imperfection
                    of human affairs, may be cruel in one case if they are just in another. Cases
                    may likewise occur where the sentence of the law, without its execution, will
                    answer every purpose which could be expected from it, and where the execution of
                    it would be extreme cruelty, although it might in strict unfeeling language be
                    called justice, because in strict conformity with the letter of the law. Yet
                    though such cases may and do often occur, it would be absurd to abolish any of
                    those laws which the security of civil society has required; and therefore the
                    only natural remedy against legal injustice is the system of pardons.</p>
                <p>Mr Godwin next goes on to trace the origin of pardons; and instead of a definite
                    system of law, we are told that it is necessary to have a court of reason, to
                    which the decisions of a court of law shall be brought for révisai. But this is
                    a remedy apparently too vague and indeterminate to produce any lasting or good
                    effect; for the proposal of such a tribunal results from supposing mankind more
                    virtuous and intelligent than they really are. He next proceeds to consider the
                    abuses of pardons, whence he would draw an argument for their abolition. He
                    tells us that the authority in this case is placed, first in the judge, and next
                    in the king and council. . “Now,” says he, “laying aside the propriety or
                    impropriety of this particular selection, there is one grievous abuse which
                    ought to strike the most superficial observer. Those persons with whom the
                    principal trust is reposed consider their functions in this respect as a matter
                    purely incidental, exercise them with supineness, and in many instances with the
                    most scanty materials to guide their judgment. This grows in a considerable
                    degree out of the very name of pardon, which implies a work of supererogatory
                    benevolence.”</p>
                <p>But it is obvious that pardons are in general granted in consequence of an
                    application from people who have more than scanty materials to guide their
                    judgments, and on whose fidelity in relating the circumstances of the case
                    confidence is or is not placed, according to their several characters. Mr Godwin
                    next proceeds to the arbitrary character of pardons. “Such a system,” he says,
                    “to speak it truly, is a lottery of death, in which each man draws his ticket
                    for reprieve or execution, as undefinable accidents shall decide.” The allusion
                    here to a lottery ticket is peculiarly unfortunate, nor does the whole sentence
                    show any great degree of candour. It is possible to define a particular crime,
                    and to annex a particular punishment to the commission of it; but the nature of
                    morality consists not in the external action, but in the motives which prompted
                    to it. Definite law, however, cannot always make this distinction; and after the
                    sentence of the law is pronounced, it comes to be considered whether there are
                    any alleviating circumstances in the case; and whether there are or not, must
                    depend on the particulars or accidents of the case. But it is impossible to
                    suppose that these accidents could be previously defined; their nature does not
                    admit of it. To particularize and define every mode of an action which
                    imagination can conceive, or which experience has shown us may happen, would
                    indeed be an Herculean labour; and we might literally say with the apostle,
                    “that the world could not contain the books that might be written.” We are,
                    however, told that “reason is a thousand times more explicit and intelligible
                    than law; and when we are accustomed to consult her, the certainty of her
                    decisions would be such as men practised in our present courts are totally
                    unable to conceive.” Were reason, however, to be appealed to in all cases, and
                    to be the final criterion, it would leave far greater room for villany than any
                    mode at present in practice. Reason is a very uncertain and indefinite term, and
                    may be made any thing, according to the circumstances or passions of men, at any
                    given time.</p>
                <p>We are next told that pardons are destructive to morality. “Another very
                    important consequence,” says Mr Godwin, “grows out of the system of pardons. A
                    system of pardon is a system of unmitigated slavery. I am taught to expect a
                    certain desirable event. From what? From the clemency, the uncontrolled,
                    unmerited kindness of a fellow-mortal. Can any lesson be more degrading? The
                    pusillanimous servility of the man who devotes himself with everlasting
                    obsequiousness to another, because that other, having begun to be unjust,
                    relents in his career,—the ardour with which he confesses the rectitude of his
                    sentence and the enormity of his deserts,—will constitute a tale that future
                    ages will find it difficult to understand. What are the sentiments in this
                    respect that are alone worthy of a rational being? Give me that, and that only,
                    which without injustice you cannot refuse. More than justice it would be
                    disgraceful for me to ask, and for yon to bestow. I stand upon the foundation of
                    right. This is a title which brute force may refuse to acknowledge, but which
                    all the force in the world cannot annihilate. By resisting this plea you may
                    prove yourself unjust, but in yielding to it you grant me but my due. If, all
                    things considered, I be the fit subject of a benefit, the benefit is merited;
                    merit in any other sense is contradictory and absurd. If you bestow upon me
                    unmerited advantage, you are a recreant from the general good. I may be base
                    enough to thank you; but if I were virtuous I should condemn you. These
                    sentiments alone are consistent with true independence of mind. He that is
                    accustomed to regard virtue as an affair of favour and grace, cannot be
                    eminently virtuous. If he occasionally perform an action of apparent kindness,
                    he will applaud the generosity of his sentiments; and if he abstain, he will
                    acquit himself with the question, May I not do what I will with my own? In the
                    same manner, when he is treated benevolently by another, he will in the first
                    place be unwilling to examine strictly into the reasonableness of this
                    treatment, because benevolence, as he imagines, is not subject to any
                    inflexibility of rule; and, in the second place, he will not regard his
                    benefactor with that erect and unembarrassed mien, that complete sense of
                    equality, which is the only immoveable basis of virtue and happiness.”</p>
                <p>Such being Mr Godwin’s conclusion on this subject, we leave it with our readers
                    to determine whether his system or that which we at present enjoy would be the
                    more rigorous or unjust; or whether mankind have indeed arrived at so eminent a
                    pitch of virtue as to disdain every favour which they do not absolutely merit.
                    The Christian religion speaks a very different language.</p>
