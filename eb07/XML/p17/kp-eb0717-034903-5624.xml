                <p><label type="entry">PHILIPS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Fabian</hi></label>, the author
                    of several books relating to ancient customs and privileges in England, was born
                    at Prestbury in Gloucestershire, on the 28th of September 1601. When very young,
                    he spent some time in one of the Inns of Chancery, and went from thence to the
                    Middle Temple, where he became learned in the law. In the civil wars, he was a
                    bold assertor of the king’s prerogative, and so strongly attached to Charles I.
                    that, two days before that monarch was beheaded, he wrote a protestation against
                    the intended murder, and caused it to be printed, and affixed to posts in all
                    the public places. He likewise published, in 1649, a quarto pamphlet entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Veritas</hi><hi rend="italic">Inconcussa,</hi> or King Charles
                    I. no Man of Blood, but a Martyr for his People, which was reprinted in 1660,
                    8vo. In 1663, when the courts of justice at Westminster, especially the
                    chancery, were dissolved by Cromwell’s parliament, he published Considerations
                    against the dissolving and taking them away, for which he received the thanks of
                    parliament. He was for some time filazer for London, Middlesex, Cambridgeshire,
                    and Huntingdonshire; and spent much money in searching records, and writing in
                    favour of the royal prerogative. The only advantage he received for this
                    attachment to the royal cause was the place of commissioner for regulating the
                    law, worth L.200 per annum, but which only lasted two years. After the
                    restoration of Charles II. when the bill for taking away the tenures was
                    depending in parliament, Philips wrote and published a book to show the
                    necessity of preserving them, entitled <hi rend="italic">Tenenda</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">non</hi><hi rend="italic">Tollenda,</hi> or, the Necessity of
                    preserving Tenures <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">capite,</hi> and
                    by Knight’s Service, which, according to their first institution, were, and are
                    yet, a great part of the <hi rend="italic">salus populi,</hi> 1660, in 4to. In
                    1663 he published the Antiquity, Legality, Reason, Duty, and Necessity of
                    Pre-emption and Purveyance for the King, in 4to; and afterwards many other
                    pieces upon subjects of a similar kind. He assisted Dr Bates in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Elenchus Motuum,</hi> especially in searching the records and
                    offices for that work, and died on the 17th of November ]690, in his
                    eighty-ninth year. He was a man well acquainted with records and antiquities;
                    but his manner of writing is neither close nor well digested. He published a
                    political pamphlet in 1681, entitled <hi rend="italic">Ursa Major</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Minor,</hi><pb break="no"

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Philips,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ambrose,</hi> an English poet
                    of some note, was descended from an ancient and considerable family of that name
                    in Leicestershire. He received his education at St John’s College, Cambridge,
                    and during his stay there wrote 1ιis pastorals, which at that time acquired him
                    a high reputation. His next performance was the Life of Archbishop Williams,
                    written, according to Mr Cibber, to make known his political principles, which
                    in the course of it he had an opportunity of doing, as the archbishop, who is
                    the hero of his work, was a strong opponent of the high-church party and their
                    measures.</p>
                <p>When he quitted the university and went to London, Philips became a constant
                    attendant at, and one of the wits of, Button’s coffee-house, where he obtained
                    the friendship and intimacy of many celebrated men of that age, particularly of
                    Sir Richard Steele, who, in the first volume of his Tatler, has inserted a
                    little poem of Philips’s, which he entitles a Winter Piece, dated from
                    Copenhagen, and addressed to the Earl of Dorset, and on which he bestows the
                    highest encomiums; and, indeed, so just are these commendations, that even Pope
                    himself, who had a fixed aversion to the author, whilst he affected to despise
                    his other works, used always to except this from his censure and contempt.</p>
                <p>The first dislike Pope conceived against Philips proceeded from that jealousy of
                    fame which was so conspicuous in his character; for Sir Richard Steele had taken
                    so strong a liking to the pastorals of Philips, that he formed a design of
                    instituting a critical comparison of them with those of Pope, in the conclusion
                    of which the preference was to be given to Philips. This design, however, having
                    come to the knowledge of Pope, the latter, who could not bear a rival near the
                    throne, determined to ward off this stroke by a stratagem of the most artful
                    kind; which was no other than taking the same task on himself. Accordingly, in a
                    paper in the Guardian, he drew a similar comparison, and gave a like preference,
                    but on principles of criticism so evidently fallacious, as to point out to all
                    the absurdity of the decision. However, notwithstanding the ridicule which
                    Philips drew upon himself by standing as it were in competition with so powerful
                    an antagonist, it is allowed that in some parts of his pastorals there are
                    certain touches of nature, and a degree of simplicity, which are much better
                    suited to the purposes of pastoral than the more correctly-turned periods of
                    Pope’s versification. Philips and Pope being of different political principles,
                    proved another cause of enmity between them, which at length rose to so great a
                    height, that the former, finding his antagonist too hard for him at the weapon
                    of wit, had determined upon making use of a rougher kind of argument; and for
                    this purpose he even went so far as to hang up a rod at Button’s for the
                    chastisement of his adversary whenever he should come thither. Pope, however,
                    declining to brave his antagonist, avoided the <hi rend="italic"
                    >argumentum</hi><hi rend="italic">baculi-num,</hi> in which he would, no doubt,
                    have found himself on the weaker side of the question. Our author also wrote
                    several dramatic pieces, as the Briton, Distressed Mother, and Humphrey Duke of
                    Gloucester, all of which met with success, and one of them still continues to be
                    a standard entertainment at the theatres, being generally repeated several times
                    in every season. Philips’s circumstances were throughout his life not only easy,
                    but rather affluent, in consequence of his being connected, by political
                    principles, with persons of great rank and consequence. He was concerned with Dr
                    Hugh Boulter, afterwards archbishop of Armagh, the Right Honourable Richard
                    West, lord chancellor of Ireland, the Rev. Gilbert Burnet, and the Rev. Henry
                    Stevens, in writing a series of papers under the title of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Freethinker,</hi> which were all published together by Philips, in three
                    volumes 12mo.</p>
                <p>In the latter part of Queen Anne’s reign, he was secretary to the Hanover Club, a
                    set of noblemen and gentlemen who had formed an association in honour of that
                    succession, and for the support of its interests, and who used particularly to
                    distinguish in their toasts such of the fair sex as were most zealously attached
                    to the illustrious house of Brunswick. Philips’ station in this club, together
                    with the zeal shown in his writings, recommended him to the notice and favour of
                    the new government. Soon after the accession of George I., he was put into the
                    commission of die peace, and appointed one of the commissioners of the lottery;
                    and, on his friend Dr Boulter being made primate of Ireland, he accompanied that
                    prelate across St George’s Channel, where considerable preferments were bestowed
                    on him, and he was elected a member of the Irish House of Commons, as
                    representative for the county of Armagh. At length, having purchased an annuity
                    for life of L.400 per annum, he returned to England some time in the year 1748;
                    but being in a very bad state of health, and, moreover, at an advanced age, he
                    died soon afterwards, at his lodgings near Vauxhall, in Surrey.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Philips,</hi><hi rend="italic">Catharine,</hi> an ingenious
                    lady, the daughter of Mr John Fowler, merchant, was born at London in January
                    1631, and educated at a school near Hackney. She married James Philips of the
                    priory of Cardigan; and went with the Viscountess of Dungannon into Ireland,
                    where she translated into English Corneille’s tragedy of Pompey, which was
                    several times acted there with great applause. She also translated the first
                    four acts of the Horace, another tragedy of Corneille, the fifth being executed
                    by Sir John Denham. This remarkable person died of the small-pox in London on
                    the 22d of June 1664, much and justly regretted; “having,” according to
                    Langbaine, “not left any of her sex her equal in poetry.” Dr Jeremy Taylor
                    addressed to her his Measures and Offices of Friendship, the second edition of
                    which appeared in the year 1657, in 12mo. Her assumed poetical name was <hi

                    >John,</hi> an English poet of considerable eminence, was born in 1676. He was
                    educated at Winchester and Oxford, where he became acquainted with Milton, whom
                    he studied with great application, and traced in all Jiis successful
                    translations from the ancients. The first poem by which he distinguished himself
                    was his Splendid Shilling, which in the Tatler is styled the “finest burlesque
                    poem in the English language.” His next was entitled Blenheim, which he wrote at
                    the request of the Earl of Oxford, and Mr Henry St John, afterwards Lord
                    Bolingbroke, on the victory obtained by the Duke of Marlborough in the year
                    1704. It was published in 1705; and the year after, he finished another poem
                    upon cider, the first book of which had been written at Oxford. It is on the
                    model of Virgil’s Georgies, and is thought a very excellent piece. We have no
                    more of Philips’ except a Latin ode to Mr Henry St John, which is esteemed a
                    masterpiece. He was contriving greater things, when he was seized with the
                    illness of which he died, at Hereford, on the !5th of February 1708, before he
                    had attained his thirty-third year.</p>
                <p>It deserves to be remarked, that there were other two poets of the same name who
                    flourished in his time. One of these was Milton’s nephew, who wrote several
                    things, particularly some memoirs of his uncle, and part of Virgil Travestied.
                    The other was the author of two political farces, which were both printed in
                    1716, viz. The Earl of Marr Married, with the Humours of Jockey the Highlander;
                    and the Pretender’s Flight, or a Mock Coronation, with the Humours of the
                    facetious Harry St John.</p>
