                <p><label type="entry">PHILIPPINES</label>. This archipelago, in the Eastern Seas,
                    extends from the fifth to the twentieth degree of north latitude, and consists
                    of a great number of islands of various sizes, and many of which are but little
                    known. The largest of the group is Luzon or Luconia; and to the south lie the
                    other principal islands, namely, Mindoro, Panay, Marindique, Negros, Masbate,
                    Zebu, Bohol, Leyte, Samar, and Magindanao. There are, besides, several smaller
                    ones, and they are all, nominally at least, subordinate to the Spanish
                    government at Manilla; but its power does not extend over all parts of the
                    islands. There are many remote· places to which the Spaniards have never been
                    able to penetrate. Amongst their fastnesses and mountains, the natives roam in a
                    state of barbarous independence, and wage an inveterate war against their
                    Spanish oppressors. These islands, which are partially colonized, pay tribute,
                    which is collected by the Spanish magistrates in the provinces or districts into
                    which the country is subdivided. The appellation of Philippines was given to
                    them in compliment to Philip II. of Spain, who at the time of their subjugation
                    was prince of the Asturias. ’</p>
                <p>The Philippines, from their situation, possess a tropical climate, and are
                    subject to the periodical rains, though the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193495611"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-5611-0348"/>heats are moderated by the breeze from the sea.
                    The rains generally commence in May, and last till September, but sometimes they
                    are protracted to the beginning of December; from which latter period till the
                    succeeding May the weather is delightful, being a perpetual spring. The
                    vegetation is luxuriant, owing to the copious rains; the trees are constantly
                    covered with leaves, and the soil with verdure, so that it is difficult to keep
                    the land clear of weeds and insects. The winds which most commonly prevail are
                    the north, the east, and the south-west, each of which continues for four
                    months; the change of wind being attended with violent storms of thunder and
                    lightning, and at times by whirlwinds. These storms rage occasionally with
                    frightful violence, and blow from every point of the compass in the course of
                    twenty-four hours, ravaging and destroying the country, and tearing up trees by
                    the roots.</p>
                <p>These islands, from their extent, their climate, and the fertility of their soil,
                    would produce all sorts of colonial products, if there were adequate industry on
                    the part of the inhabitants. Their chief production, however, is rice, which is
                    the principal subsistence of the natives. They cultivate, besides the
                    bread-fruit, beans, the cacavata, &amp;c.; and the palm-tree is much attended
                    to, as it yields a spirit and an oil, besides a sweetmeat named chanaca. The
                    pith of the palm, the young shoots of the sugar-cane, green withes, and other
                    succulents, serve as substitutes for rice to those who cannot procure anything
                    better. The other products are different sorts of pulse, such as mangos, patani,
                    kidney beans, and millet. They have not many fruit-trees, and they are, besides,
                    of an indifferent quality, excepting the plantain, to which may be added the
                    orange and the mango. The areca or betel-nut is also cultivated, and used in
                    great quantities, both by Spaniards and by natives. The domestic animals are
                    buffaloes, goats, pigs, ducks, and fowls. Horses and horned cattle, having been
                    imported in great numbers by the Spaniards, have multiplied to such a degree
                    that they now run wild in the mountains, without being claimed by any owner.
                    Deer abound in the mountains, and all sorts of pigeons swarm in the fields, with
                    other small birds, such as quails, a species of partridge, woodcocks, &amp;c.
                    The swallow which builds the edible bird-nests so much esteemed by the Chinese
                    is found here. The surrounding seas yield abundant “up-plies of fish, which
                    afford a wholesome nourishment to the inhabitants. The natives take a great
                    delight in fishing, as it flatters their natural indolence, and gives them a
                    supply of fish, which they prefer to flesh. Shells in great variety are found
                    upon the shores; amongst these are the cowries, and the enormous kima cockle, so
                    large as to hold a gallon, and used in the churches as vessels for containing
                    holy water. They have also introduced sheep, as well as geese; and amongst
                    vegetables, grapes, figs, wheat, pepper, cocoa, coffee, sugar, tobacco, and
                    various sorts of plants, which have thriven remarkably well.</p>
                <p>These islands contain many valuable mineral productions. In the interior there
                    are mines of gold and of iron, but they are not worked, either from a deficiency
                    of produce, or from the want of skill and industry amongst the inhabitants. Gold
                    is also procured by washing the sand which is found in the mountain streams. At
                    one place the gold mines are so indolently worked as scarcely to defray the
                    expense. The mountains abound in excellent timber, both for ship and house
                    building; and the bamboos are large and long. Some of them are of the thickness
                    of a man’s thigh; and of these the native houses are constructed, after which
                    they are covered with palm-leaves. The inhabitants also raise a little cotton
                    for clothing, which is dyed with indigo, logwood, &amp;c. The other productions
                    of the Philippines which are articles of export, consist of wax, wild honey,
                    amber, marble, tar, brimstone, and other lesser articles.</p>
                <p>These islands, notwithstanding their natural fertility, continue in a very
                    desolate state, which is owing partly to physical disadvantages, namely, the
                    hurricanes, which sweep across the country with wide-wasting desolation, and to
                    the destruction caused by rats, insects, and other vermin, which swarm in all
                    parts, and are a great annoyance; partly also to the indolence of the natives,
                    and to the intolerant and illiberal policy of the Spaniards. If the Chinese were
                    encouraged by an enlightened government, they would settle in great numbers in
                    these islands, and by their enterprise and industry would soon change the face
                    of the country. These islands import a variety of piece-goods, especially
                    ordinary long cloth, white, blue, and red; handkerchiefs of all kinds; chintz,
                    principally dark grounds; Surat goods of most sorts, and all kinds of European
                    cutlery and iron. The exports are the edible bird-nests, cassia, gold-dust,
                    pepper, rattans, sago, tortoise-shell, wax, wild honey, amber, marble, tar,
                    brimstone, and other articles of inferior note. The native Indians trade with
                    each other for the different productions of their country, and employ gold as
                    the medium of exchange. They likewise carry on a trade, though inconsiderable,
                    with the Chinese and the Malays of Borneo, for flag-stones, copper, and articles
                    of furniture. They are rude in their manners, and go about almost naked. These
                    islands are visited by junks which come from several parts of the Chinese
                    empire, bringing various articles for the consumption of the numerous resident
                    Chinese, and silk-goods, lackeredjvare, china-ware, and teas, for the Acapulco
                    ships. Cochineal, black wood, and dollars, constitute the returns. A trade is
                    also carried on with the British settlements, though not to any great
                    extent.</p>
                <p>The Spaniards who first visited these islands spread the most extraordinary and
                    incredible tales of their inhabitants, whom they described as divided into three
                    classes, satyrs, men with tails, and sea-monsters. There were only in these
                    islands two races, the Bisayan Indians, and that strange race of oriental
                    negroes who still occupy the Papuan Isles. The latter roamed the mountains
                    almost in a state of nature, merely covering the fore-part of the body with the
                    bark of a tree, and living on roots, or on such animals as they could kill with
                    their bows and arrows, and the flesh of which they devoured raw. In short, they
                    were nearly on a level in their habits and manners with the beasts of the
                    forest. The Spaniards have succeeded in domesticating them, and introducing
                    amongst them an imperfect civilization. But their barbarous aversion to labour
                    they have never been able to conquer. They are of opinion that the negroes were
                    the indigenous inhabitants of the islands, and that the Bisayans were intruders.
                    At present the Papuans are few in number, and consequently feeble; yet they
                    retain all their original hatred to the Bisayans, whom they lie in wait for and
                    murder without remorse. There are, besides, several other races who inhabit the
                    Philippines, and differ in features, language, and manners. The Pampangos reside
                    to the north of Manilla, as also the painted races termed by the Spaniards
                    Pintados, from whom these islands were originally named Islas de Pintados. The
                    Indians found by the Spaniards in these islands were of regular stature, and an
                    olive complexion, with flat noses, large eyes, and long hair. They were all
                    governed by their chiefs, and their different villages waged an everlasting war
                    with each other. The prisoners on each side were condemned to slavery. In some
                    places a race of Indians was discovered whiter than the others, the descendants,
                    as is supposed, of Chinese who had been wrecked on the coasts, and who had
                    intermarried with Indians. The tribes of Igorrates or Ilocas, in particular,
                    have eyes resembling the Chinese. Their customs and usages mark a barbarous
                    people. They have no fixed laws. Certain traditions are the only rules which
                    they have for deciding civil suits; and criminal cases are <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193495624" xml:id="kp-eb0717-5624-0349"/>generally compounded for a
                    sum of money, unless in cases of murder, where one tribe retaliates upon
                    another, and a scene of bloody contention ensues. They are permitted to have
                    only one wife. But the principal persons have several concubines, who are
                    slaves. No great reformation of manners has been effected by the Spaniards, nor
                    have they made any great progress in the conversion of the natives. The Tagala
                    or Gala language is in general use throughout the Philippine Islands. The
                    dialects are so many and various, that the inhabitants of one province are not
                    intelligible in those of another; yet their language is all derived from one
                    common stock. Their religion is a rude species of idolatry, and consists in
                    frantic ceremonies and sacrifices to idols, of which the details would be of
                    little interest.</p>
                <p>These islands were discovered in 1521, by Magelhaens, who named them the
                    Archipelago of St Lazarus. In 1565 they were taken possession of by a fleet
                    which was despatched from Mexico in consequence of orders from Philip II. of
                    Spain, and first stopped at the island of Zebu, which was soon wholly subdued.
                    In 1570 a fleet sailed from the island of Panay for Luzon, and, after several
                    engagements with the princes of the country, effected a settlement at the mouth
                    of the Manilla River. In 1571 the Spanish admiral took possession of the town of
                    Manilla, which he constituted the capital of the Spanish possessions in the
                    Philippines, and proceeded in his reduction of the island under the Spanish
                    authority. In 1574 the existence of the Spanish settlement was threatened by a
                    Chinese pirate, who arrived with sixty-two junks; but, after many bloody
                    engagements, he was expelled, and great part of his army destroyed. Towards the
                    conclusion of the sixteenth century a considerable trade was openly carried on
                    with Japan; and many rich cargoes were brought from that country to Manilla,
                    which had now become an emporium of the trade with China, Java, the coast of
                    Coromandel, and Mexico In 1590 the island of Sooloo was attacked by the
                    Spaniards, but they were repulsed with great slaughter by the natives; nor could
                    the Spanish maritime force make any impression on the Sooloo pirates, who have
                    continued for nearly three centuries the scourge of these seas. The number of
                    industrious Chinese had been daily increasing in the Philippines, and about the
                    year 1639 they amounted to 30,000, most of whom were settled as cultivators. The
                    Spaniards were always jealous of them, though they enriched the country by their
                    industry; and that year, in consequence of suspected disaffection, they
                    commenced a war against them, and made so dreadful a havoc amongst them, that in
                    a short time their numbers were diminished to 7000, who surrendered at
                    discretion. In 1757, the Chinese, who had again increased in the island, were
                    all banished to their own country; and, to prevent their future establishment in
                    the archipelago, the quarter of St Fernando was appropriated for the reception
                    of such Chinese as should come to the island for the purposes of commerce, and
                    regulations were made for their re-embarkation in good time, unless they should
                    be in the mean time converted to the Christian religion, in which case they were
                    permitted to settle as cultivators. In 1762, Manilla was attacked by a British
                    fleet under Admiral Cornish and General Draper, and the place was stormed on the
                    5th of October. A capitulation was agreed upon next day, when, in order to
                    redeem the city from general plunder, a ransom was agreed upon of four millions
                    of dollars. Manilla was restored to the Spaniards at the peace of 1763, and has
                    ever since remained in their possession. Besides Manilla and the larger
                    establishments in Luzon, the Spaniards have many smaller settlements scattered
                    over the islands to the southward; but such is the weakness of their government,
                    that they have never been able to protect them against the attacks of the
                    pirates who infest these seas. And so jealous of the natives are the Spanish
                    rulers of these islands, that, though unable to defend them, they do not allow
                    the natives’to possess arms, or any sort of iron, which is a royal monopoly. In
                    the year 1809 they published a declaration of their adherence to Ferdinand VII.
                    and opened their ports to the British; and since that period a free trade has
                    been carried on to a considerable extent. <hi rend="smallcaps">(f.)</hi></p>
