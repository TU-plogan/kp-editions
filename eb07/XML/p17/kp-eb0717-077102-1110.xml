                <p><label type="entry">PIUS</label>, a name of several pontiffs distinguished in the
                    history of the Catholic church.</p>
                <p>Pius H. <hi rend="italic">(Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini)</hi> was born on the 18th
                    of October 1405, at Corsigni, in the Siennese, the name of which he afterwards
                    changed into that of <hi rend="italic">Pienza.</hi> Aeneas was carefully
                    educated, and made considerable proficiency in the belles lettres. After having
                    finished his studies at Sienna, he in 1431 went to the council of Basil with
                    Cardinal Capranica, surnamed <hi rend="italic">De Ferma,</hi> because he was
                    intrusted with the government of that church. Aeneas, who acted as his
                    secretary, was then only twenty-six years of age. He afterwards acted in the
                    same capacity to some other prelates, and to Cardinal Albergati. The council of
                    Basil honoured him with different commissions, in order to recompense him for
                    the zeal with which he had defended that assembly against Pope Eugenius IV. He
                    was afterwards secretary to Frederic HL, who decreed to him the poetical crown,
                    and sent him as ambassador to Rome, Milan, Naples, Bohemia, and other places.'
                    Nicholas V. advanced him to the bishopric of Trieste, which he quitted some time
                    afterwards for that of Sienna. At last, after having distinguished himself as
                    nuncio on various occasions, he was invested withthe Roman purple by Oalixtus
                    HL, whom he succeeded two years afterwards, on the 27th of August 1458. Pius
                    II., now advanced to the holy see, exemplified the proverb, “Honores mutant
                    mores.” From the commencement of his pontificate he appeared to be jealous of
                    the papal prerogatives. In 1460 he issued a bull, declaring appeals from the
                    pope to a council to be null, erroneous, detestable, and contrary to the sacred
                    canons. That bull, however, did not prevent the procurator-general of the
                    parliament of Paris from appealing to a council in defence of the Pragmatic
                    Sanction, which the pope had strenuously opposed. Pius was then at Mantua,
                    whither he had gone to engage the Catholic princes to unite in a war against the
                    Turks. The greater part of them had agreed to furnish troops or money; but
                    others refused both, particularly France, which from that moment incurred his
                    holiness’s aversion. But his aversion abated under Louis XI., whom in 1461 he
                    persuaded to abolish the Pragmatic Sanction, which the parliament of Paris had
                    with so much vigour supported.</p>
                <p>The following year, 1462, was rendered famous by a controversy which took place
                    betwéen the Cordeliers and Dominicans, whether or not the blood of Jesus Christ
                    was separated from his body whilst he lay in the sepulchre. It was also made a
                    question whether it was separated from his divinity. The Cordeliers affirmed
                    that it was, but the Dominicans were of an opposite opinion. As usually happens
                    in such disputes, the disputants called each other heretics; and this obliged
                    the pontiff' to issue a bull, forbidding them, under pain of censure, to brand
                    one another with such odious epithets. The bull which his holiness published on
                    the 26th of April, retracting what he had written to the council of Basil when
                    he was its secretary, if it somewhat impeached his consistency, was at least
                    highly honourable to his frankness and candour. “I am a man,” says he, “and as a
                    man I have erred. I am far from denying that a great many things which I have
                    said and written may deserve condemnation. Like Paul, I have preached through
                    deception, and I have persecuted the church of God through ignorance. I imitate
                    the blessed St Augustin, who having suffered some erroneous sentiments to creep
                    into his works, retracted them. I do the Same thing; I frankly acknowledge my
                    ignorance, from a fear lest what I have written in my younger years should be
                    the occasion of any error that might afterwards be prejudicial to the interests
                    of the holy see. For if it be proper for any one to defend and support the
                    eminence and glory of the first throne of the church, it is in a peculiar manner
                    my duty, whom God, out of his mercy and goodness alone, without any merit on my
                    part, has raised to the dignity of vicar of Jesus Christ. For all these reasons,
                    we exhort and admonish you in the Lord, not to give credit to those writings of
                    ours which tend in any degree to hurt the authority of the apostolic see, and
                    which establish opinions that are not received by the Roman church. If you find,
                    then, any thing contrary to her doctrine, either in our dialogues, in our
                    letters, or in other of our works, despise these opinions, reject them, and
                    adopt our present sentiments. Believe me rather now that I am an old man, than
                    when I addressed you in my earlier days. Esteem a sovereign pontiff more than a
                    private person; except against Aeneas Sylvius, but receive Pius II.” It might
                    perhaps be objected to his holiness, that it was his dignity alone which had
                    made him alter his opinion. He anticipates that objection by giving a short
                    account of his life and actions, with the whole history of the council of Basil,
                    to which he went with Cardinal Capranica in 1431; “but,” says he, “I was then a
                    young man, and without any experience, like <pb break="no" facs="nls:193501123"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-1123-0772"/>a bird just come from its nest.” In the mean time,
                    the Turks were threatening Christendom. Pius, ever zealous in the defence of
                    religion against the infidels, formed the resolution of fitting out a fleet at
                    the expense of the church, and of passing over into Asia himself, to animate the
                    Christian princes by his example. He repaired to Ancona with a design to embark;
                    but he there fell sick from the fatigue of the journey, and expired on the 16th
                    of August 1464, aged fifty-nine. Pius was one of the most learned men of his
                    time, and also one of the most zealous pontiffs; but being of an ambition?
                    disposition, he sometimes sacrificed to that weakness. His principal works are,
                    1. Memoirs of the Council of Basil, from the Suspension of Eugenius to the
                    Election of Felix; 2. The History of the Bohemians, from their origin to the
                    year 1458; 3. Two books on Cosmography; 4. The History of Frederic HL (whose
                    vice-chancellor he had been), published in 1785, in folio; 5. A Treatise on the
                    Education of Children; 6. A Poem upon the Passion of Jesus Christ; 7. A
                    Collection of four hundred and thirty-two Letters, printed at Milan, 1473, in
                    folio, in which are found some curious anecdotes; 8. The Memoirs of his Own
                    Life, published by John Gobelin Personne, his secretary, and printed at Rome in
                    1584, in 4to; 9. <hi rend="italic">Historia Ferum Ubicumque Gestarum,</hi> of
                    which only the first part was published at Venice in 1477, in folio. His works
                    were printed at Helmstadt in 1700, in folio, with a life prefixed.</p>
