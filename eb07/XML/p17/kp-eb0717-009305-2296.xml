                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">PARR, <hi rend="smallcaps">Catharine</hi></label>, queen of
                    England, was the eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Parr of Kendal. She was first
                    married to John Nevil, Lord Latimer, and after his death was, by her marriage
                    with Henry VIII., raised to the throne. The royal nuptials were solemnized at
                    Hampton Court on the 12th of July 1543. This lady, being religiously disposed,
                    was, in the early part of her life, a zealous observer of the rites and
                    ceremonies of the Catholic Church; but on the dawning of the Reformation, she
                    became as zealous a promoter of the Lutheran doctrine, though with all the
                    prudence and circumspection which her perilous situation required. Nevertheless,
                    it is alleged that she was in great danger of falling a sacrifice to the popish
                    faction, the chief of which was Bishop Gardiner, who is said to have drawn up
                    articles against her, and prevailed on the king to sign a warrant to remove her
                    to the Tower. This warrant, however, was accidentally dropped, and immediately
                    conveyed to her majesty. What her apprehensions must have been on making such a
                    discovery may be easily imagined. Knowing the character of the monarch, and
                    recollecting the fate of his former queens, she was seized with a sudden
                    illness. The news of her indisposition brought the king to her apartment. He was
                    lavish in expressions of affection, and sent her a physician. His majesty also
                    being soon afterwards indisposed, she prudently returned the visit. With this
                    the king seemed pleased, and began to talk with her on religious subjects,
                    proposing certain questions, concerning which he wanted her opinion. She
                    answered, that such profound speculations were not suited to her sex; that it
                    belonged to the husband to choose principles for his wife; that the wife’s duty
                    was, in all cases, to adopt implicitly the sentiments of her husband; and that
                    as to herself, it was doubly her duty, being blessed with a husband who was
                    qualified, by his judgment and learning, not only to choose principles for his
                    own family, but for the most wise and knowing of every nation. “Not so, by St
                    Mary,” replied the king; “you are now become a doctor, Kate, and better fitted
                    to give than receive instruction.” She meekly replied, that she was sensible how
                    little she was entitled to these praises; that although she usually declined not
                    any conversation, however sublime, when proposed by his majesty, she well knew
                    that her conceptions could not serve any other purpose than to give him a little
                    momentary amusement; that she found the conversation a little apt to languish
                    when not revived by some opposition, and she had ventured sometimes to feign a
                    contrariety of sentiments, in order to give him the pleasure of refuting her;
                    and that she also proposed, by this innocent artifice, to engage him into
                    topics, whence she had observed, by frequent experience, that she reaped profit
                    and instruction. “And is it so, sweetheart ?” replied the king; “then we are
                    perfect friends again.” He embraced her with great affection, and sent lier away
                    with assurances of his protection and kindness.</p>
                <p>The time being now come when she was to be sent to the Tower, the king, walking
                    in the garden, sent for the queen, and met her with great good humour; when the
                    chancellor, with forty of the guards, approached. He fell upon his knees, and
                    spoke softly with the king, who called him knave, arrant knave, beast, fool, and
                    commanded him instantly to depart. Henry then returned to the queen, who
                    ventured to intercede for the chancellor: “Ah, poor soul,” said the king, “thou
                    little knowest how ill he deserveth this grace at thy hands. Of my word,
                    sweetheart, he has been toward thee an arrant knave; and so let him go.” The
                    king died in January 1547, just three years and a half after his marriage with
                    this second Catharine, who, in a short time, was again espoused to Sir Thomas
                    Seymour, lord-admiral of England; and in September 1548 she died in childbed.
                    The historians of this period generally insinuate that she was poisoned by her
                    husband, to make way for his marriage with the lady Elizabeth.</p>
