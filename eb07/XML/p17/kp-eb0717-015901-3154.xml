                <p><label type="entry">PAULO, <hi rend="smallcaps">San</hi></label>, a large and
                    important province of Brazil, in South America, celebrated for the courage of
                    its inhabitants, and for the number of expeditions which have sailed from it for
                    the purpose of exploring the interior. It is formed by the union of a part of
                    the old capitanship of St Amaro with half of that of St Vincente, and received
                    its present name in the year 1710, when John V., having incorporated them with
                    the crown-lands by purchase, appointed the city of St Paulo as the residence of
                    the captain-general. It is separated from the province of Rio de Janeiro on the
                    north-east by a line which, traversing the heights of the vast serra from the
                    point of Joatinga to the head of the ∙Jacuy, descends that river till it joins
                    the Paraiba. The Serra do Montequeira interposes between it and Minas Geraes on
                    the north, the Rio Grande and the Parana Separate it from Poyaz and Matto Grosso
                    on the west and north-west, the Saha from St Catheriria oh the south, and for
                    its easterri boundary ithaS the Atlantic Ocean. Its territory is almost all
                    within the témperate. zonè, between 20.30. and 28.0. of south latitude,
                    measuring 450 miles from north to south, and having a medium breadth of 340
                    miles. St Paulo is divided into three comarcas or ouvidorias, viz. St Paulo,
                    Hitu, and Curytiba, each called after the principal town situated in it.
                    Excepting on the eastern part, where a cordillera or elevated ridge of mountains
                    runs parallel with the coast, this province is not mountainous. With the
                    exception of Para, not one of the maritime provinces contains so many navigable
                    rivers as St Paulo; but, unfortunately, all these flow into the interior, and
                    are absorbed by the mighty Parana, so that they do not in any way facilitate
                    intercourse with the coast. The few streams or mountain torrents which descend
                    the eastern declivity of the cordillera, and fall into the Atlantic, are of no
                    use in a commercial point of view, not being navigable. This province, like most
                    others of Brazil, abounds in large forests, the trees being such as are common
                    to the country. These are succeeded by plains and gently rising hills, covered
                    with scattered bushes, and extensive tracts of verdure, which form by far the
                    largest proportion of its surface; and hence St Paulo is pre-eminently adapted
                    for the breeding of cattle, vast herds of which everywhere abound. Oxen, horses,
                    and mules thrive exceedingly well, and are particularly numerous. Sheep are not
                    attended to; but here there is a very fine and large breed of goats, whose milk
                    is generally used. The soil of this province is in many parts very rich, and the
                    vegetable productions are numerous and luxuriant. The articles chiefly
                    cultivated are wheat, rye, maize, manioc, rice, and potatoes; and lately the
                    vine has been introduced with perfect success. The palma Christi grows in such
                    abundance that castor oil is bimied in lamps instead of spermaceti. Cotton and
                    coffee do not appear to thrive very well, and the sugar-cane but indifferently;
                    yet rum is made in quantities sufficient to supply the home consumption of that
                    article. Little mandioc is cultivated, but maize is raised to a great extent,
                    and considerable quantities of it are sent to Rio. In some parts this grain, and
                    also rice, yield two hundred and fifty fold; an extraordinary return, when we
                    consider that in England the produce of wheat is only as twelve to one. The
                    mulberry tree attains to great perfection in this climate, and the silk-worms
                    are said to produce a very beautiful thread, so that the culture of silk might
                    be carried on with great success. The cochineal insect is also found in many
                    parts of the province, and might be made to furnish an equally profitable branch
                    of trade. But the aversion of the Paulistas to laborious work, as long as they
                    can obtain the rich gifts of nature without much trouble, has hitherto prevented
                    this'branch of industry from being prosecuted. The jasmine is here a favourite
                    tree, and bears flowers perennially, as does also the rose. Bees arc by no means
                    uncommon; and although insects are numerous, the mosquito is less troublesome
                    than in Rio or La Plata.</p>
                <p>The bulk of the inhabitants of St Paulo are graziers, the breeding of cattle
                    being the chief occupation. The vast grassy campos, which extend over the
                    surface of the province, afford every facility for prosecuting it upon a great
                    scale; and, by the following extract from the valuable work of Dr Von Spix, it
                    will be seen that the Paulistas take every advantage of their situation. “Every
                    landholder possesses, according to the extent of his farm, from“several hundred
                    to two thousand, nav, even forty thousand, head of cattle. They generally reckon
                    from three to four thousand head on an estate which has two square miles of good
                    pasture. AH these roam at liberty in a wild state; but every farmer keeps,
                    besides, as many tame draught oxen and cows as he requires for the purposes of
                    agriculture and milk, which is partly made into cheese. The attendance on the
                    wild cattle gives but very little trouble; all that is required is to brand
                    them* with the mark of the owner, arid to catch the aniirials intèhtìéd to be
                    slaughtered From <pb break="no" facs="nls:193493167"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-3167-0160"/>four to six servants, under the direction of a
                    chief cowherd, perform all these services; they prevent the herds from straying
                    beyond the boundaries, and defend them from the attacks of the ounces, wolves,
                    and wild dogs. These people are almost always on horseback, as their office
                    compels them to ride twenty miles or more in a day. Every year the whole herd is
                    collected at different times in a place in a high situation, and sometimes
                    fenced in. On this occasion the mark of the owner is branded on the hind quarter
                    of the beasts one year old, of which they reckon a thousand annually for a herd
                    of five or six thousand. Those of four years old or more are selected for
                    slaughter.” The hide is always the most valuable part of the cattle; but the
                    flesh also, after being salted, is exported in great quantities to the cities of
                    the north. The breeding of horses and mules likewise occupies the attention of
                    the farmers of St Pardo. The horses of this province are of a middling size, of
                    slender make, and, if they are attended with care, acquire an elegant carriage,
                    and become excellent racers. In general twenty or thirty of these wild horses
                    herd together, and hardly ever separate. Both they and the wild cattle are
                    captured, as in the pampas of Buenos Ayres, by long leathern nooses, which, Mr
                    Mawe informs us, the Paulistas use with incredible dexterity. The mules here are
                    more handsomely formed animals than the horses. They are commonly equal in size
                    to the European horse; and their colours are black, brown, fallow, or they are
                    striped like the zebra. They are preferable to the horses, especially on long
                    journeys, as they can endure hunger and thirst much longer, and carry heavier
                    burdens with much greater security.</p>
                <p>The working of the gold and iron mines of St Paulo is the next branch of the
                    industry of the province which requires to be noticed. The celebrated gold-mines
                    of Jaragua are situated about twenty-four miles from the capital of the
                    province. They were the first discovered in this country, and, on account of the
                    immense treasures which they produced above a century ago, this district was
                    regarded as the Pasco of Brazil. After having been abandoned for some time, the
                    gold-washing had been resumed at the period of Dr Von Spix’s visit in 1818. The
                    mountain of Jaragua is one of the most southerly branches of the Serra do
                    Montequeira, which, after running for more than fifty miles to the north,
                    disappears in this latitude. The rock is granite, sometimes gneiss, containing a
                    portion of hornblende with mica. The earth washed for gold Dr Spix describes as
                    “a ferruginous sandstone conglomerate. The soil is red and remarkably
                    ferruginous. The gold lies for the most part in a stratum of rounded pebbles and
                    gravel, called cascalhao, incumbent on the solid rock. In the valleys where
                    there is water occur frequent excavations made by the gold-washers, some of them
                    fifty or a hundred feet wide, and eighteen or twenty feet deep. On many of the
                    hills, where water can be collected for washing, particles of gold are found in
                    the soil, scarcely deeper than the roots of the grass.” The gold is obtained by
                    the usual process of washing with water, negroes being chiefly employed in the
                    operation. The pursuit of this precious metal has now much declined in St Paulo,
                    the gold-hunters finding a richer harvest in the provinces of Minas Geraes and
                    Matto Grosso.</p>
                <p>In the mountain of Guarassojava, situated about twenty leagues from St Paulo, the
                    capital city of the province, there are vast mines of magnetic ironstone; and a
                    foundery for obtaining the metal has been erected on the banks of the Ypanema or
                    Hipaunema, round which a small village has grown up. The mines were never
                    regularly worked until 1810, when a company of Swedish miners were brought to
                    the spot, and erected two small furnaces. In 1818 a handsome and extensive
                    edifice was built, with every necessary convenience for the miners. Operations
                    then commenced with considerable vigour; but as the wood in the neighbouring
                    forests is the only kind of fuel of which they have any command, Dr Spix
                    anticipates that a want of this indispensable article will by and by be
                    experienced. The ore appears to be very rich, some of it containing ninety per
                    cent.; and it exists in such incredible abundance, that Dr Spix thinks St Paulo
                    might supply not only Brazil, but all the rest of the American continent, with
                    that metal, if exportation were only facilitated by making a proper road or
                    canal to the coast. The mountain which produces this extraordinary quantity of
                    ore rises behind the neat little town of St Joâo de Ypanema, a quarter of a mile
                    to the west, and extends, as a rather insulated mountain ridge, a league in
                    length from south to north. The mass of magnetic ironstone is either compact or
                    traversed by veins of red ochre. The surface of the masses of rock, which rise
                    nearly perpendicularly to the height of forty feet and more, is almost
                    everywhere flat and even, with slight depressions and cavities, and has a crust
                    of imperfectly oxidated ironstone. Dr Spix informs us that he did not observe
                    that the great masses caused any motion in a suspended needle; but small pieces,
                    especially when just struck off, had a considerable effect on it.</p>
                <p>The city of St Paulo, from which the province derives its name, is the most
                    ancient in Brazil, and, beyond every other, interesting in an historical point
                    of view. “Here, more than in any other place,” says Dr Spix, “we find the
                    present connected with the past. The Paulista is sensible of this, and says, not
                    without pride, that his native city has a history of its own.” It is situated at
                    the angle of the confluence of the Tamandatahi, which washes it on the west,
                    with the Hynhangabahu, which flows on the eastern side. The celebrated Anchicta
                    and his brother Jesuits commenced this city in the year 1552, with the
                    foundation of a college, in which they celebrated the first mass on St Paul’s
                    day; and when, six years afterwards, it acquired the denomination of a town, its
                    name was determined by this circumstance. Its first inhabitants were Indians,
                    but they were soon joined by Europeans in great numbers, and a mixed race
                    rapidly augmented the population; so that, before a century had elapsed, the
                    Paulistas had become as formidable by their numbers as they were distinguished
                    by their spirit of enterprise. Their love of travelling, and the hope of
                    discovering the treasures of the New World, prevented them from cultivating
                    their own fertile territory. They visited almost every part of Brazil. They
                    crossed lofty mountains, until then deemed impassable. They were not checked by
                    rivers, deserts, nor savage men, who waged perpetual war against them. The
                    richest mines of Brazil were discovered by the Paulistas, who abandoned them
                    with regret, and reluctantly submitted to the authority of their government. But
                    this ardour of enterprise also led to serious evils. The early historians
                    describe them as a lawless tribe, who had shaken off’ the yoke of Portugal, and
                    constituted themselves a separate republic. They certainly acted in many
                    instances in a perfectly independent manner, making incursions into the
                    neighbouring countries, and committing the most dreadful barbarities. Paraguay
                    suffered severely by these inroads, and the missions which had been formed in
                    that country were at one time nearly ruined by the Paulistas. (See the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Paraguay.)</hi> The selfish rudeness and insensibility
                    which formerly distinguished the Paulista is now much softened; and, although
                    pride, revenge, and stubbornness are still recognised as forming part of his
                    character, he enjoys throughout Brazil the reputation of great frankness,
                    undaunted courage, and a romantic love of adventures and dangers.</p>
                <p>The city of St Paulo is well laid out on an eminence of about two miles in
                    extent, and rising about fifty feet above the wide plain of Pirantininga. Placed
                    exactly at the angle formed by the confluence of the rivers Tamandatahi and
                    Hynhangabahu, the former washes it on the western, and the latter <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193493180" xml:id="kp-eb0717-3180-0161"/>flows past its eastern side.
                    The streets are broad, light, and cleanly; and some of them are well paved, with
                    a material in which particles of gold are found after a heavy rain has searched
                    the chinks and hollows. The houses in the principal streets are two or three
                    stories in height, stuccoed in various colours, and frequently having latticed
                    balconies. The walls are erected by means of a framework made of wood, into
                    which earth is put, which the workmen heat and occasionally moisten with water,
                    until it acquires solidity. These houses of earth appear to be very durable, for
                    Mr Mawe mentions that he saw some which had lasted two centuries. The residence
                    of the governor, formerly the Jesuits’ College, is built in a very good style,
                    but has fallen into decay. The episcopal palace and the Carmelite convent are
                    large and stately edifices, and the cathedral and some of the churches are
                    spacious. The city is divided into two parishes; that of the Cathedral, and that
                    of the Church of St Efigenia. Besides the public buildings already mentioned, St
                    Paulo contains several chapels, monasteries, and nunneries, and three hospitals.
                    Few manufactures of any consequence are carried on. A little coarse cotton is
                    spun by the hand, and woven into cloth, which serves for a variety of purposes.
                    By the most recent accounts which we have received, the manufactures are said to
                    be improving. There is made here a beautiful kind of network for hammocks, which
                    are fringed with lace, and form an elegant piece of furniture. The making of
                    lace is a général employment for females, some of whom excel in it. Shopkeepers
                    are a very numerous class here, and various trades are prosecuted with
                    considerable spirit. A coarse earthenware is made at the outskirts of the city;
                    but the great proportion of the inhabitants are farmers and inferior husbandmen,
                    who cultivate small portions of land, on which they breed large stocks of pigs
                    and poultry for sale. With these the market is generally well supplied, and also
                    with various kinds of fruit and vegetables. St Paulo is esteemed a most healthy
                    situation; and the climate, Dr Spix says, is one of the most agreeable in the
                    world. Its situation, almost under the tropic of Capricon, as well as its
                    elevation of 1200 feet above the surface of the sea at Santos, imparts to the
                    city all the charms of a tropical climate, without any great inconvenience from
                    heat. The thermometer ranges from 50° to 80° of Fahrenheit. The population,
                    including the dependent parishes, was estimated, Dr Spix says, at above 30,000
                    souls, of which one half were whites, or those who were reckoned such, and one
                    half were people of colour. Henderson, in his history of Brazil, states the
                    population as being from 35,000 to 40,000; but an official return for 1815 fixes
                    the population of the city at 25,313 souls, of whom 12,274 were whites, 845 free
                    blacks, 6239 free mulattoes, and 5955 slaves. The number of inhabitants must
                    have considerably increased since the date of the above census, and, in the
                    absence of official reports, we probably do not over-estimate the population in
                    1838 at 40,000. In general the principal characteristics of the Paulistas are, a
                    lofty, and, at the same time, broad make; strongly-marked features, expressive
                    of a bold, independent spirit; with eyes full of fire, and motions indicative of
                    great vivacity. They are considered as the strongest, most healthy, and most
                    active inhabitants of the country; and “the appellation of Paulista,” says Mr
                    Mawe, “is considered by all the females here as a great honour, the Paulistas
                    being celebrated throughout Brazil for their attractions and their dignity of
                    character.” The city of St Paulo stands in lat. 23. 33. 10. south, and long. 46.
                    39. 10. west from Greenwich.</p>
                <p>Santos is the only harbour in the province which has a direct intercourse with
                    Europe; but, although no more than twelve leagues distant from the capital, the
                    want of water communication, and the difficult nature of the road between the
                    two cities, render the transport of goods a matter of considerable labour and
                    expense. The road from Santos to St Paulo is cut in many places through solid
                    rocks, and in others along the edge of precipices, which are fenced by parapets,
                    otherwise the traveller might be in danger of falling into an impervious thicket
                    more than thirty yards below him. Some fine springs, issuing from elevated
                    sources, form romantic cascades in the midst of detached rocks. In these places
                    the rocks consist of granite, and soft ferruginous sandstone, but everywhere
                    else the mountains are covered with thick woods; even on the road branches of
                    trees meet and form arbours, that defend the traveller from the rain, and
                    shelter him from the heat of the sun. There are two other seaports, but they are
                    situated at a much greater distance from St Paulo, and both are inconsiderable.
                    The harbour of Santos has a safe entrance, and is very secure. It is a strait,
                    having the island of St Vincente to the left, for the extent of half a mile,
                    when it takes a different direction. Here is situated the port, which has good
                    anchorage and regular soundings along the shore, and is the resort of many
                    vessels trading to the Plata. Hides and tallow are the principal articles of
                    export, and sugar, coffee, and some European articles are received in return.
                    Its intercourse with the capital is carried on by means of mules, which come
                    laden with the produce of the interior, and carry back salt, earthenwares,
                    cutlery, and other goods from Europe. Santos is tolerably well built, most of
                    the houses being of stone, and very ancient. The situation is by no means
                    healthy, as the country around is low, woody, and frequently deluged with rain.
                    The rice of this district, which is raised in great quantities, is esteemed the
                    best in Brazil, and the bananas are equally celebrated. The population,
                    consisting chiefly of merchants, shopkeepers, and artificers, amounts to about
                    7000. Not far to the north of Santos Bay is the fine island of St Sebastian,
                    which is above twenty miles in length. It is very fertile, and is reputed to
                    produce the best sugar, rum, and tobacco, as well as the finest cattle, in all
                    Brazil. There is a town situated on it; and opposite the island, on the
                    mainland, is St Sebastian, formerly of some note, but now reduced to 2000 or
                    3000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Amongst the other towns of St Paulo is Sorocaba, a flourishing place, situated on
                    a small river of the same name which flows into the Tiete, one of the
                    tributaries of the Parana. It is a great thoroughfare and market for mules from
                    Rio Grande do Sul; above thirty thousand of which, it is reckoned, pass through
                    Sorocaba annually. The population may be between five and six thousand, two
                    thirds of the whole being whites. Sorocaba is situated in the comarca of Hitu,
                    sixty miles west from the capital. Eighteen miles to the north-west is Hitu or
                    Ytu, the chief town of the comarca to which it gives name. It is situated at the
                    foot of the hills, and is excessively hot in the summer months. The soil in the
                    neighbourhood is said to be well adapted to the culture of the sugar-cane; but
                    it does not appear that any advantage is taken of this circumstance. There are
                    several other towns in the comarca, but none of them of any importance.</p>
                <p>The comarca of Curutiba is situated in the southern part of the province, and is
                    generally mountainous on the coast, but expands inland into beautiful and
                    salubrious campos. Mr Mawe speaks of these elevated plains as the finest
                    district in the country, and indeed one of the finest in the world, in point of
                    climate. Its soil and air are so excellent, that olives, grapes, apples,
                    peaches, and other fruits grow to as great maturity as in Europe, though they
                    are here almost in a wild state. Curutiba, the principal town, is stated to have
                    a magnificent church; all its structures are of stone or brick, and the streets
                    are paved. The district abounds in pine forests; hence its name <hi
                    rend="italic">cunt,</hi> pine, and <hi rend="italic">tiba,</hi> many; and the
                    cedar is also common in many parts. These forests abound with the mountain hog,
                    herds of which may be met with to the number sometimes of a hundred or more.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193493193" xml:id="kp-eb0717-3193-0162"/>
                <p>The Curutibanos, who are very robust, are chiefly employed in breeding cattle,
                    horses, and mules; but they also cultivate the ground. Paranagua, which, prior
                    to the year 1812, was the seat of the provincial magistracy, like Curutiba, is
                    built of stone, and stands on the southern bank of the river from which it
                    derives its name, about ten miles from the sea. The other villas of this comarca
                    are Villa Vovade St Luis, or Guaratuba, seven miles from the sea; Antonio, ten
                    miles west of Paranagua, at the extremity of the bay of that name; Cannanca,
                    situated upon a small island, about ten miles within the bar of the river of the
                    same name; and several others, including Nossa Senhora dos Prazeres, the most
                    southern town in the province, and much infested by the savages. The Indians
                    have still some villages, in which they live in a half-civilized state, making
                    occasional predatory attacks on the plantations and cattle of their neighbours.
                    On the other hand, numbers have become civilized, and reside peaceably in
                    settlements by themselves, imitating the manners and customs of the European or
                    Creole part of the population. The only town of importance which remains to be
                    noticed is Taubaté, a considerable place, and rivalling the capital in
                    antiquity. It is reckoned about a hundred miles north-east from St Paulo. In
                    former times, when the thirst for gold was at its height amongst the Paulistas,
                    a government establishment for the refining of the metal was founded here; and
                    the rivalry between the Tau-batenos and the Paulistas of Piratininga, rose to a
                    rancorous and implacable feud, and many sanguinary conflicts were the
                    consequences of this enmity, traces of which are said to exist at the present
                    day, although gold-washing is no longer pursued at Taubaté.</p>
                <p>According to official reports, dated in 1815, the population of the whole
                    province then amounted to 215,021 souls. By a previous census for the year 1808,
                    the number was 200,478, which shows an increase of nearly fifteen thousand in
                    seven years. The population in 1830 was said to be 610,000 souls. Considering
                    the size of the province, its vegetable wealth, and the number of its
                    inhabitants, the trade which it carries on is comparatively small, and the
                    proportion of pecuniary wealth in it is inferior to that of the more northern
                    provinces. The chief articles of export are sugars, rice, hides, and Peruvian
                    bark. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. r. r.)</hi></p>
