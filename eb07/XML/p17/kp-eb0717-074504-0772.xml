                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">PINDAR</label>, the most celebrated lyric poet that Greece
                    produced, was a native of Thebes in Boeotia, and born <hi rend="smallcaps">b.
                    c.</hi> 518, forty years before the expedition of Xerxes. He was the
                    contemporary of Aeschylus, but younger than Simonides, and somewhat older than
                    Bacchylides. It was scarcely to be expected that the early years of such a
                    distinguished poet should pass without some extraordinary event taking place,
                    and it is accordingly stated that he was exposed on a desert mountain, and that
                    he was fed by bees. Whether his father’s name was Diophantus or Scopelinus is
                    uncertain, but he was of the humble profession of a player on the flute, which
                    he at first intended that his son should pursue. Finding, however, that his
                    talents entitled him to occupy a higher position in the drama of life, he placed
                    him under Lasus of Hermione, a poet who then enjoyed a high reputation. Although
                    he lived in one of the most eventful periods of Grecian history, it does not
                    appear that he took any active part in the political struggles of his country.
                    It has been even doubted whether his feelings in favour of the liberty of Greece
                    were so ardent as to induce him to oppose the progress of the Persians. Before
                    the battle of Plataea a seditious movement had taken place in Thebes, and a
                    strong party had joined the Persians. In a passage of the poet written at this
                    period, Polybius imagines he can satisfactorily discover that Pindar was the
                    advocate of this step, and of course visits him with not unmerited reproach.
                    Stobaeus, however, gives this same passage more fully, and it there appears that
                    the poet recommends peace, not in reference to the Persians, but to his
                    fellow-citizens, who were tearing one another to pieces in civil broils. But a
                    still stronger proof that Polybius had taken a prejudiced view of his character,
                    is found in the circumstance that the poet wrote a dithyrambic poem after the
                    battle of Plataea, in which he spoke so warmly in admiration of Athens, that the
                    prevailing party amongst his countrymen took umbrage at it, and visited him with
                    punishment. The Athenians, on the other hand, erected a statue to his honour.
                    Again we find him comparing the victories of Hiero at Cumae and Himera to the
                    most illustrious engagements of the Greeks against the Persians. It is
                    impossible, therefore, to doubt that he joined heartily in support of Greek
                    independence, though he does not seem to have thought that a monarchical
                    government, justly and mildly administered, was unworthy of respect. Of his
                    private history nothing farther is known, except that he died at an advanced
                    age, probably about the year B. c. 439. According to one tradition, he died
                    whilst he was resting on the bosom of his young disciple Theoxenus, after he had
                    taken part in the active exercises of the gymnasium. He was the writer of many
                    poems, but they have all perished except some fragments, and those hymns which
                    he composed in honour of the conquerors at the solemn games of Greece. They are
                    divided into four books, of which the first contains those who had conquered at
                    the Olympic games, and consists of fourteen odes; the second, addressed to the
                    conquerors of the Pythian games, contains twelve odes; the third, addressed to
                    the Nemean conquerors, contains eleven odes; and the fourth, celebrating the
                    Isthmian conquerors, contains eight odes. It is difficult to believe that the
                    reputation of Pindar was founded upon the poetry which has come down to us, and
                    indeed his dithyrambic hymns are spoken of as his finest productions. He is no
                    doubt distinguished by a warm and enthusiastic genius, and by bold and
                    figurative expressions; but the abruptness of his transitions, and the numerous
                    allusions to persons and things now altogether unknown, and which, if known,
                    would not interest the reader, very much diminish the pleasure with which his
                    poetry is read. Still the opinion of Horace must for ever place him in the
                    foremost rank of lyric poets.</p>
                <p>Fiery, immense, profound he flowes As from a mountaille tumbling goes A torrent
                    fed with showers, flyes o’er The well-knowne limits of the shore. √∖ polio’s
                    bayes are due to him, Whether new words swolne to the brim, He (bold) through
                    dithyrambies throw, Where every new word doth loosely flow; Whether gods, kings,
                    or gods’ allies He chant, who by a just surprise, The Centaurs vanquish’d, and
                    supprest Chimaera’s dreadful flamingerest.</p>
