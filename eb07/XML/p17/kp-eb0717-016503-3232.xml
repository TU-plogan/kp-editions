                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">PEARCE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Dr</hi></label>, lord bishop of
                    Rochester, was the son of a distiller in High Holborn. He received his education
                    in Westminster school, where he was distinguished by his merit, and elected one
                    of the king’s scholars. In 1710, when he was twenty years old, he was elected to
                    Trinity College, Cambridge. During the first years of his residence at the
                    university, he occasionally amused himself with lighter compositions, some of
                    which are inserted in the Guardian and Spectator. In 1716, he published his
                    edition of Cicero <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Oratore,</hi> and,
                    at the desire of a friend, dedicated it to Lord Chief Justice Parker, afterwards
                    Earl of Macclesfield, to whom he was an entire stranger. This incident laid the
                    foundation of his future fortune; for Lord Parker soon recommended him to Dr
                    Bentley, master of Trinity, to be made one of the fellows; and the doctor
                    consented to this upon condition that his lordship would promise to “unmake” him
                    again as soon as it lay in his power to give him a living. In 1717, Mr Pearce
                    was ordained at the age of twenty-seven, having taken time enough, as he
                    thought, to attain a sufficient knowledge of the sacred office. In 1718, Lord
                    Parker was appointed chancellor, and invited Mr Pearce to live with him in the
                    capacity of his chaplain. In 1719, the latter was instituted into the rectory of
                    Stapplcford Abbots, in Essex; and, in 1720, into that of St Bartholomew, behind
                    the Royal Exchange, worth L.400 a year. In 1723, the lord chancellor presented
                    him to St Martin’s-in-the-Ficlds. His majesty, who was then at Hanover, had been
                    applied to in favour of Dr Claget, who was then along with him, and the doctor
                    actually kissed hands upon the occasion; but, upon the king’s return, the
                    chancellor disputed the point, and was permitted to present Mr Pearce. The
                    latter soon attracted the notice and esteem of persons in the highest stations
                    and of the greatest abilities. Besides Lord Parker, he could reckon amongst his
                    patrons or friends, Mr Pulteney, afterwards Earl of Bath, Archbishop Potter,
                    Lord Hardwicke, Sir Isaac Newton, and many other eminent personages. In 1724,
                    the degree of doctor of divinity was conferred on him by Archbishop Wake. The
                    same year he dedicated to his patron the Earl of Macclesfield his edition of
                    Longinus on the Sublime, with a new Latin version and notes.</p>
                <p>When the church of St Martin’s was rebuilt, Dr Pearce preached a sermon at the
                    consecration, which he afterwards printed, and accompanied with an essay on the
                    origin and progress of temples, traced from the rude stones which were first
                    used for altars to the noblc structure of Solomon, which he considers as the
                    first temple completely covered. His observations on the building called the
                    Temple of Dagon removes part of the difficulty which presents itself in the
                    narration of the manner in which Samson destroyed it.</p>
                <p>The deanery of Winchester having become vacant, Dr Pearce was appointed to it in
                    1739; and in the year 1744 he was elected prolocutor of the Lower House of
                    Convocation for the province of Canterbury. His friends now began to think of
                    him for the episcopal dignity; but he appeared rather to decline it. However,
                    after several difficulties had been started and removed, he consented to accept
                    the bishopric of Bangor, and promised Lord Hardwicke to do it with a good grace.
                    He accordingly made proper acknowledgements of the royal goodness, and was
                    consecrated on the 12th of February 1748. Upon the declining state of health of
                    Dr Wilcocks, bishop of Rochester, the bishop of Bangor was several times applied
                    to by Archbishop Herring to accept of Rochester, and the deanery of Westminster,
                    in exchange for Bangor; but he then for the first time signified his desire to
                    obtain leave to resign and retire to a private life. His lordship, however, upon
                    being pressed, suffered himself to be prevailed upon. “My Lord,” said lie to the
                    Duke of Newcastle, “your grace offers these dignities to me in so generous and
                    friendly a manner, that I promise you to accept them.” Upon the death of Bishop
                    Wilcocks he was accordingly promoted to the sec of Rochester and deanery of
                    Westminster in 1756. Bishop Sherlock died in 1761, and Lord Bath offered his
                    interest to get the Bishop of Rochester appointed to succeed him in the diocese
                    of London; but the latter told his lordship, that he had determined never to be
                    Bishop of London or Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>
                <p>In the year 1763, his lordship being then in the seventy-third year of his age,
                    and finding himself less fit for the business of his stations as bishop and
                    dean, informed his friend Lord Bath of his intention to resign both, and live in
                    a retired manner upon his private fortune. Lord Bath undertook to acquaint his
                    majesty, who named a day and hour, when the bishop was admitted alone into the
                    closet. He told the king, that he wished to have some interval between the
                    fatigues of business and eternity; and desired his majesty to consult proper
                    persons about the propriety and legality of his resignation. In about two months
                    the king informed him that Lord Mansfield saw no objection, and that Lord
                    Northington, who had been doubtful, on further consideration thought that the
                    request might be complied with. Unfortunately for the bishop, Lord Bath had
                    applied for Bishop Newton to succeed him. This alarmed the ministry, who thought
                    that no dignities should be obtained except through their hands. They therefore
                    opposed the resignation; and his majesty was informed that the bishops disliked
                    the design. His majesty sent to him again, and at a third audience told him that
                    he must think no more of resigning. The bishop replied, “Sire, I am all duty and
                    submission ;” and then retired. In 1768 he obtained leave to resign the deanery;
                    in 1773 he lost his lady; and after some months of lingering decay he died at
                    Little Ealing, on the 29th of June 1774.</p>
                <p>This eminent prelate distinguished himself in every part of his life by the
                    virtues proper to his station. His Literary abilities, and application to sacred
                    and philological learning, appear by his works, the principal of which are, 1. A
                    Letter to the Clergy of the Church of England, on occasion of the Bishop of
                    Rochester’s commitment to the Tower, 1722; 2. Miracles of Jesus vindicated, 1727
                    and 1728; 3. A Review of the Text of Milton, 1733; 4. Two Letters against Dr
                    Middleton, occasioned by the doctor’s letter to Waterland, on the publication of
                    his Treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">Scripture Vindicated,</hi> 1752; and, 5.
                    a Commentary, with notes, on the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193493245"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-3245-0166"/>four Evangelists and the Acts of the Apostles,
                    together with a new translation of St Paul’s first Epistle to the Corinthians,
                    and a paraphrase, with notes, in two vols. 4to.</p>
