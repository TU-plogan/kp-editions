                    English poet, celebrated for his translation of Virgil’s Aeneid, was born in the
                    year 1699. Having studied four years at New College, Oxford, he was presented to
                    the living of Pimperne, in Dorsetshire, which he held during the remainder of
                    his life. He had so poetical a turn, that whilst he was a school-boy he wrote
                    two large folios of manuscript poems, one of which contained an entire
                    translation of Lucan. He was much esteemed <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500967"

                    celebrated Dr Young, who used familiarly to call him his son. Next to his
                    translation of Virgil, Mr Pitt gained the greatest reputation by his excellent
                    English version of Vida’s Art of Poetry. This amiable poet died in the year
                    1748, without leaving, it is said, one enemy behind him.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Pitt,</hi><hi rend="italic">William,</hi> first Earl of
                    Chatham, a celebrated British statesman and orator, was born on the 15th of
                    November 1708. He was the youngest son of Mr Robert Pitt of Boconnock, in
                    Cornwall, and grandson of Mr Thomas Pitt, governor of Fort St George in the East
                    Indies in the reign of Queen Anne, who sold an extraordinary diamond to the king
                    of France for L.135,000, and thus obtained the name of <hi rend="italic">Diamond
                    Pitt.</hi> The subject of this notice was educated at Eton, whence, in January
                    1726, he was removed to Trinity College, Oxford, which he entered as a gentleman
                    commoner. Here the superiority of his mind soon attracted notice, and he was
                    also remarked for his powers of elocution; but, at the age of sixteen, he
                    experienced the first attacks of an hereditary and incurable gout, which
                    continued at intervals to torment him during the remainder of his life. He
                    quitted the university without taking a degree, and visited France and Italy,
                    whence he returned without having received much benefit from his excursion. His
                    father was now dead, and as he had left very little to the younger children, it
                    became necessary that William should choose a profession. He decided for the
                    army, and a cornet’s commission was procured for him in the Blues. But, small as
                    his fortune was, his family had the power and the inclination to serve him. At
                    the general election of 1734, his elder brother Thomas was chosen both for Old
                    Sarum and for Oakhampton. When parliament met in 1735, Thomas made his election
                    for Oakhampton, and William was returned for Old Sarum. At the time when he
                    obtained a seat in parliament he was not quite twenty-one years of age. The
                    intention of bringing him thus early into parliament was to oppose Sir Robert
                    Walpole, who had now been fourteen years at the head of affairs. In fact, his
                    abilities soon attracted notice, and he spoke with great vehemence against the
                    Spanish convention in 1738. It was on the occasion of the bill for registering
                    seamen in 1740, which he opposed as arbitrary and unjustifiable, that he is said
                    to have made his celebrated reply to Mr Walpole, who had taunted him on account
                    of his youth; but the language of that reply, as it now stands, is not the
                    diction of Pitt, who may have said something like what is ascribed to him, but
                    of Dr Johnson, who then reported, or rather wrote, the debates for the
                    Gentleman’s Magazine. In 1746 Pitt was appointed joint vice-treasurer of
                    Ireland, and in the same year treasurer and paymaster-general of the army, and a
                    privy-councillor. The office of paymaster he discharged with such inflexible
                    integrity, even refusing many of the ordinary perquisites of office, that bis
                    bitterest enemies could lay nothing to his charge, and he soon became the
                    darling of the people. At this time he was poor enough; but Heaven directed to
                    him a portion of wealth altogether unexpected. The old Duchess of Marlborough,
                    who carried to the grave the reputation of being decidedly the best hater of her
                    time, and who most cordially detested Walpole and his associates, left him a
                    legacy of L.10,000, in consideration of “the noble defence he had made for the
                    support of the laws of England, and to prevent the ruin of his country.” In the
                    year 1755, Mr Pitt, deeming it necessary to offer a strong opposition to the
                    continental connections then formed by the ministry, resigned his places, and
                    remained some time out of office. But his resignation having alarmed the people,
                    he was, in December 1756, called to fill a higher office, and appointed
                    secretary of state. In this situation, however, he was more successful in
                    obtaining the confidence of the public than in conciliating the favour of the
                    king, some of whose predilections he had conceived himself bound to oppose. The
                    consequence was, that soon afterwards Mr Pitt was removed from office, whilst Mr
                    Legge, with some others of bis friends, were at the same time dismissed. But the
                    nation had a mind not to be deprived of his services. The most exalted notion
                    had been formed of him throughout the country; his patriotism was believed to be
                    as pure and disinterested as his abilities and eloquence were confessedly
                    transcendent; and his colleagues shared in the same general favour. In a word,
                    the opinion of the country was so strongly expressed, both directly and
                    indirectly, that the king thought it prudent to yield; and, on the 25th of June
                    1757, Mr Pitt was again appointed secretary of state, Mr Legge became chancellor
                    of the exchequer, and the other arrangements were made conformably to his
                    wishes. Mr Pitt was now in effect prime minister; and the change which soon took
                    place in the aspect of public affairs evinced the ability of his measures, and
                    the vigour of his administration. His spirit animated the whole nation; and his
                    activity pervaded every department of the public service. His plans were ably
                    conceived, and promptly executed; and the depression, which had been occasioned
                    by want of energy in the cabinet, and ill success in the field, was followed by
                    exertion, confidence, and triumph. The whole fortune of the war was changed. In
                    every quarter of the globe success attended our arms. The boldest attempts were
                    made both by land and by sea, and almost every attempt proved fortunate. In
                    America, the French lost Quebec; in Africa, they were deprived of their
                    principal settlements; their power was abridged in the East Indies; in Europe
                    their armies were defeated; and, to render their humiliation more complete,
                    their navy, their commerce, and their finances were almost ruined. Amidst this
                    full tide of success George II. died, on the 25th of October 1760, and was
                    succeeded by George HL, who ascended the throne at a time when the French court
                    had just succeeded in obtaining the cooperation <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    Spain.</p>
                <p>The treaty commonly called family compact had been secretly concluded; but the
                    English minister, correctly informed of the hostile intentions of Spain,
                    determined to anticipate that power, and strike a blow before this new enemy
                    should be fully prepared for action. He therefore proposed in the council an
                    immediate declaration of war against Spain; urging forcibly that the present was
                    the favourable moment for humbling the whole house of Bourbon. But when he
                    stated this opinion in the privy council, the other ministers, averse to so bold
                    a measure, opposed the proposition of the premier, alleging the necessity of
                    mature deliberation before declaring war against so powerful a state. Irritated
                    by the unexpected opposition of his colleagues, Pitt replied, “I will not give
                    them leave to think; this is the time, let us crush the whole house of Bourbon.
                    But if the members of this board are of a different opinion, this is the last
                    time 1 shall ever mix in its councils. I was called into the ministry by the
                    voice of the people, and to them I hold myself answerable for my conduct. I am
                    to thank the ministers of the late king for their support; I have served my
                    country with success; but I will not be responsible for the conduct of the war
                    any longer than while I have the direction of it.” To this declaration the
                    president of the council answered, “I find the gentleman is determined to leave
                    us; nor can I say that I am sorry for it, since he would otherwise have
                    certainly compelled us to leave him. But if he is resolved to assume the right
                    of advising his majesty, and directing the operations of the war, to what
                    purpose are we called to this council? When he talks of being responsible to the
                    people, he talks the language of the House of Commons, and forgets that at this
                    board he is responsible only to the king. However, though he may possibly have
                    convinced himself of his infallibility, still it ren⅛ains that we should be
                    equally convinced before we can resign our un∙</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500980" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0980-0761"/>
                <p>derstandings to his direction, or join with him in the measure he proposes.” The
                    opposition he thus encountered the nation attributed to the growing influence of
                    Lord Bute. But however this may have been, Mr Pitt was a man of too high, not to
                    say imperious a temper, to remain as the nominal head of a cabinet which he was
                    no longer able to direct. Accordingly, on the 5th of October 1761, he resigned
                    all his appointments; and, as some reward for his services, his wife was created
                    Baroness Chatham in her own right, whilst a pension of L.3000 a year was settled
                    on the lives of himself, his lady, and his eldest son.</p>
                <p>No fallen minister, if fallen he could be called, ever carried with him more
                    completely the confidence and regret of the nation, whose affairs he had so
                    successfully administered. But at this time the king was also popular; and the
                    war being continued by his new ministers with vigour and success, no discontent
                    appeared until after the conclusion of the peace. The impulse given by Mr Pitt
                    had carried them forward in the same direction which he had pursued; but they
                    were equally incapable of profiting by the advantages which had been already
                    gained, or of prosecuting the war until the objects for which it was originally
                    undertaken should be accomplished. The victories gained over France and Spain
                    having greatly elated the nation, the feeling which almost universally prevailed
                    amongst the people was, that we should either dictate peace as conquerors, or
                    continue the war until our adversaries were more effectually humbled. This was
                    likewise Mr Pitt’s opinion. Accordingly, when the preliminaries of peace came to
                    be discussed in parliament, he went down to the House of Commons, though
                    suffering severely from an attack of the gout, and spoke for nearly three hours
                    in the debate; giving his opinion on each article of the treaty in succession,
                    and, upon the whole, maintaining that it was inadequate to the conquests of our
                    arms, and the just expectations of the country. Peace was, however, concluded on
                    the lOth of February 1763, and Mr Pitt continued unemployed.</p>
                <p>After his resignation in 1761, Mr Pitt conducted himself in a manner worthy of
                    his high character. So far from giving a vexatious and undiscriminating
                    opposition to the ministry which had succeeded his own, he maintained his
                    popularity in dignified retirement, and came forward only when questions of
                    great importance were to be discussed. One of these occurred in 1764, on the
                    subject of general warrants, the illegality of which he denounced with all the
                    energy and vigour of his eloquence. Another occasion, when he came forward in
                    all his strength, was the consideration of the discontents which had arisen on
                    account of the stamp-act. In March 1766, the repeal of that act having been
                    proposed by the Rockingham ministry, Mr Pitt, though not connected with them,
                    ably supported the measure, which was carried, but whether prudently or the
                    contrary is still a matter of dispute. About this time Mr Pitt had devised to
                    him by will a considerable estate in Somersetshire, the property of Sir λVilliam
                    Pynsent of Burton-Pynsent in that county, who, from admiration of his public
                    character, disinherited his own relations, in order to bequeath to him the bulk
                    of his fortune. After the dissolution of the Rockingham ministry, a new
                    administration was formed, and, in 1766, Mr Pitt was appointed lord privy seal.
                    At the same time he was created a peer by the titles of Viscount Pitt of
                    Burton-Pynsent in the county of Somerset, and Earl of Chatham in the county of
                    Kent.</p>
                <p>Whatever might be his motives in accepting a peerage, it is certain that it
                    proved very prejudicial to his character, and that in consequence he sank as
                    much in popularity as he rose in nominal dignity. The great commoner, as he was
                    sometimes called, had formed a rank for himself, on the basis of his talents and
                    exertions, which titular honours might obscure, but could not illustrate; and,
                    with the example of Pulteney before him, he should have been careful to preserve
                    it untarnished by empty distinctions, shared by the mean and the worthless as
                    well as by the great, the gifted, and the good. Lord Chatham, however, did not
                    long continue in office after being elevated to the peerage. On the 2d of
                    November 1768, he resigned the place of lord privy seal, and never afterwards
                    held any public employment; nor does he appear to have been at all desirous of
                    returning to office. He was now sixty, and the gout, by which he had so long
                    been afflicted, disabled him, by its frequent and violent attacks, for close and
                    regular application to business. In the intervals of his disorder, however, he
                    failed not to exert himself upon questions of great magnitude; and, in 1775,
                    1776, and 1777, he most strenuously opposed the measures pursued by the
                    ministers in the contest with America. His last appearance in the House of Lords
                    was on the 2d of April 1778. He was then very ill, and much debilitated; but the
                    question was important, being a motion of the Duke of Richmond to address his
                    majesty to remove the ministers, and to make peace with America on any terms.
                    His lordship made a long speech, in which he summoned up all his remaining
                    strength to pour out his disapprobation of a measure so inglorious. But the
                    effort overcame him, for in attempting to rise a second time, he fell down in a
                    convulsive fit; and though he recovered for the time, his disorder continued to
                    increase until the 11th of May, when he expired at his seat at Hayes. His death
                    was lamented as a national loss. As soon as the news reached the House of
                    Commons, which was then sitting, Colonel Barré made a motion, that an address
                    should be presented to his majesty, requesting that the Earl of Chatham should
                    be buried at the public expense. But Mr Rigby having proposed the erection of a
                    statue to his memory, as more likely to perpetuate the sense of his great merits
                    entertained by the public, this was unanimously agreed to. A bill was soon
                    afterwards passed, by which L.4000 a year was settled upon John, now Earl of
                    Chatham, and the heirs of the late earl to whom that title might descend. His
                    lordship was married in 1754 to Lady Hester, sister of Earl Temple, by whom he
                    had three sons and two daughters.</p>
                <p>The principal outlines of Pitt’s character have been variously sketched,
                    sometimes with, and sometimes without, any depth of shadow. The truth is, that
                    there scarcely ever lived a person who had less claim to be painted altogether
                    <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">beau,</hi> or who so little merited
                    unsparing censure. “That fie was a great man cannot for a moment be doubted; but
                    his was not a complete and well-proportioned greatness. The public life of
                    Hampden or of Somers resembles a regular drama, which can be criticised as a
                    whole, and every scene of which is to be viewed in connection with the main
                    action. The public life <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Pitt, on the other hand, is a
                    rude though striking piece, abounding in incongruities, and without any unity of
                    plan, but redeemed by some noble passages, the effect of which is increased by
                    the tameness or extravagance of what precedes and of what follows. His opinions
                    were unfixed; and his conduct, at some of the most important conjunctures of his
                    life, was evidently determined by pride and resentment. He had one fault, which
                    of all human faults is most rarely found in company with true greatness. He was
                    extremely affected. He was an almost solitary instance of a man of real genius,
                    and of a brave, lofty, and commanding spirit, without simplicity of character.
                    He was an actor in the closet, an actor in the council, an actor in parliament;
                    and even in private society he could not lay aside his theatrical tones and
                    attitudes. We know that one of the most distinguished of his partisans often
                    complained that he could never obtain admittance to Lord Chatham’s room till
                    everything was ready for the representation; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500993"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-0993-0762"/>till the light was thrown with Rembrandt-like
                    effect on the head of the illustrious performer; till the flannels had been
                    arranged with the air of Grecian drapery, and the crutch placed as gracefully as
                    that of Belisarius or Lear.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Edinburgh Review, vol. lix. pp. 509, 510.</p></note> Yet,
                    with all his faults and affectations, he possessed, in a very extraordinary
                    degree, many of the elements of true greatness. He had splendid talents, strong
                    passions, quick sensibility, and vehement enthusiasm for the grand and the
                    beautiful. There was something about him which ennobled even tergiversation
                    itself. He often went wrong, very far wrong; but, amidst the abasement of error,
                    he still retained what he had received from nature, “an intense and glowing
                    mind.” In an age of low and despicable prostitution, the age of Dodington and
                    Sandys, it was something to have a man who might perhaps, under some strong
                    excitement, have been tempted to ruin his country, but who never would have
                    stooped to pilfer from her; a man whose errors arose, not from a sordid desire
                    of gain, but from a fierce thirst of power, glory, and vengeance. “History owes
                    him this attestation, that, at a time when anything short of direct embezzlement
                    of the public money was considered as quite fair in public men, he showed the
                    most scrupulous disinterestedness; that, at a time when it seemed to be
                    generally taken for granted that government could be upheld only by the basest
                    and most immoral arts, he appealed to the better and nobler parts of human
                    nature; that he made a brave and splendid attempt to do, by means of public
                    opinion, what no other statesman of his day thought it possible to do except by
                    means of corruption; that he looked for support, not, like the Pelhams, to a
                    strong aristocratical connection, not, like Bute, to the personal favour of the
                    sovereign, but to the middle class of Englishmen; that he inspired that class
                    with a firm confidence in his integrity and ability; that, backed by them, he
                    forced an unwilling court and an unwilling oligarchy to admit him to an ample
                    share of power; and that he used his power in such a maimer as clearly proved
                    that he had sought it, not for the sake of profit or patronage, but from a wish
                    to establish for himself a great and durable reputation by means of eminent
                    services rendered to the state.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>A great many unmeaning phrases have been employed, and much rhetorical
                    exaggeration has been expended, in attempts to characterize Lord Chatham’s style
                    of eloquence. The following estimate by Mr Macaulay, from whom we have borrowed
                    some of the foregoing observations, is at once deep, discriminating, and
                    brilliant.</p>
                <p>“In our time the audience of a member of parliament is the nation. The three or
                    four hundred persons who may be present when a speech is delivered, may be
                    pleased or disgusted by the voice and action of the orator; but in the reports
                    which are read the next day by hundreds of thousands, the difference between the
                    noblest and the meanest figure, between the richest and the shrillest tones,
                    between the most graceful and the most uncouth gesture, altogether vanishes. A
                    hundred years ago, scarcely any report of what passed within the walls of the
                    House of Commons was suffered to get abroad. In those times, therefore, the
                    impression which a speaker might make on the persons who actually heard him was
                    everything. The impression out of doors was hardly worth a thought. In the
                    parliaments of that time, therefore, as in the ancient commonwealths, those
                    qualifications which enhance the immediate effect of a speech were far more
                    important ingredients in the composition of an orator than they would appear to
                    be in our time. All those qualifications Pitt possessed in the highest degree.
                    On the stage, he would have been the finest Brutus or Coriolanus ever seen.
                    Those who saw him in his decay, when his health was broken, when his mind was
                    jangled, when he had been removed from that stormy assembly of which he
                    thoroughly knew the temper, and over which he possessed unbounded influence, to
                    a small, a torpid, and an unfriendly audience, say that his speaking was then,
                    for the most part, a low monotonous muttering, audible only to those who sate
                    close to him; that, when violently excited, he sometimes raised his voice for a
                    few minutes, but that it soon sank again into an unintelligible murmur. Such was
                    the Earl of Chatham; but such was not William Pitt. His figure, when he first
                    appeared in parliament, was strikingly graceful and commanding, his features
                    high and noble, his eye full of fire. His voice, even when it sank to a whisper,
                    was heard to the remotest benches; when he strained it to its full extent, the
                    sound rose like the swell of the organ of a great cathedral, shook the house
                    with its peal, and was heard through lobbies and down stair-cases, to the court
                    of requests and the precincts of Westminster Hall. He cultivated all these
                    eminent advantages with the most assiduous care. His action is described by a
                    very malignant observer as equal to that of Garrick. His play of countenance was
                    wonderful; he frequently disconcerted a hostile orator by a single glance of
                    indignation or scorn. Every tone, from the impassioned cry to the thrilling
                    aside, was perfectly at his command. It is by no means improbable, that the
                    pains which he took to improve his great personal advantages had, in some
                    respects, a prejudicial operation, and tended to nourish in him that passion for
                    theatrical effect which was one of the most conspicuous blemishes in his
                    character.</p>
                <p>·“But it was not solely or principally to outward accomplishments that Pitt owed
                    the vast influence which, during nearly thirty years, he exercised over the
                    House of Commons. He was undoubtedly a great orator; and from the descriptions
                    of his contemporaries, and the fragments of his speeches which still remain, it
                    is not difficult to discover the nature and extent of his oratorical powers.</p>
                <p>“He was no speaker of set speeches. His few prepared discourses were complete
                    failures. The elaborate panegyric which he pronounced on General Wolfe was
                    considered as the very worst of all his performances. ‘ No man,’ says a critic,
                    who had often heard him, ‘ ever knew so little what he was going to say.’
                    Indeed, his facility amounted to a vice; he was not the master, but the slave of
                    his own speech. So little self-command had he when once he felt the impulse,
                    that he did not like to take part in a debate when his mind was full of an
                    important secret of state. ‘ I must sit still,’ he once said to Lord Shelburne
                    on such an occasion, ‘ for when once I am up, everything that is in my mind
                    comes out.’</p>
                <p>“Yet he was not a great debater. That he should not have been so when he first
                    entered the House of Commons, is not strange; scarcely any person has ever
                    become so without long practice and many failures. It was by slow degrees, as
                    Burke said, that Mr Fox became the most brilliant and powerful debater that
                    parliament ever saw. Mr Fox himself attributed his own success to the resolution
                    which he formed when very young, of speaking, well or ill, at least once every
                    night. ‘ During five whole sessions,’ he used to say, ‘ I spoke every night but
                    one; and I regret only that I did not speak that night too.’ Indeed it would be
                    difficult to name any great debater who has not made himself a master of his art
                    at the expense of his audience.</p>
                <p>“But as this art is one which even the ablest men have seldom acquired without
                    long practice, so it is one which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193501006"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-1006-0763"/>men of respectable abilities, with assiduous and
                    intrepid practice, seldom fail to acquire. It is singular that, in such an art,
                    Pitt, a man of splendid talents, great fluency, and dauntless boldness, whose
                    whole life was passed in parliamentary conflict, and who, during several years,
                    was the leading minister of the crown In the House of Commons, should never have
                    attained to high excellence. He spoke without premeditation; but his speech
                    followed the course of his own thoughts, and not that of the previous
                    discussion. He could, indeed, treasure up in his memory some detached expression
                    of an hostile orator, and make it the text for sparkling ridicule or burning
                    invective. Some of the most celebrated bursts of his eloquence were called forth
                    by an unguarded word, a laugh, or a cheer. But this was the only sort of reply
                    in which he appears to have excelled. He was perhaps the only great English
                    orator who did not think it an advantage to have the last word, and who
                    generally spoke by choice before his most formidable opponents. His merit was
                    almost entirely rhetorical. He did not succeed either in exposition or
                    refutation; but his speeches abounded with lively illustrations, striking
                    apophthegms, well told anecdotes, happy allusions, passionate appeals. His
                    invective and sarcasm were tremendous. Perhaps no English orator was ever so
                    much feared.</p>
                <p>“But that which gave most effect to his declamation, was the air of sincerity, of
                    vehement feeling, or moral elevation, which belonged to all that he said. His
                    style was not always in the purest taste. Several contemporary judges pronounced
                    it too florid. Walpole, in the midst of the rapturous eulogy which he pronounces
                    on one of Pitt’s greatest orations, owns that some of the metaphors were too
                    forced. The quotations and classical stories of the orator are sometimes too
                    trite for a clever school-boy. But these were niceties for which the audience
                    cared little. The enthusiasm of the orator infected all who were near him; his
                    ardour and his noble bearing put fire into the most frigid conceit, and gave
                    dignity to the most puerile allusion.’<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Edinburgh Review, noi spura.</p></note></p>
                <p>Such is the character of this great statesman and orator, as drawn by one
                    masterly hand. It may perhaps both instruct and interest our readers, if we
                    present another, delineated by an artist equally distinguished for the vigour,
                    judgment, and fidelity with which he paints such grand pieces for the gallery of
                    history. The preceding, as we have already said, is from the pen of Mr Macaulay:
                    the following is understood to be from that of Lord Brougham.</p>
                <p>“The first place among the great qualities which distinguished Lord Chatham, is
                    unquestionably due to firmness of purpose, resolute determination in the pursuit
                    of his objects. This was the characteristic of the younger Brutus, as he said,
                    who had spared his life to fall by his hand,— <hi rend="italic">(^uicquid vult,
                    id</hi><hi rend="italic">valde vult;</hi> and although extremely apt to be shown
                    in excess, it must be admitted to be the foundation of all true greatness of
                    character. Everything, however, depends upon the endowments in whose company it
                    is found; and in Lord Chatham these were of a very high order. The quickness
                    with which he could ascertain his object, and discover his road to it, was fully
                    commensurate with his perseverance and his boldness in pursuing it; the firmness
                    of grasp with which he held his advantage was fully equalled by the rapidity of
                    the glance with which he discovered it. Add to this a mind eminently fertile in
                    resources, a courage which nothing could daunt in the choice of his means, a
                    resolution equally indomitable in their application, a genius, in short,
                    original and daring, which bounded over the petty obstacles raised by ordinary
                    men,—their squeamishness, and their precedents, and their forms, and their
                    regularities,—and forced away its path through the entanglements of this base
                    undergrowth to the worthy object ever in his view, the prosperity and the renown
                    of his country. Far superior to the paltry objects of a grovelling ambition, and
                    regardless alike of party and of personal considerations, he constantly set
                    before his eyes the highest duty of a public man, to further the interests of
                    his species. In pursuing his course towards that goal, he disregarded alike the
                    frowns of power and the gales of popular applause; exposed himself undaunted to
                    the vengeance of the court, while he battled against its corruptions, and
                    confronted, unabashed, the rudest shocks of public indignation, while he
                    resisted the dictates of pernicious agitators; and could conscientiously
                    exclaim, with an illustrious statesman of antiquity, ‘ Ego hoc animo semper fui
                    ut invidiam virtute partam, gloriam non invidiam putarem.’</p>
                <p>“Nothing could be more entangled than the foreign policy of this country at the
                    time when he took the supreme direction of her affairs; nothing could be more
                    disastrous than the aspect of her fortunes in every quarter of the globe. With a
                    single ally in Europe, the king of Prussia, and him beset by a combination of
                    all the continental powers in unnatural union to effect his destruction; with an
                    army of insignificant amount, and commanded by men only desirous of grasping at
                    the emoluments, without doing the duties or incurring the risks of their
                    profession; with a navy that could hardly keep the sea, and whose chiefs vied
                    with their comrades on shore in earning the character given them by the new
                    minister, of being utterly unfit to be trusted in any enterprise accompanied
                    with ‘ the least appearance of danger with a generally prevailing dislike of
                    both services, which at once repressed all desire of joining either, and damped
                    all public spirit in the country, by extinguishing all hope of success, and even
                    all love of glory; it was hardly possible for a nation to be placed in
                    circumstances more inauspicious to military exertions; and yet war raged in
                    every quarter of the world where our dominion extended, while the territories of
                    our only ally, as well as those of our own sovereign in Germany, were invaded by
                    France, and her forces by sea and land menaced our shores. In the distant
                    possessions of the crown the same want of enterprise and of spirit prevailed.
                    Armies in the West were paralysed by the inaction of a captain who would hardly
                    take the pains to write a despatch recording the nonentity of his operations;
                    and in the East, while frightful disasters were brought upon our settlements by
                    barbarian powers, the only military capacity that appeared in their defence was
                    the accidental display of genius and valour by ’ a merchant’s clerk, who thus
                    raised himself to celebrity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    forlorn state of affairs, rendering it as impossible to think of peace, as it
                    seemed hopeless to continue the yet inevitable war, the base and sordid views of
                    politicians kept pace with the mean spirit of the military caste; and parties
                    were split or united, not upon any difference or agreement of public principle,
                    but upon mere questions of patronage, and share in the public spoil, while all

                    of gain.</p>
                <p>“As soon as Mr Pitt took the helm, the steadiness of the hand that held it came
                    to be felt in every motion of the vessel. There was no more of wavering
                    councils, of torpid inaction, of listless expectancy, of abject despondency. His
                    firmness gave confidence, his spirit roused courage, his vigilance secured
                    exertion, in every department under his sway. Each man, from the first lord of
                    the admiralty down to the most humble clerk in the victualling office; each
                    soldier, from the commander-in-chief to the most obscure contractor or
                    commissary; now felt assured that <pb break="no" facs="nls:193501019"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-1019-0764"/>he was acting or indolent under the eye of one who
                    knew his duties and his means as well as his own, and who would very certainly
                    make all defaulters, whether through misfeasance or through nonfeasance,
                    accountable for whatever detriment the commonwealth might sustain at their
                    hands. Over his immediate coadjutors, his influence swiftly obtained an
                    ascendant which it ever after retained uninterrupted. Upon his first proposition
                    for changing the conduct of the war, he stood single among his colleagues, and
                    tendered his resignation should they persist in their dissent; they at once
                    succumbed, and from that hour ceased to have an opinion of their own upon any
                    branch of the public affairs. Nay, so absolutely was he determined to have the
                    control of those measures, of which he knew the responsibility rested upon him
                    alone, that he insisted upon the first lord of the admiralty not having the
                    correspondence of his own department; and no less eminent a naval character
                    .than Lord Anson, with his junior lords, were obliged to sign the orders issued
                    by Mr Pitt, while the writing was covered over from their eyes.</p>
                <p>“The effects of this change in the whole management of the public business, and
                    in all the plans of the government, as well as in their execution, were speedily
                    made manifest to all the world. The German troops were sent home, and a
                    well-regulated militia being established to defend the country, a large
                    disposable force was distributed over the various points whence the enemy might
                    be annoyed. France, attacked on some points and menaced on others, was compelled
                    to retire from Germany, soon afterwards suffered the most disastrous defeats,
                    and, instead of threatening England and her allies with invasion, had to defend
                    herself against attack, suffering severely in several of her most important
                    naval stations. No less than sixteen islands, and settlements, and fortresses of
                    importance were taken from her in America, and Asia, and Africa, including all
                    her West Indian colonies except St Domingo, and all her settlements in the East.
                    The whole important province of Canada was likewise conquered; and the Havannah
                    was taken from Spain. Beside this, the seas were swept clear of the fleets that
                    had so lately been insulting all our colonies, and even all our coasts. Many
                    general actions were fought and gained; one among them the most decisive that
                    had ever been fought by our navy. Thirty-six sail of the line were taken or
                    destroyed, fifty frigates, forty-five sloops of war. So brilliant a course of
                    uninterrupted success had never, in modern times, attended the arms of any
                    nation carrying on war with other states equal to it in civilization, and nearly
                    a match in power. But it is a more glorious feature in this unexampled
                    administration which history has to record, when it adds, that all public
                    distress had disappeared; all discontent in any quarter, both of the colonies
                    and parent state, had ceased; that no oppression was anywhere practised, no
                    abuse suffered to prevail; that no encroachments were made upon the rights of
                    the subject, no malversations tolerated in the possessors of power; and that
                    England, for the first time and for the last time, presented the astonishing
                    picture of a nation supporting without murmur a widely extended and costly war,
                    and a people, hitherto torn with conflicting parties, so united in the service
                    of the commonwealth that the voice of faction had ceased in the land, and any
                    discordant whisper was heard no more. ‘ These,’ said the son of his first and
                    most formidable adversary, walpole, when informing his correspondent abroad,
                    that the session, as usual, had ended without any kind of opposition, or even of
                    debate, ‘ These are the doings of Mr Pitt, and they are wondrous in our
                    eyes.’</p>
                <p>“To genius irregularity is incident, and the greatest genius is often marked by
                    eccentricity, as if it disdained to move in the vulgar orbit. Hence he who is
                    fitted by his nature, and trained by his habits, to be an accomplished ‘ pilot
                    in extremity,’ and whose inclinations carry him forth to seek the deep when the
                    waves run high, may be found, if not ‘ to steer too near the shore,’ yet to
                    despise the sunken rocks which they that can only be trusted in calm weather
                    would have more surely avoided. To this rule it cannot be said that Lord Chatham
                    afforded any exception; and although a plot had certainly been formed to eject
                    him from the ministry, leaving the chief control of affairs in the feeble hands
                    of Lord Bute, whose only support was court favour, and whose only talent lay in
                    an expertness at intrigue, yet there can be little doubt that this scheme was
                    only rendered practicable by the hostility which the great minister’s unbending
                    habits, his contempt of ordinary men, and his neglect of everyday matters, had
                    raised against him among all the creatures both of Downing Street and St
                    James’s. In fact, his colleagues, who necessarily felt humbled by his
                    superiority, were needlessly mortified by the constant display of it; and it
                    would have betokened a still higher reach of understanding, as well as a purer
                    fabric of patriotism, if he whose great capacity threw those subordinates into
                    the shade, and before whose vigour in action they were sufficiently willing to
                    yield, had united a little suavity in his demeanour with his extraordinary
                    powers, nor made it always necessary for them to acknowledge as well as to feel
                    their inferiority. It is certain that the insulting arrangement of the
                    admiralty, to which reference has been already made, while it lowered that
                    department in the public opinion, rendered all connected with him his personal
                    enemies; and, indeed, though there have, since his days, been prime ministers
                    whom he would never have suffered to sit even as puny lords at his boards, yet
                    were one like himself again to govern the country, the admiralty chief who might
                    be far inferior to Lord Anson would never submit to the humiliation inflicted
                    upon that gallant and skilful captain. Mr Pitt’s policy seemed formed upon the
                    assumption that either each public functionary was equal to himself in boldness,
                    activity, and resource, or that he was to preside over and animate each
                    department in person; and his confidence was such in his own powers, that he
                    reversed the maxim of governing, never to force your way where you can win it;
                    and always disdained to insinuate where he could dash in, or to persuade where
                    he could command. It thus happened that his colleagues were but nominally
                    coadjutors, and though they durst not thwart him, yet rendered no heart-service
                    to aid his schemes. Indeed it has clearly appeared since his time, that they
                    were chiefly induced to yield him implicit obedience, and leave the undivided
                    direction of all operations in his hands, by the expectation that the failure of
                    what they were wont to sneer at as <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> Mr Pitt’s
                    visions,’ would turn the tide of public opinion against him, and prepare his
                    downfall from a height of which they felt that there was no one but himself able
                    to dispossess him.”</p>
                <p>The same powerful writer, having thus sketched the character of the statesman,
                    proceeds next to delineate that of the orator, as far as this can now be done
                    from the extremely scanty and imperfect materials which have been preserved. The
                    fame of Lord Chatham’s eloquence is, in truth, almost wholly traditional.</p>
                <p>“There is indeed hardly any eloquence, of ancient or of modern times, of which so
                    little that can be relied on as authentic has been preserved; unless perhaps
                    that of Pericles, Julius Caesar, and Lord Bolingbroke. Of the actions of the two
                    first we have sufficient records, as we have of Lord Chatham’s; of their
                    speeches we have little that can be regarded as genuine; although, by
                    unquestionable tradition, we know that each of them was second^only to the
                    greatest orator of their respective countries; while of Bolingbroke we only
                    know, from Dean Swift, that he was <pb break="no" facs="nls:193501032"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-1032-0765"/>the most accomplished speaker of his time; and it
                    is related of Mr Pitt (the younger), that when the conversation rolled upon lost
                    works, and some said they should prefer restoring the books of Livy, some of
                    Tacitus, and some a Latin tragedy, he at once decided for a speech of
                    Bolingbroke. What we know of his own father’s oratory is much more to be gleaned
                    from contemporary panegyrics, and accounts of its effects, than from the scanty,
                    and for the most part doubtful, remains which have reached us.</p>
                <p>“All accounts, however, concur in representing those effects to have been
                    prodigious. The spirit and vehemence which animated its greater passages, their
                    perfect application to the subject-matter of debate, the appositeness of his
                    invective to the individual assailed, the boldness of the feats which he
                    ventured upon, the grandeur of the ideas which he unfolded, the heart-stirring
                    nature of his appeals, are all confessed by the united testimony of all his
                    contemporaries; and the fragments which remain bear out to a considerable extent
                    such representations; nor are we likely to be misled by those fragments, for the
                    more striking portions were certainly the ones least likely to be either
                    forgotten or fabricated. To these mighty attractions was added the imposing, the
                    animating, the commanding power of a countenance singularly expressive; an eye
                    so piercing that hardly any one could stand its glare; and a manner altogether
                    singularly striking, original, and characteristic, notwithstanding a peculiarly
                    defective and even awkward action. Latterly, indeed, his infirmities precluded
                    all action; and he is described as standing in the House of Lords, leaning upon
                    his crutch, and speaking for ten minutes together in an under-tone of voice
                    scarcely audible, but raising his notes to their full pitch when he broke out
                    into one of his grand bursts of invective or exclamation. But in his earlier
                    time, his tvhole manner is represented as having been beyond conception animated
                    and imposing. Indeed the things which he effected by it principally, or at least
                    which nothing but a most striking and commanding tone could have made it
                    possible to attempt, almost exceed belief. Some of these sallies are indeed
                    examples of that approach made to the ludicrous by the sublime, which has been
                    charged upon him as a prevailing fault, and represented under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">charla-tanerie</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> a favourite phrase with his adversaries, as it in later
                    times has been with the ignorant undervaluers of Lord Erskine. It is related,
                    that once in the House of Commons he began a speech with the words, ‘ Sugar, Mr
                    Speaker,’—and then, observing a smile to prevail in the audience, he paused,
                    looking fiercely around, and with a loud voice, rising in its notes, and
                    swelling into vehement anger, he is said to have pronounced again the word ‘
                    Sugar 1’ three times,—and having thus quelled the house, and extinguished every
                    appearance of levity or laughter, turned round and disdainfully asked, ‘ Who
                    will laugh at sugar now ?’ We have this anecdote on good traditional authority;
                    that it was believed by those who had the best means of knowing Lord Chatham, is
                    certain; and this of itself shows their sense of the extraordinary powers of his
                    manner, and the reach of his audacity in trusting to those powers.</p>
                <p>“There can be no doubt that of reasoning,—of sustained and close argument,—his
                    speeches had but little. His statements wcre desultory, though striking, perhaps
                    not very distinct, certainty not at all detailed, and as certainty every way
                    inferior to those of his celebrated son. If he did not reason cogently, he
                    assuredly did not compress his matter vigorously. He was anything rather than a
                    concise or a short speaker; not that his great passages were at all diffuse, or
                    in the least degree loaded with superfluous words; but he was prolix in the
                    whole texture of his discourse, and he was certainty the first who introduced
                    into our senate the practice, adopted in the American war by Mr Burke, and
                    continued by others, of long speeches,— speeches of two and three hours, by
                    which oratory has gained little, and business less. His discourse was, however,
                    fully informed with matter—his allusions to analogous subjects, and his
                    reference to the history of past events, were frequent—his expression of his own
                    opinions was copious and free, and stood very generally in the place of any
                    elaborate reasoning in their support. A noble statement of enlarged views, a
                    generous avowal of dignified sentiments, a manty and somewhat severe contempt
                    for all petty or mean views, whether their baseness proceeded from narrow
                    understanding or from corrupt bias, always pervaded his whole discourse; and,
                    more than any other orator since Demosthenes, he was distinguished by the
                    nobleness of feeling with which he regarded, and the amplitude of survey which
                    he cast upon, the subject-matters of debate. His invective was unsparing, and
                    hard to be endured, although he was a less eminent master of sarcasm than his
                    son, and rather overwhelmed his antagonist with the burst of words and vehement
                    indignation, than wounded him by the edge of ridicule, or tortured him with the
                    gall of bitter scorn, or fixed his arrow in the wound by the barb of epigram.
                    These things seemed, as it were, to betoken too much labour and too much art,
                    more labour than was consistent wi th absolute scorn, more art than could stand
                    with heartfelt rage, or entire contempt inspired by the occasion, at the moment,
                    and on the spot. But his great passages, those by which he has come down to us,
                    those which gave his eloquence its peculiar character, and to which its dazzling
                    success was owing, were as sudden and unexpected as they were natural. Every one
                    was taken by surprise when they rolled forth; every one felt them to be so
                    natural, that he could hardly understand why he had not thought of them himself
                    although into no one’s imagination had they ever entered. If the quality of
                    being natural without being obvious is a pretty correct description of
                    felicitous expression, or what is called fine writing, it is a yet more accurate
                    representation of fine passages, or felicitous <hi rend="italic">hits</hi> in
                    speaking. In these all popidar assemblies take boundless delight; by these,
                    above all others, are the minds of an audience at pleasure moved or controlled.
                    They form the grand charm of Lord Chatham’s oratory; they were the
                    distinguishing excellence of his great predecessor, and gave him at will to
                    wield the fierce demo-craty of Athens, and to fulmine over Greece.” <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi></p>
                <p>Many years ago, a small volume was published by Lord Grenville, containing
                    letters written by the Earl of Chatham to his nephew, Thomas Pitt, Lord
                    Camelford. They are replete with excellent advice, conveyed in an easy,
                    affectionate, and not inelegant style, having all of them been penned evidently
                    without effort, under the simple impulse of the kindly feelings and anxious
                    interest which they manifest throughout. At the same time they might have been
                    written by a person vastly inferior to Lord Chatham; and indeed one can scarcely
                    avoid surprise at the absence of every trace of that genius, power, and
                    originality, for which the writer was so greatly distinguished. We may add, that
                    amidst the different conjectures which have at various times been entertained
                    and abandoned, respecting the authorship of Junius, Lord Chatham has once and
                    again been pointed to as the writer of these celebrated and still unclaimed
                    letters; nor can it be doubted by one who has made himself master of the
                    question, that there are circumstances of a very striking kind which appear to
                    give a certain colour of probability to this supposition. Indeed it would not be
                    difficult, we think, to make out as strong a case in his favour as any that has
                    yet been offered ’ Edinburgh Review, vol. lxviii. p. 438, et seq.</p>

                    action.” But as time, the great revealer of all mysteries, will most likely, ere
                    long, remove the veil by which this is covered, we shall not add to the mass of
                    doubtful speculation by reviving a discussion which, by a sort of tacit consent,
                    has for some time been abandoned as unprofitable and nugatory. <hi

                    >William,</hi> the second son of the preceding, and his legitimate successor in
                    talents and celebrity as a statesman and orator, was born on the 28th of May
                    1759. His father, having confided the care of his eldest and youngest sons to
                    others, took William under his own inspection; and the rapid progress of the son
                    cheered the solitude and brightened the declining days of this illustrious
                    statesman. The school exercises of the youth were performed under the direction
                    of a private tutor well qualified for the task assigned him; whilst his father,
                    finding in him a capacity above his years, embraced every opportunity of
                    conversing freely with him upon topics of interest, calculated to expand his
                    mind and mature his judgment. It is even said that he also made him declaim from
                    a chair or table; well knowing the importance of an easy, natural, and dignified
                    elocution, which, in his own case, had helped to supply the deficiencies of
                    fortune. The proficiency of the youth was such that, at the age of fourteen, he
                    was found qualified for being sent to the university; and Cambridge was
                    preferred to Oxford, from a decided opinion entertained by many, that the
                    political doctrines inculcated at the former place were more liberal than those
                    usually promulgated at the latter. He was accordingly entered at Pembroke Hall,
                    where he was placed under the tuition of Hr Turner; whilst Dr Prettyman,
                    afterwards Tomline, and successively bishop of Lincoln and of Winchester,
                    officiated as his private instructor. During his residence at Cambridge, Mr Pitt
                    was distinguished alike for the assiduity of his application, and the success
                    that attended his efforts to acquire those branches of knowledge to which his
                    studies were more particularly directed; nor have many young men of rank ever
                    passed through the ordeal of an university, exposed to the contaminating
                    influence of seductive example, with a higher character for morals, abilities,
                    industry, and regularity. Here young Pitt took his bachelor’s degree, and also
                    that of master of arts, both in a creditable manner; and acquired a reputation
                    for talents, diligence, and propriety of deportment, which proved eminently
                    serviceable to him in after life. Being intended by his father for the bar and
                    the senate, his education was regulated so as to embrace both these objects; and
                    it is certain that his early acquisitions in various branches of knowledge must
                    have far exceeded those of almost any of his contemporaries.</p>
                <p>After quitting the university, he went to the Continent, and passed a short time
                    at Rheims, the capital of Champagne. The death of his father, however, whilst he
                    was only in his nineteenth year, could scarcely fail to throw a cloud over the
                    prospects of the younger son; but the foundation of future distinction had been
                    firmly laid, and it only remained for him to clear the path to eminence by his
                    own exertions. He had already entered himself a student of Lincoln’s Inn; and as
                    soon as he came of age he was called to the bar, having received some favour on
                    account of his degree. He made choice of the western circuit, and appeared in
                    several causes as junior counsel; in which capacity, of course, he had few or no
                    opportunities of distinguishing himself. The result of this short experiment,
                    however, was thought sufficient to encourage him to pursue the career of the
                    law, and rendered it almost certain that he would ultimately attain a high rank
                    in his profession; but a seat in parliament, which he soon afterwards obtained,
                    gave his ambition its proper direction, and placed him in the arena where he was
                    best calculated to excel. At the general election in 1780, he had been induced
                    to offer himself as a candidate for the representation of the university of
                    Cambridge; but finding that, from want of sufficient influence, he had no chance
                    of success, he declined the contest, and in the following year was returned for
                    the borough of Appleby, through the interest of Sir James Lowther, afterwards
                    Earl of Lonsdale.</p>
                <p>This, be it observed, was during the period of most violent political opposition
                    to the American war; which, it may be supposed, Mr Pitt regarded with hereditary
                    aversion, and reprobated as one of the most disgraceful and ruinous contests in
                    which the country could have engaged. He was also ardently attached to the cause
                    of political reform, particularly in the representation of the people; which he
                    conceived to be the best safeguard of constitutional liberty, and the only
                    security against the recurrence of such •wars as that which he so much deplored
                    and condemned. On the 26 th of February 1781, Mr Pitt made his first speech in
                    the British senate. At the commencement of the session Mr Burke had brought
                    forward his bill for effecting great retrenchments in the civil list; and it was
                    in reference to this measure that Mr Pitt made his débûtin the House of Commons.
                    The attention of the house was naturally fixed upon the son of the great
                    Chatham; but in a few moments the regards of the audience were directed to him
                    on his own account. Unembarrassed by the novelty of his position, and master
                    alike of his feelings and his subject, he delivered himself with an ease and
                    grace, a richness of expression, a closeness of argument, and a classical
                    precision of language, which not only answered, but exceeded all the
                    expectations that had been formed of him, and elicited great applause from both
                    sides of the house. During the same and the subsequent session, he spoke several
                    times, particularly in favour of parliamentary reform, of which, as we have just
                    stated, he was a zealous advocate; and, from his talents as a public speaker, it
                    soon became evident that he was destined to perform a prominent part upon the
                    political stage.</p>
                <p>But although, for the most part, he ostensibly went along with the party in
                    opposition to Lord North, yet he had not formed any decided connection with
                    them; and hence, when his lordship was driven from power, and a new
                    administration formed, with the Marquis of Rockingham at its head, Mr Pitt’s
                    name was not included in the list. This cabinet, however, was of short
                    endurance. Lord Rockingham died suddenly; and his death having occasioned a
                    fatal difference as to the choice of a new head, the Earl of Shelburne,
                    profiting by the circumstance, formed a junction with several members of the
                    former cabinet, and having (in July 1782) been appointed first lord of the
                    treasury, associated with himself Mr Pitt, who had just completed his
                    twenty-third year, as chancellor of the exchequer. A general peace with America,
                    and the powers in alliance with the Transatlantic republic, followed soon
                    afterwards; but this having been made a ground of severe censure by a powerful
                    opposition, a coalition was formed between Lord North and Sir Fox, and, in April
                    1783, the Shelburne administration was forced to give way to this extraordinary
                    confederacy, which had in some measure dictated its own terms to the sovereign.
                    During his continuance in office, Mr Pitt had found but little opportunity of
                    distinguishing himself, except as an able defender of the measures of
                    administration, and a vigorous assailant of the principles and conduct of his
                    antagonists. But a circumstance soon occurred which constitutes an important era
                    in his life, and not only proved the eventual cause of his return to office, but
                    secured to him a degree of authority with the king, and of popularity with the
                    nation, which has seldom fallen to the lot of any minister, and which he
                    preserved with but little diminution till the close of his life.</p>
                <p>The coalition ministry was, both in its formation and in its character, odious to
                    the country at large. It was regarded <pb break="no" facs="nls:193501058"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-1058-0767"/>as an unprincipled combination for purposes purely
                    selfish; in its formation all the old landmarks and distinctions of party had
                    been thrown down; and as its composition was such as to afford no hopes of
                    future benefit to the nation, its proceedings were watched with the jealous
                    vigilance of suspicion and hatred. Whilst matters were in this state, Mr Fox
                    introduced his bill for regulating the affairs of India. The leading provision
                    of this famous project was to vest the whole management of Indian affairs in
                    seven commissioners named in the bill, and to be appointed by the ministry; or,
                    in other words, to transfer the whole patronage of Inςlia from the Crown and the
                    Company, to the administration for the time being. In vain was it represented
                    that this measure would prove alike advantageous to the Company and the nation;
                    that it would introduce responsibility where there was none, or next to none;
                    and that it would serve to prevent abuses, which were described as equally
                    flagrant and notorious. The public generally considered it as trenching too much
                    upon the prerogative, as creating a mass of ministerial influence which would be
                    irresistible, and as rendering the ministry too strong for the cf ’ own. In
                    opposing it, therefore, Mr Pitt had rather to follow than to lead public
                    opinion, to obey the impulse already given, than to endeavour to excite and
                    stimulate opposition; and this he did with so much skill and ability, that
                    although the bill passed the House of Commons, it was thrown out in the Lords.
                    This defeat decided the fate of the coalition ministry. For although it were
                    true, as the partisans of the ministers alleged, that the rejection of the bill
                    had been caused by secret intrigue and undue influence, this made no difference
                    in regard to public opinion, which was decidedly adverse to the measure; and
                    hence the country was not disposed to find fault with the means by which the end
                    desired had been obtained. The ministry therefore resigned, and in the new
                    arrangement Mr Pitt was made first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the
                    exchequer.</p>
                <p>Having thus become prime minister at the early age of twenty-four, Mr Pitt’s
                    appearance in that high and difficult station was greatly applauded by his
                    friends, and at the same time ridiculed by his opponents, who represented it as
                    the arrogant assumption of a stripling, indebted to accident or intrigue for a
                    position from which he would be driven in a few months, perhaps even sooner. And
                    at first it seemed by no means improbable that this prognostication would be
                    fulfilled. In the House of Commons, the adherents of the coalition ministry were
                    still so numerous, that, when Mr Pitt introduced his bill for the regulation of
                    Indian affairs, it was rejected by a majority of eight (222 to 214); and in this
                    state matters remained for some months. In the mean time several meetings were
                    held by the leading men of both parties, and various projects of accommodation
                    discussed; but Mr Pitt’s previous resignation being demanded as a <hi
                    rend="italic">conditio sine qua non,</hi> all these attempts failed. Resolved to
                    stand by the sovereign who confided in, and the people who supported him, Mr
                    Pitt now took a step, the very boldness of which, perhaps, conduced to his
                    success, we mean, dissolving parliament. This took place in March 1784, and was
                    speedily followed by a general election, in which thirty coalitionists,
                    including some of the leading men of the party, lost their seats; so that the
                    minister was enabled to meet the new parliament with a decided majority, and an
                    opposition more weakened in talent than in numbers. His India bill, which the
                    last parliament had thrown out, was now re-introduced and passed; an addition
                    was made to the window-tax, in order to supply the deficiency occasioned by a
                    reduction of the principal duties upon tea; and various plans were proposed for
                    the more effectual prevention of smuggling.</p>
                <p>At this period, indeed, the grand object of Mr Pitt’s ambition seems to have
                    been, to acquire the reputation of an able and successful minister of finance.
                    In 1786, he brought in and carried through a bill for establishing his famous
                    sinking fund, upon <hi rend="italic">a</hi> plan which, it seems, had been
                    suggested to him by Dr Richard Price, and which, as modified in the bill, was
                    long regarded by his friends and partisans as the <hi rend="italic">ne</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">plus ultra</hi> of financial skill and ingenuity. But all this
                    ignorant admiration was at length dissipated by the masterly work of Dr
                    Hamilton; and even Lord Grenville, the friend and colleague of Mr Pitt, found
                    himself constrained to admit, in a pamphlet which he published on the subject,
                    after his retirement from public life, that the whole scheme was bottomed upon
                    delusion. In the year 1787, Mr Pitt concluded a commercial treaty with France;
                    and amongst the subsequent measures in which he was personally concerned, may be
                    mentioned his accession to the impeachment of Warren Hastings, his opposing the
                    repeal of the corporation and test acts, his interference in behalf of the
                    stadtholder, the affair of Oczakow, and the dispute with Spain respecting the
                    fur-trade at Nootka Sound, several of which were extremely unpopular.</p>
                <p>But the most important epoch of Mr Pitt’s political life was now approaching. His
                    reforming and patriotic .zeal had already been sensibly cooled. Instead of
                    seeking to strengthen himself in the affections of the people, he began to think
                    only of establishing himself firmly in the favour of the court; and, whilst
                    pursuing this object, a circumstance occurred which raised him to the summit of
                    power, and enabled him, as prime minister, to exercise every function of his
                    office without check or control. This was the illness of the king, which took
                    place in the autumn of 1788, and incapacitated his majesty for the exercise of
                    the royal functions. Parliament had been prorogued to the 20th of November; and
                    as the sovereign, by whom alone it could be further prorogued, was not in a
                    condition to exercise his prerogative, it became necessary that it should meet
                    upon that day. A question of great nicety and delicacy now arose; namely, in
                    whom the office of regent was to be vested. The Prince of Wales being then
                    connected with the party in opposition, Mr Fox strenuously contended that the
                    regency devolved upon him as a matter of course, without restriction or
                    limitation; whilst Mr Pitt, on the other hand, maintained that it belonged to
                    the two remaining branches of the legislature to fill up the office as they
                    should judge proper, and impose such restrictions as they might deem necessary;
                    at the same time admitting that, under actual circumstances, no other person
                    than the prince could be thought of for the regency, thus limited by the two
                    houses of parliament. The view of the prime minister prevailed, and a bill was
                    in consequence passed, greatly restricting the power of the regent. But its
                    provisions were soon rendered inoperative, by the convalescence of his majesty
                    in the beginning of 1789. It is certain, however, that, upon recovering the use
                    of his reason, the king greatly approved of the course which Mr Pitt had
                    pursued; and the latter was in consequence established in power more firmly than
                    ever. We may add, that on the recurrence of a similar visitation, with still
                    more melancholy circumstances, the precedent of 1788-1789 served as a guide to
                    the minister of the day, Mr Percival, and the Prince of Wales became regent,
                    subject to restrictions analogous to those which had formerly been imposed by Mr
                    Pitt.</p>
                <p>The next great epoch in Mr Pitt’s political life, and which, beyond all the
                    preceding portions of his conduct, will determine his character as a statesman
                    with posterity, was the French Revolution; taken in connection with the policy
                    which the government of this country, under the sole guidance of Mr Pitt,
                    pursued in reference to that mighty convulsion, and the astounding events to
                    which it gave birth. But as Mr Pitt, considered individually, cannot be
                    separated from the history of the long and sanguinary war with France, in which,
                    principally through his <pb break="no" facs="nls:193501071"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-1071-0768"/>means, the country became involved; and as the
                    most ample details, both of the policy of this country, and the strange
                    vicissitudes <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the contest, have already been given
                    under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Britain,</hi> it is only necessary to
                    refer the reader to that head for the fullest information on these points, as
                    well as respecting the most important domestic events of Mr Pitt’s long
                    administration, the rebellion in Ireland, and the subsequent union of that
                    country with Great Britain. Suffice it to say, that having held the reins of
                    government for eighteen years, Mr Pitt, and all the members of bis cabinet,
                    retired from office in 1801. The French armies had been victorious all over the
                    continent; Prussia had, at an early period, prudently withdrawn from the
                    contest; Austria had been completely humbled; and a successful soldier, under
                    the denomination of First Consul, had assumed the reins of government in France.
                    All Mr Pitt’s plans for humbling that country, and, as it were, rolling back the
                    Revolution, had most signally failed; the cry for peace was now become general;
                    and a breathing-time, at least, had become indispensably necessary. But it was
                    left to Mr Addington to make the experiment, and, under his auspices, the treaty
                    of Amiens was concluded with the French government.</p>
                <p>But, as every reflecting person had foreseen, this armistice (for it was nothing
                    more) proved of short duration. The war broke out again in the year 1803; and Mr
                    Pitt, having gradually withdrawn his support from the Addington administration,
                    it fell to pieces from its own inherent fragility.- In 1804, Mr Pitt, having
                    resumed the reins of government, exerted all his ability to give a successful
                    turn to the contest, and organized a new coalition against France. But the
                    thunder-stroke of Austerlitz blasted all his hopes, again placed Austria at the
                    feet of the conqueror, and left Prussia exposed to that vengeance which soon
                    afterwards descended upon her as a just retribution for her treachery. The prime
                    minister was at this time in a state of health ill calculated to bear up under
                    such a blow. A gouty habit, the predisposing causes of which appear to have been
                    hereditary, and a too liberal use of wine as part of his ordinary regimen,
                    undermined a constitution which had never been very robust; and these, added to
                    the cares and anxieties of office, at a period of so great excitement, brought
                    on a premature exhaustion of the vital powers. In December 1805 he went to Bath;
                    but the change afforded him no permanent relief. On the 11th of January 1806, he
                    returned to his seat at Putney, much debilitated, and there lingered on till the
                    23d of the same month, when he expired, in the forty-seventh year of his age. A
                    public funeral was decreed to him by parliament, and forty thousand pounds were
                    voted to discharge those debts which he was said to have incurred in the service
                    of the state.</p>
                <p>Though Mr Pitt possessed no particular advantages of person or of physiognomy,
                    yet as a speaker he was considered by many as of surpassing eminence. Happy in
                    the choice of his words, judicious in the arrangement of his subject, and gifted
                    with a natural flow of eloquence, his wonderful powers were acknowledged even by
                    those who dissented from his doctrines, and remained unmoved by his arguments.
                    When employed in a good cause, he was irresistible; in defending a bad one, he
                    could dazzle the judgment, mislead the imagination, and seduce the heart, even
                    when he could not overcome the understanding. In statement or exposition he was
                    clear, perspicuous, and singularly adroit, not to say artful; in sarcasm and
                    invective he was tremendous. But although ambition and the love of power were
                    his ruling passions, his mind was elevated above the meanness of avarice; his
                    personal integrity remained unimpeached; and though he died involved in debts,
                    these are to be ascribed to negligence, and the demands of his public station,
                    rather than to extravagance, or any fondness for splendour and parade. Though
                    his manner, in his public deportment, was distant and reserved, not to say
                    haughty, yet few men were ever more successful in fixing the attachment of their
                    private and personal friends. By all those who shared his intimacy he seems to
                    have been esteemed and beloved. “They saw the all-powerful energies of his
                    character,” says Mr Rose, “softened into the most perfect complacency and
                    sweetness of disposition in the circles of private life, the pleasures of which
                    no one more cheerfully enjoyed, or more agreeably promoted, when the paramount
                    duties which he conceived himself to <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> owe to the
                    public admitted of his mixing in them. That indignant severity with which he met
                    and subdued what he considered unfounded opposition, that keenness of sarcasm
                    with which he expelled and withered, as it might he said, the powers <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> most of his assailants in debate, were exchanged, in the
                    society of his intimate friends, for a kindness of heart, a gentleness of
                    demeanour, and a playfulness of good humour, which no one ever witnessed without
                    interest, or participated without delight.” Mr Wilberforce, who knew him.
                    intimately, entertained the same opinion of his social qualities, when he moved
                    in the circle of his particular friends. “Though less formed for general
                    popularity than Fox,” says he, “Pitt, when free from shyness, and amongst his
                    intimate companions, was the very soul of merriment and conversation. He was the
                    wittiest man I ever knew, and, what was quite peculiar to himself, he had at all
                    times his wit under entire control. Others appeared struck by the unwonted
                    association of brilliant images; but every possible combination of ideas seemed
                    always present to his mind, and he could at once produce whatever he desired. I
                    was one of those who met to spend an evening in memory of Shakspeare, at the
                    Boar’s Head, East Cheape. Many professed wits were present, but Pitt was the
                    most amusing of the party, and tlre readiest and most apt in the required
                    allusions.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Life of
                    Wilberforce, vol. ii. p. 18.</p></note></p>
                <p>This, it will be observed, applies to an early period of his career, when his
                    faculties were in all the freshness and vigour of youth. But from other accounts
                    we learn, that amidst all the anxieties and disappointments of his public life,
                    he retained to the last the reputation of being a most amiable companion in the
                    circle of his private friends. The Marquis of,wellesley’s character of him,
                    which we subjoin, is perhaps a little overdrawn, and has something of a
                    controversial character about it, having been written in refutation of certain
                    statements of Sir Nathaniel Wraxall, who, amongst other things, had said that
                    “Pitt’s manners were stiff, retired, and without unction or grace but, making
                    every allowance for the partialities of friendship, considerable weight must be
                    given to the deliberate estimate of one who, himself a great statesman, an
                    elegant scholar, and an accomplished man, enjoyed the best opportunities of
                    appreciating the character and attainments of his friend.</p>
                <p>“In attempting to convey to you my recollection of Mr Pitt’s character in private
                    society,” says his lordship, “I cannot separate those qualities which raised him
                    to the highest public eminence from those which rendered him a most amiable
                    companion. Both proceeded from the same origin, and both were happily blended in
                    the noble structure of his temper and disposition.</p>
                <p>“Mr Pitt’s mind was naturally inaccessible to any approach <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> dark, or low, or ignoble passion. His commanding genius and magnanimous
                    spirit were destined to move in a region far above the reach of those
                    jealousies, and suspicions, and animosities, which disturb the course of
                    ordinary life. Under the eye of his illustrious father he had received that ‘
                    complete and generous education which fits a man to perform justly, skilfully,
                    and magnanimously, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193501084"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-1084-0769"/>ħll∙the offices, both private and public, of peace
                    and war.’ Such an education, acting on such a natural disposition, not oniy
                    qualified him to adorn the most elevated stations in the counsels of his
                    country, but furnished him with abundant resources to sustain the tranquillity
                    and cheerfulness of his mind.</p>
                <p>• “He had received regular and systematic instruction in the principles of the
                    Christian religion, and in the doctrine and discipline of the Church of England,
                    and in every branch of general ecclesiastical history. His knowledge in those
                    subjects was accurate and extensive. He was completely armed against all
                    sceptical assaults, as well as against all fanatical illusion; and, in truth, he
                    was not merely a faithful and dutiful, but a learned member of our established
                    church; to which he was most sincerely attached, with the most charitable
                    indulgence for all dissenting sects. No doubt can exist in any rational mind
                    that this early and firm settlement of his religious opinions and principles was
                    a main cause of that cheerful equanimity which formed the great characteristic
                    of his social intercourse, and which was never affected by adversities nor
                    troubles.</p>
                <p>“He was perfectly accomplished in classical literature, both Latin and Greek. The
                    accuracy and strength of his memory surpassed every example which I have
                    observed; but the intrinsic vigour of his understanding carried him far beyond
                    the mere recollection of the great models of antiquity in oratory, poetry,
                    history, and philosophy; he had drawn their essence into his own thoughts and
                    language; and, with astonishing facility, he applied the whole spirit of ancient
                    learning to his daily use.</p>
                <p>“Those studies were his constant delight and resort; at Holwood, in Kent (his
                    favourite residence), and at Walmer Castle, his apartments were strewed with
                    Latin and Greek classics; and his conversation with those friends who delighted
                    in similar studies frequently turned on that most attractive branch of
                    literature; but he was so adverse to pedantry or affectation of superior
                    knowledge, that he carefully abstained from such topics in the presence of those
                    who could not take pleasure in them. In these pursuits his constant and
                    congenial companion was Lord Grenville, who has often declared to me that Mr
                    Pitt was the <hi rend="italic">best Greek scholar</hi> he ever conversed with.
                    Mr Pitt was also as complete a master of all English literature as he was
                    undoubtedly of the English language. I have dwelt on this branch of Mr Pitt’s
                    accomplishments because I know not any source from which more salutary
                    assistance can be derived, to chase from the spirits those clouds and vapours
                    which infest vacant minds, and, by self-weariness, render retirement melancholy
                    and intolerable.</p>
                <p>“But Mr Pitt amply possessed every resource which could enliven retirement. No
                    person had a more exquisite sense of the beauties of the country. He took the
                    greatest delight in his residence at Holwood, which he enlarged and improved (it
                    may be truly said) with his own hands. Often have I seen him working in his
                    woods and gardens with his labourers for whole days together, undergoing
                    considerable bodily fatigue, and with so much eagerness and assiduity, that you
                    would suppose the cultivation of his villa to be the principal occupation of his
                    life.</p>
                <p>“He was very fond of exercise on horseback, and when in the country frequently
                    joined the hounds of his neighbourhood, both at Holwood and walmer Castle.</p>
                <p>“At the latter place he lived most hospitably, entertaining all his neighbours,
                    as well as the officers of the neighbouring garrisons, and of the ships in the
                    Downs; and he was most attentive to his duties of lord warden of the cinque
                    ports, which called him frequently to Dover, and sometimes to the other
                    ports.</p>
                <p>“But in all places, and at all times, his constant delight was society. There he
                    shone with a degree of calm and steady lustre which often astonished me more
                    than his most splendid efforts in parliament. His manners were perfectly plain,
                    without any affectation; not only was he without presumption or arrogance, or
                    any air of authority, but he seemed utterly unconscious of his own superiority,
                    and much more disposed to listen than to talk. He never betrayed any symptom of
                    anxiety to usurp the lead or to display his own powers, but rather inclined to
                    draw forth others, and to take merely an equal share in the general
                    conversation: then he plunged heedlessly into the mirth of the hour, with no
                    more care than to promote the general good humour and happiness of the company.
                    His wit was quick and ready, but it was rather lively than sharp, and never
                    envenomed with the least taint of malignity; so that, instead of exciting
                    admiration or terror, it was an additional ingredient in the common enjoyment.
                    He was endowed, beyond any man of his time whom I knew, with a gay heart and a
                    social spirit. With these qualities he was the life and soul of his own society.
                    His appearance dispelled all care; his brow was never clouded, even in the
                    severest public trials; and joy, and hope, and confidence beamed from his
                    countenance in every crisis of difficulty and danger.</p>
                <p>“He was a most affectionate, indulgent, and benevolent friend, and so easy of
                    access, that all his acquaintance, in any embarrassment, would rather resort to
                    him for advice than to any person who might be supposed to have more leisure.
                    His heart was always at leisure to receive the communications of his friends,
                    and always open to give the best advice in the most gentle and pleasant
                    manner.</p>
                <p>“It is a melancholy but a grateful task to pay this tribute to the memory of my
                    departed friend. <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> Aut me amor negotii suscepti
                    fallit,’ or the character which 1 have endeavoured to draw is not less just and
                    true than it is amiable and excellent; and I cannot resist the conclusion, that
                    a pure and clear conscience must have been the original source of such uniform
                    cheerfulness and gaiety of spirit. The truth which I have asserted I possessed
                    ample means of knowing. From the year 1783 to 1797 I lived in habits of the most
                    confidential friendship with Mr Pitt.</p>
                <p>“In the year 1797 I was appointed governor-general of India, and in the month of
                    September in that year I went to Walmer Castle to meet Mr Pitt and Mr Dundas,
                    and to receive my last instructions. I found Mr Pitt in the highest spirits,
                    entertaining officers and country gentlemen with his usual hospitality. Amongst
                    others, Admiral Duncan was his constant and favourite guest. His fleet was then
                    in the Downs, preparing for the memorable victory of Camperdown. The admiral was
                    a lively and jovial companion, and seemed to be quite delighted with Mr Pitt’s
                    society. I embarked for India early in the month <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    November 1797, and I returned to England in January 1806.</p>
                <p>“Not wishing to state any thing beyond my own personal knowledge, I will not
                    attempt to relate the history of Mr Pitt’s social habits during the period of my
                    absence; but I cannot believe that, during that time, the whole frame of his
                    magnificent mind had been so broken and disjointed, that he could not endure the
                    temporary loss of power, nor reconcile himself to that retirement, and to those
                    recreations, which were his relief from the labour of official business, and his
                    consolation in the hour of political solicitude and care. But 1 know that the
                    first summer after his resignation was passed with Mr Addington at Wimbledon,
                    and that soon afterwards Mr Pitt was closely occupied at Walmer Castle in
                    forming a corps of volunteer cavalry, living with his officers, and passing the
                    greater part <hi rend="italic">of</hi> his time on horseback, under the firm
                    expectation of a French invasion. This does not well agree with the story which
                    represents him wrapped in sullen seclusion, sunk in despondency, shunning all
                    society, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193501097" xml:id="kp-eb0717-1097-0770"
                    />yet unable to relieve the gloom of solitude by any mental resource.</p>
                <p>“On my arrival in England in January 1806, Mr Pitt was at Bath; I wrote to him,
                    and I received from him a very kind invitation to meet him at Putney Hill. I met
                    him accordingly, in the second week in January, and I was received by him with
                    his usual kindness and good humour. His spirits appeared to be as high as 1 had
                    ever seen them, and his understanding quite as vigorous and clear.</p>
                <p>“Amongst other topics, he told mes with great kindness and feeling, that, since
                    he had seen me, he had been happy to become acquainted with my brother Arthur,
                    of whom he spoke in the warmest terms of commendation. He said, ‘ I never met
                    any military officer with whom it was so satisfactory to converse. He states
                    every difficulty before he undertakes any service, but none after he has
                    undertaken it.’</p>
                <p>“But notwithstanding Mr Pitt’s kindness and cheerfulness, I saw that the hand of
                    death was fixed upon him. This melancholy truth was not known nor believed by
                    either his friends or opponents. In the number of the latter, to my deep
                    affliction, I found my highly respected and esteemed friend Lord Grenville, and
                    I collected that measures of the utmost hostility to Mr Pitt were to be proposed
                    in both houses at the meeting of parliament. I warned Lord Grenville of Mr
                    Pitt’s approaching death. He received the fatal intelligence with the utmost
                    feeling, in an agony of tears, and immediately determined that all hostility in
                    parliament should be suspended. Mr Pitt’s death soon followed.”</p>

                    Brougham, that great orator and powerful writer thus contrasts the elder and
                    younger Pitt as public men and ministers:</p>
                <p>“The true test of a great man,—that at least which must determine his place among
                    the highest order of great men,—is his having been in advance of his age. This
                    it is which decides whether or not he has carried forward the grand plan of
                    human improvement, has conformed his views, and adapted his conduct, to the
                    existing circumstances of society, or changed those so as to better its
                    condition; has been one of the lights of the world, or only reflected the
                    borrowed rays of former luminaries, and sat in the same shade at the same
                    twilight or the same dawn with the rest of his generation. Tried by this test,
                    the younger Pitt cannot certainly be said to have lived before his time, or shed
                    upon the age to which he belonged the illumination of a more advanced
                    civilization and more inspired philosophy. He came far too early into public
                    life, and was too suddenly plunged into the pool of office, to give him time for
                    the study and the reflection which can alone open to any mind, how vigorous
                    soever be its natural constitution, the views of a deep and original wisdom.
                    Accordingly, it would be difficult to glean, from all his measures and all his
                    speeches, any thing like the fruits of inventive genius; or to mark any token of
                    his mind having gone before the very ordinary routine of the day, as if familiar
                    with any ideas that did not pass through the most vulgar understandings. His
                    father’s intellect was of a higher order.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>“Mr Pitt had foibles,” says Mr Wilberforce, “and of course
                    they were not diminished by a long continuance in office; but for a clear and
                    comprehensive view of the most complicated subject in all its relations; for
                    that fairness of mind which disposes a man to follow out, mid, when overtaken,
                    to recognise truth; for magnanimity, which made him ready to change his measures
                    when he thought the good of the country required it, though he knew he should be
                    charged with inconsistency; for willingness to give a fair hearing to all that
                    could be urged against his ow opinions, and to listen to the suggestions of
                    other men, whose understandings he knew to be inferior to his own; for personal
                    purity, disinterestedness, integrity, and a love of his country, I have never
                    known his equal. His strictness in regard to truth was astonishing, considering
                    the situation he had so long filled.” (Life of Wilberforce, vol. iii. p. 249,
                    250.)</p></note></p>
                <p>Lord Brougham’s opinion of the oratory of the younger Pitt is recorded in the
                    conclusion of the following passage:</p>
                <p>“Some have compared Mr Fox’s eloquence to that of Demosthenes; but it resembled
                    Lord Chatham’s just as much, if not more. It was incomparably more argumentative
                    than either the Greek or the English orator’s, neither of whom carried on chains
                    of close reasoning as he did, though both kept close to their subject. It was,
                    however, exceedingly the reverse of the Attic oration, either in method, in
                    diction, or in conciseness. It had nothing like arrangement of any kind. Except
                    in the more vehement passages, its diction was perhaps as slovenly, certainly as
                    careless, as possible,—betokening indeed a contempt of all accurate composition.
                    It was diffuse in the highest degree, and abounded in repetitions. While the
                    Greek was concise, almost to being jejune, the Englishman was diffuse, almost to
                    being prolix. How the notion of comparing the two together ever could have
                    prevailed, seems unaccountable, unless it be that men have supposed them alike
                    because they were both vehement, and both kept the subject in view rather than
                    run after ornament. But that the most elaborate and artificial compositions in
                    the world should have been likened to the most careless, and natural, and
                    unprepared that ever were delivered in public, would seem wholly incredible if
                    it were not true. The bursts of Mr Fox, however, though less tersely and
                    concisely composed, certainly have· some resemblance to Lord Chatham’s,—only
                    that they betray far less fancy,— and, however vehement and fiery, are
                    incomparably less bold. Mr Pitt’s oratory, though admirably suited to its
                    purpose, and as perfect a business kind of speaking as ever was heard, certainly
                    resembled none of the three others who have been named. In point of genius,
                    unless perhaps for sarcasm, he was greatly their inferior; although, from the
                    unbroken fluency of his appropriate language, and the power of a most sonorous
                    voice, he produced the most prodigious effect.” <hi rend="smallcaps"
