                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">PAUW, <hi rend="smallcaps">Cornelius de</hi></label>,
                    sometimes called <hi rend="smallcaps">Nicoas,</hi> a moral philosopher and
                    historian, born at Amsterdam in 1739. He is better known as the uncle of the
                    revolutionist Anacharsis Clootz, than by the ancestors from whom he was
                    descended; they are, however, reported by his nephew to have distinguished
                    themselves in the revolutions of Holland in the sixteenth century.</p>
                <p>It appears, from the same authority, that his name was Cornelius, and not Nicoas,
                    but that he was not related to Cornelius de Pauw, the critic and the rival of
                    Dorville; and that it was upon the marriage of his sister to Clootz’s father
                    that he obtained, through the interest of his brother-in-law, a Catholic
                    canonicate at Xanten, in the territory of Cleves. He was afterwards appointed
                    reader to Frederic king of Prussia, perhaps as an advocate of the new doctrines
                    and principles which that sovereign was disposed to patronize; but he is said to
                    have declined the offer of the place of an academician of Berlin, and a
                    bishopric at Breslau. His attacks on the Jesuits, whom he accused of gross
                    misrepresentation and exaggeration in their historical and geographical memoirs,
                    rendered him unpopular with the Catholic clergy, though his learning and talents
                    commanded a certain portion of their respect. He was simple in his manners, and
                    somewhat negligent of his appearance. The close of his life was embittered by a
                    tedious and painful disease; and he died on the 7th of July 1799.</p>
                <p>His principal publications are, 1. Recherches sur les Américains, Berlin, 1770
                    and 1772, in 8vo; a work intended to show the “degraded state of the savage
                    Americans,” and forming a contrast to !'∙.e speculations of some contemporary
                    writers of celebrity: 2. Défense des Recherches, Berlin, 1771, 8vo: 3.
                    Recherches sur les Egyptiens et les Chinois, Berlin, 1774, in two vols. 8vo;
                    Philosophical Dissertations on the Egyptians and Chinese, translated by Captain
                    J. Thomson, London, 1795, in two vols. 8vo. The investigation was undertaken, he
                    observes, to show that “no two nations ever resembled each other less than the
                    Egyptians and the Chinese ;” and it must be admitted that he has sufficiently
                    established his proposition. There is, indeed, one argument that he has
                    employed, which appears to be founded on a mistake of the Greek historians of
                    Egypt, who have asserted that the Egyptians had long been in the use of
                    alphabetical characters; and the want of any alphabet amongst the Chinese is
                    stated by Μ. de Pauw as affording a marked distinction from the Egyptians. There
                    is, however, scarcely a shadow of resemblance in the particular hieroglyphical
                    characters employed by the two nations, although the general system of beginning
                    with a representation of a visible object, and departing, more and more, by
                    degrees, from the fidelity of the delineation, must necessarily have been common
                    to both. But it so happens, that out of about seventy Egyptian characters, which
                    are compared by the Jesuits and Dr Morton with the Chinese in the Philosophical
                    Transactions for 1769, there are about twenty of which the sense has been
                    ascertained with tolerable accuracy by Dr Young; and of these there is only one
                    that happens to have been rightly determined by the comparison with the Chinese,
                    excepting two or three which are obviously mere pictures, as the moon and a bow.
                    There is also amongst the old Chinese characters a figure of a chain, which
                    agrees remarkably in its form with the Egyptian hieroglyphic employed as a
                    copulative conjunction; but there is a still more striking coincidence, which Μ.
                    Jomard has noticed, between the Egyptian and Chinese characters for a thousand,
                    both of which he derives from the seed-vessel of the lotus, as containing a
                    multitude of seeds; and if the older Chinese characters be found to preserve
                    this resemblance as perfectly as they ought to do, it must be confessed that the
                    suspicion of a common origin will be much strengthened by the argument. Both the
                    Egyptians and the Chinese were condemned, Μ. de Pauw observes, “to an eternal
                    mediocrity and the weight of this observation is certainly not diminished by any
                    thing that has been inferred from the study of the hieroglyphics of the Rosetta
                    stone and other monuments.</p>
                <p>There are several papers of Μ. de Pauw on antiquarian subjects in the Memoirs of
                    the Society of Cassel, and in particular one on the Temple of Juno Lacinia, vol.
                    i∙ 1780. Recherches sur les Grècs were published at Berlin, 1787, in two vols.
                    8vo; Philosophical Dissertations on the Greeks, translated by Thomson, London,
                    1793, in two vols. 8vo. This work is principally devoted to the Athenians,
                    amongst whom their boasted liberty is shown to have been confined to a very
                    small number of citizens, who tyrannized over the rest of the inhabitants of
                    their country. The Lacedaemonians, the Aetolians, the Thessalians, and the
                    Arcadians, are separately discussed, but considered as comparatively
                    contemptible; the Lacedaemonians in particular, and their successors the
                    Mainotes, arc treated with great severity, as a worthless race of dishonourable
                    vagabonds. The athletic education of the Athenians is, however, highly
                    applauded, from a visionary theory of the importance of the physical perfection
                    of the body to the operations of the mind. An edition of the author’s three
                    principal works appeared at Paris, in seven volumes octavo, 1795. (See Dorsch,
