                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">PHRYGIA</label>, a country in Asia. The origin of the name is
                    uncertain; but some say that it was derived from the river Phryx, now Sarabat,
                    which divides Phrygia from Caria, and empties itself into the Hermus; whilst
                    others think that it was so called from Phrygia, the daughter of Asopus and
                    Europa. The Greek writers inform us that the country took its name from the
                    inhabitants, and these from the town of Brygium in Macedonia, whence they first
                    passed into Asia, and gave the name of <hi rend="italic">Brygia</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Phrygia</hi> to the country where they settled. Bochart is of
                    opinion that this tract was called Phrygia from the Greek verb pguyg∕v, <hi
                    rend="italic">to burn</hi> or <hi rend="italic">parch,</hi> which, according to
                    him, is a translation of its Hebrew name, derived from a verb of the same
                    signification.</p>
                <p>Nor are the opinions of authors less various as to the ancient boundaries of this
                    country; an uncertainty which gave rise to an observation of Strabo, that the
                    Phrygians and Mysians had distinct boundaries, but that it was scarcely possible
                    to ascertain them. The same writer adds, that the Trojans, Mysians, and Lydians,
                    are, by the poets, all blended under the common name of Phrygians, which
                    Claudian extends to the Pisidians, Bithynians, and Ionians. Phrygia proper was,
                    according to Ptolemy, bounded on the north by Pontus and Bithynia; on the west
                    by Mysia, Troas, the Aegean Sea, Lydia, Maeonia, and Caria; on the south by
                    Lycia; and on the east by Pamphylia and Galatia. It lies between the 37th and
                    41st degrees of north latitude, and extends in longitude from 56 to 62 degrees.
                    The inhabitants of this country, mentioned by Ptolemy, are the Lycaones and
                    Anthemisenii towards Lycia, and Moccadelis or Moccadine; the Cyddeses or
                    Cydisses towards Bithynia; and the Peltini or Speltini, the Moxiani,
                    Phylacenses, and Hiera-politae, between these. To the latter may be added the
                    Berecyntes, mentioned by Strabo.</p>
                <p>Phrygia is commonly divided into the Greater and Lesser, called also Troas. But
                    this division did not take place till Troas had been subdued by the Phrygians;
                    and hence it is rather considered by some Roman writers as a part of Phrygia,
                    than Bithynia, Cappadocia, or any other of the adjacent provinces. In after ages
                    the Greater Phrygia was divided into two districts or governments; one called
                    Phrygia Pacatiana, from Pacatianus, who, under Constantine, was the <hi
                    rend="italic">praefectus praetorio</hi> of the East; and the other Phrygia
                    Salutaris, from some miraculous cures supposed to have been performed there by
                    the archangel Michael.</p>
                <p>This country, and indeed all Asia Minor, was in ancient times greatly celebrated
                    for its fertility. It abounded in all sorts of grain, being, for the most part,
                    a champaign country covered with a deep and rich soil, and plentifully watered
                    by small rivers. In some parts it produced bitumen and other combustible
                    substances. The plains were also well stocked with cattle and pasture grounds.
                    The air was anciently deemed pure and wholesome, although it is now in some
                    parts thought extremely bad, great part of the country lying uncultivated.</p>
                <p>Phrygia Major anciently contained several cities of great celebrity, such as
                    Apamea, Laodicea, Hierapolis, Gordium, &amp;c. There were also in it some famous
                    rivers, such as the Marsyas, the Maeander, &amp;c. The Maeander is now named
                    Madre or Mindre, and was much celebrated by the ancients for its windings and
                    turnings; whence all such windings and turnings have been denominated
                    meanders.</p>
                <p>The Phrygians accounted themselves the most ancient people in the world. Their
                    origin, however, is extremely uncertain. Josephus and St Jerome say that they
                    were descended from Togarmah, one of Gomer’s sons; and that they were known to
                    the Hebrews under the name of Tigrammanes. The heathen authors derive them from
                    the Brygians, a people of Macedonia. But this is a mere conjecture, being
                    totally unsupported, except by the similarity of names. Bochart thinks that the
                    Phrygians were the offspring of Gomer the eldest son of Japhct, the word Phrygia
                    being the Greek translation of his name. Josephus makes Gomer the father of the
                    Galatians; but by the Galatians he must necessarily mean the Phrygians
                    inhabiting that part of Phrygia which the Galatians had made themselves masters
                    of; the descendants of Gomer having been placed by Ezekiel to the northward of
                    Judaea, near Togarmah (which Bochart takes to be Cappadocia), long before the
                    Gauls passed over into Asia. We are willing to let Gomer enjoy the fine country
                    which Bochart has been pleased to assign him, and concede to him the honour of
                    being the progenitor of the Phrygians, since we know no other person upon whom
                    it can be conferred with any degree of probability.</p>
                <p>The ancient Phrygians are described as superstitious, voluptuous, and effeminate,
                    without any prudence or foresight, and of such a servile temper that nothing but
                    stripes and ill usage could make them perform their duty; a character which gave
                    rise to several trite and well-known proverbs. They are also said to have been
                    the inventors of divination by the singing, flying, and feeding of birds. Their
                    music, commonly called the <hi rend="italic">Phrygian mood,</hi> is alleged by
                    some as a proof of their effeminacy.</p>
                <p>The government of this country was certainly monarchical; for during the reigns
                    of some kings, Phrygia was subject to one prince. Ninnacus, Midas, Manis,
                    Gordius and his descendants, were undoubtedly sovereigns of all Phrygia. But
                    some time before the Trojan war we find this country divided into several petty
                    kingdoms, and different princes reigning at the same time. Apollodorus mentions
                    a king of Phrygia as contemporary with Hus king of Troy. Cedrenus and others
                    speak of one Teuthrans, a king of a small country in Phrygia, whose territories
                    were ravaged by Ajax, whilst he himself was slain in single combat, his royal
                    seat laid in ashes, and his daughter, named Teemessa, carried away captive by
                    the conqueror. Homer makes mention of Phorcys and Ascanius, both princes and
                    leaders of the Phrygian auxiliaries who came to the relief of Troy. Tantalus, a
                    prince no less famous for his great wealth, than infamous for his covetousness
                    and other detestable vices, was only king of Sipylus and its adjacent district.
                    That Phrygia was subdued either by Ninus, as Diodorus Siculus informs us, or by
                    the Amazons, as we read in Suidas, is not sufficiently established. Most authors
                    who speak of Gordius tell us, that the Phrygians, having .sent to consult an
                    oracle in order to learn how they might put an end to the intestine broils which
                    divided their country into many factions and parties, received for answer, that
                    the most effectual means to deliver themselves and their country from the
                    calamities under which they groaned, was to commit the government to a king; an
                    advice which they followed accordingly, and placed Gordius on the throne.</p>
                <p>Apamea was the chief emporium of all Asia Minor. Thither resorted merchants and
                    traders from all parts of Greece, Italy, and the neighbouring islands. Besides,
                    we know from Syncellus, that the Phrygians were for some time masters of the
                    sea; and none but trading nations ever prevailed on that element. The country
                    produced many choice and useful commodities, which afforded considerable
                    exports. They had a safe coast, convenient harbours, and whatever may incline us
                    to think that they carried on a considerable trade. But as most of the Phrygian
                    records are lost, we will not dwell on conjectures so difficult to be
                    ascertained.</p>
                <p>We have no remains of the Phrygian laws; and in regard to their learning, as we
                    are informed that for some time they enjoyed the sovereignty of the sea, we may
                    at least allow them a competent skill in geography, geometry, and astronomy,
                    besides their reputed knowledge of music. Some have been of opinion that the
                    Phrygian language bore a great resemblance to the Greek; but the contrary is
                    manifest from the few Phrygian words which have been transmitted to us, and
                    carefully collected by Bochart and Rudbe-chius<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193497262" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7262-0475"/>. To these we may add the
                    authority of Strabo, who, after attempting to derive the name of a Phrygian city
                    from the Greek, concludes that it is a difficult matter to discover any
                    similitude between the barbarous words of the Phrygian language and the Greek.
                    The Phrygian tongue, after the experiment made by Psammetichus, king of Egypt,
                    was looked upon by the Egyptians as the most ancient language )f the world. But
                    other nations, particularly the Scythians, refused to submit to their opinion,
                    as founded on an argument of no real weight. “As the two children,” say they,
                    “had never heard the voice of any human creature, the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >bee,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bekkos,</hi> the first they uttered, was only an
                    imitation of the goats that had suckled them, and happened to be a Phrygian word
                    signifying <hi rend="italic">bread”</hi></p>
                <p>As the Phrygians were superstitious, their idols were consequently numerous. The
                    chief of these was Cybele, who went by a variety of names. They also worshipped
                    Bacchus under the name of Sabazios, and called his priests Saboi.</p>
                <p>The history of their kings is dark and uncertain, and the dates of their several
                    reigns and actions cannot now be fixed. We refer such of our readers, therefore,
                    as wish to know what is certain respecting them, to the Ancient Universal
                    History.</p>
