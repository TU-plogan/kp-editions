                    rend="smallcaps">xso,</hi> John, i. 42), one of the twelve apostles, and author
                    of two epistles in the inspired canon. He was a native of Bethsaida in Galilee,
                    and was the son of a certain Jonas, or John, whence he is named on one occasion
                    in the gospel history Simon Barjona, that is, son of Jona (Matt. xvi. 17). Along
                    with his brother Andrew, he followed the occupation of a fisherman on the Sea of
                    Galilee. It is probable that before they became known to Christ they were both
                    disciples of John the Baptist. That Andrew was so, we are expressly informed by
                    the evangelist John; and as his brother seems to have been much of the same mind
                    with him on religious matters, it is extremely likely that he was so likewise.
                    Their becoming known to Christ was owing to John’s pointing him out on the day
                    after his baptism to Andrew and another disciple (probably the evangelist John),
                    as “the Lamb of God,” on which they immediately followed Christ, and spent some
                    time in receiving his instructions. Shortly after this, Andrew finding Simon,
                    carried him to Christ, who, on receiving him as his disciple, bestowed upon him
                    that surname by which he has since that time been most commonly designated:
                    “When Jesus beheld him he said, thou art Simon the son of Jona; thou shalt be
                    called Cephas, which is by interpretation a stone <hi rend="italic"
                    >(yeετy&gt;ς)l</hi> ’ After this interview the two brothers seem to have
                    returned to their usual occupation for a season, as we have an account in
                    Matthew (iv. 18-20), of their being summoned from that occupation by Christ on a
                    subsequent occasion, posterior to his temptation in the wilderness, and to the
                    commencement of his public ministry as a religious teacher. From this time
                    forward they were his devoted and admiring followers. In the course of the
                    evangelical history several anecdotes of Peter are incidentally recorded, for
                    the purpose, doubtless, principally of illustrating the character and teaching
                    of our Lord, but which tend also to throw light upon the history and character
                    of his attached disciple. Such are the accounts furnished by the evangelists of
                    his walking upon the agitated waters of the Sea of Galilee to meet his master
                    (Matthew, xiv. 22, ff.; Mark, vi. 45, ff.); of his bold and intelligent avowals
                    of the undoubted Messiah-ship of Jesus, notwithstanding the difficulties which
                    he, along with the rest <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the disciples, felt in
                    reconciling what they saw in him with what they had fondly expected the Christ
                    to be (Matthew, xvi. 13-20); of his rash but affectionate rebuke of his Lord for
                    speaking of suffering and death as in prospect for him, and as forming a
                    necessary part of his mediatorial work (Matthew, xvi. 21-23); of his conduct in
                    first rejecting, with an earnestness bordering on horror, the offer of Christ to
                    wash his feet, and then, when the symbolical nature of that act had been
                    explained to him, his over-ardent zeal that not his feet only, but also his
                    hands and his head, might be washed (John, xiii. 4, ff.); of his bold and
                    somewhat vaunting avowal of attachment to his Master, and his determination
                    never to forsake him, followed by his disgraceful denial of Jesus in the hour of
                    trial (John, xiii. 36, 37; Mark, xiv. 29, &amp;c.); of his deep and poignant
                    contrition for this sin (Matthew, xiv. 72); and of his Lord’s ample forgiveness
                    of his offence, after he had received from him a profession of attachment as
                    strong and as frequently repeated as his former denial of him (John, xxi.
                    15-18). From these notices it is easy to gather a tolerably correct conception
                    of the predominating features of the apostle’s character up to this period. He
                    seems to have been a man of undoubted piety, of ardent attachment to his Master,
                    and of great zeal for what he deemed his Master’s honour, but at the same time
                    with a mind rather quick than accurate in its apprehensions, and with feelings
                    rather hasty in their impulse than determined and continuous in their exercise.
                    Hence his readiness in avowing his opinions, and his rashness in forming them;
                    and hence also the tendency which beset his honest openness to degenerate into
                    bravado, and his determinations of valour to evaporate into cowardice at
                    appalling forms of danger. His fall, however, and his subsequent restoration,
                    connected as these were with the mysterious events of his Master’s crucifixion
                    and resurrection, and with the new light which had by them been cast around his
                    character and work, produced a powerful change for the better upon the apostle’s
                    mind. From this time forward he comes before us under a new aspect. A sober
                    dignity and firmness of purpose have displaced his former hasty zeal; sagacity
                    and prudence characterize his conduct; and whilst his love to his Master shows
                    no symptom of abatement, it displays itself rather in active labour and
                    much-enduring patience in his service, than in loud protestations or extravagant
                    exhibitions of attachment. In the subsequent Scripture history he is presented
                    to us as the courageous herald of the kingdom of Christ, by whose mouth the
                    first public declaration of salvation through the crucified Jesus was made to
                    the people; by whose advice and counsel the early churches were planted and
                    governed; and by whom the prejudices of Judaism were first fairly surmounted,
                    and the gospel preached in all its universal freeness to the Gentile world.</p>

                <p>The Acts of the Apostles contain recitals of many interesting incidents which
                    befell him whilst engaged in those efforts. Of these, the chief are his
                    imprisonment and trial before the Sanhedrim, for preaching Christ, and his bold
                    avowal of his determination to persist in that work (Acts, iv. 1-22); his
                    miraculously inflicting the punishment of death on the infatuated couple who had
                    dared to try an experiment upon the omniscience of the Holy Ghost (v. 1-11); his
                    visit to Samaria, and rebuke of Simon Magus, who deemed that the miracles of the
                    apostle were the work of some deep magic spell of which he had not yet become
                    possessed, and which consequently he was desirous of purchasing from Peter
                    (viii. 14-24); the vision by which he was taught that the ancient ritual
                    distinctions between clean and unclean had been abolished, and thereby prepared
                    to attend on the summons of Cornelius, to whom he preached the gospel (x. 1-48);
                    his apprehension by Herod Agrippa, and his deliverance by the interposition of
                    an angel, who opened for him the doors of his prison, and set him free (xii.
                    3-19); and his address to the council at Jerusalem, on the occasion of a request
                    for advice and direction being sent to the church there by the church in
                    Antioch, in which he advocated the exemption of Gentile converts from the
                    ceremonial institutes of the law of Moses (xv. 6-11). In all these incidents we
                    trace the evidences of his mind having undergone an entire change, both as to
                    its views of truth jmd impressions of duty, from what is displayed by the
                    earlier events of his history. On one occasion only do we detect something of
                    his former weakness, and that strangely enough in regard to a matter in which he
                    had been the first of the apostles to perceive, and the first to recommend and
                    follow, a correct course of procedure. The occasion referred to was his
                    withdrawing, through dread of the censures of his Jewish brethren, from the
                    Gentiles at Antioch, after having lived in free and friendly intercourse with
                    them, and his timidly dissembling his convictions as to the religious equality
                    of Jew and Gentile. For this Paul withstood him to the face, and rebuked him
                    sharply, because of the injury which his conduct was calculated to produce to
                    the cause of Christianity. With this single exception, however, his conduct
                    seems to have been in full accordance with the name which his Master had
                    prophetically bestowed on him when he called him Simon the Rock, and with the
                    position which Paul himself assigns to him, at the very time that he recounts
                    his temporary dereliction, as one of the “Pillars of the Church.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Gal. ii. 9-14. The
                    circumstance of Peter’s having submitted to a rebuke from Paul is so fatal to
                    the pretensions which have been urged in favour of his supremacy over the other
                    apostles, that from a very early age attempts have been made to set aside its
                    force, by the hypothesis that it is not of Peter the apostle, but of another
                    person of the same name, that Paul speaks in the passage referred to; Conf.
                    Euseb. H. E. i. 13. This hypothesis, however, is so plainly contradicted by the
                    words of Paul, who explicitly ascribes apostleship to the Peter of whom he
                    writes, that it is astonishing how it could have been admitted even by the most
                    blinded zealot. See ver. 8, 9.</p></note></p>
                <p>Thus far we are enabled, from the inspired documents, to trace the history of
                    this apostle; but for what remains we must be indebted to evidence of a less
                    explicit and certain character. The testimony of several of the ecclesiastical
                    writers, corroborated by the phraseology employed by the apostle himself in the
                    salutation of his first epistle, makes it highly probable that at some period of
                    his official life he performed an extensive missionary tour throughout those
                    districts, to the converts in which his epistles were addressed. “It appears,”
                    says Origen, “that Peter preached to the Jews in the dispersion, in Pontus,
                    Galatia, Bithynia, Cappadocia, and Asia.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    towards the close of his life visited Rome, become bishop of the church in that
                    city, and suffered martyrdom in the persecution raised against the Christians by
                    Nero. The importance of these points in connection with the claims urged by the
                    Catholics on behalf of the supremacy of the pope, has led to a careful and
                    sifting examination of the accuracy of this tradition; the result of which seems
                    to be, that whilst it is admitted as certain that Peter suffered martyrdom, in
                    all probability by crucifixion,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    probable that this took place at Rome, it has, nevertheless, been made pretty
                    clear that he never was for any length of time resident in that city, and
                    morally certain that he never was bishop of the church there.<note

                    apostle’s own testimony in favour of his having at one period resided at Rome,
                    by interpreting the words, “the church that is at <hi rend="italic"
                    >Babylon”</hi> the salutations of which he sends to those to whom he wrote his
                    first epistle, as applying to the church at <hi rend="italic">Pome</hi>; an
                    attempt which Dr Campbell justly stigmatizes as “poor, not to call it
                    ridiculous.” Even if we admit that at the time when this epistle was written it
                    was understood amongst the Christians that Babylon was the prophetical name for
                    Rome, an admission, however, which is entirely unsupported by evidence, it would
                    remain unexplained why the apostle, in such a mere matter-of-fact affair as the
                    communication of the friendly salutations of one church to another, should have
                    employed the obscure and symbolical language of prophecy, when his meaning could
                    have been so much more distinctly conveyed by a simple statement. This would be
                    the more inexplicable, that the style of Peter is remarkably plain and
                    perspicuous throughout the entire epistle. It seems much more consistent,
                    therefore, with rational principles of interpretation, to understand the
                    statement literally of Babylon in Egypt, in which city, as we learn from
                    Josephus, there was a great multitude of Jews <hi rend="italic">{εν⅛α και
                    tran∂ος ην loυδαιuν, Ant. Jud.</hi> l xv. c. ii. sect. 2; see also c. iii. sect.
                    1), and to which, consequently, it is almost certain, that at some period of his
                    life, “the apostle of the circumcision” (Gal. ii. 8) must have paid a visit.</p>
                <p>The assertion that St Peter was bishop of Rome is connected with another by which
                    the claims of the papacy are sought to be established, namely, that to him was
                    conceded a right of supremacy over the other apostles. In support of this, an
                    appeal is made to those passages in the gospels, where declarations supposed to
                    imply the bestowal of peculiar honour and distinction on Peter are recorded as
                    having been addressed to him by our Lord. The most important of these are, “Thou
                    art Peter, and on this rock will I build my church” (Matt. xvi. 18); and, “Unto
                    thee will I give the keys of the kingdom of heaven,” &amp;c. (Matt, xvi. 19). At
                    first sight these passages would seem to bear out the assumption founded on
                    them; but upon a more careful investigation it will be seen that this is rather
                    in appearance than in reality. The force of both is greatly impaired for the
                    purpose for which Catholics produce them, by the circumstance, that whatever of
                    power or authority they may be supposed to confer upon Peter, must be regarded
                    as shared by him with the other apostles, inasmuch as to them also are ascribed
                    in other passages the same qualities and powers which are promised to Peter in
                    those under consideration. If by the former of these passages we are to
                    understand that the church is built upon Peter, the Apostle Paul informs us that
                    it is not in him <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> that it is built, but upon <hi
                    rend="italic">all</hi> the apostles (Ephes, ii. 20); and in the book of
                    Revelation we are told, that on the twelve foundations of the New Jerusalem (the
                    Christian church), are inscribed <pb break="no" facs="nls:193495143"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-5143-0312"/>“the names of the <hi rend="italic">twelve

                    n</hi> (ch. xxi. 14). As for the declaration in the latter of these passages, it
                    was in all its essential parts repeated by our Lord to the other disciples
                    immediately before his passion, as announcing a privilege which, as his
                    apostles, they were to possess in common (Matt, xviii. 18; John, xx. 23). It is,
                    moreover, uncertain in what sense our Lord used the language in question. In
                    both cases his words are metaphorical; and nothing can be more unsafe than to
                    build a theological dogma upon language of which the meaning is not clear, and
                    to which, from the earliest ages, different interpretations have been affixed.
                    And, finally, even granting the correctness of that interpretation which
                    Catholics put upon these verses, it will not bear out the conclusion they would
                    deduce from them, inasmuch as the judicial supremacy of Peter over the other
                    apostles does not necessarily follow from his possessing authority over the
                    church. On the other side it is certain, that there is no instance on record of
                    the apostle’s having ever claimed or exercised this supposed power; but, on the
                    contrary, he is oftener than once represented as submitting to an exercise of
                    power upon the part of others, as when, for instance, he went forth as a
                    messenger from the apostles assembled in Jerusalem to the Christians in Samaria
                    (Acts, viii. 14), and when he received a rebuke from St Paul, as already
                    noticed. Whilst, however, it is pretty well established that Peter enjoyed no
                    judicial supremacy over the other apostles, it would, perhaps, be going too far
                    to affirm that no dignity or primacy whatsoever was conceded to him on the part
                    of his brethren. His superiority in point of age, his distinguished personal
                    excellence, his reputation and success as a teacher of Christianity, and the
                    prominent part which he had ever taken in his Master’s affairs, both before his
                    death and after his ascension, furnished sufficient grounds for his being raised
                    to a position of respect and of moral influence in the church and amongst his
                    brother apostles. To this some countenance is given by the circumstances that he
                    is called “the first,” <hi rend="smallcaps">hjŭi-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >roς,</hi> by Matthew (ch. x. 2), and that apparently not merely as a numerical,
                    but as an honorary distinction; that when the apostles are mentioned as a body,
                    it is frequently by the phrase, “Peter and the eleven,” or, “Peter and the rest
                    of the apostles,” or something similar; and that when Paul went up to Jerusalem
                    by divine revelation, it was to Peter particularly that the visit was paid.
                    These circumstances, taken in connection with the prevalent voice of Christian
                    antiquity, would seem to authorize the opinion that Peter occupied some such
                    position as that of <hi rend="italic">ιrgoεσ-ruς, or</hi> president in the
                    apostolical college, but without any power or authority of a personal kind over
                    his brother apostles.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The extant writings of the apostle Peter are confined to two brief epistles, of
                    which the former has been universally admitted as genuine, whilst the latter has

                    extremely insecure, as they depend chiefly upon nice distinctions and analogies
                    of style between the two epistles, which are seldom drawn with such unerring
                    accuracy as to induce us to attach very much weight to them.<note

                    The persons to whom these epistles were addressed were converted Jews scattered
                    over the districts enumerated by the apostle in the commencement of the first of
                    them. The epistles themselves are characterized by great vigour of conception,
                    warmth of feeling, and force of eloquence. The style is glowing and rapid,
                    approaching at times to vehemence; and the sentiments are of the most elevated
                    description. The exhortation to holiness with which the second chapter of the
                    first epistle concludes, is perhaps unequalled in the New Testament for the
                    appropriateness of its sentiments, the beauty of its appeals, and the concentred
                    energy and rapid flow of the style; nor would it be easy to find any passage,
                    either in sacred or profane literature, that should surpass in vividness of
                    description and power of expression the prophetic view of the end of the world
                    with which, towards the conclusion of the second epistle, he enforces his
                    exhortation to holy conversation and godliness. In both epistles we trace the
                    characteristic ardour and the elevated piety of their author, and of both we may
                    justly say, in the language of the excellent Leighton, that they are eminently
                    adapted “to establish Christians in believing, to direct them in doing, and to
                    comfort them in suffering, often setting before them the matchless example of
                    the Lord Jesus, and the greatness of their engagement to follow him.” <hi

                    rend="italic">of Blois,</hi> a learned man of the twelfth century, was born
                    about the year 1120, at the city of Blois, in France, from which he derived his
                    name. His parents being opulent, gave him a learned education. In his youth,
                    when he studied in the university of Paris, he was excessively fond of poetry;
                    and when he had advanced a little further in life, he became no less fond of
                    rhetoric, to the study of which he applied with the greatest ardour. From Paris
                    he removed to Bologna in Italy, to study the civil and the canon law, in the
                    knowledge of which he very much excelled. From his writings it appears that he
                    cultivated medicine, and several branches of the mathematics, with no little
                    care and success. But the study of theology formed the chief delight and
                    business of his life, and in it he not only spent the greatest part of his time,
                    but made the greatest progress. Unfortunately, however, the theology he studied
                    was of that scholastic kind, which consisted in vain attempts to explain and
                    prove the many absurd opinions which then prevailed, by the subtilties of the
                    Aristotelian logic. In attempting to explain the doctrine of the real presence,
                    as held by the Latin church, he was the first who employed the famous term <hi
                    rend="italic">transubstantiation,</hi> which was soon afterwards adopted by the
                    church, and has ever since been retained. Being appointed preceptor to William
                    II. king of Sicily, in 1167, he obtained the custody of the privy seal; and,
                    next to the Archbishop of Palermo, who was the prime minister, he had the
                    greatest influence in all affairs. His power, however, was not of long duration;
                    for the archbishop being banished in 1168, Peter soon afterwards left the court
                    of Sicily, and returned into France. But in a short time he found another royal
                    patron, having been invited into England by Henry II. who employed him as his
                    private secretary, made him Archdeacon of Bath, and gave him some other
                    benefices. Having spent a few years at court, however, he conceived a disgust at
                    that way of life, of which in one of his letters he has drawn a very unpleasing
                    picture, and retired into the family of Richard, archbishop of Canterbury, who
                    had made him his chancellor about the year 1176. In this station he continued
                    until the death of the archbishop in 1183, enjoying the highest degree of favour
                    with that prelate, though he used much freedom in reproving him for his
                    remissness in the government of the church. He continued in the same station in
                    the family of Archbishop Baldwin, who succeeded Richard, acting both as his
                    secretary and as his chancellor. In 1187, he was also sent by the latter prelate
                    upon an embassy to Rome, to plead his cause before Urban III. in the famous
                    controversy between him and the monks of Canterbury respecting the church of
                    Hackington. After the departure of his friend and patron Baldwin for the Holy
                    Land in the year 1190, our author was in his old age involved in various
                    troubles, the causes <pb break="no" facs="nls:193495156"

                    about the end of the twelfth century. He appears from his works, which may be
                    justly reckoned amongst the most valuable monuments of the age in which he
                    flourished, to have been a man of great integrity and sincere piety, as well as
                    of a lively, inventive genius, and uncommon erudition. His printed works consist
                    of a hundred and thirty-four letters, which he collected together at the desire
                    of Henry II.; of sixty-five sermons, delivered on various occasions; and of
                    seventeen tracts on different subjects.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Peter</hi> I, czar or tsar, and afterwards emperor, of
                    Russia, was the founder of the Russian empire. That country was indeed well
                    known, and of great antiquity; but it had no extent of power, of political
                    influence, or of general commerce in Europe, until the time of Peter. He was
                    born in 1672, and proclaimed czar when only ten years of age, in exclusion of
                    John his eldest brother, who, being of a sickly constitution, was at the same
                    time equally deficient in understanding. The Princess Sophia, his sister by the
                    half-blood, raised an insurrection in favour of John; but, to put an end to the
                    civil war, it was at last agreed that the two brothers should jointly share the
                    imperial dignity. Peter had been very ill brought up, not only through the
                    general defects of education in Russia, but likewise through the arts of the
                    Princess Sophia, who surrounded him with every thing calculated to stifle his
                    natural desire of knowledge and to deprave his mind. But notwithstanding this,
                    his inclination for military exercises discovered itself in his tenderest years.
                    He formed a company of fifty men, commanded by foreign officers, and clothed and
                    exercised after the German manner. He himself entered into the lowest post, that
                    of a drummer, and never rose otherwise than as a soldier of fortune. His design
                    in this was to teach his nobility, that merit, and not birth, formed the only
                    solid title to military employments. He reinforced his company with several
                    others, until at last he had got together a considerable body of soldiers. As he
                    had then no war on his hands, he exercised them in all sorts of mock
                    engagements, and by this means secured to himself a body of well-disciplined
                    troops. The sight of a Dutch vessel, which he had met with upon a lake belonging
                    to one of his pleasure-houses, made such an impression on his mind, that he
                    conceived the almost impracticable design of forming a navy. His first care was
                    to get some Hollanders to build small vessels at Moscow; and he passed two
                    successive summers on board of English or Dutch ships, which sailed out from
                    Archangel, that he might instruct himself in every branch of nautical affairs.
                    In the year 1696, the Czar John died, and Peter now became sole master of the
                    empire. In 1698 he sent an embassy to Holland, and having gone <hi rend="italic"
                    >incognito</hi> in the retinue, he visited England as well as Holland, to inform
                    himself fully respecting the art of ship-building. At Amsterdam he worked in the
                    yard as a private ship-carpenter, under the name of Peter Michaelof; but he has
                    been often heard to say, that if he had never gone to England, he would still
                    have remained ignorant of the art of ship-building. In 1700 he had got together
                    a body of regular troops, amounting to thirty thousand infantry; and now the
                    vast project he had formed displayed itself in all its parts. He opened his
                    dominions, which till then had been closed, having first sent the principal
                    nobility of his empire into foreign countries to improve themselves in knowledge
                    and in learning. He invited to Russia all the foreigners he could meet with, who
                    were capable of instructing his subjects in any respect, and offered them great
                    encouragement to settle in his dominions. This raised many discontents; and the
                    despotical authority which he exerted on all such occasions was scarcely
                    sufficient to suppress them. In 1700, being strengthened by the alliance of
                    Augustus king of Poland, he made war on Charles XII. king of Sweden.</p>
                <p>His ill success at first did not discourage him; for he used to say, “I know that
                    my armies must be overcome for a great while; but even this will at last teach
                    them to conquer.” He afterwards gained considerable advantages, and founded St
                    Petersburg in 1703. In 1709 he gained a complete victory over the Swedes at
                    Pultowa. In 1712 he was surrounded by the Tuιks on the banks of the Pruth, and
                    seemed inevitably lost, had not the Czarina Catherine bribed the grand vizier,
                    and the czar’s prudence completed his deliverance. In 1716 he made a tour
                    through Germany and Holland, and visited the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris.
                    It would be endless to enumerate all the various establishments for which the
                    Russians are indebted to him. He formed an army according to the tactics of the
                    most experienced nations; he fitted out fleets in all the four seas which border
                    upon Russia; he caused many strong fortresses to be raised according to the best
                    plans, and made convenient harbours; he introduced arts and sciences into his
                    dominions, and freed religion from many superstitious abuses; he made laws,
                    built cities, cut canals, and executed many other works; he was generous in
                    rewarding, and impartial in punishing; faithful, laborious, and humble, yet not
                    free from a certain roughness of temper natural to his countrymen. He had indeed
                    cured himself of excess in drinking; but he has been branded with several other
                    vices, particularly cruelty. He published the unfortunate history of his son
                    Prince Alexis, towards whom some blame his severity, whilst others think it no
                    greater than was absolutely necessary. He perlect-ly knew the respect due to
                    persons of merit; and not only heaped honours upon them during their life, but
                    paid to their memory marks of esteem after their death. He died of the strangury
                    in 1725, and is said to have left the world with the magnanimity of a hero and
                    the piety of a Christian.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Peter</hi><hi rend="italic">the Wild Boy-</hi> This
                    extraordinary creature at one time occasioned a great deal of speculation
                    amongst the learned; but we do not know that any satisfactory causes have been
                    assigned for the striking difference observed between him and other human
                    beings.</p>
                <p>The following account of him is extracted from the parish register of North
                    Church, in the county of Hertford. “Peter, commonly known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Peter the Wild Boy,</hi> lies buried in this church-yard, opposite
                    to the porch. In the year 1725 he was found in the woods near Hamelen, a
                    fortified town in the electorate of Hanover, when his majesty George I. with his
                    attendants, was hunting in the forest of Hertswold. He was supposed to be then
                    about twelve years of age, and had subsisted in those woods upon the bark of
                    trees, leaves, berries, &amp;c. for some considerable length of time. How long
                    he had continued in that wild state is altogether uncertain; but that he had
                    formerly been under the care of some person, was evident from the remains of a
                    shirt collar about his neck at the time when he was found. As Hamelen was a town
                    where criminals were confined to work upon the fortifications, it was then
                    conjectured at Hanover that Peter might be the issue of one of those criminals,
                    who had either wandered into the woods and could not find his way back again,
                    or, being discovered to be an idiot, was inhumanly turned out by his parents,
                    and left to perish, or shift for himself. In the following year, 1726, he was
                    brought over to England, by the order of Queen Caroline, then Princess of Wales,
                    and put under the care of Dr Arbuthnot, with proper masters to attend him. But
                    notwithstanding there appeared to be no natural defect in his organs of speech,
                    after all the pains that had been taken with him he could never be brought
                    distinctly to articulate a single syllable, and proved totally incapable of
                    receiving any instruction. He was afterwards intrusted to the care of Mrs
                    Titchbourn, one of the queen’s bedchamber <pb break="no" facs="nls:193495169"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-5169-0314"/>women, with a handsome pension annexed to the
                    charge. Mrs Titchbourn usually spending a few weeks every summer at the house of
                    Mr James Fenn, a yeoman farmer at Axter’s End, in this parish, Peter was left to
                    the care of the said Mr Fenn, who was allowed thirty-five pounds a year for his
                    support and maintenance. After the death of James Fenn he was transferred to the
                    care of his brother Thomas Fenn, at another farm-house in this parish, called
                    Broadway, where he lived with the several successive tenants of that farm, and
                    with the same provision allowed by government, to the time of his death, 22d of
                    February 1785, when he was supposed to be about seventy-two years of age.”</p>

                    applied to an annual tribute of one penny, paid at Rome by every family at the
                    festival of St Peter. Ina the Saxon king, when he went in pilgrimage to Rome
                    about the year 740, paid this contribution to the pope, partly as alms and
                    partly in recompense of a house erected in Rome for English pilgrims; and the
                    same continued to be paid generally until the time of Henry VIII., when it was
                    enacted, that henceforth no person should pay any pensions, Peter’s pence, or
                    other impositions, for the use of the bishop or see of Rome.</p>
