                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">PARKER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Matthew</hi></label>, the second
                    Protestant archbishop of Canterbury, was born at Norwich in the year 1504, the
                    19th of Henry VII. His father, who was a man in trade, died when his son was
                    about twelve years of age; but his mother took especial care of his education,
                    and at the age of seventeen sent him to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge,
                    where, in 1523, he took his bachelor’s degree. In 1527 he was ordained, created
                    master of arts, and chosen fellow of the college. Having obtained a license to
                    preach, he frequently discoursed at St Paul’s cross in London, and in other
                    parts of the kingdom. In the year 1533 or 1534, he was made chaplain to Anne
                    Boleyn, who obtained for him the deanery of Stoke Clare in Suffolk, where he
                    founded a grammar-school. After the death of this unfortunate woman, Henry made
                    him his own chaplain, and in 1541 appointed him prebendary of Ely. In 1544, he
                    was, by the king’s command, elected master of Corpus Christi College, and the
                    following year appointed vice chancellor of the university. In 1547 he lost the
                    deanery of Stoke, by the dissolution of that college. In the same year he
                    married the daughter of Mr Robert Harlestone, a Norfolk gentleman.</p>
                <p>In the year 1552 he was nominated by Edward VI. to the deanery of Lincoln, which,
                    with his other preferments, enabled him to live in great affluence. But Mary had
                    scarcely succeeded to the throne when he was deprived of every office he held in
                    the church, and obliged to live in obscurity, frequently changing his place of
                    abode to avoid the fate of the other reformers.</p>
                <p>Elizabeth ascended the throne in 1558; and in the following year Parker was at
                    once raised from indigence and obscurity to the see of Canterbury, an honour
                    which he had neither solicited nor desired. In this high station he acted with
                    equal spirit and propriety. He founded several scholarships in Bennet or Corpus
                    Christi College, Cambridge, and made large presents of plate to that and to
                    other colleges in this university. He gave a hundred volumes to the public
                    library; and, besides, founded a free school at Rochdale in Lancashire. He took
                    care to have the different sees filled with pious and learned men; and,
                    considering the great want of Bibles in many places, he, with the assistance of
                    other learned men, improved the English translation, which he caused to be
                    printed on large paper, and dispersed throughout the kingdom. This estimable
                    prelate died in the year 1575, aged seventy-two, and was buried in his own
                    chapel at Lambeth. He was pious without affectation or austerity, cheerful and
                    contented in the midst of adversity, moderate in the height of power, and
                    beneficent beyond example. He was the author of several works, and likewise
                    published four of our best historians; Matthew of Westminster, Matthew Paris,
                    Asset’s Life of King Alfred, and Thomas</p>
                <p>Walsingham. The archbishop also translated the Psalter. This version was printed,
                    but without a name, and has been attributed to an obscure poet of the name of
                    Keeper. Such, at least, was Wood’s opinion, although it is more than probable
                    that he was wrong. But in the Gentleman’s Magazine for 1781 (p. 566), Parker is
                    proved to be the author of a version of the Psalms.</p>
