                <p><label type="entry">PLAGUE</label>. Tlíe terms pest, pestilence, and plague, were
                    long employed in Great Britain, as were the corresponding terms in other
                    languages, both in ancient and in modern times, to denote simply a disease
                    attacking a great number of persons simultaneously and in succession, and
                    destroying a large proportion of those whom it attacked; in short, á
                    widely-diffused and malignant'epidemic. At the present day these terms are
                    restricted to signify a particular form of disease, of fréquent occurrence in
                    the countries bordering on the eastern extremity of the Mediterranean, the
                    Levant and Archipelago, but occasionally appearing also in countries* more or
                    less remote from these regions.</p>
                <p>The disease in question, the plague of the Levant, as it is often termed,
                    exhibits, not in fevery individual case, but in a large proportion of those
                    affected in the progress of its epidemic prevalence, two classes of symptoms,
                    the constitutional and the local. Under the constitutional symptoms may be
                    comprehended those indicatory of fever of a malignant or typhoid character, with
                    various concomitant phenomena that are in wont to attend fever of this character
                    in different regions of the globe; the local consist chiefly of glandular
                    swellings, or buboes as they are termed, and of malignant or gangrenous boils,
                    or carbuncles.</p>
                <p>These two classes of symptoms stand variously related to one another in different
                    individual cases; and even, there seems reason to believe, in different periods
                    of the same epidemic. Dr Patrick Russell, in hiè Treatise of the Plague, in
                    which he has given the results of his own extensive observation of this disease
                    during its epidemlc prevalencein Aleppo in the years 1760,1761, and 1762,
                    mentions one class of patients.who seldom or never bad buboes or carbuncles; and
                    another class, in a few of whom, when the disease proved quickly fatal, these
                    symptoms were likewise absent. “These two eruptions,” he says, “are equally
                    diagnostics of the true plague; their presence, separately or in conjunction,
                    leaves the nature of the distemper unequivocal; but fatal has been the error of
                    rashly, from their absence, pronouncing a distemper not to be the plague, which
                    in the sequel has depopulated regions, and which early precaution might probably
                    have prevented from spreading.” Dr Louis Frank, also, mentions, that though the
                    appearance of buboes is the most constant and characteristic symptom of the
                    plague, yet he has seen many affected with this disease, in whom buboes were
                    altogether wanting, or appeared only at the period of death. As cases of this
                    kind are particularly liable to occur at the commencement of an epidemic, a
                    considerable number of persons may, it is obvious, come to be affected, before
                    the pestilential character of the disease is ascertained, or even suspected,
                    particularly in regions in which the plague is of rare occurrence.</p>
                <p>But as the constitutional symptoms of plague may occur without the local, so the
                    local may occur with "little fever or constitutional disturbance of any kind. Dr
                    Russell, under his fifth class of cases, to which he refers those of slight
                    infection, in which all the infected recovered, and which, he says, “was very
                    numerous,” mentions, that in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193501136"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-1136-0773"/>these the access was often attended with so little
                    apparent disorder, that the eruptions gave the first alarm, “the buboes were
                    often the first symptom of infection and the fever, which came on afterwards,
                    was frequently so slight as not to confine the sick to the house: others found
                    themselves indisposed for two or three days, but were not sensible of any
                    febrile heat whatever. In these, cases, and in some others in which the fever
                    ran somewhat higher, but without the concurrence of alarming symptoms, “all the
                    infected had buboes or carbuncles, and very often both eruptions.concurred in
                    the ,same .subject. Persons not confined, by indisposition were often, by t <hi
                    rend="subscript"> i</hi> he inguinal buboes, prevented from walking abroad.”</p>
                <p>In cases of plague in which .both. the constitutional and the local symptoms
                    manifest themselves, there is considerable difference in the rclativq tune of
                    their appearance· “In a very large proportion of the sick,” ï)r Russell informs
                    us, “the buboes made their appearance ip the course of the first day; but in
                    many instances they did not appear before the second or third day, or* even
                    later,”</p>
                <p>In the few remarks we purpose to offer relative to the plague, we shall consider
                    some points of its natural history, as it presents itself, 1<hi rend="italic"
                    >st,</hi> in the <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> equntries in which it is of
                    frequent occurrence; and, <hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi> 2<hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi>, in those countries in which it rarely shows itself.</p>
                <p>I. In the countries bordering on the,Levant and Archipelago, the plague is liable
                    to present itself either in single, or, as they are termed by medical mθn, <hi
                    rend="italic">sporadic</hi> cases,; or in a great number of cases.simultaneously
                    or in succession, so as to constitute an <hi rend="italic">epidemic.</hi></p>
                <p>It is stated, indeed, by Dr Patrick Russell, that “in the intervals between the
                    plagues of Aleppo,” that is to say, between the successive epidemic prevalences
                    of this disease, “the city remains absolutely free; and the plague is never
                    sporadic there, except in its beginning and decline; it never subsists for any
                    length ,of time in a few scattered cases without consequence.” But this
                    statement is not conformable with tfie reports of others, Μ. Pugnet, who
                    accompanied Bonaparte’s expedition to Egypt, affirms, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoire</hi><hi rend="italic">suf</hi><hi rend="italic">les Fièvres du mauvais
                    caractère du</hi><hi rend="italic">Lévant,</hi> that that country is seldom
                    absolutely free from the plague during several successive years; and that in
                    almost every month of every year there occur a number of cases, though these are
                    not noted when they do not occasion its epidemic prevalence. Sir James M‘Grigor,
                    who had the medical charge of the army which was brought from India to Egypt in
                    1801, in like manner expresses his belief that “the contagion of plague is
                    seldom or never <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> out of Egypt.” Dr Murdoch
                    Mackenzie, in his Letters concerning the Plague at Constantinople, published in
                    the Philosophical Transactions, vol. xlvii. remarks, that during the twenty
                    years he had lived at Constantinople and Smyrna, there had scarcely been a year,
                    excepting three, in which the plague did not threaten more or less, with little
                    or no perceptible difference in the character of the season to explain it. The
                    late Sir Thomas MaitΓand, who had occasion, whilst governor-general of Malta and
                    the Ionian Islands, to apply his vigorous mind to the investigation of the
                    natural history of the plague, came to the conclusion, that, though subject to
                    variations in respect of prevalence in the countries in question, this disease
                    is never wholly extinct in any of them.' “We find,” says Sir Thomas, “that,
                    whether it be in Egypt, at Smyrna, or Constantinople, an effort has been made to
                    convince the world that the plague stops in these places at certain seasons, and
                    commences at others. For my own part, I can only say, that he would be a bold
                    man who would venture to assert that the plague ever is eradicated at any season
                    of the year, in any one of the three places just mentioned; on the‘ contrary, I
                    hold nothing more certain, than that it constantly exists in them all, showing
                    itself with greater violence at one time than at another, and hardly taken
                    notice of till it arrives at such a height as to be seriously alarming to the
                    whole community.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Variqus estimates have been given of the frequency of plague epidemics in the
                    principal towns of Egypt, Syria, and Turkey. Prosper Alpinus, who resided in
                    Egypt between 158Õ and 1584, refers to a belief of its recurring in that country
                    every seventh year, but represents this belief as being incorrect. Dr Alexander
                    Russell mentions it as the common opinion of the inhabitants of Aleppo, that
                    they are visited with the plague about once in ten years; which opinion, he
                    observes, seems in some measure to be founded on experience. Dr Mackenzie,
                    writing from Constantinople in 1763, says,’ that “the plague is now more
                    frequent in the Levant than it waè when I first came into this country, about
                    thirty years ago; for then they were almost strangers to it in Alecpo and
                    Tripoli of Syria, and they had it but seldom at Smyrna; whereas now they have it
                    frequently at Aleppo, and summer and winter in Smyrna, which,” he adds, “must be
                    owing to the great communication by commerce all pver the Levant, and more
                    extended into the country villages than it used to be.”</p>
                <p>When the plague assumes an epidemic character in the countries in which it is
                    common, the epidemic frequently continues for several years; not, however,
                    uninterruptedly, for in general it is observed, that for a part of the year the
                    disease in a great measure or altogether disappears, breaking out again after an
                    interval of various duration. In the same way, in non-epidemic seasons, sporadic
                    cases of plague are seldom or never met with during a particular portion of the
                    year. It seems reasonable to conclude that this disappearance of plague, or
                    great abatement in its prevalence, during a particular portion of the year, must
                    be connected with some peculiar condition of the weather then prevailing, and
                    consequently that the period must be liable to variations, not only in different
                    countries, but also to some extent in the same country in different years.</p>
                <p>Dr L. Frank mentions his having been assured that at Cairo the time of year in
                    which the operation of the plaguepoison is suspended uniformly commences with
                    the summer solstice (21st June), as stated by Prosper Alpinus with regard both
                    to that city and to Egypt generally; but that at Alexandria, Rosetta, and
                    Damietta, that is, in the towns along the coast, the plague terminates about the
                    feast of St John (24th June), though not uniformly every year, as it sometimes
                    continues till about the middle of July. In respect to the period of the
                    plague’s terminating at Cairo, Dr P. Russell mentions, that several accounts
                    which, on making strict inquiry, he received from persons long resident in that
                    city, Europeans as well as natives, all concurred in the fact of the plague’s
                    declining rapidly in June, but not ceasing entirely; and he particularly refers
                    to information which he had received of the Europeans having remained, in 1759,
                    shut up till the middle of July, “which was considered as very extraordinary.”
                    Dr Russell also remarks, that in most places in the Levant, a popular tradition
                    is to be found of the extinction of the plague at a certain fixed period, which
                    varies, however, at different places. At Aleppo, he adds, it is fixed nearly a
                    month later than at Cairo. His brother, Dr A. Russell, states, that at Aleppo
                    the plague comes to its height in June, decreases greatly in July, and certainly
                    disappears in August. Mr Dawes, chaplain to the factory at Aleppo, says, that in
                    all the plagues with which Aleppo had been visited in the eighteenth century up
                    to that of 1761, the contagion is said to have regularly and constantly ceased
                    in August and September. But that which prevailed in the year last mentioned
                    proved the fallacy of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193501149"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-1149-0774"/>general observations on this subject; for, from
                    the end of March 1761, to the middle of September 1762 (that is, for acontinued
                    period of seventeen and a half months), scarcely a day passed without some
                    deaths or fresh attacks from the distemper; and though its violence ceased in
                    auturnn, yet on an average he believes it was fatal to at least thirty persons
                    in every week, from that time to the end of the winter. Dr P. Russell, in
                    reference to the same epidemic, says,—“The natives all agreed in declaring the
                    plague had never before been so formidable in the winter; and many went so far
                    as to affirm that it was the first instance of the plague’s having been ever
                    known at all at that season. But what happened in the year 1742 was entirely
                    forgotten; and the cases in the present winter, however strongly marked, will
                    probably, in the course of a few years more, be obliterated from the memory of
                    the people of Aleppo, leaving them as tenacious as before of a traditionary
                    opinion, that the city stands secure from the plague in the winter.” At Smyrna,
                    according to Mr Hayes, the virulence of the disorder is almost invariably over
                    by August. From the statement of Dr Mackenzie, it appears that the plague began
                    at Constantinople in 1751 about the middle of May, and continued uninterruptedly
                    more than sixteen months, that is, up to the latter end of September 1752. In
                    1753, it began the last day of May, and continued uninterruptedly till the
                    middle of September 1754.</p>
                <p>Admitting that, in general, though certainly not universally, plague disappears
                    in Egypt soon after the 21st of June, in Syria about a month later, and probably
                    at a still more advanced period of the year in Asia Minor and Turkey, is there
                    any constancy in regard of its re-appearance? Sir J. M ’ Grigor mentions that
                    the month of November, or more usually of December, is the time of year in which
                    the plague is wont to re-appear in Egypt, and that, according to the observation
                    of the natives, when it breaks out before December, they have always a generally
                    prevailing and very destructive disease. According to Pugnet, there are three
                    periods in the prevalence of the plague in Egypt ∙. its <hi rend="italic"
                    >invasion,</hi> which occupies the months of December, January, and February;
                    its <hi rend="italic">acme,</hi> which occupies March, April, and May; and its
                    <hi rend="italic">extinction,</hi> which occur« suddenly during the second half
                    of June. Frank says, that, according to the general accounts, the plague seldom
                    occurs in Egypt in the months of September, October, November, December, and
                    January, but usually appears in the months of February, March, and April; and he
                    adds, conformably with Sir J. M‘Grigor’s statement, that “it is well
                    ascertained, that, when it begins in September or October, it is more terrible
                    than if it appears later, because it then continues for a longer time, and is
                    the cause of greater mortality. Perhaps, also, the pestilential miasma becomes
                    more deadly.” At Aleppo, according to Dr A. Russell, the plague is constantly
                    moderated during the winter, and grows more violent as the spring advances. Mr
                    Hayes mentions the months of March and April as the period at which the plague
                    usually begins at Smyrna. Timone states in regard to the plague at
                    Constantinople, that it is pretty soundly lulled by the cold of winter,
                    emitting, however, here and there sparks during that season as well as in
                    spring; it increases in summer, and rages with the greatest violence in August.
                    The spread of the infection is not stopped by the coldish north winds blowing at
                    stated times of the summer; but if the south winds blow during that season,
                    constantly and of sufficient warmth, they suppress the plague.</p>
                <p>We shall presently have occasion to see the application of these facts relative
                    to the periods at which the plague subsides and revives in Egypt, Syria, and
                    Turkey, to the explanations that have been proposed of the causes or agencies by
                    which this disease is produced.</p>
                <p>Great difference of opinion has subsisted as to the nature of the agent which,
                    by'its operation on the animal economy, produces this form of disease; whether
                    the plague is generated by a particular state of the atmosphere, itself the
                    result of the reciprocal action of various concurrent agents, and which is
                    sufficient to produce the disease in a large proportion of those who are exposed
                    to its influence, as is the case in respect of ague or intermittent fever; or
                    whether the disease is communicated from person to person through the, medium of
                    some impalpable effluvium from the body, as in the cases of measles and scarlet
                    fever? Whether, in the language of Υnedical men, the plague depends on
                    terrestrial or atmospheric miasm, improperly named infection by some, or upon
                    human contagion.</p>
                <p>‘The laws of quarantine, so far as they refer to the plague, obviously proceed on
                    the supposition that this disease is capable of being communicated by person to
                    person; and also that the plague-poison is capable of being imbibed by
                    substances that have come in contact with the bodies of those affected, or that
                    have been exposed to the air which they breathe; of remaining attached to such
                    substances for a considerable space of time, when excluded from free
                    ventilation; of mixing with the atmosphere when exposed to it, and infecting
                    those who breathe it; or of communicating the disease to persons who touch or
                    handle the articles to which it is attached. The inconvenience with which the
                    enforcement of the quarantine laws is necessarily attended, particularly to
                    those engaged in commerce, has naturally rendered many anxious for their repeal
                    or modification. The grounds upon which those who have represented them as
                    unnecessary have rested their case, may be referred to the two following: lsí,
                    That the plague always depends on miasm, and consequently, where the
                    circumstances necessary for the production of plague-miasm concur, the disease
                    will happen in spite of all quarantine regulations; and, 2d, that supposing the
                    disease to be contagious, there are climates in which its contagion cannot be
                    received and propagated, and consequently, as regards these, quarantine laws
                    must be superfluous.</p>
                <p>The evidence in favour of the contagious character of the plague in Egypt, Syria,
                    Turkey, &amp;c. and of its dissemination both by person and by fomites, as
                    deduced from the places and individuals that escape, as well as from the places
                    and individuals that become affected, is so ample and complete, as to leave room
                    for doubt only in minds pre-occupied with theoretical dogmata, or considerations
                    of personal advantage. Accordingly, the opinion adverse to the contagious
                    character of plague in these countries, seems to be now very generally abandoned
                    by those who can be regarded as impartial and competent judges of the fact.
                    λVhen a select committee was appointed by the House of Commons in 1819, to
                    consider the validity of the doctrine of contagion in the plague, all the
                    medical men examined, with the exception of two, were in favour of the received
                    doctrine, that the plague is a disease communicable by contagion. One of these
                    anti-contagionists in plague was Dr Charles Maclean, the other Dr Mitchell. Of
                    the medical officers of the French and English armies in Egypt between 1799 and
                    1802, who have published an account of the diseases which presented themselves
                    to their observation during that campaign, Assalini seems to have been the only
                    one who came to the conclusion that the plague is not a truly contagious
                    disease, and that it is produced solely by local causes. »</p>
                <p>By some, however, it has been supposed that both terrestrial miasm and human
                    contagion are concerned in spreading the plague, the disease being first
                    generated by miasm, but subsequently diffusing itself, by contagion, both in the
                    districts in which the miasm is produced, and in countries to which it does not
                    extend, and in which it can <pb break="no" facs="nls:193501162"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-1162-0775"/>not be supposed to be generated. Amongst those
                    holding this doctrine, there has been a difference of opinion as to the number
                    of districts in which the supposed plague-miasm maybe produced. Some conceive
                    that there is, one particular portion of the globe only in which the
                    circumstances essential for the development of plague-miasm occur in
                    combination; an opinion readily adopted by the different nations and provinces
                    among whom the disease frequently prevails, though they differ very much as to
                    the parent soil, each being desirous to transfer that odium from itself to its
                    neighbour. Μ. Fodéré, who, though he had never personally seen the plague, had
                    bestowed much pains in studying its history, maintains that the plague is a
                    production of the soil of Lower Egypt alone; that is to say, of the combination
                    of the waters of the Nile, and of the materials brought down by that river, with
                    the vegetable earth of the Delta, when, after the inundation, the heat causes
                    these waters to be volatilized, and gives rise to the creation of an immense
                    multitude of insects and of reptiles. When the disease has once been produced in
                    the human body by this miasm, he has no doubt as to its being capable of being
                    communicated from person to person. He holds, therefore, that in Lower Egypt,
                    the plague is both an endemic and a contagious disease; whilst, when it occurs
                    in Upper Egypt, in Syria, and the other countries of Turkey, and in Europe, it
                    is simply a contagious disease, being transported to them from Lower Egypt.</p>
                <p>Others, again, are of opinion, that in Egypt, as elsewhere, the plague always
                    requires a human effluvium for its production and communication; but that the
                    propagation of this contagious effluvium is greatly influenced by, if not
                    dependent upon, particular conditions of the atmosphere. This unknown condition
                    of the atmosphere is supposed either to cause the effluvia of non-pestilential
                    diseases to assume a pestilential character, or the plaguceffluvium to be
                    generated of a peculiarly virulent character, or to render the human body more
                    susceptible of its action. The influence of the atmosphere in promoting and in
                    checking plague seems sufficiently established by the circumstances already
                    stated relative to the variations in its prevalence in the different seasons of
                    the year; but in what manner or by what qualities the atmosphere exerts this
                    influence, is a matter of the greatest uncertainty.</p>
                <p>Some authors have been of opinion, that it is simply the <hi rend="italic"
                    >temperature</hi> of the atmosphere which determines the prevalence of plague in
                    the countries along the shores of the Mediterranean; that the atmosphere may be
                    either too hot or too cold for its propagation. Thus Dr A. Russell mentions,
                    that the season wherein the plague always ceases at Aleppo, is that in which the
                    heats are the most excessive. “Extreme heat,” he says, “seems to check the
                    progress of the disease; for though, during the few first hot days, the
                    mortality, as well as the number of those newly infected, increase, yet a few
                    days’ longer continuance of that weather greatly diminishes the number of the
                    sick.” Mr Dawes, in mentioning August and September as the months in which the
                    plague usually, though not constantly, ceases at Aleppo, notices them as being
                    the hottest months in the year. Conformably with the same view, the occurrence
                    of the hot winds is conceived by some to be the agent which puts a stop to the
                    prevalence of the plague in Egypt. From the statements of Timone, and of several
                    other authors, as we have already seen, it appears that, at Constantinople, the
                    cold of winter generally exercises a great influence in suppressing or
                    diminishing the extension of this disease. Dr James Frank, who was upon the
                    expedition with Sir Ralph Abercromby in the year 1800, and had the first
                    establishment of the Plague Hospital at Aboukir, says, in his evidence before
                    the committee of the House of Commons in 1819, “the great cold of Constantinople
                    puts an end to it, and the great heat of Cairo puts an end to it.” And to the
                    same effect Mr Edward Hayes, a native of Smyrna, and who had resided there
                    nearly forty-four years, on being asked by the committee, “When does the plague
                    generally subside in your country ?” replied, “When the great cold or the great
                    heat destroys it.”</p>
                <p>Μ. Pugnet, again, affirms that the prevalence of the plague in Egypt is always
                    proportional to the <hi rend="italic">moisture</hi> of the atmosphere taken in
                    connection with its <hi rend="italic">licat</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    y</hi> whether the moisture shall depend on a greater than usual inundation of
                    the Nile, or on the fall of rain; and explains by these different sources of
                    moisture the plague making its appearance in different districts of Egypt in
                    different years. 1he circumstance of the heat bearing either a very great or a
                    very small proportion to the moisture of the atmosphere, is, .according to
                    Pugnet, unfavourable to the extension of plague; but at the same time he holds,
                    that besides moisture and heat, the germ of the disease, as ħe terms the
                    contagious principle, is requisite for its development. In noticing that most of
                    those who have travelled if i Egypt say the plague is brought there from Greece,
                    and those who have travelled in Greece pretend that that country only receives
                    it from Egypt, Μ. Pugnet remarks,— “I think that the defenders of Egypt and
                    those of Greece are equally in the right; the plague comes no less from Egypt
                    than from Greece, or from Greece than from Egypt. It has established itself a
                    durable focus in these two opposite points; and when one of them seems to become
                    extinguished, the other revives it.”</p>
                <p>Dr L. Frank, who, after sojourning with the French army in Egypt, subsequently
                    resided for a year in Tunis, and travelled for six years over the continent of
                    Greece, principally for the purpose of investigating everything connected with
                    the plague, is adverse to the idea of the production of the pestilential poison
                    being in any way connected with the overflowing of the Nile. The Nile begins to
                    decrease in September, and in December all the waters disappear from the
                    inundated surface. Consequently, he argues, if the putrefaction of stagnant
                    waters could produce the plague, this disease should manifest itself chiefly in
                    the months of October, November, and December, whilst, in fact,' it very rarely
                    occurs in these months. And as the increase of the Nile in the month of June is
                    very small, it cannot be supposed to be the occasion of the extinction of the
                    plague which occurs at that season. Besides, the plague occurs in some years
                    when the increase of the river has been small, and does not occur in other years
                    when the increase has been considerable. Frank has no doubt that the plague
                    maybe generated in Egypt; but in many instances he thinks it is imported into it
                    from other countries, just as it is liable to be carried from it to other
                    countries. He suggests, that when the plague manifests itself rapidly without
                    any other epidemic having preceded it, it has probably been imported; but that
                    when an epidemic, petechial, malignant, or nervous fever has previously
                    occurred, it is very probable that these diseases have degenerated, and produced
                    the contagious principle of the plague. Frank conceives, with Alpinus, that it
                    is in the character of the <hi rend="italic">winds</hi> that the cause of the
                    prevalence or cessation of the plague in Egypt is to be looked for; the
                    unhealthy season corresponding with the part of the year during which the winds
                    and weather are variable, and the healthy season with the period during which
                    the north wind blows steadily, that is, from June to September.</p>
                <p>Those who, in admitting the contagious character of the plague, have argued in
                    favour of the possibility of its poison being engendered independently of human
                    effluvia, and simply from the reciprocal action of the atmosphere and the earth
                    upon one another, seem to have been led to this view by their believing that the
                    plague-poison is wholly extinguished during a certain portion of the year, and
                    con <pb break="no" facs="nls:193501175" xml:id="kp-eb0717-1175-0776"/>sequently,
                    that for the reproduction of the disease there must be a reproduction, or <hi
                    rend="italic">generatio</hi><hi rend="italic">de novo,</hi> as medical men term
                    it, of the poison.</p>
                <p>When by the return of the period of the year which is unfavourable to its
                    dissemination, the plague ceases, one of two things may happen. It may remain
                    absent from the country or district for a succession of years, or it may recur
                    with the period of the year which is compatible with its propagation. Now it
                    does not appear to be necessary, in either of these cases, to admit thθ
                    supposition of a fresh generation of pestilential poison from terrestrial
                    miasmata. In the case of the shorter interval, the epidemic may have slumbered,
                    but not died; in short, there may have occurred sporadic cases of the disease,
                    in sufficient number to maintain the stock. When, again, a more considerable
                    interval elapses between the cessation of the plague and its re-appearance at a
                    particular place, a fresh importation may have taken place from regions in which
                    it has been prevailing epidemically during its absence from the country under
                    observation.</p>
                <p>Besides being maintained by sporadic cases during the non-epidemic season of the
                    year, the contagion of the plague may also be maintained in the form of <hi
                    rend="italic">fomites,</hi> that is, attached to substances that have been in
                    contact with the bodies of patients, or exposed to the air which they breathe.
                    Dr Russell mentions, that at Aleppo, in 1762, several instances occurred of the
                    revival of plague in houses which had suffered the year before, attended with
                    circumstances highly suspicious of the contagion having been preserved several
                    months for want of cleansing. It has very generally been believed, also, that by
                    fomites the contagion of plague may be carried to regions very remote from that
                    in which these substances acquired it. When the articles to which the
                    pestiferous poison has attached itself are freely exposed to ventilation, it
                    does not seem to be retained for any considerable length of time; but when, on
                    the contrary, they are excluded from open communication with the air, there is
                    good ground for suspecting that the poison may remain attached to them for a
                    long space of time. Indeed we are not acquainted with any natural limit to its
                    continuance, besides that of the free exposure of the fomites to the air.</p>
                <p>In considering the plague to be capable, at least during a certain portion of the
                    year, of being diffused by contagion, it is not necessarily inferred that all
                    persons who approach within a given distance of a person labouring under the
                    disease must become affected with it. There seem to be a variety of
                    circumstances that diminish the probability of infection, with some of which we
                    are more or less acquainted, whilst of others we are entirely ignorant.</p>
                <p>Isí, lt has been supposed that exposure during one period of the epidemic is
                    attended with less risk of infection than exposure during another. 2c?, That
                    exposure to a mild case off plague is attended with less risk of infection than
                    exposure to one of a very malignant character. 3cZ, I hat a person who is
                    exposed to plague-contagion by degrees, runs less risk of infection than one who
                    is suddenly brought within the sphere of its operation. <hi rend="italic"
                    >4th,</hi> That persons possessing equanimity of mind, of temperate habits,
                    &amp;c. run less risk than those who are in opposite circumstances.</p>
                <p>Individual peculiarities in respect of the susceptibility or non-susceptibiiity
                    of plague-contagion are very singular and unaccountable; but not more so than
                    are observed in respect of other contagious diseases. A person whose exposure to
                    the affected has been slight and of short continuance, may be seized with the
                    disease; whilst another who has undergone a very great degree of exposure
                    remains free. And a person who has remained free during close and long-continued
                    exposure, may ultimately become affected, without any change of circumstances,
                    extrinsic or intrinsic, which it is possible to detect.</p>
                <p>Dr L. Frank conceives that the proportion of persons who pass their life in Egypt
                    without experiencing an attack of plague, is greater than the proportion of
                    persons who never experience an attack of small-pox, which he reckons as
                    scarcely one in ten thousand.</p>
                <p>It has been much disputed whether having once passed through plague renders a
                    person unsusceptible of re-infection; and if it does not afford absolute
                    security against more than one attack, in what proportion of cases a second or
                    more frequent recurrence takes place. Some authors have denied the reality, if
                    not the possibility, of a second attack of plague; others have related, as very
                    singular events, single cases which had been noticed in particular epidemics;
                    whilst others again represent such occurrences as by no means rare. Dr Mackenzie
                    mentions his having been assured by the Greek Padre, who took care of the Greek
                    hospital at Smyrna for fifty years, that he had had the plague twelve different
                    times during that period; and it is very certain, adds Dr Mackenzie, that he
                    died of it in 1736. The abbé who took care of the Frank Hospital at Pera,
                    assured Dr M. that he had had the disease at Constantinople and at Smyrna four
                    different times.</p>
                <p>In various respects it is extremely desirable to know what length of time may
                    elapse between a person’s exposure to plague-poison, and the appearance of the
                    disease. On the decision of this question, it is obvious, the duration of
                    personal quarantine should be founded. Dr P. Russell mentions, that at Aleppo,
                    he met with no instance of the disease appearing later than the ninth or tenth
                    day after the day of shutting up, in those who adopted that precaution. Sir J.
                    M‘Grigor, in noticing that in different people, and under different
                    circumstances, there is the greatest variety in respect of the time the matter
                    of the pestilential contagion takes before it comes into action, mentions one
                    case in which ten days seemed to be the shortest period that could possibly have
                    intervened; and another in which a person continued well till the seventeenth
                    day after being placed in quarantine.</p>
                <p>II. The few remarks which we have room to offer rela-tivç to the plague, as
                    occurring occasionally in other regions than those bordering on the Levant and
                    Archipelago, must bear reference chiefly to the question, whether, admitting the
                    plague to be a contagious disease in the countries we have hitherto alluded to,
                    there is any reason to apprehend the possibility of its being introduced into
                    the British isles; or whether the quarantine laws, as regards the plague, might
                    be safely abolished. To justify such a measure, it would, it appears to us, be
                    necessary to establish the correctness of one or other of the following
                    propositions:— Is?, That it is impossible, in the nature of things, that the
                    plague should exist in the British isles; and that, in point of fact, it never
                    existed in them: 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, That if it ever existed in these
                    islands, it was indigenous, not imported, and consequently could not have been
                    prevented by quarantine laws: or, 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, That if it ever was
                    imported into these islands, it was under circumstances which cannot recur.</p>
                <p>1 <hi rend="italic">st,</hi> Our opinion, as to whether a particular disease can
                    occur in any country, may rest upon two grounds; the first, our belief as to the
                    conditions on which its prevalence in the countries it is known to infest may
                    depend; and the second, our knowledge as to whether it has ever prevailed in the
                    country in former times. These two con siderations may reflect mutual light on
                    each other. If we are very certain as to the conditions requisite for the
                    existence of the particular disease, and are told that it has occurred in a
                    country which we know not to fulfil these, we will disbelieve the correctness of
                    the statement. And, conversely, if we are perfectly satisfied that the disease
                    has prevailed in a country which does not fulfil the conditions we are disposed
                    to consider requisite for its exist <pb break="no" facs="nls:193501188"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-1188-0777"/>ence, our opinion as to these conditions must be
                    modified. In respect of the plague, it is plain, from the discrepancies which we
                    have seen to prevail in the explanations given of the causes by which it is
                    produced and propagated in Egypt, &amp;c. that the reality of its existence is
                    exposed to much less dubicty than the explanation of the conditions on which
                    that existence depends.</p>
                <p>The fact already mentioned, of the very wide signification that used to be
                    attached to the term plague or pest, renders it necessary, indeed, that in
                    judging whether a particular epidemic was really plague or not, we should not
                    trust to the mere name which it received, but inquire into the symptoms which it
                    actually exhibited. But, with symptoms so very characteristic as those that
                    attend true plague, or rather, as we have already said, a large proportion of
                    the cases that occur in the course of a plague-epidemic, a very slight
                    description of a <hi rend="italic">pestilence</hi> must suffice for determining
                    as to its identity with genuine plague. Accordingly, we have experienced
                    considerable surprise, in looking over the evidence taken by the committee of
                    the House of Commons in 1819, at the number of witnesses who either positively
                    denied that the so-called plague in London of 1665 (to omit previous epidemics
                    to which that title was applied) was really that disease, or expressed much
                    doubt on the subject. If the general statement of Sydenham to that effect left
                    any room for doubt on this head, the minute description of Dr Hodges, and
                    particularly the portion of it that relates to the more peculiar symptoms,
                    including buboes, carbuncles, &amp;c. is more than sufficient, we should have
                    thought, to remove all doubt from the minds of the most sceptical.</p>
                <p>2&lt;∕, As to the plague of 1665 having been indigenous, and not imported, we
                    have a very explicit statement of Dr Hodges as to its having been brought from
                    Turkey to Holland, and from Holland to England. Attempts have indeed been made
                    to point out discrepancies in his explanation of its first appearance and
                    propagation in England; but to us the objections appear inconclusive, and the
                    deficiencies in the chain of proofs such as might occur in tracing the diffusion
                    of a disease universally recognised as contagious. The non-recurrence of the
                    plague in this country since that period is certainly not more easy to explain,
                    on the supposition of the epidemic in question having been indigenous, than on
                    that of its having been imported.</p>
                <p>3c?, The circumstances favourable to the reception and dissemination of
                    plague-contagion, which may be supposed to have existed in 1665, but to be now
                    extinct and incapable of recurring, may be of different kinds. The beneficial
                    change may be in the character of the climate, in the condition of the soil, or
                    in the habits of the people. But if our immunity has depended on a change in the
                    climate, who can be responsible for the continuance of this change? What the
                    climate has been, it may, for any thing we know, become again. And as to any
                    immunity that could be supposed to result from a change in the habits of
                    society, and particularly from the superior attention paid to cleanliness and
                    ventilation in our cities, from the introduction of public sewers, &amp;c. to
                    which much importance has been attached, we must confess our apprehensions, that
                    any seeds of disease which depend for their development upon filth, will not
                    perish for want of a hot-bed in many districts of the larger cities of the three
                    kingdoms.</p>
                <p>A recent occurrence in Egypt forcibly inculcates the necessity of great caution
                    in admitting, that in a country in which plague is known to have occurred, any
                    changes have been effected, either in the soil or in the people, incompatible
                    with its recurrence. Mr Edward W. Lane, in his Account of the Manners and
                    Customs of the Modern Egyptians, written in Egypt during the years 1833, 1834,
                    and 1835, says, “The climate of Upper Egypt is more healthy, though hotter, than
                    that of Lower Egypt. The plague seldom ascends far above Cairo, the metropolis.
                    It is most common in the marshy parts of the country near the Mediterranean.
                    During the last ten years, the country having been better drained, and
                    quarantine regulations adopted to prevent or guard against the introduction of
                    this disease from other countries, very few plague cases have occurred,
                    excepting in the parts above mentioned; and in those parts the pestilence has
                    not been severe.” But in a note Mr Lane adds, “This remark was written before
                    the terrible plague of the present year (1835), which was certainly introduced
                    from Turkey, and extended throughout the whole of Egypt, though its ravages were
                    not great in the southern parts. It has destroyed not less than eighty thousand
                    persons in Cairo, that is, one third of the population; and far more, I believe,
                    than two hundred thousand in all Egypt.”</p>
                <p>If, from any of the circumstances alluded to, the British isles can be supposed
                    to be free from the risk of the importation of plague-contagion, or of its
                    diffusion in the event of importation, it is to be presumed that it does not
                    enjoy this as an exclusive privilege, but must share it with other countries
                    that are similarly circumstanced. It becomes necessary, therefore, to inquire in
                    what countries, besides those immediately bordering on the Levant and
                    Archipelago, we have occasion to believe that the plague has existed, or is
                    capable of existing.</p>
                <p>In the first place, of its liability to occur in the islands, and along the
                    coasts of the more western portions of the Mediterranean, we presume no doubt
                    can be entertained. In two of the Greek islands now under British dominion, viz.
                    Corfu and Cephalonia, the plague occurred in 1816, in a form which left no room
                    for doubt as to its real nature. In Italy, Malta, and the adjoining small island
                    of Gozo, we have equally unquestionable examples of the occurrence of plague in
                    recent times; witness that which occurred at Noja in the kingdom of Naples in
                    1816, and of which accounts have been published by Morea, Onofrio, and
                    Schonberg; and that which occurred in Malta and Gozo in 1813, of which accounts
                    have been given by Calvert, Faulkner, and Tully. Previously to 1813, Malta
                    appears not to have been infected with the plague for upwards of a hundred and
                    thirty years, that is, since 1675; a circumstance not undeserving the
                    consideration of those who are disposed to consider non-occurrence as implying
                    impossibility of occurrence.</p>
                <p>In Sicily, we are not aware of the plague having appeared in an epidemical form
                    since the year 1743, when it raged at Messina.</p>
                <p>Along the African coast we have accounts of the occurrence of the plague at Tunis
                    in 1818, 1819, and 1820, by Passeri; and of its occurrence so far to the west as
                    Tangier in 1818 and 1819, an account has been published by Graberg di Hemso.</p>
                <p>Of the plague-epidemics that have occurred on the northern shores of the western
                    portion of the Mediterranean, that of which we possess the most circumstantial
                    account is the epidemic of Marseilles in 1720. The descriptions of that epidemic
                    given in the works of Chicoy-neau, and of Bertrand and Michel, .leave, we
                    conceive, not the smallest room for doubt as to the disease having been genuine
                    or Levant plague.</p>
                <p>Of the extension of the plague from Turkey into more northern latitudes, numerous
                    examples might he adduced. Between the years 1702 and 1711, it advanced by a
                    gradual but steady course through the different provinces of Poland and Prussia
                    to Dantzig, and from thcnce extended itself to Copenhagen. (See the accounts of
                    this epidemic by Gottwald, Chamberlayne.) Again, in the year 1769 and 1770, when
                    the Russians and Turks were engaged in warfare, the plague passed from the
                    Turkish confines through some of the Polish provinces, and thence into the
                    Russian <pb break="no" facs="nls:193501201" xml:id="kp-eb0717-1201-0778"
                    />territories, and ultimately reached the city of Moscow. (De Mertens, Orraeus,
                    -Samoilowitz.)</p>
                <p>It has been generally considered as a well-established fact in regard to the
                    plague, that it had not been seen beyond a certain degree of eastern longitude,
                    Mecca being the limit that has usually been assigned to its extension in that
                    direction. This fact has been supposed to confirm and to be explained by the
                    notion of its contagious poison being rendered innocuous by a certain degree of
                    atmospheric temperature. From recent communications from India, however, there
                    seems too much reason to apprehend that the plague has at length made its
                    appearance on the confines of the north-western district of Hindustan. The only
                    accounts of the epidemic which has excited these apprehensions that we have yet
                    had an opportunity of perusing, are contained in the first three numbers of the
                    Quarterly Journal of the Calcutta Medical and Physical Society, published
                    between the 1st January and the 21st July 1837. We are unable to lay extracts
                    before our readers, but we may refer to the communications of Mr Maclean, Dr
                    Irvine, and Dr Keir, therein contained, as leaving little room to doubt that the
                    epidemic in question was true plague, though not in its most aggravated form.
