                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">PEGU</label>, formerly an independent kingdom of Asia, now
                    incorporated with the Birman empire, by whose sovereign it was subdued, after
                    long wars. The limits of this state were never very accurately defined, and it
                    probably varied with the fate of war. It included a large tract of country,
                    about 350 miles in length from north to south, and as much in breadth from east
                    to west, situated on and comprising a large portion of the delta of the
                    Irrawaddy. Arracan and Ava were its northern boundaries, Siam its limit on the
                    east, on the south Siam and the sea, and on the west the Bay of Bengal and part
                    of Arracan.</p>
                <p>This country, being intersected by the Irrawaddy and its branches, is fertile and
                    well watered; but, owing to the desolations of war, it is wild and uncultivated,
                    overrun in many places with jungle or rank luxuriant grass, affording cover for
                    wild animals, such as tigers, elephants, buffaloes, deer, and other animals.
                    Both banks of the river are covered everywhere with a narrow belt of tall reedy
                    grass. The country from Rangoon throughout is a low champaign. As far as the
                    tide reaches it is covered with a narrow belt of tall reedy grass, and behind
                    with a thick and continuous forest of moderate-sized trees, amongst which the
                    most frequent and remarkable are the <hi rend="italic">sonnera-tia
                    appetalu,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">heritiera</hi><hi rend="italic">fomes.</hi>
                    Here and there are a few grassy plains. The character of the vegetation changes
                    where the influence of the tide ceases. The country is then covered with a tall
                    rushy grass, a species of saccha-rim, amongst which are scattered trees of from
                    twenty to sixty feet in height. There is very little appearance of inhabitants
                    along the shores of the river, which ought to be the most populous portion of
                    the country. Here and there, on the immediate banks, are a few fishing villages,
                    and in the interior other agricultural villages, with a few patches of rice
                    culture about them. The only culture of any extent is that of the banana, of
                    which extensive groves line the sides of the river. In some parts advantage is
                    taken of the vicinity of the river for the purposes of irrigation; but in
                    general the country is nearly in a desolatè state. Symes, who was sent as
                    ambassador to Ava, gives a similar description of the country. “The country
                    round,” he observes, “as far as our view could reach, displayed a level plain,
                    with clumps of trees at distant intervals; a thick reedy grass had grown in some
                    places very high; in others, where it had been burnt, there appeared good
                    pasturage for cattle; we saw the embanked divisions of a few rice plantations,
                    and discovered the vestiges of former culture and population; but during a walk
                    of two hours the eye was not gratified with the sight of house or inhabitant.
                    Desolated by the contentions of the Birmans and Peguans, the country had not yet
                    recovered from the ravages of war. In our walk we observed many tracks of wild
                    elephants, the spots where hogs had rooted and deer lain, and found the remains
                    of two antelopes that had recently been killed, and were half devoured by
                    tigers. The walks on each side of the river are low, and the land seems adapted
                    to produce excellent crops; but it is now quite deserted, and become the
                    undisputed domains of the wild beasts of the forest.” The chief produce of the
                    country is rice; but where those who sow are not sure that they shall reap <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193493323" xml:id="kp-eb0717-3323-0172"/>the fruits, they
                    seldom cultivate more than suffices for their immediate subsistence; and to such
                    grievous oppression have the people often been subjected, that they have been
                    forced to abandon their villages and fly into the woods, where they have
                    cultivated small patches of ground, and lived principally upon fish, fowl,
                    venison, and reptiles. The country around Pegu, the capital, was completely laid
                    waste by the victorious troops of Alompra, when he conquered that city in 1757;
                    and to such oppressions were the Peguans subjected, that the country, though
                    fruitful in the extreme, and one of the fairest and most healthful on the globe,
                    has never recovered its former prosperity. The subjugation of the people by the
                    Birmans ushered in a long era of tyranny and persecution, under which, though
                    mitigated, they still suffer. Severe penal laws were imposed on the Taliens or
                    native Peguans. But these have been abrogated by the present sovereign; justice
                    has also been more impartially administered; and it is mentioned by Symes, that
                    the only distinction between the subjected Peguans and the Burmese is the
                    exclusion of the former from all places of public trust and power. The people
                    have also been more reconciled to the Birman yoke by other proceedings of the
                    present monarch, especially by the order which he issued for rebuilding Pegu the
                    capital, encouraging settlers by grants of ground, and inviting the scattered
                    families of former inhabitants to return and repeople their deserted city. The
                    preservation and embellishment of the ancient national temple of Shoomandoo,
                    which has been ordered by the government, is also a popular act. These measures
                    do not appear, however, to have conciliated the Peguans, as Mr Crawford, who
                    visited the country, mentions that in 1827 they had risen in rebellion against
                    the authority of the Burmese; and he was himself a witness to an action between
                    the two contending parties.</p>
                <p>Pegu possesses mines of iron, tin, and lead; also of precious metals, namely,
                    rubies, sapphires, and rock crystal. Its most valuable produce, however, is the
                    teak timber, used for ship-building, which is impervious to worms or the bad
                    effects of salt water. The trees, some of which are sixty feet in length by nine
                    in girth, are floated down the Irrawaddy and its tributaries during the rainy
                    seasons. This river is the largest in the country, and, about a hundred miles
                    from the sea, divides into numerous branches, the principal being those of
                    Persaim and Rangoon, which overflow an extensive tract during the rainy season.
                    The Sitang, another large river, flows into the Gulf of Martaban. The principal
                    ports are Siriam, Negrais, and Rangoon.</p>
                <p>The history of the eastern nations is for the most part involved in darkness,
                    until the period when the Europeans, in the progress of navigation, found out a
                    maritime route to India; and we learn from the testimony of the Portuguese
                    historians, that about this time four powerful states divided amongst them the
                    regions which lie between the south-east province of British India, Yunan in
                    China, and the Eastern Sea. These states were distinguished amongst the
                    Europeans by the names of Arracan, Ava, Pegu, and Siam; and, from all that is
                    known respecting them, it appears that they carried on constant wars with each
                    other, and with various success. It is mentioned on the authority of Mendez
                    Pinto, that the Birmans, though formerly subject to the king of Pegu, became
                    afterwards masters of Àva, and caused a revolution in Pegu about the middle of
                    the sixteenth century. Their “supremacy continued throughout the seventeenth and
                    also during the first forty years of the last century, when the Peguans in the
                    provinces of Dalla, Martaban, Tongo, and Prome revolted, and a civil war ensued,
                    which was carried on by both parties with the most revolting ferocity. In the
                    year 1744 the British factory at Siriam was destroyed by the “rage of the
                    contending parties. After a tedious and pro tracted war, which was long
                    doubtful, the Peguans, aided with arms by European traders, and joined by
                    renegade Dutch and Portuguese adventurers, gained important advantages over the
                    Birmans, in the years 1750 and 1751. They finally invested Ava, the capital,
                    which the Birmans, disheartened by defeat, surrendered at discretion, and
                    Dweepdee, the last of a long line of kings, was made prisoner with all his
                    family, excepting two sons, who fled to the Siamese, from whom they met with a
                    friendly reception, and with assurances of succour. Apporaza, the brother of the
                    king of Pegu, was left in Ava, the capital, to complete the reduction of the
                    Burmese. But a deliverer unexpectedly arose to the Birmans, in the person of the
                    celebrated Alompra, who was of low extraction, but endowed with a spirit of
                    boldness and enterprise which qualified him for great achievements. He had
                    collected around him a hundred devoted followers, on whom he could rely; and,
                    availing himself of the favourable opportunity when the Birmans were exasperated
                    by oppression, and when the garrison of Ava had been greatly diminished, he
                    attacked the Peguans with irre⅛istible fury, and put every man to the sword. He
                    then retreated to the fort of Monchaboo, where he repelled the feeble assaults
                    of the Peguans, and became the assailant in his turn, attacking and defeating
                    their scattered forces, and finally advancing, by a bold and well-concerted
                    movement, to Ava, of which he took possession. A large armament was now fitted
                    out by the king of Pegu, the command of which was given to Apporaza, who,
                    ascending the stream of the Irrawaddy, appeared before Ava, which he summoned to
                    surrender, but which Shemhuan, the lieutenant of Alompra, declared that he would
                    defend to the last extremity. Alompra had in the mean time collected a
                    formidable fleet, which Apporaza proceeded to attack. The action, which was
                    obstinate and bloody, terminated in the entire discomfiture of the Peguan
                    general, who retired with the wreck of his army to his own country. This action
                    took place in 1754. An alarm was at this time spread in Pegu, that the Birmans
                    in that city were engaged in a conspiracy against the government, upon which the
                    terrified inhabitants flew to arms, and having murdered the deposed monarch, who
                    was detained in prison, they proceeded to put to death every Birman who was
                    found within the city. This act of cruelty was the signal for a general revolt
                    of the Birmans throughout the empire, who retaliated the barbarity of their
                    oppressors, and quickly made themselves masters of Prome, Denobew, Loonzay, and
                    other places. The monarch of Pegu, Beinga Della, alarmed by this disastrous
                    intelligence, levied a new army, with which he marched from Pegu, and commenced
                    the siege of Prome. The city made a resolute defence; and the besiegers,
                    repelled in several attacks, were forced to convert the siege into a blockade.
                    Alompra detached part of his fleet and army to the aid of the besieged, and
                    forty days afterwards followed with his choicest troops. He immediately
                    commenced an attack on the works of the besiegers, who, defeated in a long,
                    close, and bloody action, were at length compelled to seek safety in a
                    precipitate flight. Alompra did not fail to improve his victory. He commenced an
                    active pursuit, and his troops advanced within a few leagues of Bassein
                    unmolested by the enemy. The intelligence of this disaster spread consternation
                    throughout the dominions of Pegu; the king retired from Bassein to his capital;
                    his adherents, abandoned and terrified, consulted each his own safety, and the
                    town and fort of Persaim were completely deserted. Each party was at this time
                    anxious to procure the aid of the French or English, who had factories at
                    Syriam, and who alternately espoused the one or the other side, accordingas it
                    seemed to suit their interests. Many skirmishes ensued, and the war was for some
                    time carried on without any decisive success on either side. The Birmans,
                    however, supported<pb break="no" facs="nls:193493336"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-3336-0173"/> by the vigour and capacity of Alompra, were
                    making slow but sure advances, and in April 1755 that chief gained a decided
                    victory over Apporaza, in his camp at Synan-gong. The Pegιιans, disheartened,
                    fled to Syriam, and many did not halt till they reached Pegu itself. The Birmans
                    soon afterwards took possession of Rangoon; and an attempt to recover the place
                    by the Peguans was repulsed with loss. It was again attacked by the Peguans,
                    aided by three English ships, and the Birmans were driven from their boats. They
                    still, however, maintained their position on shore till their enemies retreated.
                    In July 1756, Syriam was <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> taken by assault, and
                    its fall may be said to have decided the contest. As soon as the rainy season
                    subsided, and the low and swampy country which lies between Pegu and Syriam had
                    emerged from the inundations of the monsoon, Alompra ordered his general to
                    advance towards Pegu with a strong body of troops. The whole army followed a few
                    days afterwards, and in four days reached the city, marching through a wasted
                    country. The city of Pegu was occupied by the royal family, and the principal
                    nobles of the nation. Alompra, according to the usual tactics of the Birmans,
                    had recourse for the reduction of the city to blockade, rather than to the
                    doubtful attempt of an assault. The Peguans, reduced to the utmost straits,
                    .were forced at last to surrender the city, which was given up to indiscriminate
                    plunder; a decisive blow was thus given to the independence of Pegu; and
                    Alompra, improving his victory, proceeded to bring into subjection the countries
                    to the eastward, including the fertile districts between Pegu and the three
                    pagodas, which were the ancient boundaries of Pegu and Siam. From this period
                    the kingdom of Pegu has been incorporated with the Burmese dominions; and the
                    Peguans, though occasionally rebelling, have never been able to shake off their
                    oppressive yoke.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Pegu,</hi> the capital of the former kingdom of Pegu,
                    situated on the Sitang, formerly a large and populous city, the extent of which
                    may be still traced in the ruins of the walls. These were compose,d of brick
                    badly cemented with clay, about thirty-five feet thick, with small equidistant
                    bastions about 300 yards asunder. The ditch was about sixty yards in breadth,
                    and ten or twelve feet in depth. The ancient city was razed to the ground by the
                    conqueror Alompra, when he took it in 1757, with the exception of the temples,
                    which are numerous; and of these, the great temple of Shoomandoo has alone been
                    renewed and kept in repair. Europeans who visited this city in the year 1600,
                    describe it as a place of great splendour, the streets spacious, and running in
                    a straight line from gate to gate. The king’s palace, with walls and ditches,
                    stood in the middle of the town, built like a fortress; but the interior
                    apartments were all composed of wood with gilt roofs, and the population
                    amounted to 150,000.</p>
                <p>As stated in the former article, orders were issued by the Birman monarch to
                    rebuild the ruined city; and the governor of the province was induced to quit
                    Rangoon and to make Pegu his future residence. These measures so far succeeded
                    that a new town was built on the site of the ancient city; and the inhabitants,
                    consisting chiefly of the priests, the followers of the court, and a few poor
                    families, now amount to 7000. The great proportion of the former inhabitants are
                    either extinct, or have been dispersed over the whole extent of the empire. The
                    new city of Pegu is built on the plan of the former city, and occupies about one
                    half of its area; it is fenced round by a stockade from ten to twelve feet high.
                    The plan of the new town is that of one main street running east and west,
                    crossed at right angles by two smaller streets not yet finished. At each
                    extremity of the principal street there is a gate in the stockade, which is
                    defended by a wretched piece of ordnance and a few musqueteers. There are two
                    inferior gates on the north and south sides of the stockade. The streets are
                    spacious, like those of most Birman towns; and the town is paved with brick,
                    large supplies of which are found in the old ruins. All the houses, even those
                    of the meanest classes, are raised from the ground, either on wooden posts or
                    bamboos, according to the size of the building. The monasteries of the priests,
                    and the habitations of the higher classes, are raised to the height of six or
                    eight feet. The houses are all made of mats or sheathing boards, the use of
                    brick or stone in private buildings being prohibited by a royal edict. The
                    dwellings being composed of such combustible materials, the inhabitants are in
                    continual dread of fire; and almost every house has earthen pots filled with
                    water on the roof; and a class of firemen perambulate the streets day and night.
                    The roofs are lightly covered; and, as an additional precaution against fire, at
                    each door stands a long bamboo, with an iron hook at the end, to pull down the
                    thatch. There is also another pole with a grating of iron, to suppress flame by
                    pressure. The house of the maywoon or viceroy is a spacious building,
                    possessing, however, few ornaments; gilding is forbidden to all subjects in the
                    Birman empire; few have even the liberty to paint the pillars of their house, or
                    to use lacker; and the naked wood gives an unfinished appearance to their
                    houses, however roomy or well adapted to their purposes. The greatobjeetthat
                    attracts attention in Pegu is the noble edifice of Shoomandoo or the Golden
                    Supreme. This extraordinary pile of building is erected on double terraces, one
                    raised upon another; the lower and greater terrace, about ten feet above the
                    natural level of the ground, forming an exact parallelogram; the upper and
                    lesser terrace is similar in shape, and rises about twenty feet above the lower
                    terrace, or thirty feet above the level of the ground. These terraces are
                    ascended by flights of stone steps. The temple is pyramidal, composed of brick
                    and mortar, without excavation or aperture of any sort; it is octagonal at the
                    base and spiral at the top, and each side measures at the base 162 feet. This
                    breadth diminishes abruptly, so that its form has been compared to that of a
                    speaking trumpet. The extreme height of the edifice from the level of the
                    country is 361 feet; and on the top is an iron tee or gilded umbrella, seen on
                    every building in the Birman dominions, fifty-six feet in circumference. All
                    around the steps or ascent are placed innumerable marble images of Gaudama their
                    saint. The Rahaans or attendant priests assert that the foundation of this
                    temple was laid two thousand years ago, and that it was brought to its present
                    state of magnificence by successive monarchs. On the south-east angle of the
                    upper terrace are two handsome saloons, supported on pillars sixty feet in
                    length by thirty in breadth; at each angle of the interior and higher terrace is
                    a temple sixty-seven feet in height, resembling in miniature the great temple;
                    and in front are four gigantic representations in masonry of Palloo the evil
                    genius, half beast, half man, seated on his hams, with a large club on the right
                    shoulder. Long. 96. 12. E. Lat. 17. 10. N.</p>
