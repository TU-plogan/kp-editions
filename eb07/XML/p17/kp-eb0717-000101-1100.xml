                    or of a less size, than the original. It consists of four moveable rulers fixed
                    together by four pivots, and forming a parallelogram. At the extremity of one of
                    these rulers prolonged is a point, which is drawn over the lines of the original
                    drawing, whilst a pencil, fixed at the end of another branch of the instrument,
                    traces on paper the lines of the copy. The pencil is placed in a hollow
                    cylinder, and a weight is added on the top of the pencil; by this means the
                    point of the pencil is made to press on the paper with the force requisite for
                    drawing the lines. The improvements in the construction of different parts of
                    the pantograph described in the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Acad. des Sciences,</hi> 1743, have been
                    generally adopted. The pantograph, however, is not found convenient in practice;
                    and, for the purpose of copying maps, plans, and other designs, artists most
                    commonly employ the method of dividing the original design into a number of
                    squares, and the paper on which the copy is to be made into the same number of
                    squares. When this is done, they copy the lines contained within each square of
                    the original, so as to form a similar figure within the corresponding square of
                    the reticula which covers the copy. When the drawing consists of straight lines,
                    a reduced copy is accurately made by means of an isosceles triangle, in which
                    the base is to the side as any line of the copy is to the corresponding line in
                    the original. By setting off with the compasses any line of the original drawing
                    on the sides of the triangle, the base which completes the triangle is the
                    length of the corresponding line to be laid down on the copy. The same operation
                    is performed by the sector.</p>
                <p>If a drawing is to be copied, of the same size as the original, without
                    diminution or enlargement, engravers usually trace the copy upon oiled paper
                    laid over the original, or upon the transparent <hi rend="italic">papier</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de guimauve</hi> (marsh-mallow paper), made in France.</p>
                <p>A pantograph has been made, consisting of a rod, placed vertically, and turning
                    round a fixed point in its length, situated between its upper and lower
                    extremity; the up per end of the rod being a point which is conducted by the
                    hand over the lines of the original drawing, and the lower end being the pencil
                    which traces the copy on paper. An instrument upon this principle is sometimes
                    used for drawing the profile of the face, in order to form small portraits or
                    silhouettes.</p>
                <p>The instrument called micrograph and prosopograph in Puissant’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geodesic</hi> does not differ in principle from the common pantograph. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(b. b.)</hi></p>
                <p>A very ingenious instrument for copying drawings, either upon a reduced or an
                    enlarged scale, was invented by Mr Wallace, professor of mathematics in the
                    University of Edinburgh. Of this instrument, which may be fitly introduced under
                    the present head, though differing in <hi rend="italic">name,</hi> we have been
                    favoured with the following description.</p>
                <p>It is a fact well known, that artists of various descriptions, who have frequent
                    occasion to imitate original designs, have long felt the want of a convenient
                    mathematical instrument, by which a copy may be made with neatness and
                    expedition, that shall have any given proportion to the original. The <hi
                    rend="italic">pantograph</hi> is the only instrument that has hitherto been
                    employed; but although correct and plausible in theory, in practice it is found
                    to be so very imperfect that the artist hardly ever thinks of making use of
                    it.</p>
                <p>A consideration of the essential service that would be rendered to the graphic
                    art, by a copying instrument, which should be at once simple in its theory and
                    easy in its application, induced Mr Wallace to turn his attention to the
                    subject; and, in the summer of 1821, he produced the model of a copying
                    instrument, which he has denominated an Eidograph (from <hi rend="italic"
                    >είδος</hi> and <hi rend="italic">γgαfω).</hi> The instrument, and its
                    application to the copying of a great variety of subjects, has been shown to
                    engineers, engravers, and other competent judges, in London and in Edinburgh;
                    and their opinion of its utility has been such as to leave no doubt whatever of
                    its completely fulfilling the views of the inventor.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193491113" xml:id="kp-eb0717-1113-0002"/>
                <p>The instrument is represented in the annexed figure.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The beam,</hi> AB, which is made of mahogany, slides backwards
                    and forwards in a <hi rend="italic">socket,</hi> C; and the socket turns on a
                    vertical axis, supported by the∕h∕- <hi rend="italic">crum,</hi> D, which stands
                    on a table. There is a slit in the beam, through which the axis of the socket
                    passes, so that, when the beam slides in the socket, a portion of it passes on
                    each side of the axis. There are two equal wheels, E, E, below the beam, which
                    turn on axes that pass through pipes fixed at A, B, near its extremities; and a
                    steel chain passes over the wheels as a band, by which a motion of rotation
                    maybe communicated from the one to the other. There are two <hi rend="italic"
                    >arms,</hi> F, F, which slide in sockets along the lower face of the wheels,
                    just under their centres; at the extremity, G, of one arm, there is a metal <hi
                    rend="italic">tracer,</hi> with a handle attached to it, by which its point may
                    be carried over the lines in any design; and at H, the extremity of the other
                    arm, there is a black-lead <hi rend="italic">pencil</hi> fixed in a metal tube,
                    which is ground to fit exactly into a pipe, so as just to slide up or down. In
                    using the instrument, the pencil, in its tube, is raised by a thread which
                    passes over a pulley, and it descends again by a weight with which it is
                    loaded.</p>
                <p>From the perfect equality of the wheels, it is easy to see that, if the arms
                    attached to them be placed parallel in any one position, they will retain their
                    parallelism, although one of the wheels, and consequently both, be turned on
                    their centres. Supposing, now, that BC and AC, the parts into which the axis is
                    divided at the centre, have any proportion whatever to each other, if the
                    distances of the tracing point G, and pencil point H, from the centres of their
                    wheels, have the very same proportion, then it follows, from the elements of
                    geometry, that the tracing point G, the centre C, and the pencil point H, will
                    be in a straight line; and further, that CG and CH, the distance of these points
                    from the centre, will have to each other the constant proportion <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> CB to CA, or of EG to AH. Such being the geometrical
                    property of the <hi rend="italic">eidograph,</hi> if any subject to be copied be
                    fixed to the table on which the instrument stands, and the tracing point be
                    carried over every line of the design, the pencil point will trace a copy in all
                    respects similar to the original. To facilitate the adjustment of the
                    instrument, so that the copy may have any given ratio to the original, there are
                    scales of equal parts on the beam and the two arms; by these and verniers, both
                    halves of the beam, and equal lengths on the arms, are each divided into 1000
                    equal parts, and at certain intervals corresponding numbers are marked on them.
                    By means of the scales, when any ratio is assigned, the adjustment is made
                    without the least difficulty. To avoid any derangement by the chain slipping on
                    the wheels, there are <hi rend="italic">clamps</hi> at K and K, which hold it
                    fast to the wheels at points where it never quits them. They are slackened when
                    the instrument is adjusted.</p>
