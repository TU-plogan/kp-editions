                <p><label type="entry">PAUSANIAS</label>, a Spartan king and general, who signalized
                    lιimself at the battle of Plataea against the Persians. The Greeks, sensible of
                    his services, rewarded his merit with a tenth of the spoils taken from the
                    Persians. He was afterwards appointed to command the Spartan armies, and he
                    extended his conquests in Asia; but the haughtiness of his behaviour created him
                    many enemies; and the Athenians soon obtained a superiority in the affairs of
                    Greece. Pausanias, dissatisfied with his countrymen, offered to betray Greece to
                    the Persians, if he received in marriage, as the reward of his perfidy, the
                    daughter of their king. His intrigues being discovered þy the Ephori of Sparta,
                    he fled for safety to a temple of Minerva; and as the sanctity of the place
                    screened him from the violence of his pursuers, the sacred building was
                    surrounded with heaps of stones, the first of which was carried there by the
                    indignant mother of the unhappy man. He was starved to death in the temple, and
                    died about 474 years before the Christian era.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Pausanias,</hi> a very celebrated antiquary, who is believed
                    by Fabricius to be the same mentioned by Philostratus, in his Lives of the
                    Sophists (ii. 13), as a native of Caesareia ad Argaeum, in Cappadocia, was the
                    disciple of Herodes Atticus, and spent the greater part of his life at Rome,
                    where he died at an advanced age. Siebelis, however, in the preface to his
                    valuable edition of the works of Pausanias, remarks that this supposition
                    respecting the place of his birth does not agree with what may be inferred from
                    his own statements. In one passage (v. 13, 4) he seems to speak of Lydia as his
                    native province; and though he frequently alludes to Herodes Atticus, he never
                    speaks of him as his master, which he would scarcely have failed to do if he had
                    owed any part of his education to him. Besides, Philostratus and Suidas are both
                    silent in respect to the work upon Grecian Antiquities which has come down to
                    us; and such an omission is a strong proof that they were not the same
                    individual. The exact period of his birth and death is unknown, but he was
                    employed on a part of his work in the reign of Hadrian, who died <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 139, and was writing the Antiquities of Elis A. D.
                    174, in the fourteenth year of the reign of Μ. Aurelius (v. 1, 1). He must thus
                    have been contemporary with Aulus Gellius, Ptolemy the geographer, Fronto the
                    philosopher, Apuleius, and Lucian, though his pursuits were not likely to bring
                    him in contact with any of them.</p>
                <p>The work which he has left is entitled <hi rend="smallcaps">Tíj;</hi> 'Ελλάδος
                    <hi rend="italic">∏εξιηγfiσις,</hi> The Description of Greece, and is divided
                    into ten books, containing an account of the antiquities in each of the
                    provinces of Greece, in the following order: Attica, Corinthiaca, Laconica,
                    Messeniaca, two books entitled Eliaca, Achaica, Arcadica, Boeotica, and Phocica.
                    He must have examined minutely every part of these provinces; and it is observed
                    by Sir John Hobhouse, in his Journey through Albania, “that the exact conformity
                    of present appearances with the minute descriptions of the itinerary is no less
                    surprising than satisfactory.” He evidently took every means in his power to be
                    accurate in his descriptions, as he constantly refers, as a corroboration of his
                    statements, to inscriptions on ancient monuments and works of art, and to gifts
                    dedicated in the temples of the gods. Poets and historians also furnished him
                    with materials to illustrate the antiquities of the places he visited. He is
                    accused, however, like the Latin historian Livy, of credulity, and of narrating
                    many stories which have no pretension to credibility. But, aware that such an
                    accusation might be brought against him, he states (vi. 3, 4) tlιat he thought
                    himself bound to give these traditions of the Greeks, though there was no reason
                    why he should believe them. In his style he is thought to have imitated
                    Herodotus, but it is by no means successful.</p>
                <p>The Greek text of Pausanias was first published at Venice in 1516 by Aldus, who
                    was assisted by Musurus; but this edition, which is in folio, is very incorrect,
                    having been printed from a bad manuscript. That of Francfort, 1583, in folio,
                    reprinted at Hanau in 1613, and that of Leipzig, 1696, in folio, published by
                    Kuhn, arc accompanied by the Latin translation of Amaseo, which had appeared
                    separately, Florence, 1551, in two volumes. This version, more elegant, but less
                    faithful, than that of Loescher, published without the Greek text, by Oporin,
                    forms the fourth volume of the edition published at Leipzig by Facius, 1794-
                    1797, in four volumes 8vo., the first in which an attempt was made to collate
                    the text with the manuscripts. The edition of Schoefer, Leipzig, 1818, in three
                    small volumes, contains only the Greqk. But that of Clavier, Paris, 1814- 1821,
                    in six volumes 8vo., is preferable to both these, notwithstanding the numerous
                    typographical errors by which it is deformed; and it is accompanied by a new
                    French translation. It is only necessary further to indicate the Italian
                    translation of Bonaccinoli, Mantua, 1597, in 4to; and that <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193493206?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0717-3206-0163"/> which appeared
                    at Rome 1792—1793, in five volumes 4to; the English translation of Taylor,
                    London, 1793-1794, in three volumes 8vo; and the German translation of
                    Gold-hagen, Berlin, 1798, in two volumes 8vo.</p>
