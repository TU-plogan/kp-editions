                    Latin historian of considerable celebrity in the reign of Tiberius, is supposed
                    by Dodwell to have been born before Christ 30, and to have been included in the
                    fall of Sejanus, the favourite of Tiberius, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> D. 32.
                    The place of his birth is unknown; but his great-grandfather, Minatius-Magius,
                    was a native of Asculum, and took an active part in favour of the Romans during
                    the Italic war; whilst another of his ancestors, Decius Magius, was of high rank
                    in Campania (Pat. ii. 16). His paternal uncle, Capito, was a senator, and joined
                    with Agrippa in accusing Cassius, the murderer of Caesar (ii. 69). Paterculus
                    commenced his military career under Caius Caesar, the grandson of Augustus, and
                    accompanied him to the East as tribune in the second year of the Christian era.
                    On his death he attached himself to the fortunes of Tiberius, and as commander
                    of the cavalry was present during nine years in his several expeditions in
                    Germany, Pannonia, and Dalmatia. On his return to Rome he was raised to the
                    praetorship, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> D. 14, the same year in which Augustus
                    died; but he does not appear to have reached any higher dignity.</p>
                <p>Paterculus left an abridgment of Roman history, and had promised a larger work,
                    which it does not appear that he ever executed. This epitome was still in
                    progress, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 30, in the sixteenth year of the reign
                    of Tiberius, and is entitled <hi rend="italic">Historiae Romanae ad M. Viniciurn
                    Cos.</hi><hi rend="italic">libri</hi><hi rend="italic">ii.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    after the eighth chapter. Only one manuscript has been found of this author, and
                    even that has now disappeared. It was discovered in 1515, by Beatus Rhenanus, in
                    the monastery of Marbach, in Oberelsass, and first published at Basle in 1520.
                    In this work Paterculus intended to give a sketch of the history of the world,
                    more particularly of whatever he thought likely to interest the Romans. He began
                    with the destruction of Troy, and the arrival of AEneas in Italy, and ended with
                    the year 30 of the Christian era. He dwells particularly upon those parts of
                    general history which were connected with that of Rome, and intersperses the
                    work with moral reflections, that do honour to his heart and understanding. In
                    his description of particular characters, he is more than usually happy, though
                    his style is sometimes rather too oratorical, and evinces too much anxiety to
                    strike the imagiation of the reader by startling thoughts and expressions. His
                    language is generally pure, and formed upon the best models of an earlier
                    period. Sallust seems to have been the author whose style he more particularly
                    imitated.</p>
