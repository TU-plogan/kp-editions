                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">PAPYRUS</label>, the reed from which was prepared the
                    far-famed paper of Egypt.</p>
                <p>Before entering on a description of the papyrus, it may be right to say a word or
                    two as to the opinion generally received in Europe concerning the disappearance
                    of this plant. Supposing the circumstance possible, the date of it must be fixed
                    at no distant period; for it is not more than two centuries since Guilandin and
                    Prosper Alpin observed the papyrus on the banks of the Nile. Guilandin observed
                    the inhabitants of the country eating the inferior and succulent part of the
                    stem, in the manner of the ancients; a fact which shoavs that it must have been
                    the papyrus. This, and the practices related by Prosper Alpin, are
                    sufficientto<pb break="no" facs="nls:193491724" xml:id="kp-eb0717-1724-0049"/>
                    convince us that the plant is not wholly useless, although it is not now
                    employed in the fabrication of paper. The alteration in the soil of Egypt, and
                    the methods of agriculture, have in all probability rendered the plant less
                    common; but causes altogether local could not occasion the destruction of the
                    papyrus, especially as its residence in the marshes would prevent their
                    operation. It is needless, however, to reason from probabilities or analogy. Mr
                    Bruce not only saw the papyrus growing both in Egypt and Abyssinia, but actually
                    made paper of it in the same manner as that in which it was made by the
                    ancients. He tells us, likewise, that, so far from any part of it being useless,
                    the whole plant is at this day used in Abyssinia for making boats, a piece of
                    the acacia tree being put into the bottom to serve as a keel. That such were the
                    boats of ancient Egypt, we know from the testimony of Pliny, who informs us that
                    the plants were first sewed together, and then gathered up at stem and stern,
                    and tied fast to the keel: <hi rend="italic">Conseritur bibula Memphitis cymba
                    papyro.</hi></p>
                <p>The papyrus, says Pliny, grows in the marshes of Egypt, or in the stagnant places
                    of the Nile, formed by the overflowing of that river, provided they are not
                    beyond the depth of two cubits. Its roots are tortuous, and in thickness about
                    four or five inches; and its stem is triangular, rising to the height of ten
                    cubits. Prosper Alpin states it as growing about six or seven cubits above the
                    water; the stem tapering from the bottom, and terminating in a point.
                    Theophrastus adds, that the papyrus carries a top or plume of small hairs, which
                    is the thyrsus of Pliny. Guilandin informs us, that its roots throw to the right
                    and left a great number of small fibres, which support the plantagainst the
                    violence of the wind, and against the waters of the Nile. According to him, the
                    leaves of the plant are obtuse, and resemble the <hi rend="italic">typha</hi> of
                    the marshes. Mr Bruce, on the other hand, assures us that it never could have
                    existed in the Nile. Its head, says he, is far too heavy; and in a plain country
                    the wind must have had too violent a hold of it. The stalk is small and feeble,
                    and withal too tall; the root is also too short and slender to stay it against
                    the violent pressure of the wind and current; and therefore it could never have
                    been a plant growing in the river Nile itself, or in any very deep or rapid
                    river, but only in the calishes or places where the Nile had overflowed and was
                    stagnant.</p>
                <p>The Egyptians made of this plant paper fit for writing (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Paper),</hi> which they called <hi rend="italic">βιζλoς,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">philuria,</hi> and also χαgrjji, whence the Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">charta;</hi> for in general the word <hi rend="italic">Charta</hi>
                    is used to signify the paper of Egypt.</p>
                <p>The papyrus was produced in so great quantities on the banks of the Nile, that
                    Cassiodorus compares it to a forest. There, says he, rises to the view, this
                    forest without branches, this thicket without leaves, this harvest of the
                    waters, this ornament of the marshes. Prosper Alpin is the first who gives us a
                    plate of the papyrus, which corresponds in some degree with the description of
                    the plant mentioned by Theophrastus; but by far the best drawing of it is that
                    given by Bruce.</p>
                <p>The ancient botanists placed the papyrus amongst the gramineous plants or
                    dog-grass; ignorant of the particular ki*ad to which it belonged, they were
                    contented to specify it under the name of <hi rend="italic">papyrus,</hi> of
                    which there were two kinds, namely, that of Egypt, and that of Sicily. The
                    moderns have endeavoured to show that these two plants are one and the same
                    species of cyperus; and it is under this genus that they are found in the
                    catalogues and descriptions of plants published since the edition of Morrison’s
                    work, where the papyrus is called <hi rend="italic">Cyperus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Niloticus Syriacus maximus papyraceus.</hi></p>
                <p>It is impossible to determine whether the papyrus of Sicily was used in any way
                    by the Romans. In Italy it is called <hi rend="italic">papero,</hi> and,
                    according to Cesalpin, <hi rend="italic">pipero. '</hi> This papyrus of Sicily
                    was cultivated in a garden at Pisa; and if we can depend on the authority of
                    Cesalpin, who himself examined the plant, it is different from the papyrus of
                    Egypt. The papyrus, says he, which is commotìly called <hi rend="italic"
                    >pipero</hi> in Sicily, has a longer and thicker stem than the plant cyperus. It
                    rises sometimes to the height of four cubits; the angles are obtuse, and the
                    stem at the base is surrounded with leaves growing from the root; and there are
                    no leaves on the stem even when the plant is at the greatest perfection; but it
                    carries at the top a large plume, which resembles a great tuft of dishevelled
                    hairs. This is composed of a great number of triangular pedicles, in the form of
                    reeds, at the extremity of which are placed the flowers, between two small
                    leaves of a reddish colour like the cyperus. The roots are woody, about the
                    thickness of reeds, jointed, and throw out a great number of branches, which
                    extend themselves in an oblique direction. These are scented somewhat like the
                    cyperus, but their colour is a lighter brown: from the lower part issue many
                    small fibres, and from the higher a number of stems shoot up, which, in
                    proportion as they are tender, contain a sweet juice.</p>
                <p>The plume of the papyrus of Sicily is a tuft or assemblage of a great number of
                    long slender pedicles, which grow from the same point of division, are disposed
                    in the manner of a parasol, and carry at the top three long and narrow leaves,
                    from which issue other pedicles, shorter than the former, and terminating in
                    several knots of flowers. Micheli <hi rend="italic">(Nova Plantarum Genera,</hi>
                    Florence, 1728) has given an engraving of one of the long pedicles in its
                    natural length. It is surrounded at the base with a case of about one inch and a
                    half in height; and towards the extremity it carries three long and narrow
                    leaves, and four pedicles, to which are fixed the knots of flowers. Every
                    pedicle has also a small case surrounding its base. In short, the papyrus of
                    Sicily is well known to botanists. It were to be wished that we had as
                    particular a description of the papyrus of Egypt. It may be observed, however,
                    that these two plants have a near affinity to one another; that they are
                    confounded together by many authors; and that, according to Theophrastus, the
                    <hi rend="italic">sari</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">papyrus nilotica</hi> have
                    a decided character of resemblance, differing only in this, that the papyrus
                    sends forth thick and tall stems, which being divided into slender plates, are
                    fit for the fabrication of paper, whilst the <hi rend="italic">sari</hi> has
                    small stems, considerably shorter, and altogether useless for any kind of
                    paper.</p>
                <p>The papyrus, which anciently served to make paper, must not be confounded with
                    the papyrus of Sicily, which is also found in Calabria. According to Strabo, the
                    papyrus was not to be found anywhere except in Egypt and in India. The greater
                    part of botanists have believed that the Sicilian plant is the same with the
                    sari of Theophrastus; but others have alleged that the papyrus of Egypt and the
                    sari were the same plant in two different stages of its existence, or considered
                    with respect to the greater or less height; which, according to them, might
                    depend upon the qualities of the soil, the difference of the climate, or other
                    accidental causes. In proof of this, it is maintained, that there is an
                    essential difference between the papyrus growing in the waters and the same
                    plant growing on the banks of rivers and in marshes. The first of these has
                    thick and tall stems, and a plume in the form of a tuft of hair very long and
                    slender, and without any seed. The second differs from the first in all these
                    particulars; it has a shorter and more slender stem, its plume is loaded with
                    flowers, and consequently it produces seed. In whatever way we consider these
                    facts, it is sufficient for us to know, that the difference between the papyrus
                    and the sari neither depends on climate, nor soil, nor situation. The plants
                    whose difference depended on these circumstances both grew in Egypt, and were
                    both employed in the manufacture of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193491737"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-1737-0050"/>paper. But it is an established fact, that the
                    sari cannot be employed for this purpose.</p>
                <p>Finally, the papyrus of Sicily began to be known by botanists in the years 1570,
                    1572, and 1583, at which periods the works of Lobel, of Gnilandin, and of
                    Cesalpin, first appeared. The ancients had no manner of knowledge of this plant,
                    and Pliny makes no mention of it in his Natural History; from which it is
                    evident that it was used neither in Rome nor in Sicily. If he had seen this
                    plant, he must have been struck with its resemblance to the papyrus and the
                    sari, as these were described by Theophrastus; and since he gives a particular
                    description of the latter, he would most naturally have hinted at their
                    conformity to the Sicilian papyrus, had such actually been the case.</p>
