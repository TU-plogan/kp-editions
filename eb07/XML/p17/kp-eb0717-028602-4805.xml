                <p><label type="entry">PERTH</label>, the principal town of Perthshire, and the most
                    central in Scotland, is situated on the banks of the river Tay, about
                    twenty-five miles above its confluence with the German Ocean, in latitude 56.
                    23.40. north, and longitude 3. 26. 20. west. The situation of Perth is one of
                    the finest that can be imagined. Two beautiful and extensive meadows, called the
                    North Inch and South Inch, bound it upon two sides. On the east it is washed by
                    the waters of the Tay, whilst on the west and the south-west it is surrounded by
                    a screen of hills, of moderate elevation, but richly wooded, and sloping gently
                    down towards the town and the river. Of these hills, or rather eminences, the
                    highest is that of Moncrieff, which is 756 feet above the level of the sea; but
                    the landscape that opens to the eye from its summit is one of the finest in
                    Scotland, comprehending in the northern distance a noble sweep of the Grampian
                    Mountains, and presenting to the westward a splendid view of Strathearn,
                    intersected by the numerous windings of its river; whilst to the east appear the
                    Carse of Gowrie, rich in all the beau <pb break="no" facs="nls:193494818"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-4818-0287"/>ties of fertility, and the majestic Tay rolling
                    onwards to the sea. The site of Perth is remarkably low, being only a few feet
                    above the level of the sea; but notwithstanding this circumstance, and the
                    vicinity of hills, the climate is not particularly moist, and is considered as
                    healthy. The lowness of the situation, however, exposes the town to frequent
                    inundations from the river, several of which make rather a formidable appearance
                    in its annals. The greatest of these upon record appears to have happened in the
                    reign of William the Lion, who is said to have narrowly escaped with his family
                    and court, from the sudden rising of the waters. The years 1621, 1773, and 1814
                    are also memorable in the burgh records for similar and equally extensive
                    casualties. The deepening of the Tay below the town, which has been in progress
                    for some years, will, however, ultimately lessen the dangers to be apprehended
                    from these sudden inundations, by affording a deeper and freer channel for the
                    waters of the river.</p>
                <p>Perth is one of the most ancient towns in Scotland, and its civil history, up to
                    the sixteenth century, is deeply interwoven with the national annals. Its origin
                    is buried in the obscurity of the past, and the very etymology of its name is
                    uncertain.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lord Hailes
                    informs us, in his Annals, that he had been favoured with various etymologies of
                    the name, but not knowing which to choose, he had omitted them all. We learn
                    from Fordun, however, that the town was formerly called Bertha, which is
                    probably the Celtic Bhar-tatha, signifying the height of Tay, or Kinnoull Hill,
                    immediately contiguous to the town; and this conjecture is strengthened by the
                    circumstance that the word Tatha in Celtic is pronounced as Ta or Tay in
                    English; so that Bertha is very nearly the exact sound of Bhar-tatha. But as the
                    mutes B and P are interchangeable in Celtic, the one being used indiscriminately
                    for the other, Bertha was shortened into Berth or Perth, in the ordinary course
                    of human speech. It may be added, that the names of many places in the
                    neighbourhood, as well as all over Scotland, are of Celtic origin, and that the
                    vernacular language of the people not many miles from Perth still continues io
                    be a dialect of that .original language.</p></note> For many centuries it was
                    called St Johnston, which appears indeed to have been its most ancient
                    designation. This name was, it seems, given to it from the circumstance of the
                    first church erected in it, after the conversion of the inhabitants to
                    Christianity, being dedicated to St John the Baptist; a circumstance which is in
                    some degree confirmed by the ancient seal of the burgh, on which is represented
                    the martyrdom of the saint. The city records are very ancient, but are not
                    legible farther back than the year 1512. From that period they are very
                    complete, and contain matter equally curious and interesting to the historian
                    and the antiquary. Indeed, some of our early historians are of opinion that the
                    town was founded by the Roman general Àgricoa, who erected a citadel to maintain
                    his conquests, and check the wild spirit of the savage natives. In corroboration
                    of this opinion, it may be stated, that there are no less than four great
                    military roads, leading to the city from different points, which are all
                    evidently of Roman origin. Its central situation, as well as the fertility of
                    the soil, and the beauty of the surrounding country, must naturally have
                    suggested to those discriminating invaders its occupation as a military station.
                    But not to dwell on apocryphal events and circumstances, faintly looming on the
                    verge of authentic history, the first fact of any importance which emerges from
                    its early annals is the charter granted by William the Lion, in 1210, and which
                    raised it to the dignity of a royal burgh. It has been said, however, that Perth
                    must have been a royal burgh in 1106, from the terms of a charter granted in
                    that year by Edgar, in favour of one John Mercer, who in it is designated as a
                    burgess of the city. In the charter of confirmation by James VI. allusion is
                    also made to a previous one, granted by David I., who died in the year 1153.
                    Perth enjoys the dignity of having been the ancient metropolis of Scotland.
                    James II. was the first Scottish monarch crowned in Edinburgh, an event which
                    happened in the year 1447; and soon afterwards the parliament and courts of
                    justice were removed thither; but it was not until 1482, in the reign of James
                    III., that Edinburgh was declared to be the capital of Scotland, and the
                    Scottish court finally removed from the city of St John.</p>
                <p>Perth appears to have been early fortified. From its importance as the seat of
                    government, its central situation, and its vicinity to the Highlands, some
                    defence was absolutely necessary. In these rude ages it was surrounded by the
                    feudal castles of several powerful barons, with some of whom the inhabitants
                    appear to have been frequently at feud, whilst with others, as Chartres of
                    Kinfauns, the Earl of Gowrie, the Earl of Atholl, Lord Scone, and Threipland of
                    Fingask, they were on such friendly terms as to have had one of their number for
                    chief magistrate. Amusing evidence is to be found in the records of the burgh,
                    of these alternate feuds and fraternizations. The worthy burgesses seem to have
                    been men of mettle in those days, and on various occasions sallying forth from
                    behind their walls, set fire to the castles of their haughty neighbours, when
                    the latter, probably in reprisal for some offence, had forbidden their vassals
                    to carry provisions to the city. In the year 1311, Robert Bruce laid siege to
                    the town, but was obliged to withdraw his troops, after various unsuccessful
                    attempts to take it. Not discouraged, however, the Scottish hero, having
                    selected a band of determined men, and chosen a dark night, led them on in
                    person, scaled the walls, and carried the town, sword in hand, the king himself
                    being the second man who entered the place. About the beginning of the
                    fourteenth century, the famous combat between the Clan Chattan and the Clan
                    Quhele or Clan Kay, took place on the North Inch, and was decided in favour of
                    the former, partly by the bravery of a citizen or burgess called Harry Wynd,
                    whom the chief of the Clan Chattan had engaged on the spot to supply the place
                    of one of his men who had failed to appear. The particulars of this singular
                    conflict have been described by Sir Walter Scott in the first series of his
                    Tales of a Grandfather; and in his romance of the Fair Maid of Perth, he has,
                    with equal skill and effect, availed himself of the traditional story, which he
                    has embellished with the felicity peculiar to his rich and inventive genius.
                    This city has also been the scene of several of those social tragedies, in which
                    the history of Scotland, in those rude times, was so prolific. In the year 1336,
                    King Edward III. of England stabbed his brother the Duke of Cornwall, before the
                    high altar of the church of St John; and in 1437, James I. was murdered in the
                    monastery of the Blackfriars, with circumstances of the most savage barbarity.
                    The murderers were executed in Perth, and the details of their punishment are of
                    the most revolting character, reflecting but little honour on the good feeling
                    and humanity of our forefathers. Perth appears to have been several times
                    visited by the plague, particularly in 1512, 1585, 1608, and 1645. Its ravages
                    during the last of these visitations were severe, three thousand persons having
                    become its victims. In 1617, James VI. honoured the ancient capital of Scotland
                    with a visit, the details of which, as found in the burgh records, are not a
                    little graphic and entertaining. And in 1623, one of those exhibitions, of which
                    James was so fond, and which leave a stain upon the national annals, took place
                    in Perth; we mean, the burning of three poor women for witchcraft. In 1633,
                    Charles I., in his tour through Scotland, visited Perth; and in 1651, Oliver
                    Cromwell took military possession of the city, and erected a citadel on the
                    South Inch. In 1559 John Knox appeared in Perth, and the excitement produced by
                    his preaching, with the imprudent conduct of the Catholic clergy, caused the
                    destruction of the finest ecclesiastical buildings in the city. Previously to
                    the Reformation, Perth was crowded with religious houses, the cowled inmates of
                    which swarmed in the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193494831"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-4831-0288"/>city like bees. Many of these houses were
                    buildings distinguished for elegance and taste, and the destruction of them is
                    therefore much to be regretted. But the fury of the inhabitants was, in a great
                    measure, confined to the edifices, which they were taught by their new
                    instructors to regard as the abodes of iniquity; and hence, whilst they pulled
                    down “the nests that the rooks might be scattered,” they offered little personal
                    insult to any one, and not a single Roman Catholic was put to death. The men of
                    Perth, however, were zealously devoted to the cause of the Reformation. Three
                    hundred of their number, bedecked with “St Johnston ribands,” set out from the
                    city, determined to prosecute the work of reformation, or to perish in the
                    attempt. Before they reached Stirling, their numbers had increased to five
                    thousand; and by the appearance of this faithful band, the struggle between the
                    queen and the reformers was speedily brought to an end without the effusion of
                    blood. The year 1600 was rendered memorable by the occurrence of the famous
                    Gowrie conspiracy, as it is called; one of those events on which ingenuity and
                    research have exhausted themselves in vain, and which, in its origin and
                    circumstances, still remains enveloped in impenetrable mystery.</p>
                <p>The present level of the city has been ascertained to be higher than it was at
                    one period, and the level of the river appears also to have risen along with it,
                    to the great injury of the navigation; vessels of considerable burden formerly
                    discharging their cargoes farther up than they can do at present. The burgh of
                    Perth is invested with an ample jurisdiction over the river, but does not appear
                    to have paid much attention to the improvement of the navigation·. Of late
                    years, however, the subject has excited considerable interest; and, in 1834, the
                    town-council obtained an act for deepening the river, and constructing a tide
                    harbour and wet-dock. A powerful steam dredging-vessel has for some time been in
                    operation on the river, and such have been its effects, that vessels of 200
                    tons, it is expected, w ill be soon able to discharge their cargoes at Perth.
                    The city has also lately obtained the privilege of bonded warehouses, which will
                    materially assist its foreign trade. The exports of the city, however, are
                    comparatively but trifling; the accessible and thriving port of Dundee absorbing
                    a great part of the foreign as well as coasting trade, which Perth formerly
                    possessed. Potatoes constitute a considerable article of export to the London
                    market, and the external commerce of the city may now be expected to improve, as
                    the facilities of its river navigation increase. The imports are chiefly from
                    the Baltic, and consist of flax, hemp, timber, seeds, cheese, and foreign
                    spirits; coals, lime, salt, and manure, form the general coasting freights. In
                    1836, 736 vessels entered the' harbour of Perth, the tonnage of which amounted
                    to 40,000 tons. The capital vested in shipping is, however, but trifling.
                    Between five and six thousand tons, in about eighty vessels of every
                    description, comprise the shipping of the port of Perth. The salmon caught in
                    the river form an item of some importance in its commerce, and are exported to
                    London. The revenue of the burgh from its fisheries alone amounts to L.830 per
                    annum.</p>
                <p>A considerable quantity of cotton goods is manufactured in Perth, chiefly for
                    Glasgow houses. The principal articles are ginghams, pullicates,
                    umbrella-cloths, harness-muslins, and linen-lawns, employing about 1600 weavers.
                    Calico printing and bleaching are carried on in the neighbourhood, to a very
                    considerable extent. A large mill has lately been erected for spinning flax; and
                    an establishment of this description has long been known as one of the best
                    managed and most extensive in Scotland. There are, besides, three large
                    founderies in operation, in which the manufacture of machinery and iron goods is
                    considerable. But Perth ap pears to have rather retrograded as a seat of trade
                    and commerce, as the early records of the burgh show that it formerly carried on
                    an extensive traffic with the Baltic, the</p>
                <p>Mediterranean, and the Netherlands; the decay of which arose most probably from
                    the increasing obstructions to the navigation of the river, by the gradual
                    elevation of its bed from the accumulation of alluvial deposit, and from other
                    incidental causes. The tanning of leather and the manufacture of gloves were at
                    one time extensively carried on in Perth, but these trades havé now greatly
                    fallen off. About forty years ago, the printing of books was also a trade of
                    some importance, but it is now of little consequence. Of late years
                    ship-building has also been carried on to some extent. From the eligibility of
                    its situation, the cheapness of living, and the low price of education of the
                    best des Motion, many respectable families in easy circumstances mSe Perth their
                    residence.</p>
                <p>The government of the city is vested in a lord provost, who is also sheriff and
                    coroner, four bailies, a treasurer, the dean of guild, who is <hi rend="italic"
                    >ex officio</hi> a member of the council, and nineteen councillors. There are
                    two city clerks, a procurator fiscal, and a chamberlain. The city sends a member
                    to parliament; and, in 1837, the constituency amounted to 1073. The burgh has a
                    very large property and revenue, the former derived chiefly from the favour and
                    munificence of several of the Scottish sovereigns. The property is estimated at
                    L.67,510. Ils. 10d. and the revenue for 1836-1837 was L.6334. 8s. The debt of
                    the city amounts to L.33,723, and the expenditure to L.5926. 1 ls. 7d. After
                    Edinburgh was constituted the capital of the kingdom, Perth stood second on the
                    roll of burghs of the Scottish parliament, and is still entitled to hold that
                    rank. Its chief magistrate has for centuries enjoyed the title of lord provost;
                    and by a judgment of the Court of Session (12th March 1836), he is still
                    entitled to that distinction. The Circuit Court of Justiciary is held here twice
                    a year, when the criminal offences committed in the counties of Perth, Fife, and
                    Forfar are tried. At the spring court of 1838 the cases brought to trial were
                    upwards of fifty in number, and although few of them were of great turpitude,
                    the court were occupied during five days in disposing of them.</p>
                <p>In the year 1831 the population of Perth amounted to 20,016 persons, but by a
                    census recently taken, it is at present only 19,601, being 415 less than it was
                    in 1831. The causes of this decrease are not easily ascertainable. Of the
                    population, 11,683 have been stated as connected with the established church,
                    and the rest arc dissenters. In 1831 there were 2049 inhabited houses,
                    containing 4956 families. Of public buildings, the principal are the bridge over
                    th Tay, the barracks, the dépôt built for the reception of Frepcι prisoners
                    during the war, St Paul’s Church, the building erected to the memory of Provost
                    Marshall, which contains a public library and the museum of the Literary and
                    Antiquarian Society, the Perth Academy, the water-wOrks, and the county
                    buildings, a large and tasteful structure, situated close to the bank of the
                    river. The lunatic asylum, an elegant building, is situated on the hill of
                    Kinnoull; and an infirmary is almost finished. Besides these public buildings,
                    several handsome streets have of late years been erected, which, combined with
                    the natural beauty of the situation, render Perth one of the most desirable
                    places of residence in this country. The town is well supplied with water,
                    filtered from the river by a very ingenious method; and it is also well lighted
                    with gas, by a company established for the purpose. The assessment for water
                    cannot exceed five per cent, on the rental. The revenue of the post-office is
                    about L.4000.</p>
                <p>The Perth Academy, instituted in the year 1760, enjoys a high reputation as a
                    seminary of classical and scientific learning. There are thirty-five schools in
                    Perth, including the Academy. In the year 1834 the town-council applied to
                    government for a grant, which, assisted by private subscriptions, has provided
                    accommodation for 400 additional scholars. In 1697 a proposal was made to remove
                    the Univer <pb break="no" facs="nls:193494844" xml:id="kp-eb0717-4844-0289"
                    />sity of St Andrews to Perth. The inhabitants have established several
                    religious and charitable societies; and also a literary and antiquarian society
                    of some note, which has a museum and library attached to it. A savings-bank was
                    likewise established in 1815, the accumulated deposits of which, from that time
                    till 1836, amounted to L.3188. 13s. 10d∙, whilst the sum lodged during 1836
                    exceeded L.381. In 1836 the assessment for the poor was L.2128. 13s. 3d. which
                    was raised by a five per cent, tax upon rental, and L.723. 5s. 2∣d. were
                    collected at the church doors; besides which, the incorporated trades expend
                    annually above L.2000 for the relief of their poor members. The poor’s-funds
                    obtained from the hospital of King James average yearly about L.435; and there
                    are two other mortifications for their behoof, wduch realise annually
                    L.312.10s.; so that, not to mention various charitable societies, the interests
                    of the poor are apparently well attended to in this ancient city.</p>
