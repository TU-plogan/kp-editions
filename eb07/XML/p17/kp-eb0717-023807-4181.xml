                <p><label type="entry">PERRAULT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Claude</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated architect, was born at Paris in the year 1613. His father, an
                    advocate of the parliament, caused him to study medicine, anatomy, and the
                    mathematics; and he even took the degree of doctor of physic in the faculty of
                    Paris. But Colbert, the celebrated French minister, having advised him to
                    undertake a translation of Vitruvius, the studies in which he found it necessary
                    to engage in order to understand that writer inspired him with a decided taste
                    for architecture, and gave a new direction to his pursuits. When the Academy of
                    Sciences was established, in 1666, Perrault was admitted a member of this body,
                    and was employed to furnish designs and building-plans for the Observatory. But
                    this edifice, which, with all its merits, is in a heavy style, was far from
                    giving any indication of the talents which Perrault afterwards displayed. His
                    grand work is the palace of the Louvre, the façade of which was designed by him,
                    and is certainly one of the noblest monuments of architecture in the world. The
                    building had been commenced, and even part of the façade raised according to the
                    designs of Lavau. But Colbert, dissatisfied with these, which he justly
                    considered as deficient in grandeur, and unsuitable to the nature of the
                    subject, appealed to the genius of other architects; and Perrault produced a
                    design so superior to those of his competitors, that it immediately obtained a
                    decided preference. Nevertheless, before commencing the work, the king wished to
                    have the ideas of the best artists of Italy; and with this view, Bernini, who
                    then enjoyed a great reputation, both as a sculptor and an architect, was sent
                    for from Rome, and received in France with the greatest distinction. But the
                    pre-eminent merit of Perrault was, notwithstanding, fully recognised; his plans
                    were adopted by the court, although objections had been strenuously urged as to
                    the practicability of their execution; and a model constructed by the artist
                    himself at length removed every doubt on the subject, by proving that the
                    difficulties raised were altogether imaginary, and that the solidity of the
                    fabric might be rendered commensurate with the beauty of the design. Such were
                    the preliminaries of the erection of this monument, which may justly be regarded
                    as the masterpiece of French architecture, and the finest edifice that exists in
                    Paris. Perrault furnished designs for other works, particularly the triumphal
                    arch erected at the extremity of the Rue Saint-Antoine, the foundation-stone of
                    which was laid on the 6th of August 1670; and, in all his works, he displayed
                    that superiority of genius, which was first exhibited in his translation of
                    Vitruvius, particularly in the plates with which it was enriched, and which have
                    ever been considered as masterpieces of their kind. The first edition of this
                    work appeared in 1673, and the second in 1684, in one volume folio; after which
                    the translator published an abridgement in one volume 12mo. To the same author
                    we are likewise indebted for another work, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ordonnances</hi><hi rend="italic">des Cinq</hi><hi rend="italic">Espèces de

                    translation of Vitruvius, and containing explanations of several points which
                    had not been touched upon in the notes to that work. Of his other productions
                    the principal are, 1. Essais de Physique, 1680—1688, in two vols. 4to, and four
                    vols. 12mo; 2. Mémoires pour servir à ΓHistoire <pb break="no"

                    Claude Perrault assisted his brother Charles in preparing the memoirs relating
                    to the establishment of the Academy of Sciences, and that of Painting and
                    Sculpture, and took a warm interest in the success of that institution. He died
                    at Paris, on the 9th of October 1688, in consequence, it is believed, of having
                    wounded himself whilst dissecting, in the Jardin du Roi, a camel which had died
                    of some contagious disease; and the faculty of medicine caused his portrait to
                    be placed <hi rend="subscript"> -</hi> amongst those of their most distinguished
                    members. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Perrault,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Charles,</hi> the brother of Claude, was born at Paris on the 12th
                    of January 1628, and at the age of eight was placed in the college of Beauvais,
                    where he'distinguished himself in scholastic disputation, and in making verses
                    with extreme facility, “indice trompeur d’un talent qui ne mûrit presque
                    jamais.” On leaving school, he found that burlesque was in vogue; and a friend
                    having suggested to him the idea of translating the sixth book of the Aeneid in
                    the manner of Scarron, he executed the travesty in a manner which attracted the
                    commendation both of Voltaire and of Marmontel. But when his ideas were matured
                    by reflection, he ceased to attach any value to such effusions; and, having
                    completed his studies, he was admitted as advocate, in which capacity he pleaded
                    two causes with success. Colbert, however, soon deprived the law of his
                    services, and, in the year 1664, appointed him first commissary for the
                    superintendence of royal buildings, an office the duties of which he discharged
                    with equal zeal and ability, nobly justifying the confidence of the minister,
                    and regarding himself as the representative of men of letters and of artists at
                    the court. The Academy of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture, and that of
                    Sciences∕were founded on memoirs drawn up by Charles Perrault, who had now
                    become comptroller-general of buildings; and he was admitted into the French
                    Academy in 1671, in the room of the bishop of Léon. But the impracticable
                    character of Colbert having at length wearied out his patience, he retired from
                    his public situation, and, devoting himself to literature, produced his poem
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Siècle</hi><hi rend="italic">de Louis XIV.,</hi>
                    which appeared in 1687, and involved him in a war with the learned, by reason of
                    his exalting the modern in comparison with the ancient authors. He defended
                    himself, however, in the <hi rend="italic">Parallèle des Anciens et
                    Modernes,</hi> which appeared at Paris in 1688, afterwards attracted the notice
                    of Bayle, and excited very considerable attention. One of his principal
                    antagonists was Boileau, who attacked him with great asperity, and, as usual,
                    had all the scoffers on his side; but at length they were, in some measure,
                    reconciled, although, on the part of Boileau, the <hi rend="italic">amende</hi>
                    was made in a tone which savoured more of contempt than of conciliation. His
                    poem on Painting was, however, generally admired; but his Tales in verse,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Grisélidès,</hi><hi rend="italic">Peau</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d’Ane,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Souhaits</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ridicules,</hi> are prolix and heavy. Perrault died at Paris on the 16th of May
                    1703. Besides the works already indicated, he wrote, 1. Recueil des divers
                    Ouvrages en prose et en vers, Paris, 1675, in 4to; 2. Courses de Têtes et de
                    Bagues, faites par le Roi et par les Princes et les Seigneurs de sa Cour, en
                    1662, Paris,· 1669, in folio; 3. Cabinet des Beaux-Arts, <hi rend="italic"

                    of his Life, for the use of his children; 6. <hi rend="italic">E</hi><hi

                    comedies, which, in 1822, passed into the rich and valuable collection of Μ. de
                    Soleinne. D’Alembert included the éloge ofCharles Perrault amongst those of the
                    members of the French Academy (tom. ii. p. 165.) <hi rend="smallcaps"
