                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    was governor of Judaea when our Lord was crucified. Of his family or country we
                    know little, though it is believed that he was a native of Rome, or at least of
                    Italy. He was sent to govern Judaea in the room of Gratus, in the year 26 or 27
                    of the common era, and he governed this province for ten years, that is, from
                    the twelfth or thirteenth to the twenty-second or twenty-third year of Tiberius.
                    He is represented, both by Philo and by Josephus, as a man of an impetuous and
                    obstinate temper, and, as a judge, accustomed to sèll justice, and to pronounce
                    any sentence that was desired, provided he' was paid for it. The same authors
                    mention his rapines, his injuries, his murders, the torments he inflicted upon
                    the innocent, and the persons he put to death without any form of process.
                    Philo, in particular, describes him as a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500733"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-0733-0742"/>man who exercised excessive cruelty during the
                    whole time of his government, disturbed the repose of Judaea, and gave occasion
                    to the troubles and revolt which followed. St Luke (xiii. I, 2, et seq.)
                    acquaints us that Pilate had mingled the blood of the Galileans with their
                    sacrifices, and that the matter having been related to our Lord, he said,
                    “Suppose ye that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans, because
                    they suffered such things? I tell you, nay; but except ye repent, ye shall all
                    likewise perish.” It is not known upon what particular occasion Pilate caused
                    these Galileans to be slain in the temple whilst they were sacrificing; for this
                    is the meaning of die expression about mingling their blood with their
                    sacrifices. Some think they were disciples of Judas the Gaulonite, who taught
                    that the Jews ought not to pay tribute to foreign princes, and that Pilate had
                    put some of them to death even in the temple; but there is no proof of this
                    fact. Others are of opinion that these Galileans were Samaritans, whom Pilate
                    cut to pieces in the village of Tira-taba,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Josephus, Antip Jud. lib. xviii. c. 5.</p></note> as they
                    were preparing to go up to Mount Gerizim, where a certain impostor had promised
                    to discover to them treasures; but this event did not happen before the year 35
                    of the common era, and consequently two years after the death of Jesus Christ.
                    At the time of our Saviour’s passion, Pilate made some faint endeavours to
                    rescue him out of the hands of the vindictive Jews. He knew that they had
                    delivered him up, and pursued his life with so much violence, solely out of
                    malice and envy (Matt, xxvii. 18). His wife, also, who had been disturbed the
                    night before with frightful dreams, sent to tell him that she desired him not to
                    meddle in the affair of that just person <hi rend="italic">(ibid.</hi> 19). He
                    attempted to appease the wrath of the Jews, and to give them some satisfaction,
                    by scourging our Lord (John, xix. 1; Matt, xxvii. 26). He also tried to take him
                    out of their hands by proposing to deliver him or Barabbas, on the day of the
                    festival of the passover. Lastly, he had a mind to discharge himself from
                    pronouncing judgment against him by sending him to Herod king <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> Galilee (Luke, xxiii. 7, 8). But when he saw that all this would not
                    satisfy the Jews, and that they even in a manner threatened him, saying he could
                    be no friend to the emperor if he let him go (John, xix. 12, 15), he caused
                    water to be brought, and having washed his hands before all the people, publicly
                    declared himself innocent of the blood of Jesus, in whom he found no fault
                    (Matt, xxvii. 23, 24); though at the same time this miserable juggler with
                    conscience delivered him up to his soldiers that they might crucify him. His
                    conduct, however, was sufficient to justify Jesus Christ, as Calmet observes,
                    and to show that the governor held him to be innocent; but it was not enough to
                    vindicate the conscience and integrity of a judge, whose duty it was to assert
                    the cause of oppressed innocence, as well as to punish the guilty and criminal.
                    He ordered to be inscribed on our Saviour’s cross an abstract as it were of his
                    sentence, and the motive of his condemnation, “Jesus of Nazareth, king of the
                    Jews,” which was written in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. Some of the Jews found
                    fault with it, and remonstrated with Pilate, alleging that he ought to have
                    written “Jesus of Nazareth, who pretended to be king of the Jews.” But Pilate
                    could not be prevailed on to alter it, and gave them this peremptory answer,
                    that what he had written he had written.</p>
                <p>Towards evening, he was applied to for leave to take down the bodies from the
                    cross, that they might not continue there the following day, which was the
                    passover and the sabbath-day (John, xix. 31). This he allowed, and granted the
                    body of Jesus to Joseph of Arimathea, that he might pay to it his last duties
                    <hi rend="italic">(ibid.</hi> 33). Lastly, when the priests, who had solicited
                    the death of our Saviour, came to desire him to set a watch upon the sepulchre,
                    lest his disciples should steal him away by night, he answered them, that they
                    had a guard, and might place it there themselves (Matt, xxvii. 65). This is the
                    substance of what the gospel tells us concerning Pontius Pilate.</p>
                <p>Justin Martyr, Tertullian, Eusebius, and several other succeeding writers, both
                    ancient and modern, assure us that it was formerly the custom for Roman
                    magistrates to prepare copies of all verbal processes and judicial acts which
                    took place in their several provinces, and to send these to the emperor. Pilate,
                    therefore, in compliance with this custom, having sent intelligence to Tiberius
                    of what had passed relating to Jesus Christ, the emperor wrote an account of it
                    to the senate, in a manner which gave reason to infer that he thought favourably
                    of the religion of Jesus Christ, and showed that he had no §erious objection to
                    their decreeing him divine honours. But the senate was not of the same opinion,
                    and so the matter dropped. It appears, from what Justin says of these acts, that
                    the miracles of Jesus Christ were mentioned there, including even the
                    circumstance of the soldiers having divided his garments amongst them. Eusebius
                    insinuates that they spoke of his resurrection and ascension. Ter-tuilian and
                    Justin refer to these acts with so much confidence, that we cannot suppose them
                    to have written without authority. However, neither Eusebius nor St Jerome, who
                    were both inquisitive and intelligent persons, nor any other author who wrote
                    afterwards, seems to have seen these acts, at least not the true and original
                    acts; for as to those which we have now in great number, they are not authentic,
                    being neither ancient nor uniform. There are also some pretended letters of
                    Pilate to Tiberius, giving a history of our Saviour; but they are universally
                    allowed to be spurious.</p>
                <p>Pilate being a man who, by his excessive cruelties and rapine, had disturbed the
                    peace of Judaea during the whole time of his government, was at length deposed
                    by Vitellius, -the proconsul of Syria, in the 36th year of Jesus Christ, and
                    sent to Rome to give an account-of his conduct to the emperor. But though
                    Tiberius died before Pilate arrived at Rome, yet his successor Caligula banished
                    him to Vienne in Gaul, where he was reduced to such extremity that he put
                    himself to death with his own hands. The Evangelists call him governor, although
                    in reality he was only procurator of Judaea.</p>
                <p>With regard to Pilate’s wife, the general tradition is, that she was named
                    Claudia Procula or Proscula; and in relation to her dream, some are of opinion,
                    that as she had intelligence of our Lord’s apprehension, and knew by his
                    character that he was a righteous person, her imagination, being struck with
                    these ideas, had naturally produced the dream we read of; but others think that
                    this dream was sent to her providentially, for the clearer manifestation of our
                    Lord’s innocence.</p>
