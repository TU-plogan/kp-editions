                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">PIEDMONT, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Piemont</hi></label>, a
                    principality and principal province of the continental states of the Sardinian
                    monarchy, forming the north-western portion of Italy. It was separated from
                    Sardinia by the French in the year 1798, and in 1802 incorporated with France.
                    On the fall of Napoleon in 1814 it was restored to the king of Sardinia, and the
                    duchies of Milan and Montferrat have been annexed to it. It is now divided into
                    twenty-six districts. Piedmont, in a narrower sense, borders on the Valais and
                    Savoy to the north, on France to the west, on Nice and Genoa to the south, and
                    on the Sardinian Milanese and Montferrat to the east. These limits comprise an
                    area of 6575 square miles, and contain a population of 1,400,000 souls. If we
                    include the Sardinian Milanese and Montferrat, its superficial extent is above
                    12,000 square miles, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500720"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-0720-0741"/>and the inhabitants amount to 2,322,000. It forms
                    a continuation of the plain of Lombardy, somewhat narrowed, and-more closely
                    bounded by the mightiest ranges of the Alps and Apennines; the former on the
                    north and west, the latter on the south. The principal river is the Po, which
                    runs through its centre, dividing it into two nearly equal parts; and it
                    receives here, nearly all its early tributaries, which, from being in the
                    vicinity of their mountain sources, are liable to sudden and destructive
                    inundations. The climate, of course, varies according .to the elevation of the
                    surface. In the mountainous regions in the north and west the snow and ice
                    remain during a great portion of the year. In the plains the climate is
                    temperate during winter, and the excessive heats of summer are tempered by the
                    vicinity of the Alps. The soil generally· is very fertile, the plains traversed
                    by the Po being particularly prolific, and in a high state of cultivation. They
                    yield in abundance corn, wine, oil, fruits, rice, and hemp. But the staple
                    product is silk, the breeding of&lt;the silk-worm being nowhere in Italy carried
                    to the same extent; and the produce is also reckoned the finest in quality. It
                    produces yearly 22,000,000 <hi rend="italic">lire</hi> worth of silk, most of
                    which is exported in the raw state. Another important branch of industry is the
                    breeding of cattle, the pastures being both extensive and rich. The hills are in
                    general covered with vineyards, the produce of which is very abundant, but
                    generally of inferior quality. Olives, almonds, chestnuts, and in smaller
                    quantities figs, oranges, and lemons, are raised here. The northern, western,
                    and southern districts supply the central region with wood. The Piedmontese are
                    industrious and frugal, and are all Catholics, with the exception of about
                    20,000 Waldenses and a few Jews. They have Some silk, linen, and woollen
                    manufactures, and thousands of them are seen travelling about Italy, France, and
                    Germany as pedlars. The capital of Piedmont is Turin. This province derives its
                    name from its situation at the foot of the mountains.</p>
