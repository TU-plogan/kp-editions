                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">PHILOSTRATUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Flavius</hi></label>, was
                    an ancient Greek author. Eusebius calls him an Athenian, because he taught at
                    Athens; but Eunapius and Suidas always speak of him as a Lemnian; and he himself
                    hints, in his Life of Apollonius, that when he was young he used to reside at
                    Lemnos. He frequented the schools of the sophists; and he mentions his having
                    heard Damianus of Ephesus, Proclus Naucrati-tas, and Hippodromus of Larissa.
                    This seems to prove that he lived in the reign of the Emperor Severus, from 193
                    to 212, when those sophists flourished. He afterwards became known to Julia
                    Augusta, the wife of Severus, and was one of those learned men whom this
                    philosophical empress had continually about her. It was by her command that he
                    wrote his celebrated Life of Apollonius Tyanensis, as he relates himself in the
                    same place where hé informs us of his connections with that learned lady.
                    Philostratus, as Cyril observes, endeavours to represent Apollonius as a
                    wonderful and extraordinary person, rather to be admired and adored as a god,
                    than to be honoured or considered as a mere man. Hence Eunapius, in the preface
                    to his Lives of the Sophists, says that the proper title of that work should
                    have been, The Coming of a God to Men; and Hierocles, in his book against the
                    Christians, called Philalethes, and which was refiited by Eusebius in a work
                    still extant, amongst other things instituted a comparison between Apollonius
                    and Jesus Christ. It has always been supposed that Philostratus composed his
                    work with a view to discredit the miracles and doctrines of our Lord, by setting
                    up other miracles and other doctrines against them; and this supposition may be
                    true: but that Apollonius was really an impostor and magician may not be so
                    certain. He may, for ought we know, have been a wise and excellent person; and
                    it is remarkable that Eusebius, though he had the worst opinion of the history
                    of Philostratus, says nothing unfavourable of Apollonius. He concluded that that
                    history was written to oppose the history of Jesus; and the use which the
                    ancient infidels made of it justifies his opinion: but he draws no information
                    from it with regard to Apollonius. It would have been improper to do so, since
                    the sophistical and affected style of Philostratus, the sources whence he owns
                    that his materials were drawn, and, above all, the absurdities and
                    contradictions with which he abounds, plainly show that his history was nothing
                    but a collection of fables, either invented, or at least embellished, by
                    himself.</p>
                <p>The works of Philostratus, however, have engaged the attention of some critics of
                    the first class. Graevius intended to have given a correct edition of them, as
                    appears from the preface of Merle Casaubon to a dissertation upon an intended
                    edition of Homer, printed at London in 1658, 8vo. So also had Bentley, who
                    designed to add a new Latin version of his notes; and Fabricius says that he saw
                    the first sheet of Bentley’s edition printed at Leipzig in 1691. Both these
                    designs, however, were dropped. But a very exact and beautiful edition was at
                    length published at Leipzig, 1709, in folio, by Olearius, professor of the Greek
                    and Latin languages in that university; a man who has proved himself perfectly
                    qualified for the work he undertook, and shown all the judgment, learning, and
                    industry, which are required in an excellent editor.</p>
                <p>At the end of the Life of Apollonius, there are ninety-five letters which go
                    under his name. They are not, however, believed to be his, the style of them
                    being very affected, and like that of a sophist, whilst they bear in other
                    respects all the marks of a forgery. Philostratus says that he saw a collection
                    of the Letters of Apollonius in Hadrian’s library at Antium, but had not
                    inserted them all amongst <pb break="no" facs="nls:193496898"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-6898-0447"/>these. They are short, and have in them little
                    else than moral sentences. The Lives of the Sophists contain many things which
                    are to be met with nowhere else. The Heroics of Philostratus are only a dialogue
                    between a vintner of the Thracian Chersonesus and a Phoenician, in which the
                    former draws characters of Homer’s heroes, and represents several things
                    differently from that poet; and this is done upon the faith of Protesilaus’s
                    ghost, who had lately visited his farm, not far from the tomb of this hero.
                    Olearius conjectures, with much probability, that Philostratus’s design in this
                    dialogue was secretly to criticise some things in Homer, which he durst not do
                    openly, on account of the great veneration then paid to him, and for fear of the
                    odium which Zoilus and others had incurred by censuring him too freely. The
                    images are elegant descriptions and illustrations of some ancient paintings and
                    other particulars relating to the fine arts, to which Olearius has subjoined the
                    description of some statues by Callistratus, for the same reason that he
                    subjoined Eusebius’s book against Hierocles to the Life and Letters of
                    Apollonius, namely, because the subjects of these respective works are related
                    to each other. The last piece is a collection of Philostratus’s Letters; but
                    some of these, though it is not easy to determine which, were written by a
                    nephew of Philostratus, of the same name, as were also the last eighteen in the
                    book of images. This is the reason why the title runs not <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philostrati,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">Phi-lostταtorum quae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">supersunt</hi><hi rend="italic">omnia.</hi> There were many
                    persons of the name of Philostratus amongst the ancients; and there were many
                    other works of the Philostratus here recorded, but no others are extant except
                    those we have mentioned.</p>
