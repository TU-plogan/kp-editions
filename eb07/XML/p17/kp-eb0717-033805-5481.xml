                <p><label type="entry">PHALARIS</label>, the tyrant of Agrigentum, of whom only a
                    few facts have been transmitted to us, upon which any dependence can be placed.
                    Ancient writers are not agreed as to the precise period when he began to reign,
                    but Eusebius fixes the commencement of it <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 570,
                    and his death <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 555. His father’s name was
                    Leodamas, a native of Astypalaea, an island in the Aegean Sea, where Phalaris
                    was born. A dream of his mother is said to have prognosticated the cruelty of
                    her unborn son. (Cic. <hi rend="italic">Div.</hi> i. 23.) When he was grown to
                    manhood, he made an at tempt to seize upon the government of his native country,
                    but was obliged to fly. Hp took refuge at Agrigentum, where he contrived to
                    ingratiate himself with the people, and by a stratagem (Polyaen. v. 1) got
                    possession of the supreme authority, which he exercised at first with much
                    moderation. The Agrigentines, however, refused to submit quietly to his sway,
                    and Phalaris found himself obliged to maintain by severity that power which he
                    had so unjustly acquired. It is not unlikely that the ancients gave an
                    exaggerated account of his cruelties, with the view of inspiring a hatred of
                    tyranny. Athenaeus speaks of his roasting children alive, and Aristotle states
                    that he actually ate them; but such accounts can scarcely he credited. Perillus,
                    an Athenian artist, is said to have constructed a brazen bull, in which the
                    victims of Phalaris might be roasted; and when he expected to have been highly
                    rewarded, the tyrant ordered him to be shut up in his own horrible machine. This
                    story was doubted by Timaeus <hi rend="italic">{Schol. Find. Pyth.</hi> i. 185),
                    but Diodorus Siculus asserts its truth (xiii. 90, xix. 108). When Agrigentum was
                    taken by the Carthaginians, they carried the bull to Carthage, and when that
                    city was destroyed by Scipio Africanus, B. c. 146, it was presented by him to
                    the Agrigentines. (Cic. <hi rend="italic">Verr.</hi> iv. 33.) Authors are not
                    agreed as to the mode of his death, but the most probable opinion is that the
                    Agrigentines, tired of his cruelties, stoned him to death. <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Off.</hi> ii∙ 7.) We possess a collection of letters under the name of
                    Phalaris, which Boyle, who has edited them, tries to prove the genuine
                    productions of the tyrant; but there can be no doubt that they were written by
                    some of the later sophists. They were published for the first time by
                    Justinopolitanus, at Venice, 1498, in 4to. The best editions are those of
                    Oxford, 1695, 1718, in 8vo, with a Latin translation, notes, and a dissertation
                    of Boyle ou the life of Phalaris; and that of Groningen, 1777, in 4to, which was
                    begun by Lennep and finished by Walkenaer. (See the Dissertation of Dodwell, <hi
                    rend="italic">JDe Aeiate</hi><hi rend="italic">Phalaridis;</hi> and the Answer
                    of Bentley.)</p>
